# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Dwarakadas
**Date:** 2026-02-25

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Personal strategies and workflows for organizing YouTube lecture content from various speakers/playlists
**Goals:** Build an efficient personal system for lecture preparation using YouTube content

### Session Setup

_Dwarakadas is looking for personal consumption strategies and workflows — not software features — to organize lecture content from multiple YouTube speakers and playlists, with the aim of improving lecture preparation._

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Personal YouTube lecture content organization with focus on efficient lecture preparation workflows

**Recommended Techniques:**

- **Mind Mapping (Structured):** Foundation setting — map all dimensions of the content organization challenge before jumping to solutions
- **Analogical Thinking (Creative):** Idea generation — borrow proven organizational strategies from other domains to spark non-obvious workflow ideas
- **SCAMPER Method (Structured):** Refinement — systematically stress-test and refine the best ideas into actionable, polished workflows

**AI Rationale:** The session requires a balance of structured thinking (to build a usable system) and creative exploration (to discover non-obvious strategies). This sequence moves from understanding the full landscape, through creative cross-domain inspiration, to systematic refinement of actionable workflows.

## Technique Execution Results

### Mind Mapping (Completed)

**Mind Map Structure:**

```
                        ┌─ Bhagavad-gita (verses + purports)
         ┌─ Sources ────┼─ Srimad Bhagavatam (verses + purports)
         │              └─ 10 YouTube speakers (angle matters, not who)
         │
         │              ┌─ Keyword match (narrow)
         ├─ Themes ─────┤
         │              └─ Broader thematic connections (mental, no system)
         │
         │              ┌─ Circle 1: Full-time missionaries (deep)
         ├─ Audiences ──┼─ Circle 2: Congregation & volunteers (solid)
         │              ├─ Circle 3: Newcomers (accessible)
LECTURE   │              └─ Circle 4: No prior exposure (universal)
 PREP ────┤
         │              ┌─ Stories & examples
         ├─ Content ────┼─ Philosophical explanations
         │  Types       ├─ Analogies
         │              └─ Practical instructions
         │
         │              ┌─ Discovery (scouting — PAINFUL)
         ├─ Problems ───┼─ Extraction (harvesting — works OK)
         │              ├─ Retrieval (memory-only — fragile)
         │              └─ Hidden angle (can't preview treatment)
         │
         └─ Current ────┼─ No organized notes
           State        ├─ Memory-based retrieval
                        └─ Re-scouting previously heard content
```

**Key Insights from Mind Mapping:**
- Three interconnected problems: Discovery, Extraction, Retrieval
- Hidden angle problem: can't tell a speaker's treatment approach without listening
- Circle-matching is an audience segmentation challenge layered on content discovery
- Each content type (story, philosophy, analogy, practical) serves different circles differently
- Keyword search alone misses broader thematic connections — needs both narrow + broad
- Current system is entirely memory-based with no organized notes

### Analogical Thinking (In Progress — Paused)

**Analogies Explored:**

**Analogy 1 — DJ/Music Curator:** Tag segments with theme, content-type, circle-fit, energy. Search by tags not by title.

**Analogy 2 — Research Librarian:** Build controlled vocabulary linking core concepts to broader related themes (theme map).

**Analogy 3 — Chef's Flavor Bible:** Living reference of what pairs well with what — grows richer with every lecture prepared.

**Analogy 4 — Film Editor's Bin System:** Log content on first listen into tagged bins, pull from bins when preparing, star what lands well.

### Workflow Ideas Generated (6 so far)

**[Workflow #1]: DJ-Style Content Tagging System**
_Concept_: Tag every lecture segment with theme, content-type (story/analogy/philosophy/practical), circle-fit (1-4), and energy/mood. Search by tags instead of by speaker or title.
_Novelty_: Shifts from "which lecture was it?" to "show me everything tagged tolerance + story + Circle 3"

**[Workflow #2]: Personal Theme Map / Controlled Vocabulary**
_Concept_: Build a master list linking each core verse concept to broader related themes (e.g., tolerance → patience, endurance, equanimity, dualities, detachment). Expands search from 1 keyword to 5-10 threads.
_Novelty_: Eliminates mental effort of theme expansion — build once, grows over time.

**[Workflow #3]: Transcription-First Approach**
_Concept_: Bulk transcribe all 10 speakers' playlists. Search text instead of listening. Transforms 1-hour scouting into 30-second text search. Solves hidden angle problem — skim transcript to see treatment approach instantly.
_Novelty_: Completely eliminates painful scouting mode. You never listen until you've already found a match.

**[Workflow #4]: AI-Powered Auto-Tagging & Theme Mapping**
_Concept_: Feed transcripts to AI to automatically generate tags (theme, content-type, circle-fit) and build theme connections across all lectures. Near-zero manual effort after transcription.
_Novelty_: The entire scouting + tagging + theme-mapping workflow becomes automated.

**[Workflow #5]: Film Editor Bins**
_Concept_: On first listen/read, log content into labeled bins by theme, emotion, content type. Pull from bins when preparing lectures. Star what lands well for reuse.
_Novelty_: Every lecture consumed becomes a permanent investment, not a fading memory.

**[Workflow #6]: Lecture Flavor Bible**
_Concept_: A living personal reference showing what pairs well with what — which speakers cover which themes, which stories pair with which verses, which approaches land with which circles.
_Novelty_: Grows richer with every lecture prepared, becoming an irreplaceable personal resource.

### Key Design Decisions Made

- **Bulk transcription** upfront (not incremental)
- **Good-enough AI tagging** preferred over perfect manual tagging
- **No self-lecture transcription** — only the 10 speakers' content
- **Segment-level tagging** (timestamps), not whole-lecture tagging

### End-to-End Pipeline Vision (Emerged During Session)

```
YouTube Playlists (10 speakers)
      ↓
Bulk Transcription (automated)
      ↓
AI Auto-Tags Each Transcript:
  → Verse references, Themes (broad & specific)
  → Content type per segment (story/analogy/philosophy/practical)
  → Circle suitability (1-4), Key quotes & timestamps
  → Connections to other lectures on similar themes
      ↓
Searchable Personal Knowledge Base
      ↓
Pick a verse → Theme map expands keywords → Search transcripts
→ Get exact segments, tagged and ranked by circle fit
```

### Still To Explore (When Resuming)

- How the day-of lecture preparation workflow would look with this system
- Scaling: what happens at 500+ transcripts over a year
- Lecture templates per circle
- More cross-domain analogies
- **SCAMPER Method** (pending) — stress-test and refine workflows into actionable strategies
