#### Krishna's transcendental nature, material contamination, influence of material modes

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is not a human being. Krishna is the Supreme Unlimited Lord."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on Krishna's transcendental nature, emphasizing that He is not a human being and is not influenced by material contamination, unlike conditioned souls.

So Kunti is helping us understand what is the nature of Krishna's personality. Krishna is completely transcendental, which means that he has no enmity. He has no special liking for somebody. He is not partial. It appears sometimes like he is partial to his devotees. It appears like that. So that will be explained here in the purport by Srila Prabhupada. The Lord's mercy upon the fallen souls is equally distributed. He has no one as the specific object of hostility. Now this point is very important. The very conception of the personality of Godhead as a human being is misleading. Krishna is not a human being. Krishna is the Supreme Unlimited Lord, full of all good qualities. He is absolute. He is all good. Every living being is his part and parcel and therefore every living being is dear to him as the part and parcel living being. His pastimes in this material world especially appear to be exactly like a human being's activities, but actually they are transcendental. They are without any tinge of material contamination because Krishna does not come in contact with material nature. The material modes are not able to influence Krishna. The material modes always are influenced by Krishna.

#### conditioned souls, material enjoyment, pure devotees, mercantile community

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Foolish people think that devotional service is something like flattering Krishna to get some special mercy."
**Summary:** This segment contrasts conditioned souls seeking material enjoyment with pure devotees offering selfless service, using the analogy of a mercantile community to illustrate the difference.

Only the conditioned souls. Why? Because the conditioned souls want to enjoy materially. Therefore the material modes will act on them. Only then they can try to enjoy, though there is no enjoyment. Now here one point Srila Prabhupada explains, that Krishna is known to be partial to his pure devotees, but actually he is not partial. He appears to be partial to his pure devotees. Just like Prabhupada gives the example of the sun. The sun is never partial to anybody. By utilizing the sun rays, sometimes even the stones become valuable, brilliant jewels, whereas a blind man cannot see the sun, although there are enough sun rays before him. So darkness and light are two opposite conceptions, but this does not mean that the sun is partial in distributing its rays. In spite of the sun being present in the sky, why is there darkness in some places? Because even though the sun rays are open to everyone, the capacity of the receptacles are different. Foolish people think that devotional service is something like flattering Krishna to get some special mercy, whereas the fact is that the Lord has so many unlimited number of pure devotees, and those pure devotees are always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord Krishna, always, and they are not like a mercantile community. Now mercantile community, people are merchants. They render some service in exchange for value. They always want something in exchange.

#### pure devotion, unconditional service, reciprocity with Krishna, material motives

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "You simply want to serve Krishna out of love Krishna wants to provide you everything that you require out of love for you."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of unconditional service to Krishna and the reciprocal relationship where Krishna provides everything out of love.

That's the nature of a commercial transaction. So a pure devotee, even though he is always engaged in serving Krishna lovingly, he never does any service with expectation of something in return from Krishna. Never. Never. Never. Now just because the pure devotee renders loving service to Krishna, Krishna's full mercy is open for him. Then there are other people who serve the Lord but with a material motive, so when the purpose is over then they don't continue their service, just like somebody is in need of money and they approach Krishna and pray to him, "I am in need of money, kindly help me," so after Krishna fulfills their desire then they forget Krishna, how they are not continuing their prayer to Krishna. So such people they are conditionally rendering service to Krishna, they have a material motive, whereas pure devotees they render service to Krishna without any tinge of any material motive, pure service. So the Lord correspondingly is always taking care of them. It is reciprocal. You simply want to serve Krishna out of love, Krishna wants to provide you everything that you require out of love for you. You serve him unconditionally, Krishna takes care of you without putting any conditions. So it is not that Krishna is partial to the Lord and he performs service to Krishna.

#### universal devotion, demoniac nature, mercy of Krishna, pure vs. mixed devotees

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "The mercy of the Supreme Lord Krishna is open for everyone all living beings especially all human beings but people are reluctant to receive the mercy of Krishna many times they refuse."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the availability of Krishna's mercy to all, contrasting pure and mixed devotees and highlighting the rarity of pure devotional service.

So Lord Krishna is so strong, which only a traditional consumer is able to apply it to such people who render him loving transcendental service. No, he does not say some select people can become my devotee, can render service to me. He says everyone is my devotee, means everyone is Krishna's devotee, so everyone should render service to Krishna because you are his devotee, everyone without exception. But some people they are very much against Krishna, they are very, very, very demoniac natured, they envy Krishna. So such people it is very difficult for them to understand Krishna or relate to Krishna properly, it is very difficult. So Prabhupada concludes this description by telling the mercy of the Supreme Lord Krishna is open for everyone, all living beings, especially all human beings, but people are reluctant to receive the mercy of Krishna, many times they refuse. So this is the difference between a pure devotee and a mixed devotee. Mixed devotee means there is some material motive for such a devotee to render service to Krishna, and pure devotee on their hand, me other hand means no material motive and without any material motive constantly engaged in Krishna's service, always. So it is a very exacted position to constantly render service without any envy towards somebody or without any expectation of anything in return. It is very, very, very, very rare. This is the difference between a pure devotee and...

#### receiving Krishna's mercy, atheists, partial recipients, full recipients

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Those who are cent percent engaged in devotional service to Krishna are the full recipients of the Lord's mercy."
**Summary:** This segment explains who can receive Krishna's mercy, differentiating between those in darkness, partial recipients, and full recipients based on their engagement in devotional service.

pure devotional service. It's very rare, but anybody associates with a pure devotee, they can easily develop this pure devotion to Krishna. So Prabhupada explains in terms of who can receive the mercy of the Lord. Lord is freely distributing, but who can receive? Prabhupada says those who are compelled to receive the mercy of the Lord are those who are compelled to receive the mercy of the Lord, who are completely against the service of the Supreme Lord Krishna are considered to be in abject darkness, they're completely in darkness. Those who ask for the Lord's favor only at the time of necessity are partial recipients of the mercy of the Lord. The atheist, agnostics, demoniac natured people who never worship God, they are completely in darkness about Krishna and they remain in material existence till they change their ways. And those who are asking for the Lord's favor, but they are rendering some devotional selves, though it's not pure devotional service, but still they're rendering some service to Krishna and asking for some help, they are actually partially partial recipients of the mercy of Krishna because how will Krishna reciprocate with them? They are asking for something, Krishna will give that, but devotees, pure devotees who don't ask anything from Krishna, Krishna provides everything they require. They are always protected by Krishna, always sheltered by Krishna, always provided for by Krishna. So the conclusion is that those who are cent percent engaged in devotional service to Krishna are the...

#### sincere chanting, reciprocity, salvation, spiritual abode
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/nFSDaKHg3wM?t=801

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "It appears like he is partial to his devotees but he is not at all partial he is simply reciprocating with each person exactly according to that person surrender to Krishna that's all."
**Summary:** This segment concludes by emphasizing the availability of Krishna's mercy through sincere chanting, explaining that Krishna reciprocates based on surrender, and discussing salvation and the spiritual abode.

full recipients of the Lord's mercy. So it is just open for everyone. Anybody who sincerely serves Krishna, just sincerely chants, vibrates the tongue and says Hare Krishna, the Lord's mercy is available fully for such a person, but people refuse to even chant the name of Krishna. They will not chant the name of Krishna. So unfortunate people miss this opportunity even though when the Lord descends to this material world, he plays like a human being. It appears like he is partial to his devotees, but he is not at all partial. He is simply reciprocating with each person exactly according to that person's surrender to Krishna, that's all. Now in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, who died in the presence of Krishna, they got salvation without necessary qualification. Salvation means liberation without having even the qualifications because when somebody dies in the presence of Krishna then they become purified of all sinful reactions, therefore such a person is able to get some place in the spiritual abode of the Supreme God Krishna, provided they are willing to go to the supreme abode of the Supreme God. If people don't want to go, Krishna does not force. Sometimes people who don't have proper knowledge or information, they refuse to go to this abode of the Lord because only those who are purified can go. But even those who are purified, if they reject the opportunity they have for going to the spiritual personal abode of the Lord, they need not go. Krishna will not force. So I will stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.

#### grief, family relationships, Kurukshetra
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/oXd5gVY0iQ4?t=50
**Verse References:** SB 1.8.3
**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "There sat the king of the Kurus Maharaj Yudhishthira along with his younger brothers and Dhritarashtra Gandhari, Kunti and Draupadi all overwhelmed with grief."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of ego and begins discussing the third verse of the eighth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, describing the grief of the family members after the battle of Kurukshetra.

In this session, we will be talking about the process of getting rid of the ego. We will be discussing from the third verse of the eighth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The third verse is as follows: Tatrasenam Kurupatim Dhritarashtram Sahanujam Gandharim Putrashokartam Pratham Krishnam Chamadhavaha. The meaning of this third verse of the eighth chapter of the first canto of Bhagavatam: There sat the king of the Kurus, Maharaj Yudhishthira, along with his younger brothers and Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, Kunti, and Draupadi, all overwhelmed with grief. Lord Krishna was also there. Now, Srila Prabhupada explains this situation that, in the purport of the third verse of the eighth chapter, Ganga Mahaprabha talks about the battle of Omneshwarinha in Kurukshetra, as we read about in her report. Srila Prabhupada says that the battle of Kurukshetra was fought between family members, and thus all affected persons were also family members like Maharaj Yudhishthira and brothers, Kunti, Draupadi, Subhadra, and Dhritarashtra and Gandhari. Her daughters-in-law were on one side with Kauravas, and on the other side there were... So, therefore, the description given by Srila Prabhupada here is, all the principal dead bodies were in some way or other related with each other. And therefore, the family grief was combined.

#### compassion, duty, family relationships, Krishna's role

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "When Arjuna is surveying the battlefield against whom he has to fight, the enemy party, he sees all grades of relatives on the enemy side."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the family relationships involved in the battle and how Krishna was related to everyone, emphasizing Krishna's sympathy towards all.

They had lost all different grades of relatives. This is described in the Bhagavad Gita in the beginning also. When Arjuna is surveying the battlefield against whom he has to fight, the enemy party, he sees all grades of relatives on the enemy side. Of course, on his side also there were relatives, but he is seeing the enemy side. There are so many grades of relatives, and he is overjoyed, and he is overjoyed with compassion for them, and he refuses to fight. And then Krishna instructs him in the Bhagavad Gita and tells him how he has to do his duty of fighting in this Dharma Yudha as a Kshatriya. So, after the battle, the family grief of the surviving family members on both sides, the grief was combined. Lord Krishna was also one of them as a cousin of the Pandavas and nephew of Kunti, as well as brother of Subhadra, etc. See how Krishna is related in so many ways. He is the nephew of Kunti. He is a cousin of the Pandavas. He is the brother of Subhadra. Subhadra was the wife of Abhimanyu. Abhimanyu was the son of Arjuna. Abhimanyu died in the battle. So, Subhadra was... lost her son, Abhimanyu, not her husband. Subhadra's husband was Arjuna. Arjuna and Subhadra's son was Abhimanyu. Abhimanyu died in the battle. So, Subhadra lost her son, Abhimanyu. So, Krishna was the brother of Subhadra. The Lord... Who is the Lord? The Lord... Supreme Lord Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is the best well-wisher of every living being."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna is sympathetic to all, especially his devotees, and began to pacify the grieving family members.

Therefore, he was equally sympathetic toward all of them, and therefore he began to pacify them befittingly. Now, Krishna... He is Supreme Lord. So, he is actually sympathetic to all of them because the Pandavas especially and Kunti and Draupadi were his devotees. And, otherwise also, Krishna is the best well-wisher of every living being. So, Krishna, understandably, he began to pacify all the family members who were in grief due to losing their beloved relatives. And, the fourth verse... The meaning of this verse is: Citing the stringent laws of the Almighty and their reactions upon living beings, Lord Sri Krishna and the Munis began to pacify those who were shocked and affected. And, the fourth verse... The Lord...

#### laws of nature, Dharma, religion, God's laws

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Dharma or religion means the laws given by the supreme law."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of spiritual discourses in pacifying those affected by loss and emphasizes that the laws of nature are under the control of the Supreme Lord, defining Dharma as the laws of God.

This is very important that when there is some natural calamity or some unfortunate incident where there is a loss of life, and that too a big number of people are killed, then the only way to pacify the surviving family members is by the instructions and the spiritual discourses given by saintly persons, sages, given by the devotees, by the saintly persons. So, exactly that is the meaning of this verse. Laws of nature, under the order of the Supreme Personality of God, it cannot be altered by any living entity. The laws of nature are something which nobody can alter. Nobody can alter it. So, therefore, it is described here, the living entities are eternally under the subjugation of the Almighty Lord. Now, who is the maker of these laws? It is Supreme Lord Krishna. And who enforces it? Supreme Lord enforces it, and therefore everyone is eternally under the subordinate control of the Supreme Lord, who is the supreme control. Now, it is clearly explained here by Srila Prabhupada, the Lord makes all the laws and orders, and these laws and orders are generally called Dharma or religion. This is a very, very important point. What is Dharma or what is religion? Dharma or religion means the laws given by the supreme law. Nobody else can make these laws. You cannot have your own religious system as is fashionable nowadays. No, there is a universal religion or Dharma, the real Dharma, that is the laws of God, which is acting on every living being irrespective of their belonging to some particular country or some religious sect or some belief system.

#### laws of nature, Dharma, Bhagavad Gita, happiness

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Simply by following krishna's orders as given the bhagavad gita anyone can become happy in this world both materially and spiritually"
**Summary:** The speaker continues discussing the laws of nature and emphasizes that following Krishna's orders, as given in the Bhagavad Gita, leads to both material and spiritual happiness.

All that doesn't matter. Just like when death comes, there is no consideration of whether this person is a Hindu or somebody is believing in God or somebody doesn't believe. There is no such consideration. When there is disease, especially when there is an epidemic or a pandemic, there is no consideration whether somebody believes or does not believe. These are laws, stringent laws of material nature, which are actually laws of God. So, no one can create any religious formula. Bona fide religion is to abide by the orders of the Lord. The Lord's orders are clearly declared in the Bhagavad Gita. For all the scriptures, the most concise scripture is the Bhagavad Gita, and all the scriptures by the German BI, known as Bible, Krishna is directly spoken and given the orders. Everyone should follow Krishna's orders, and that will make everyone happy simply by following Krishna's orders as given in the Bhagavad Gita. Anyone can become happy in this world both materially and spiritually. Note this, it is not just spiritual happiness. Of course, Bhagavad Gita is a spiritual literature, but still in the Bhagavad Gita, how to be spiritually happy and also how to be materially happy, both are described. As long as we are in the material world, our duty is to follow the orders of the Lord. That is our duty, to simply follow Krishna's orders as is given in the Bhagavad Gita.

#### liberation, service to the Lord, spiritual vision, material conception

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Serving the lord is our eternal engagement."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that by following the Lord's orders, one can be liberated and render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord, emphasizing the importance of giving up the material conception of life.

And if, by the grace of the Lord, we are liberated from the clutches of the material world, then in our liberated stage also, we can render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord. Serving the Lord is not some temporary activity. No, serving the Lord is our eternal engagement. That's called swarupa. So, if we agree to follow the orders of the Supreme Lord as given in the bona fide scriptures or in Bhagavad Gita, then we are protected by the Lord. We can be materially and spiritually happy. We can get liberation from material bondage. And after liberation, what happens? That's clearly told here. We render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord. And we are transcendental loving service to the Lord. In our material stage, we can see neither ourselves nor the Lord for want of spiritual vision. In our present condition, we lack spiritual vision. This vision is simply some material vision which is not useful for seeing the spiritual reality. We cannot see God. We cannot because God is completely spiritual in form, and we cannot see our self, the real self inside this body. We can't see anything spiritual. But when we are liberated from material affection, and when we are situated in the original spiritual form, we can see both ourselves and the Lord face to face. So, therefore, what is called as mukti or moksha or liberation actually means to be reinstated in our original spiritual status after giving up the material concept of life. We are all having a material concept that I am this body, all the bodily connections are mine, but we are not the body. Bodily connections are not mine. So, to give up this material conception is to practice Dharma.

**Key Quote:** "Human life is specifically meant for qualifying ourselves for the spiritual liberty"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of spiritual liberation and realizing that we are separate from the material body and possessions, leading to understanding our relationship with Krishna.

Properly and become liberated from misconceptions, material misconceptions. Therefore, human life is specifically meant for qualifying ourselves for the spiritual liberty. Real liberation is spiritual liberation. Materially, however much people may try to become free, the bondage is always there and because of the body, and after this body is finished, we don't die, but we accept another material body. So, if you want to become free from this material covering, material trap, material entanglement, then you should aim for spiritual liberation, spiritual liberty. In the influence of the illusory energy or material energy, we accept this spot life of few years as permanent existence. This is a big defect in our civilization. People do not know that this material world is a temporary place, and it is actually a presentation of illusion by the material energy. Now, by cultivating spiritual knowledge, we can realize we are nothing to do with all this material paraphernalia. Then, as soon as we realize this, I am nothing to do with this material body or material possessions or material existence itself, I become free from all material attachments, and then this freedom from material attachment means we understand who we are. We understand who is Krishna. We understand what is our relationship with Krishna, and we become reinstated in our spiritual original position.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by highlighting the importance of chanting Hare Krishna to cleanse the heart of misconceptions and awaken spiritual knowledge, solving the real problems of life.

Now, this chanting of Hare Krishna, it is actually the means to inject within the core of our heart the spiritual sound of the holy name of the Supreme Lord. Thereby, it actually clears away misgivings, misconceptions. It clears away material misconceptions, and then it actually unlocks. It awakens our spiritual knowledge within our heart, the spiritual knowledge. It is awakened. So, the real problems of life, birth, death, disease, old age, these problems are solved only by cleansing the misgivings in the heart and by awakening to spiritual reality, through especially chanting Hare Krishna. So, this is what is explained by Srila Prabhupada in his purport.

**Speaker:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami

#### inconceivability of God, contradictory nature of God's actions, understanding Krishna through pure devotees
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/3qsJNeMCsbg?t=50
**Verse References:** SB 1.8.30, BG 9.4, BG 3.22
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So, if we properly hear from the right source, like pure devotees, like Kunti, and all the other Acharyas, then we can get some understanding about Krishna's personality as inconceivable for our tiny brain."
**Summary:** Kunti's prayer highlights the seemingly contradictory nature of Krishna's actions, emphasizing that He is both unborn and takes birth, active yet inactive, and that understanding Him requires hearing from pure devotees.

In this session we will be discussing from the 30th verse of the 8th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, continuing the prayers by Queen Kunti. जन्म कर्मच विश्वात्मन् अजस्याकर्तुरात्मनः तिरियन् रिशिशु यादसु तरत्यन्त विडंबनम्. So Kunti Devi is saying, of course, it is bewildering, O soul of the universe, that you work, although you are inactive, that you take birth, though you are the vital force and the unborn. You yourself descend among animals, men, sages, and aquatics. Verily, this is bewildering. So, in this particular prayer, Kunti is helping us understand something about the characteristics of the Supreme Lord, which seem to be self-contradictory. So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "The transcendental pastimes of the Lord are not only bewildering, but also apparently contradictory." In other words, they are all inconceivable to the limited thinking power of the human being. What is the reality? We cannot conceive of a personality who is simultaneously unborn and still takes birth. He is active, yet he has nothing to do. So we cannot conceive what kind of a personality is that. Even though the Supreme Lord is all-pervading Supersoul of all existence, still he appears in the form of a boar among animals, in the form of a human being among inhuman society as Rama, Krishna, etc. Or he appears in the form of a rishi like Narayana Rishi, or he appears in the form of an aquatic like a fish, Matsyavatara. Still, Kunti is saying he is unborn. Even the scriptures declare Aja. In Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says Ajo Pisannabhya Yatma. He is Aja, he is unborn. And Name Parthasthi Kartavyam Trishulokeshu Kinchana. Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita. Here also it is said, there is nothing to do. And even in the Vedas, Natasyakaryam Karanam Javidhyate. This is in Upanishads. So, if we properly hear from the right source, like pure devotees, like Kunti, and all the other Acharyas,

#### transcendental nature of Krishna's forms, Krishna as the vital force of the universe (Vishwatma), Krishna's actions are extraordinary

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Although he appears among animals like another animal, or he appears like a man, or a rishi, or a fish, he is eternally the Supreme Lord under all circumstances."
**Summary:** This segment explains that Krishna's various forms (fish, boar, human) are all spiritual and transcendental, and that He is the vital force (Vishwatma) sustaining the entire universe, with actions meant for our understanding.

then we can get some understanding about Krishna's personality as inconceivable for our tiny brain. Everything is possible for him because everything is reconciled in his personality. Every action of the Lord actually is bewildering for the common man because none of his actions are ordinary. They are all extraordinary. Lord means performer of extraordinary activities, always, not sometimes, always. Now in the Brahma Samhita it is said, He cannot be understood by Vedic knowledge, Vedesh Udurlabham, but he can be easily understood by the pure devotees, Adurlabham Atma Bhaktao. It is very easy to understand for the pure devotees. So, therefore, it is the pure devotees who know that, although he appears among animals like another animal, or he appears like a man, or a rishi, or a fish, he is eternally the Supreme Lord under all circumstances, and his activities prove that. Activities prove that. When the Lord appeared as a fish, he instructed Satyavrata. Satyavrata was a great king. He was a devotee also. So, the Lord instructed him in transcendental knowledge, you see. So, which fish will instruct transcendental knowledge to somebody else? That is because he is the Supreme Lord in that form. The form may appear like a fish, or a boar, or a human, or half man, half lion, all kinds of inconceivable forms, simply for the sake of his pastimes, he appears in such forms. But all of those forms are completely spiritual. There is not the least tinge of any materiality in any of those forms. So, therefore, Kunti addresses the Supreme Lord Krishna here as Vishwatman, the vital force of the universe. In everybody's body, there is vital force. There is Atma. But, just as this whole body works because of the presence of that vital force in the heart of the living being, similarly, the whole universe is working because Krishna has entered this universe as Vishwatma. So, he is the supreme vital force, supreme vital force. We are all present in this universe, but we are not in the center of the universe. We don't control the universal working.

#### transcendental nature of Krishna's birth and activities, Krishna's presence within and without everything, limitations of material understanding

**Key Quote:** "One who understands this real nature in truth about the activities and appearance, or birth of Krishna, such a person, upon leaving the present body, need not take birth again in this material world, but instead, attains Krishna's eternal abode."
**Summary:** Krishna's birth and activities are transcendental, and understanding this leads to liberation; He is present within and without everything, but cannot be understood through material logic or observation.

But Krishna's actions, they are meant specifically for our understanding. If Krishna is present as the supreme vital force in the center of the universe, where is the question of his taking birth? So, he will not take birth. Why he has to take birth? So, therefore, in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna clarifies, "I take birth and I perform activities, but they are all transcendental. They are not ordinary. janmaharmachame divyam and evamyo veti tattvatah." One who understands this real nature in truth about the activities and appearance, or birth of Krishna, such a person, upon leaving the present body, need not take birth again in this material world, but instead, attains Krishna's eternal abode. In the beginning of our prayers, we said that Krishna is within and without everything, but still, he is invisible. Now, for example, Krishna is in everyone's heart. He is entered into every atom also. Andantrastha paramanu chayantrastha. Paramanu means atom. So, he entered into every universe. He enters into every planet. He enters into every living being's heart. He enters into every material atom. So, Krishna is within everyone and everything, and he is outside also. As Vishnu, he is outside of everything. He never comes in touch with the material nature, material world. So, he is outside of everything also. So, therefore, Krishna we cannot understand by some ordinary logic, by some material calculations, by descriptions given in terms of some material observation. That will never help you understand Krishna.

#### Vishwaroopa (universal form) description, greatness of Krishna, Krishna is greater than the greatest and smaller than the smallest

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is simultaneously greater than the greatest Mahato Mahiyan and he is smaller than the smallest Anoranyan."
**Summary:** The lecture describes the Vishwaroopa, or universal form of Krishna, emphasizing His immense greatness, and explains that He is simultaneously greater than the greatest and smaller than the smallest.

We have to hear devotees like Venkati. Now, there is a description of Krishna's Viratrupa or Vishwarupa, one form of the Lord. The external body of Krishna as described in the description given of the Viratrupa or Vishwarupa. The hills and mountains are described as the bones of the Lord. So many hills are there. So many mountains are there. They are all described as the bones of the Virat Purusha. The great oceans have been described as the different holes in the Lord's universal body. The planet Brahmaloka has been described as the upper portion of his skull. Like this, the universal form has been described in so many ways. But then, the earth and the sky are intended to be the upper portion, because they are the set of the earth. The certain part of the earth and the sky is where the earth is. This is the only thing about which the universe is. Let us veer from the present state. In Brahma's view, the matter of the universe is to have run—what makes the universe and God's existence both greater than the matter of the universe. Now, it is said here, Brahma Shankar Prabhupada, there are people who can simply think of God as being great, but they do not know how great he is. They are thinking in terms of what they consider as great. So then they are misguided. So, then they are misled to believe some Devatas as God or some other powerful person they think is God. So, therefore, the Vishwaroopa description of the Lord, Supreme Lord is given in the scriptures that if you think of greatness of the Supreme Lord, think of the hills and mountains as the bones of the universal form. So, how many hills are there? How many mountains are there? You cannot count. So, this form is the universal form is very, very, very, very huge. Nobody can see. Arjuna was given special eyes to see that universal form. Otherwise, nobody can see this form of the Supreme Lord. So, Krishna is simultaneously greater than the greatest, Mahato Mahiyan, and he is smaller than the smallest, Anoranyan. That is Krishna's wonderful characteristic. Simultaneously, he is greater than the greatest and smaller than the smallest. So, the Vishwaroopa is the biggest form of anyone in this entire universe, and the form of the Supersoul who has entered into every atom is much, much smaller than the atom. That form of the Lord is actually the Lord being smaller than the smallest, Anoranyan. So, this is also greatness of the Lord. Simultaneously, he is present as greater than the greatest and smaller than the smallest.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing Krishna's eternal supremacy and how He becomes a plaything in the presence of His pure devotee, Mother Yashoda.

this sight is bewildering to me. So, in the previous verse, Kunti Devi has said his activities, Krishna's activities, are bewildering. So, she is giving an example of a particular pastime which is bewildering. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, here is another explanation of the bewilderment created by the pastimes of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is the supreme in all circumstances, as already explained earlier. It is not that sometimes he is supreme and sometimes he is not. No, always eternally supreme under all circumstances, all places, always, eternally. Here is a specific example of the Lord's being the supreme, at the same time a plaything in the presence of his pure devotee. The pure devotee being referred to here is Yashoda, Mother Yashoda.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the nature of pure devotion, highlighting how pure devotees serve Krishna out of unalloyed love and often forget His supreme position.

Now, we have to remember that the pure devotees are rendering service to Krishna only because of their unalloyed love, pure love. There is no expectation of anything in return. And while discharging such devotional service to the Supreme Lord, the pure devotee forgets that Krishna is actually the Supreme Lord. They forget that. And when the Supreme Lord is reciprocating with his pure devotee, he also accepts the loving service of the devotee more relishably when the devotee is rendering that service out of pure affection, spontaneously, without any reverential admiration.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the devotion in Vaikuntha, characterized by reverence, with the spontaneous love in Goloka Vrindavan, which Krishna relishes more.

See, in spiritual world there are two kinds of devotees. The devotees in the Vaikuntha Loka are also pure devotees, as much as devotees in Goloka Vrindavan are also pure devotees. But the devotees in Vaikuntha, they have appreciation of the Supreme Lord, knowledge, understanding, as the supreme person full of all opulences, the greatest. So, they have reverential admiration for the Supreme Lord. Whereas in Goloka Vrindavana, devotees, they forget that Krishna is the Supreme Lord, and they render service to him simply out of their love for him. So, this is without reverential admiration. This is spontaneous love. This is different than what devotion that is expressed in Vaikuntha. Now, Krishna as a Supreme Lord, one and only one Supreme Lord, he relishes more if his devotees render him spontaneous loving service, than when the devotees render him devotional service out of reverence for him

**Summary:** The speaker provides examples of Krishna's friends and parents in Vrindavan and emphasizes that Krishna values the loving chastisement of his devotees more than the prayers of the Vedas.

as the greatest. Now, Prabhupada gives examples here. The friends of Krishna, the covered boyfriends, they consider Krishna as one of them. They are not conscious that, Oh, here is Krishna who is the Supreme Lord. You have to be very careful in our dealing with him. No. The parents of Krishna, they are like Yashoda, Nanda Maharaj, and elderly gopis and elderly gopas in Vrindavan, they consider Krishna as a child only. Again, they are not conscious, here is Krishna, who is the Supreme Personality of God, full of all powers. No. They forget that. Now, one important point here is that Krishna accepts the chastisement by his devotees like his parents, more lovingly than he accepts the prayers of the Vedas, which glorify him in so many ways as the greatest.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna, when he came to this material world, he wanted to show to the people of this world, what are the kind of pastimes that go on between himself and his pure devotees in Goloka Vrindavana."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna descended to show the pastimes of Goloka Vrindavan, giving the example of Krishna stealing butter and being scolded by Yashoda.

So, therefore, Krishna, when he came to this material world, he wanted to show to the people of this world what are the kind of pastimes that go on between himself and his pure devotees in Goloka Vrindavana. He wanted to show that. So, in front of this material world, in front of his mother Yashoda, he displayed a unique picture of subordination. Though he does not become subordinate, he plays the role of a subordinate child, but he does not become subordinate. So, Srila Prabhupada explains, in his natural, childish, playful activities, Krishna used to spoil the stock of butter that was kept by mother Yashoda, by breaking the pot of this butter and distributing it to his friends and monkeys. And that made mother Yashoda very angry. Why? Because, I have churned this butter for you. And what are you doing? Spoiling the stock of this nice delicious butter and distributing to the monkeys?

**Summary:** The speaker describes Yashoda's attempt to punish Krishna, Krishna's feigned fear and tears, and the contrast between Krishna's fear of Yashoda and the fear that He inspires in the universe.

So, simply out of love for her child, Yashoda wanted to make a show of punishment. So, what did she do? She took a rope and threatened and threatened to actually tie him up, tie his hands. So, Krishna, when he saw mother Yashoda is angry and she wants to tie him, he began to cry, just like a small child, ordinary children. When mother is angry, they also become very afraid and they begin to cry. Now, when tears were rolling down Krishna's eyes, they were washing the mascara, which Yashoda used to decorate his eyes with. Krishna is already very beautiful, but the devotees like to decorate him. So, the beautiful eyes, the mascara was being washed when he was crying out of fear of mother Yashoda. So, this picture of Krishna is adored by Kunti Devi. And Kunti Devi is simultaneously remembering this child who is crying as a son of mother Yashoda. She is, this child is not ordinary child. He is a Supreme Lord. And he is feared by whom? By Sakshatbhayamurthy, by the fear personified, who creates fear in everyone, in his entire universe creation. That Bhayamurthy is always afraid of Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "It is the loving exchange that Krishna relishes."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Kunti's awareness of Krishna's supreme position with Yashoda's forgetfulness, emphasizing that Krishna relishes the loving exchange with his devotees.

Then how can Krishna be afraid of Yashoda? So, Srila Prabhupada explained, this means Kunti was conscious of the exalted position of Krishna, whereas Yashoda was not conscious of the exalted position of Krishna as the Supreme Lord. Why? Because if Yashoda were to be conscious of Krishna's position, she could not have chastised Krishna. And it is said here, that Krishna makes Yashoda forget that he is the Supreme Lord, so that Yashoda will not treat him as a Supreme, and thereby, she will actually, out of love, even chastise him. So, what does Krishna relish? It is the loving exchange that Krishna relishes. It is only out of love that mother chastises. Mother Yashoda chastises Krishna. It is not out of any real anger. It is anger of love. Anger of love. So, this is actually a different kind of anger than what we know as anger in this material world. It is only possible in the spiritual world, this kind of anger. And it is only because of the loving exchange between Mother Yashoda and Krishna. The same love, Mother Yashoda sometimes will kiss Krishna. Same love, she will embrace him. Same love, she will sometimes feed him. Sometimes she will send him for taking the cows for grazing in the forest. The same love, but variety of exchanges of rasa.

**Key Quote:** "They all know Krishna is the Supreme Personality of God."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the exalted position of Krishna's devotees and clarifies that their forgetfulness of Krishna's supreme position is not due to ignorance, illustrating with the mud-eating pastime.

This is subject matter of the Bhagavatam, subject matter of one book written by Srila Rupa Goswami, Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu. So, this is a very, very exalted position of the devotees of Krishna, pure devotees. They are among the topmost devotees. And don't think that because they forget Krishna as Supreme Lord, don't think they are in ignorance about Krishna's actual position. They all know Krishna is the Supreme Personality of God. They all know. Like it happens when Yashoda once told Krishna, I heard you have eaten some mud. Open your mouth. So, Krishna said, No, I have not eaten any mud. So, Yashoda said, Okay, okay, if you have not eaten, let me just see. Let me open your mouth. You open your mouth, let me just see whether there is any mud in your mouth. So, Krishna opened his mouth and then Yashoda began to see the whole universe in his mouth. So, then she became completely conscious of Krishna's exalted position as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And she began to think actually under the influence of illusion, I am thinking this, Krishna is my child. Actually, Krishna is my child. Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how Krishna uses Yogamaya to conceal his greatness from Yashoda and concludes by reiterating the eternal nature of Krishna's loving exchanges with his devotees in the spiritual world.

So, then Krishna does not like Mother Yashoda to treat him as the Supreme Lord. So, therefore, Krishna covered Mother Yashoda with Yogamaya, which hides Krishna's greatness and supremacy. And Mother Yashoda after that said, Okay, okay, now don't ever again attempt to eat mud. I will give you nice sweets. Don't eat mud. Go and play. So, she came back to her position as the loving mother of Krishna, the small child Krishna. And this is the eternal position of Krishna in the spiritual world, in his loving exchanges with his devotees. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna has a transcendental form which never deteriorates and he is always unborn."
**Summary:** Queen Kunti glorifies Krishna, explaining that although unborn, He appears in a transcendental form, unlike ordinary beings who are forced to take birth due to karma.

From the 32nd verse of the 8th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, continuing the prayers by Queen Kunti: kecidahur ajam jatam punya shlokasya keertaye yadopriyasyaanvavaye malayasyeva chandanam. The meaning of this verse is: some say that the unborn is born for the glorification of pious kings, and others say that he is born to please King Yadu, one of your dearest devotees. You appear in his family as sandalwood appears in the Malaya hills. So here the description is being given by Queen Kunti, glorifying the Supreme Lord Krishna as 'Unborn is born.' Krishna is unborn, ajopisannabhya yatma. Krishna has a transcendental form which never deteriorates, and he is always unborn. He eternally exists in the spiritual world. Eternally he is the controller of everyone and everything in the entire cosmic manifestation. Still he incarnates. 'Incarnates' means he takes birth in this material world. But he is born as the Supreme Lord. His position doesn't change. He appears in a transcendental form.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Krishna's transcendental birth with the forced birth of spirit souls due to karma, emphasizing the eternal master-servant relationship between Krishna and the living entities.

He doesn't take birth like we take birth. Even spirit soul, the living entity, is Ajop. He is unborn. But the spirit soul is forced to take birth, accept a material body, a temporary material body, because of the force of karma. Such karmic force does not act on the Supreme Lord, because the Supreme Lord is the controller of all such laws of karma. He is transcendental always. He is the master always, and we are eternally the servant. Either we serve Krishna as devotees, or we serve the illusory energy as non-devotees. So servant we are, always. Krishna is the master always, the controller, the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that despite Krishna being unborn, He takes birth in the material world, as stated in the Bhagavad Gita, and there are different opinions as to why He does so.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, because the Lord's appearance in this material world is bewildering, there are different opinions about the birth of the unborn. In the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord says that he takes his birth in the material world, although he is the Lord of all creations, and he is unborn. So there cannot be any denial of the birth of the unborn, because he himself establishes the truth, Krishna's own statement in the Bhagavad Gita. But still there are different opinions as to why he takes his birth. That is also declared in the Bhagavad Gita. In the fourth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna declares that he takes birth in this material world, and he also declares the purpose of such birth.

#### Krishna's potencies, Internal potency, Reestablishing religion
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/FJHr2o0VsVc?t=279
**Verse References:** BG 4.8
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "He appears by his own internal potency."
**Summary:** Krishna appears by His internal potency to reestablish the principles of religion, protect the pious, and annihilate the impious, as stated in the Bhagavad Gita.

He appears by his own internal potency. Krishna has got three kinds of potencies: internal potency, external potency, and internal potency. So that internal potency is the spiritual potency. It is Krishna's personal energy. Potency means energy. It is his personal energy for his purposes exclusively. And when Krishna takes birth in this world, it is the action of the internal potency. Energies are working always, but we take birth under the external potency, under the material energy. Therefore we get a material body. Krishna does not accept the material body. So in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says he comes to reestablish the principles of religion, dharmasamsthapanarthaya. So how does he establish these principles? He speaks the Bhagavad Gita. He follows the rules and regulations of a householder while he was living in Dwaraka as the king of Dwaraka. By his own behavior, by his actions, by his words, by his teachings, by his instructions, he establishes, rather reestablishes, the principles of religion. And he also comes to protect the pious, paritranaya sadhunam, and to annihilate the impious, vinashaya chadushkrutam. So three purposes clearly he says in the Bhagavad Gita for which he appears, or he takes birth in this material world. That is the mission of the appearance of the unborn.

#### Transcendental appearance, Glorifying Yudhishthira, Pious King

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "His birth is not exactly birth. Birth means we are accepting a material body. Krishna does not accept a material body."
**Summary:** Krishna's birth is described as an appearance, a transcendental manifestation, to glorify the pious King Yudhishthira, who follows the scriptures and instructions of Krishna.

Srila Prabhupada uses this word 'appearance' to distinguish Krishna's birth as transcendental. He is always present, but he becomes visible. Therefore we say he appears. His birth is not exactly birth. Birth means we are accepting a material body. Krishna does not accept a material body. Still it is said that the Lord is there to glorify the pious king Yudhishthira. Now Yudhishthira, one of the Pandavas, the eldest Pandava, he was a pure devotee of Krishna. Not only Yudhishthira, all the five Pandavas are pure devotees of Krishna. Kunti is pure devotee of Krishna. Draupadi is pure devotee of Krishna. All the members of the family of Yudhishthira, the Pandavas, are pure devotees of Krishna. So Krishna appears to glorify Yudhishthira. Yudhishthira is a pious king. He rules exactly according to the directions given in the Shastra, the scriptures. He follows the instructions of Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "The people in this world can be happy only when they have a devotee ruling over them."
**Summary:** A devotee ruler is essential for the welfare and happiness of the people, as demonstrated by the rule of the Pandavas, where basic needs were plentiful.

He rules for the welfare of the entire world. He teaches the citizens what is the goal of life, and he guides them so that they may be delivered from this material existence. That's why devotees are required to rule this world. So Srila Prabhupada further says, Lord Sri Krishna certainly wanted to establish the kingdom of the Pandavas for the good of all in the world. The Mahabharata describes when Pandavas were ruling, everyone was happy. There was plenty of supply of all the basic needs. That's described in the Mahabharata and the Bhagavatam both. King Yudhishthira's rule is very, very good. So Prabhupada says when there is a pious king ruling over the world, the people are happy. That's a fact. When the ruler is impious, the people are unhappy. This is the opposite. So there cannot be happiness simply by some artificial arrangements. No. The people in this world can be happy only when they have a devotee ruling over them.

**Key Quote:** "In the case of democracy, the impious citizens themselves elect their representative to rule over them."
**Summary:** In Kali Yuga, rulers are often impious, leading to unhappiness, and in democracies, impious citizens often elect impious leaders, thus being responsible for their own suffering.

Only such a devotee can ensure the people will be happy. In the age of Kali, in most cases, the rulers are impious, and therefore the citizens are also continuously unhappy. Kali Yuga is the age of quarrel, hypocrisy, and the rulers are generally impious. So people are not happy in Kali Yuga. But in the case of democracy, the system of government that we have at present in our country, and many other countries also, the democratic form of government, Srila Prabhupada says, in the case of democracy, the impious citizens themselves elect their representative to rule over them. Mostly people are not pious in Kali Yuga, and such impious citizens, they elect an impious person to rule. Therefore, they cannot blame anyone for their unhappiness. When there is an impious ruler, people have to be unhappy. They cannot be happy. So they want to be happy. So who is to blame? They themselves are to blame, because they elect their representative.

#### Yudhishtira vs. Nala, Krishna's independence, Choice of appearance

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna chooses where he wants to appear. How he wants to appear. As whose son he wants to appear. He chooses that. Therefore he is completely independent."
**Summary:** Yudhishtira is glorified by Krishna's appearance because he is a pure devotee, unlike Maharaj Nala, and Krishna is independent, choosing where and how to appear, unlike conditioned souls.

To rule. So Srila Prabhupada gives another point here, that Maharaj Nala was also celebrated as a great pious king, but he had no connection with Lord Krishna. Therefore Maharaj Yudhishtira is meant here to be glorified by Lord Krishna. Maharaj Nala was also a pious king. He was ruling nicely. But he was not a pure devotee of Krishna. So therefore, Yudhishtira was a pure devotee of Krishna. He is meant to be glorified by the appearance of Krishna in this world. Krishna also glorified King Yadu, having taken birth in his family. So Krishna appeared in Yadu dynasty. Yadu was a former king, and from him the dynasty of kings is coming down. So Krishna's father Vasudeva was a descendant of the Yadu dynasty. Krishna appeared in that Yadu dynasty, the son of Vasudeva. So therefore it is said here, Krishna is known as Yadava, Yadu Veera, Yadu Nandana. Many names are there like this, although the Lord is always independent of such obligation. Krishna is identified as a descendant of the Yadu dynasty, but Krishna has no obligation to appear in the Yadu dynasty. When we take birth in this world in a certain family or a certain lineage, we have no choice. We are forced to take birth according to karma. Krishna is not forced like that. So Krishna chooses where he wants to appear, how he wants to appear, as whose son he wants to appear. He chooses that. Therefore he is completely independent.

#### Sandalwood analogy, Malaya hills, Glorifying King Yadu

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is just like the sandalwood that grows in the Malaya hills."
**Summary:** Krishna's appearance in the Yadu dynasty is likened to sandalwood growing in the Malaya hills, highlighting the association but also Krishna's independence from obligation.

He is not bound like us. So the example is given. Krishna is just like the sandalwood that grows in the Malaya hills. Trees can grow anywhere and everywhere, yet because the sandalwood trees grow mostly in the area of Malaya hills, the name sandalwood and the Malaya hills are interrelated. Sandalwood is famous. It has got very, very nice fragrance. But such sandalwood trees grow mostly in the Malaya hills, and therefore malayasyeva chandanam. Sandalwood is known as Malayan sandalwood. So the example is given to help us understand. Krishna need not appear in the Yadu dynasty just to glorify his devotee King Yadu. Krishna appears in that dynasty.

**Key Quote:** "The conclusion is that the Lord is ever unborn like the sun. And yet he appears as the sun rises from the eastern horizon."
**Summary:** Krishna's appearance is further explained using the analogy of the sun, which is always present but appears to rise and set, emphasizing Krishna's unborn nature and His appearance out of mercy.

So Srila Prabhupada says the conclusion is that the Lord is ever unborn like the sun, and yet he appears as the sun rises from the eastern horizon. Now another example. The sun is in its orbit, and it is just rotating in its orbit, but to our eyes on the earth, it appears like sun is rising on the eastern horizon in the morning, and sun is setting in the evening, and there is a period of darkness. Again next morning the sun rises. So the sun appears to rise and set, but actually sun is always in its orbit in its position. So just as the sun is never the sun of the eastern horizon, similarly the Lord is no one's son, but he is the father of everything that be. Krishna is the Lord of everything, everyone, but out of his causeless mercy, he appears as the son of Vasudeva, Devaki, as a descendant of Yadu dynasty, out of his mercy. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "so yet one more reason why Krishna appeared"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and discusses the reasons for Krishna's appearance, highlighting that while the Lord may appear for one apparent purpose, He solves many problems simultaneously.

In this session we will be discussing from the 34th verse of the 8th chapter of the 1st canto, Srimad Bhagavatam, continuing the prayers by Queen Kunti. The meaning of this verse is: Others say that the world, being overburdened like a boat at sea, is much aggrieved and that Brahma, who is your son, prayed for you and so you have appeared to diminish the trouble. So yet one more reason why Krishna appeared. Krishna had incarnated, and all these reasons are valid reasons. So the Lord is so expert that when he appears for apparently one purpose, actually he solves so many problems.

#### Brahma's Birth, Narayana's Potency, Garbhodakashayi Vishnu

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "without spiritual contact matter cannot create"
**Summary:** The speaker explains Brahma's unique birth from Narayana without a mother (Lakshmiji), emphasizing the omnipotency of the Lord and the necessity of spiritual contact for material creation.

All the problems of all the people, that's the Lord's way of incarnation. So here another reason is being given that Brahma, he felt that the earth was overburdened by demoniac forces and he was unable to deal with it, so he prayed for the Lord's incarnation and the Lord appeared to diminish this burden. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, "Brahma or the first living being born just after the creation is the direct son of Narayana. Narayana as Garbhodakashayi Vishnu. Garbhodakashayi Vishnu is a form of Narayana incarnating as Vishnu as the second Vishnu form in this world. Garbhodakashayi Vishnu first of all this Vishnu enters the material universe, why? Because without spiritual contact matter cannot create. We think that material changes are taking place automatically, no, nothing happens automatically. Behind matter there has to be spirit." So Srila Prabhupada says, "Without spiritual contact matter cannot create. This principle was followed from the very beginning of the creation. The supreme spirit, that is the supreme Lord, entered the universe and the first living being Brahma was born on a lotus flower grown out of the transcendental abdomen of Vishnu. Garbhodakashayi Vishnu has got a lotus like depression in his navel region. From that Lotus navel a lotus flower was born, therefore he is called Padmanabha." What I've heard this name, Padmanabha, he from whose navel, nabi or nabha, Padma, a lotus appeared. Brahma was born on that Lotus. So Srila Prabhupada says, "Vishnu is also known therefore as Padmanabha. Brahma is known as Atma Bhuvu because he was begotten directly from the father without any contact of mother Lakshmi ji. Brahma is also known therefore as Padmanabha. Brahma is known as Atma Bhuvu because he was begotten directly from the father without any contact of Mother Lakshmi ji."

#### Narayana's Omnipotency, Mayavada Philosophy, Transcendental Nature of Krishna

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Narayana is not an ordinary living being."
**Summary:** The speaker refutes the Mayavada philosophy that equates all beings with Narayana, emphasizing Narayana's transcendental nature and omnipotency, contrasting it with the limitations of ordinary living beings.

Vishnu's consort is Lakshmi. Generally anybody takes birth from a father and mother. That's our experience in this world. But Brahma, he was born directly from the father without any contact with the mother. Srila Prabhupada explains, Lakshmiji was present near Narayana engaged in the service of Lord Narayana, and still without contact with Lakshmiji, Narayana begot Brahma. So therefore Srila Prabhupada says, this is the omnipotency of Lord Narayana. Omnipotency means he is the father. He has got all power, all kinds of potencies, and those potencies are working. They are active, actively engaged in producing so many different changes. One who foolishly considers Narayana like other living beings should take a lesson from this. There are so many millions and billions of living beings including powerful devatas, but no devata can produce a son without contact between the male and female. Not possible. Never happens. Therefore, the conclusion is, Narayana is not an ordinary being. Narayana is not an ordinary living being. Especially the mayavadis. They wrongly think or consider everyone is Narayana. So between sanyasis, they address each other as Narayana. When one mayavadi sanyasi meets another mayavadi sanyasi, he says, Namo Narayana. So he is addressing the other sanyasi as Narayana. Then the other sanyasi will also address this first sanyasi as Narayana. This is blasphemy, because Narayana is not an ordinary living being. Ordinary living being can never become Narayana. Narayana never becomes conditioned. In this material world, Narayana never accepts a material body. So these mayavadis who accepted a material body, it is because they are jiva. They are ordinary living being. Living being is subject to bewilderment by the illusory energy. Living being has to be, may be forced to take birth and accept a material body, but Krishna does not take such birth. Krishna does not accept material body. Narayana is always transcendental.

#### Narayana's Potencies, Brahma Samhita, Creation Process

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Narayana is the personality of God in himself."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Narayana's divine potencies, referencing Brahma Samhita to explain how each part of His body can perform the functions of all other parts, and discusses Brahma's role in the secondary creation process.

So, the conclusion or the proper understanding is that Narayana is the personality of God in himself, and he has all the potencies of all the senses in all the parts of his transcendental body. So, this is statement in the Brahma Samhita. As regards the Supreme Personality of God, Brahma Samhita states, "His different parts of the body are capable of doing the work of all other parts. Each part or each sense can act, and perform the activities of all other senses." Just like Narayana can eat by seeing through his eyes. We can only see with our eyes. We cannot eat with our eyes. We cannot see with our mouth. We can only eat with our mouth. Like that. So, Srila Prabhupada explains, "An ordinary living being begets a child by sexual intercourse, and he has no other means to beget a child other than the one designed for him. But Narayana being omnipotent is not bound to any condition of energy." Supreme Lord Narayana, he is complete and independent to do anything and everything by his various potencies, very easily and perfectly. Everything the Lord does, through his energies, through his potencies, easily and perfectly. Just by his will, things happen. That's all. Nothing more. And whatever he does, he does it perfectly. Brahma is therefore directly the son of the father, and was not put into the womb of a mother, therefore Brahma is called Atma Bhuv, self-born, because he doesn't have a mother. Brahma doesn't have a mother. Doesn't enter a womb of a mother. No. This Brahma, who is thus created by Narayana, without any contact with the woman, this Brahma is in charge of further creations in the universe. Further creations in the universe. So the initial work of creation is done by Vishnu, but afterwards, after Brahma is born, Brahma does the further work of creation.

#### Brahma's Empowerment, Kshirodakashayi Vishnu, Prayers for Incarnation
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/kF-oaFcfY74?t=679
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "If Brahma were not empowered by Narayana, Brahma could not create."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Brahma's ability to create is due to the power invested in him by Narayana, describes Kshirodakashayi Vishnu and the demigods' prayers to Vishnu for relief from the burden of the earth, leading to Krishna's appearance.

And Prabhupada explains here, "secondarily reflected by the potency of the omnipotent." What is the meaning of this? That Brahma does further work of creation. Like Brahma creates the Prajapatis. Now that is also due to the potency of the Supreme Lord, which is invested in Brahma to do the further creation. If Brahma were not empowered by Narayana, Brahma could not create. If Brahma were not empowered, he could not create. Within the halo of the universe, there is a transcendental planet known as Shwetadvipa, which is the abode of the Kshirodakashaya Vishnu. This is the third Vishnu form, Kshirodakashaya Vishnu. He is residing in a planet called Shwetadvipa, in which there is a milk ocean, and in the center of the milk ocean, there is an island. On that island, the Lord resides at Kshirodakashaya Vishnu, the maintainer Vishnu of this whole universe. Whenever there is trouble in the universe that cannot be solved by the administrative demigods, they approach Brahma. And if Brahma also cannot solve their problem, then Brahma consults and prays to Kshirodakashaya Vishnu, the maintainer Vishnu. So when Kamsa and others were giving trouble, then earth became overburdened by the misdeeds of these demoniac people. So Brahma, along with the other devatas, prayed at the shore of the Kshirodaka ocean, and they were advised that the Supreme Lord himself is going to descend in his avatar as Krishna. And they also knew that Krishna would appear as the son of Vasudeva and Devaki. So therefore, some people say the Lord appeared because of the prayers of Brahmaji. Brahma prayed. It's a fact. Brahma prayed, and he got the response from the Lord within his heart that the Supreme Lord himself will personally appear in the Yadu dynasty as the son of Vasudeva and Devaki. Therefore, when Krishna appeared in the womb of Devaki, then the devatas came to pray to Krishna within the womb of Devaki. It's called Garbhasthuti prayers, Tenth canto, second chapter. Beautiful prayers are there which are offered by the demigods to Krishna in the womb of Devaki. They knew because Brahma was informed.

#### devotional service, liberation, Krishna's appearance

**Key Quote:** "Krishna has also appeared for rejuvenating the devotional service of hearing, remembering, worshipping, etc."
**Summary:** Queen Kunti's prayer is explained, focusing on Krishna's purpose of rejuvenating devotional service to liberate conditioned souls.

Bhavesmin Klishyamananam Avidyakamakarmabhihi Shravanasmaranarhani Karishyan Nithikechana. The meaning of this verse is, and yet others say that you appear to rejuvenate the devotional service of hearing, remembering, worshipping and so on in order that the conditioned souls suffering from material pangs might take advantage and gain liberation. So Krishna appears for different purposes, and He simultaneously fulfills all the purposes when He appears in an incarnation. That's the greatness of His appearance. So Queen Kunti, being a pure devotee, is very well aware that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His appearance is very, very purposeful. So in this verse she is saying that Krishna has also appeared for rejuvenating the devotional service of hearing, remembering, worshipping, etc. And why He has to revive that? Because

**Key Quote:** "Every millennium, every yuga, he appears because the materialistic way of life is such that, after Krishna revives in one particular incarnation, gradually the religious principles deteriorate in human society."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how conditioned souls are bound by karma and how Krishna incarnates in every yuga to re-establish religious principles as they deteriorate over time.

the conditioned souls, conditioned souls means all those who are under the stringent laws of karma, they are suffering from material pangs, simply because they are always engaged in some material activities and they get bound up and they suffer. So, such conditioned souls should take advantage of the process of devotional service and thereby very easily gain liberation from this material bondage. So, Krishna comes for this purpose also. So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, in the Srimad Bhagavad, sorry, in the Srimad Bhagavad Gita, the Lord asserts that he appears in every millennium just to reestablish the way of religion: Dharma samsthapana arthaya sambhavami yuge yuge. Every millennium, every yuga, he appears, because the materialistic way of life is such that, after Krishna revives in one particular incarnation, gradually the religious principles deteriorate in human society. Then again Krishna comes in another incarnation, again he rejuvenates the religious principles. Again it starts deteriorating. So, periodically Krishna incarnates for this purpose.

**Key Quote:** "The factual way of religion is to accept the Lord as a supreme authority, and thus render service unto him in spontaneous love."
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes that true religion is defined by God, specifically Krishna, and involves accepting Him as the supreme authority and rendering loving devotional service.

Dharma samsthapana arthaya. Now, Srila Prabhupada explains, "The way of religion is made by the Supreme Lord. No one can manufacture a new path of religion as is the fashion for certain ambitious persons." In modern times, sometimes people say, "Oh, I have got my own way of practicing Dharma." But that is not real Dharma. That's not religion. That's not true religion. True religion is what is given by God, what is given by Krishna. The factual way of religion is to accept the Lord as a supreme authority, and thus render service unto him in spontaneous love. This is the perfect understanding of religion: that Krishna is the Supreme Lord, Supreme Personality of Godhead, and everyone should render loving devotional service to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "A living being, any living being, cannot help but render service because he is constitutionally made for that purpose."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that all living beings are meant to render service, and if they don't serve Krishna, they become servants of illusory energy and material desires, leading to the illusion of being masters.

Now, Srila Prabhupada explains here, a living being, any living being, cannot help but render service because he is constitutionally made for that purpose. We are made for doing service eternally. That's the only function: to render service. But, we are meant to serve Krishna. If we don't serve Krishna, then we are forced to serve illusory energy, Maya. Servant we are. We cannot avoid rendering service. So, it's explained here, the only function of the living being is to render service to the Lord, to Lord Krishna. The Lord is great and living beings are subordinate to him. Everyone is subordinate to Krishna, the Supreme Lord. So, everyone's duty is simply to serve Krishna. Unfortunately, the illusioned living beings, out of misunderstanding only, become servants of the senses by material desire. We all have material desires, and these material desires dictate that we become servant of our senses. We think we are master in this material world, generally, under the influence of illusion. But, in reality, nobody is master. Krishna is the only master. Krishna is the only Lord. Krishna is the only controller.

**Key Quote:** "In such a false conception, they become servants of the senses. They simply chase their material desires. And that is never to be fulfilled."
**Summary:** The lecture discusses how material desires lead to becoming servants of the senses, chasing unfulfillable desires, and becoming entangled in nescience, with a specific mention of perverted sex life as a central point of material enjoyment.

But, others have an illusory idea that "I am controller, I am master. I am the enjoyer." And in such a false conception, they become servants of the senses. They simply chase their material desires, and that is never to be fulfilled. It is called durashaya. Durashaya, never to be satisfied, never. Though, sometimes people think, "By my hard work, I have successfully worked for satisfying some material desire of mine, and I have become successful," but that success is another facet of the illusion only. Both failure and success are illusions, because we have nothing to do with this material world. So, we become, under illusion, servant of our own senses. Now, this desire, material desire, is called avidya, nescience. Now, only because of this nescience or avidya or material desires, the living beings make different plans for material enjoyment. Material enjoyment, there are so many plans made by different living beings. This plan for material enjoyment is centered about a perverted sex life. Sex life, by itself, is not condemned in the scriptures. It's got a higher purpose: to produce Krishna conscious progeny, Krishna conscious children. But perverted sex life is simply meant for some so-called enjoyment, which actually is totally illusory.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Transmigration means, I am leaving one body and entering another body."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of transmigration, where the soul leaves one body and enters another, emphasizing that death is not the end of existence but a migration to a new body.

Therefore, a person becomes entangled in the chain of birth and death by transmigrating into different bodies. You should understand this word, transmigration. Transmigration means I am leaving one body and entering another body, while I am not aware that I have changed my body. I am existing through the changes, but I am not aware of that. That's why it's called transmigration. Migration, you understand. Just say, a person migrates from India to America. He leaves India and he goes to America, say, migrated to America. Actually, a similar thing happens when we die. Death is not the end of our existence. Death means we migrate from this body to another body, new body. But because that change happens without our knowledge, without our understanding, it's called transmigration. And actually life is continuous through the changes of the body.

**Key Quote:** "In that next body, a person thinks, I have come into existence when I was born, which is a mistake, which is an incorrect understanding."
**Summary:** The lecture continues on transmigration, highlighting the illusion of forgetting past lives and the incorrect understanding of coming into existence at birth, and emphasizing that threefold miseries persist even when changing bodies.

Just like we change body from childhood to youth to old age. Do we think that we are different person from childhood to youth when the change happens? No. I am quite aware. I am the same person. I had the body of a child. Now I have the body of a young man when I become youthful, when I go to the youthful stage. So, I don't think that I am a different person. But what happens when we quit this body at the time of death and enter another body? Mostly, in most cases, a person forgets about the previous life. That is one thing. Second thing, in that next body, a person thinks, "I have come into existence when I was born," which is a mistake, which is an incorrect understanding. So, in the chain of birth and death, by transmigrating to different bodies on different planets, this happens under the direction of the Supreme Lord. He is completely in control, the Supreme Lord. So, Srila Prabhupada explains, unless one is beyond the boundary of this nescience or ignorance or misunderstanding, misconception, one cannot get free from the threefold miseries of material life. One cannot get free. The threefold miseries will be there in material existence, even if we change bodies. Miseries are not going to vanish.

**Summary:** The lecture concludes by emphasizing the importance of devotional service (bhakti) as the path to liberation, highlighting Krishna's role in reviving religious principles and encouraging listeners to take advantage of this opportunity to return to Godhead.

So, therefore, the conclusion is that if we understand and take to devotional service, which Krishna actually every time appears in every yuga, and he revives the real religious principles in human society, Dharma Samsthava and Artha, and we should take advantage of that. Krishna is doing it for our sake. It's not for his benefit. It's for our benefit. So, those who are accepting this path of devotional service, they are very, very fortunate souls, and they can solve this problem of repetition of birth and death by practicing bhakti and becoming liberated. Ultimate liberation is possible in the bhakti. Go back to Godhead, never to return again to this miserable material world.

#### repetition of birth and death, transcendental activities, Krishna's lotus feet
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/w2np8N3hAs4?t=54

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "O Krishna, those who continuously hear, chant and repeat your transcendental activities or take pleasure in others doing so certainly see your lotus feet which alone can stop the repetition of birth and death."
**Summary:** Kunti Devi explains how hearing, chanting, and repeating Krishna's transcendental activities, or even taking pleasure in others doing so, can lead to liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

In this session we will be discussing from the 36th verse of the 8th chapter of the 1st canto of Shreemad Bhagavatam, continuing the prayers by Queen Kunti. श्रिन्वन्ति गायन्ति गृणन्ति भीक्ष्णशः स्मरन्ति नन्दन्ति तवेहितं जनाह तैयेवपश्यंति अचिरेणतावकं भवप्रवाहो परमं पदाम्बुजम. The meaning of this verse is, O Krishna, those who continuously hear, chant, and repeat your transcendental activities or take pleasure in others doing so, certainly see your lotus feet which alone can stop the repetition of birth and death. So Kunti Devi is explaining how one can end this repetition of birth and death. Of course, most people do not know that the real fundamental problem of material existence is this repetition of birth and death. It's called samsara or bhava. So this accepting this material body, while we are actually not got anything to do with matter, we are pure spirit and we have our spiritual body, we have our spiritual heart, we have our home, the abode of Krishna, Krishnaloka, but foolishly we give up that spiritual home and we desire independent enjoyment, we desire to lord over material nature and therefore we are forced to take this material body which is called birth and we cannot remain in this material body permanently, we have to quit this material body by force, that's called death and after death if we still have desire for lording over or we have desire for material enjoyment, independent enjoyment then we have to continue to accept another body and that's another birth. So jatasyahi dhruva mṛtyu dhruvam janma mṛtasyaca Krishna explains this in the Bhagavad Gita, for one who has taken his birth in this material world death is certain and after death if one is not liberated at the time of death then one has to take birth again, cannot avoid. So Kunti Devi is now telling who can actually stop this repetition of birth and death, those who continuously hear, chant, and repeat the transcendental activities of Krishna or even if they don't do it they simply take pleasure in somebody else who is doing that, such persons are able to have darshan of Krishna's lotus feet by which they are very easily able to conquer this material existence, they are able to stop the repetition of birth and death.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore even though the Lord may be present before our eyes it is not possible to see him unless we have the necessary vision."
**Summary:** Seeing Krishna requires developing spontaneous love of God and changing our conditional vision, as material qualifications are not enough to recognize the Lord.

So Sri La Pravapa explains in the purple, The Supreme Lord Sri Krishna cannot be seen by our present conditional vision, this eyes with which we normally see so many material things, it works under certain conditions, so this conditional vision is not suitable for seeing the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna, in order to see him one has to change his present vision by developing a different condition of life which is full of spontaneous love of God, spontaneous love of God, not forced to do some devotional service, spontaneously one renders service to Krishna very enthusiastically, lovingly, very nicely. When Sri Krishna was present personally on the face of the globe not everyone could see him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, when Krishna incarnates everybody can see him but they don't recognize him, they don't understand here is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they think he is another ordinary person, materialists like Ravana, Hiranyakashipu, Kamsa, Jarasandha are highly qualified personalities by acquisition of material assets but they were unable to appreciate the presence of the Lord, so somebody is materially qualified that is not enough to to recognize the Supreme Lord when he is incarnated or when he is personally present before our vision, therefore even though the Lord may be present before our eyes it is not possible to see him unless we have the necessary vision. Sometimes people ask can you show me God, even if God were to appear in front of you the question you should ask yourself before you ask the question can you show me God, can I recognize God if God comes in front of me as one does God have and does he rule God and can be first in difficult or end able and have the strength to rank the planet later it would just rather be permanent above

#### hearing from right sources, transcendental activities, dealings with Gopis

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "If hearing is from the right sources, it acts very quickly."
**Summary:** Hearing from authorized sources is crucial for spiritual advancement, and one should approach the Lord's pastimes, including those with the Gopis, with the right understanding and motivation.

service does not see the Lord face to face. The reason is that the first item shravana is very important. If hearing is from the right sources, it acts very quickly. Generally people hear from unauthorized persons. Such unauthorized persons may be very learned by academic qualifications but because they do not follow the principles of devotional service, hearing from them becomes a sheer waste of time. Hearing from unauthorized persons will not result in any spiritual advancement. Sometimes the texts are interpreted fashionably to suit their own purpose. Therefore, first one should select a competent and bonafide speaker and then hear from him. When the hearing process is perfect and complete, the other processes become automatically perfect in their own way. After hearing comes chanting and then remembering etc. There are different transcendental activities of the Lord and each and every one of them is competent bestow the desired result provided the hearing process is perfect. In the Bhagavatam the activities of the Lord begin from his dealings with the Pandavas, that's the first canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam. There are many other pastimes of the Lord in connection with his dealings with the asuras and others and in the tenth canto the sublime dealings with his conjugal associates the Gopis as well as his married wives at Dwaraka are mentioned. Since the Lord is absolute there is no difference in the transcendental nature of each and every dealing of the Lord whether the description in the first canto is about the Lord's dealings with the Pandavas or in some other canto about the Lord's dealings with some other asuras or it is the dealing of the Lord with his most beloved devotees the Gopis or his beloved Queens at Dwaraka all are transcendental. But sometimes people in an unauthorized hearing process take more interest in hearing about his dealings with the Gopis, such an inclination indicates the lusty feelings of the hearer so a bona fide speaker of the dealings of the Lord never indulges in such hearings, one must hear about the Lord from the very beginning as in the Srimad Bhagavatam or any other scripture.

#### Krishna's transcendental nature, spiritual life, troublesome material life

**Key Quote:** "We must always remember that the Lord is always transcendental to any mundane attachment."
**Summary:** Krishna is transcendental to any material attachment, and hearing about Him and His devotees is conducive to spiritual life, offering relief from the troubles of material existence.

and that will help the hearer attain perfection by progressive development, one should not therefore consider that his dealings, that means Krishna's dealings with the Pandavas are less important than his dealings with the Gopis, we must always remember that the Lord is always transcendental to any mundane attachment, Krishna doesn't have any attachment, any material attachment at all. In all the above mentioned dealings of the Lord he is the hero in all circumstances and hearing about him or about his devotees or combatants is conducive to spiritual life. It is said that the Vedas and Puranas etc are all made to revive our lost relation with him, hearing of all these scriptures, essential, it's absolutely essential. In the previous verses Kunti Devi has explained that those who have come to this material world are working very hard like asses and have such a hard burden that they cannot bear it because the lusty desires have created heavy work that puts them always in trouble, Krishna comes to introduce the system by which one can get relief from this continuously troublesome life, material life means troublesome heavy work that's

the essence of material line. Now as regards what is Pushpa Roshani Gratia? Religion consists of the laws of God. People who do not know this think that religion means faith, but although you may have faith in something, and I may have faith in something, and although I may believe you, and you may or may not believe me, that is not religion. There is even a supposedly religious mission that says, you can manufacture your own way, whatever you think is right, that is right. This is their philosophy, wrong philosophy, bogus philosophy, but that is not science. Supposing I am a madman, is it all right? Is it all right to think, whatever I think is correct? Is it all right to think like that? How could this be? 2 plus 2 equals 4 is science. If I believe that 2 plus 2 equals 5 or 3, does it become true? No, never. So, there are laws of God, and when there is dharma, asya glani, deviation from these laws, we suffer. So, Krishna comes to correct these mistakes, and he shows us the way of devotional service. And if we follow that, very easily, we can cross over this most difficult material existence.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Only Krishna can protect us."
**Summary:** This segment explains that Kunti Devi's prayer highlights the pure devotee's complete dependence on Krishna for protection, contrasting this with the non-devotee's reliance on temporary and ultimately insufficient shelters.

The meaning of this verse is, O my Lord, you have executed all duties yourself. Are you leaving us? Today, though we are completely dependent on your mercy and have no one else to protect us, now when all kings are at enmity with us. This verse, spoken by Kunti Devi in a prayer to Krishna, is clearly indicating the position of a pure devotee like Kunti Devi on the Supreme Lord Krishna. In a sense, what is Kunti Devi telling? My dear Lord Krishna, we are dependent on you. We are totally dependent on your mercy. We have no one else for protecting us. Only you are our protector. This is the factual position of everyone, not only Kunti Devi, but pure devotees know this, recognize this, and always take shelter of Krishna. The non-devotees, they try to take shelter of so many other so-called shelters, but they are not. But nobody else can protect us, the living beings, except Krishna.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "What is the material disease? To be independent of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker defines the material disease as the desire to be independent of Krishna, emphasizing that our natural constitutional position is one of dependence on Him, which paradoxically leads to true independence from other material influences.

Only Krishna can protect us, because non-devotee means somebody who is in a very unsafe position, under the clutches of the illusory energy. It is not at all safe. It is not at all secure. It is not at all the best shelter. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport to this verse, "The Pandavas are most fortunate because with all good luck, they were entirely dependent on the mercy of the Lord." In the material world, to be dependent on the mercy of someone else is the utmost sign of misfortune. See, in the material world, people want to be independent. That's the material disease. What is the material disease? To be independent of Krishna, because our constitutional position is dependence on Krishna. And by becoming dependent on Krishna, not by becoming, by remaining dependent on Krishna, we are completely independent of all other persons, all other so-called sources of protection. But in the case of our transcendental relation with the Lord, it is the most fortunate case where we can live completely dependent on Krishna. The material disease is due to thinking of becoming independent of everything.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, General public
**Key Quote:** "But a cruel material nature does not allow us to become independent."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the futility of trying to become independent of the laws of nature through material advancement, using the example of Ravana's attempt to build a staircase to heaven as an illustration of this misguided endeavor.

This is the material disease. I want to be independent. But a cruel material nature does not allow us to become independent. The false attempt to become independent of the stringent laws of nature is known as material knowledge. Material advancement means we go on trying to secure ourselves whenever we face some danger, and what is the nature of material existence? Danger in every step, padam padam yad vipadam, that is material existence. And only a foolish man will think that I can secure myself independently. You cannot. Material nature is going to completely smash all our so-called arrangements. The whole material world is moving on this false attempt at becoming independent of the laws of nature, beginning from Ravana. Ravana lived millions and millions of years back in some Dretayuga, former age. This Ravana, he wanted to prepare a direct staircase to the plants of heaven and transport people against the laws of God. What are the laws of God? That anybody wants to elevate themselves, like we've energized, performing pious activities and qualify themselves to go there. Impious persons cannot force themselves or somehow go there. It's not possible. So Ravana thought, why should people perform pious activities? I will make a staircase to heaven from the earth and anybody wants to go, even without performing any austerity, they can go. I will give them the access. This is what Ravana thought.

**Key Quote:** "The highest goal of human civilization is to work hard under the guidance of the supreme lord Krishna and become completely dependent on him."
**Summary:** The speaker asserts that the highest achievement is to work diligently while remaining completely dependent on Krishna, citing the Pandavas as an example of this ideal, teaching others that complete dependence on Krishna ensures safety and security.

But that is never to happen. So Srila Prabhupada says, beginning from Ravana down to the present age, they are trying to overcome the laws of nature. They are trying now to approach distant planetary systems by electronic mechanical power, just like they're trying to go to the moon, but they cannot force themselves the way they are attempting. The highest goal of human civilization is to work hard under the guidance of the Supreme Lord Krishna and become completely dependent on him. The highest achievement of perfect civilization is to work with valor, but at the same time depend completely on the Supreme Lord Krishna. This is the best achievement. The Pandavas were the ideal existence of this standard of civilization because they're pure devotees and they rule the whole world teaching people this principle. What are the principle the Pandavas were teaching? Completely depend on the Supreme Lord Krishna and you are safe, you're secure, that is the way to

make spiritual progress and go back to Godhead. That is the way. Undoubtedly, the Pandavas were completely dependent on the goodwill of Lord Sri Krishna, but they were not idle parasites of the Lord. This is a very important point. Pandavas are dependent on the goodwill of the Supreme Lord Krishna, does not mean that Krishna will do everything, I don't have to do anything. No, they are not idle parasites. They were all highly qualified both by personal character and their physical activities. They were, in terms of character, they had the best character as is very evident in the dealings of the Pandavas with everyone else, and they were also active physically also, not sitting back lazily and telling Krishna we'll do it. Still, they always look for the mercy of the Lord because they knew that every living being is dependent by constitutional position, the way we are made, the way we are.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "The perfection of life is therefore to become dependent on the will of the Lord instead of becoming falsely independent in the material world"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the pursuit of false independence in the material world is an illusion, and true protection comes from becoming 'sanatha' - dependent on the will of the Lord, shielding us from the unfavorable conditions of material existence.

We depend completely on the Supreme God. The perfection of life is therefore to become dependent on the will of the Lord instead of becoming falsely independent. In the material world, somebody may say, I am an independent person in the material world, but that person is speaking in ignorance, under illusions. Somebody may think everything is fine with me now. That is because after the previous misery that somebody has experienced, then they get some relief from that misery, they think everything is fine, but very soon another misery is going to affect them. Miseries come one after another, one after another, one after another. There is some relief period between two miseries and that period people wrongly think, because right now, I've got some relief, some misery I was suffering, therefore I think everything is fine. I have become so habituated to suffering in this world that when I get relief, I think it's very nice. Those who try to become falsely independent of the Lord are called anatha or without any guardian, anatha. Whereas those who are completely dependent on the will of the Lord are called sanatha or those having someone to protect them. Therefore, we must try to be sanatha so that we can always be protected from the

**Summary:** This segment discusses how the deluding power of maya makes us forget the undesirable nature of material existence, emphasizing that only after many births does a fortunate person realize Krishna is everything and surrender to Him, becoming a Mahatma like the Pandavas.

unfavorable condition of material existence. As long as we are here, in the material world, we need protection against the onslaught of maya, and how is that protection to be achieved? By becoming dependent on Krishna through devotional service. By the deluding power of the external material nature, we forget that material condition of life is the most undesirable perplexity. That's the power of maya. As I said, when there is some relief from some suffering, we think under the influence of illusion, I am very safe. I am protected or I am fine. I don't require any protection. That's what I think. The Bhagavad Gita, 7th chapter, 19th verse, therefore, directs us that after many, many births, one fortunate person becomes aware of the fact that Vasudeva or Krishna is all in all and that the best way of leading one's life is to surrender unto him completely. bahunam janmanamante jnanavan mam prapadyate. Jnanavan means one person got mature knowledge, fully enlightened by properly maturing in transcendental knowledge. Such a person is actually a Mahatma. Mahatma means a pure devotee. All the members of the Pandava family were Mahatmas in household life. They were not renunciates. They were not living in a secluded place doing some meditation or tapasya. They were householders.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The scriptures are teaching us that we should depend upon the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by reiterating that the scriptures teach dependence on the Supreme Lord, exemplified by the Pandavas' relationship with Krishna, and highlighting Kunti's prayer expressing their complete reliance on Him.

They had responsible duties as Kshatriyas. Maharaj Yudhishthira was the head of these Mahatmas, as Pandavas, and Queen Kunti Devi was the mother. The lessons of the Bhagavad Gita and all the Puranas, specifically the Bhagavata Puranas or Srimad Bhagavatam, are therefore inevitably connected with the history of the Pandava Mahatmas. The scriptures are teaching us that we should depend upon the Supreme Lord. That's what the scriptures are teaching us, and that is best illustrated by this description of the Pandavas' dependence on Krishna. For the Pandavas, separately, they were dependent on Krishna. For the Pandavas, separation from the Lord was just like separation of the fish from water. The fish cannot live outside of water. Similarly, devotees cannot live outside of the protection of Krishna. So Queen Kunti is pursuing the Lord, please stay with us. Don't go home, because we are totally dependent on you. So I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "We should know that every moment I should be dependent on Krishna's mercy only."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of dependence on Krishna, urging listeners to be constantly Krishna conscious and avoid complacency.

This is yet another prayer offered by Queen Kunti to Krishna, that the devotees are very well aware that their existence is totally dependent on Krishna, and only because of Krishna's mercy, they are able to perform their duties. They are able to perform activities in a nice way. And the example is being given, when the spirit soul leaves the body, the body is a useless piece of dead matter. But as long as the spirit is there, the body is having so many nice life symptoms. Actually, the body is always matter, dead matter. But the presence of the spirit makes it appear to be having life. And the absence of the spirit means immediately the body starts decomposing. It cannot be sustained anymore. So in the Purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, "The body is quite aware that the existence of the Pandavas is due to Shri Krishna only." This point has to be very, very nicely understood. And only then we become very serious in Krishna consciousness and not be complacent in our practice. In this material world, while we are still here, we should not be complacent. We should know that every moment I should be dependent on Krishna's mercy only.

And for that, I have to be Krishna conscious always, not sometimes, always. The Pandavas are undoubtedly well established in name and fame and are guided by a great king, Yudhishthira, whose morality personified. He is called Dharma because he is morality personified. And the Yadus are undoubtedly great allies of the Pandavas. But without the guidance of Lord Krishna, all of them are non-entities.

There is a background consciousness. No one should be proud of his prestige, power and fame, without being guided by the favor of the Supreme Lord. He will be always conscious of this favor of the Supreme Lord upon each one of us, under all circumstances.

We may therefore invent by our advancement of material knowledge all sorts of counteracting material resources, but without being guided by the Lord. All such inventions end in fiasco, however strong and stout the reactionary elements may be, just like we sometimes hear, oh, this building is earthquake proof.

As soon as an important man dies his name and form become unimportant even though he may have been a big scientist, a politician or a philosopher. We have experience of this.

See the fact is everybody considers the body as the self as the person body is not the person but they only can identify in terms of the body what happens to this body after the person the life is gone the body is gone out of the body the spirit soul is left the body then this body is just a lump of matter when an important man is alive he may have so many guards and no one can go before him or touch him but when the same man is dead and lying on the floor one may kick him in the face and practically no one will care a dead man a dead body who cares for showing some respect or protecting or guarding or showing some honor nobody cares this is

energies all his energies so example is given by Srila Prabhupada the sun for example is energetic and the sunshine is energy as long as the sunshine is present the sun is present and if the sun were not present the Sun's energy would also not be there just like at night the Sun is not in the sky so there's no sunshine sunshine can never exist without the Sun Sun can never be without the sunshine so this is the kind of interrelationship the energy and energetic must both exist although the Mayavadi philosophers do not accept the energetic but only the in-person energy we must accept both the energy and the energetic this is the special thing about Krishna conscious philosophy that Krishna is the energetic source of all energies and all energies belong to Krishna and Krishna can never be without his energy and energy cannot exist independently without Krishna so therefore the devotees always know energy is there means Krishna and Krishna is there means energies are automatically there always there so this understanding will help us actually become Krishna conscious I'll stop here

**Key Quote:** "In the modern civilization, people think industries are generating many jobs, increasing the wealth of the nation, increasing the GDP and giving so many nice gadgets and facilities and machines for peoples. But actually, there is the negative side of this industrial development."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Queen Kunti's prayers to Krishna for prosperity and contrasts it with the speaker's view on modern industrial development and its negative consequences.

In this session, we will be discussing from the fortieth verse of the eighth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, continuing the prayers by Queen Kunti, Ime Janapada Sriddha Supak Kau Shadhi Veerudhaha Vanadrinad Yudanvanto Hedante Tava Bhikshitaihi. The meaning of this verse is all these cities and villages are flourishing in all respects because the herbs and grains are in abundance. The trees are full of fruits, the rivers are flowing, the hills are full of minerals, and the oceans full of wealth. And this is all due to your glancing over them. Kunti is offering prayers to Krishna because of Krishna's glance, there is prosperity, abundance of everything. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "Even prosperity flourishes by natural gifts and not by gigantic industrial enterprises." In the modern civilization, people think industries are generating many jobs, increasing the wealth of the nation, increasing the GDP and giving so many nice gadgets and facilities and machines for people. But actually, there is the negative side of this industrial development. So many problems due to these industries, which are not generally highlighted or discussed by the industrialists themselves, just like the waste generated, the pollution. So, there is a negative side of this industrial development.

**Key Quote:** "The more we attempt to exploit material nature according to our whims of enjoyment, the more we shall become entrapped by the reaction of such exploitative attempts."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the dangers of exploiting material nature and emphasizes the importance of accepting nature's gifts with God consciousness.

But actually, there is the negative side of this industrial development. The dependence on artificial way of living, all this has actually led to destroying the finer sentiments of our human being. So, Srila Prabhupada explains some of these things in the purport. 1. Industrial enterprises are products of a godless civilization and they cause the destruction of the noble aims of human life. This is what Prabhupada is explaining, they cause the destruction of the noble aims of human life. The more we go on increasing such troublesome industries to squeeze out the vital energy of the human being, the more there will be unrest and dissatisfaction of the people in general. Although if you only can live lavishly by exploitation, not everybody actually is prosperous because of the industries. It's only a few people who are becoming very, very rich and they ensure that they have all the best facilities for their stay, for their family members, for their comfortable living, etc., but they end up exploiting the poor people. The natural gifts such as grains and vegetables, fruits, rivers, the hills of jewels and minerals, and the seas full of pearls are supplied by the order of the Supreme as He desires. Material nature produces them in abundance or restrict them at times according to the desire of the Supreme Lord. The natural law is that the human being may take advantage of these godly gifts by nature and satisfactorily flourish on them without being captivated by the exploitative mentality of lording it over material nature. The industrial enterprises are basically exploitation due to the tendency of lording, but accepting the gifts of nature. The gifts of nature given by Krishna, the Supreme Lord, who is actually the one who is directing material nature, so then we may accept them and live very nicely without destroying the noble aim of life that is God consciousness, God realization. The more we attempt to exploit material nature according to our whims of enjoyment, the more we shall become entrapped by the reaction of such exploitative attempts. Material nature is entangling if we try to exploit.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the sufficiency of natural gifts and criticizes industrial exploitation, advocating for devotional service and obedience to the laws of the Lord.

We should always remember that. If we have sufficient grains, fruits, vegetables, herbs, then we will be entrapped by the reaction of such exploitative attempts. Material nature is entangling if we try to exploit. We should always remember that. If we have sufficient grains, fruits, vegetables, herbs, then we will be entrapped by the reaction of such exploitative attempts. The more we attempt to exploit material nature, the more we shall become entangled by the Patrol of Elemental Nature and causal action. That was the ultimate goal of my research and you can understand that by fully understand what annicas involved in their independent consumption of Entropical anywhere is not only their contribution to life but also into their survival. Contraindyst himself this is the very individual act they commit to each device, anything and not kill an animal if he has sufficient grains and vegetables to eat. This is a fact. The flow of river waters fertilizes the fields and there is more than what we need. Minerals are produced in the hills and the jewels in the ocean. If the human civilization has sufficient grains, minerals, jewels, water, milk etc., then why should we hanker after terrible industrial enterprises at the cost of the labor of some unfortunate men? See, industries always exploit poor people. The labor class of people are exploited. But all these natural gifts are dependent on the mercy of the Lord. What we need therefore is to be obedient to the laws of the Lord and achieve perfection of human life by

The indications of Kunti Devi are just to the poor. Lord Krishna as was described by Guruji in from the point. She desires that God's mercy be bestowed upon them so that natural prosperity will be maintained by His grace. So, by Krishna's mercy there will be prosperity because Krishna is directing material nature. Further Srila Prabhupada explains Kunti Devi mentions that the grains are abundant, the trees are full of fruits, the rivers flowing nicely, the hills of minerals, hills are full of minerals and the oceans are full of wealth.

developments. They never existed in the Vedic culture, Vedic civilization never existed. If we depend on God's creation there will be no scarcity but simply ananda or bliss. God's creation provides sufficient grains and grass while we eat. The grains and fruits, the animals like the cows will eat the grass. The bulls will help produce grains and they will take only a little being satisfied with what we throw away. If we take fruit and throw away the skin the animal will be satisfied with the skin. If anybody has got a Goshala then they have experienced that we take the vegetable and peel, we give it away to the animals. We take the fruit and the peel, we give it to the animals and they are happy and they are satisfied and they are nourished by those peels. In this way with Krishna in the center there can be full cooperation between the trees, animals, human beings and all living entities. This is Vedic civilization, a civilization of Krishna consciousness. Very important to note, Vedic civilization is a civilization of Krishna consciousness. Simply by cooperation between all the varieties of living beings there is plenty for everyone. There is prosperity the whole world. Kunti Devi prays to the Lord this prosperity is due to your glance she is telling Krishna. So, Prabhupada says when we sit in the temple of Krishna, Krishna glances over us and everything is nice. When sincere souls try to become Krishna's devotees, Krishna very kindly comes before them in his full opulence and glances upon them and they become happy and beautiful. So, whenever you visit the temple of Krishna, just sit in front of Krishna and let his merciful glance fall on you. Then there will be plenty, there will be prosperity, there will be no scarcity.

#### Krishna's glance, creation, material nature
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/KLL0oh07pmA?t=736
**Verse References:** BG 9.10
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Simply by Krishna's glance, matter becomes agitated. And then becomes pregnant and gives birth to the living entities."
**Summary:** This segment explains how Krishna's glance is responsible for the creation of the material world and the birth of all living entities, referencing scriptures to support this point.

This is a fact, cent percent fact. Similarly, the whole material creation is due to Krishna. It is due to Krishna's glance. This is what the scriptures tell us, sa aikshata, this is the statement in the Upanishads. Sa aikshata sa asrujata, this is the statement of the Upanishads. In the Vedas, it is said that he glanced over matter thus agitating it. And there was a creation, the whole creation took place. Simply by Krishna's glance, matter becomes agitated. And then becomes pregnant and gives birth to the living entities. Krishna injects the living entities into the womb of material nature. tasmin garbham dadamyaham, Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita. It is simply by Krishna's glance that plants, trees, animals and all of the living entities come forth. How is this possible? None of us can say simply by glancing over my wife, I can make her pregnant. Not possible for us. Although this is impossible for us, it is not impossible for Krishna. The Brahma Samhita says, angani yasya sakalendriya vritti manti. What does this mean? It means every part of Krishna's body has all the capabilities of all the other parts of his body. With our eyes, we can only see. But Krishna merely by seeing can make others pregnant. There is no need of sex. For simply by glancing, Krishna can create pregnancy. In Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says in the 9th chapter, 10th verse, maya dhyakshena prakriti hi suyatesu characharam. By my supervision, material nature gives birth to all moving and non-moving living beings. The word aksha means ice. So akshena indicates that all living entities take birth because of the Lord's glance.

No. So therefore, simply by Krishna's grace. If we become devotees, if we become Krishna conscious, there will be no scarcity, we will have plenty and we will be having prosperity. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 43rd verse of the 8th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, which is Queen Kunti's prayer to Krishna, and explains the meaning of the verse, highlighting Krishna's various attributes and roles.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 43rd verse of the 8th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is the last prayer by Queen Kunti in this chapter. Shri Krishna Krishna Sakha Vrishni Rishabhava Nidrup Rajanya Vamsha Dahanana Pavarga Virya Govinda Godvija Surarthi Haravatara Yogeshwara Kila Guru Bhagavan Namaste. Kunti Devi is addressing Krishna in different ways in this prayer. The meaning of this verse is, O Krishna, O friend of Arjuna, O chief among the descendants of Vrishni, You are the destroyer of those political parties which are disturbing elements on this earth. Your prowess never deteriorates, you are the proprietor of the transcendental abode, and you descend to relieve the distress of the cows, the brahmanas, and the devotees. You possess all mystic powers and you are the preceptor of the entire universe.

**Key Quote:** "Actually the kings are meant to rule over the citizens exactly as the representative of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the verse, discussing Krishna's transcendental abode, his pastimes, his role in maintaining the universe, and the responsibility of kings to act as representatives of Krishna.

You are the Almighty God and I offer you my respectful obeisances. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, a summary of the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna is made herein by Srimati Kunti Devi. Kunti Devi knows very well Krishna is not just a relative, not just an ordinary person, not just another powerful Kshatriya, but Krishna is the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Personality of God. And he has multiple relationships with his devotees. Accordingly, he is addressed here in different ways. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, the Almighty Lord has his eternal transcendental abode where he is engaged in keeping Surabhi cows in the Goloka Brindavana. Krishna is always engaged in pastimes with his devotees, especially the cowherd boys, the cows, the gopis, like that. Krishna is served by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune in Goloka Brindavana. He descends on the material world to reclaim his devotees. He is the one who has the power to annihilate the disturbing elements in groups of political parties and kings who are supposed to be in charge of administration work. Actually the kings are meant to rule over the citizens exactly as the representative of Krishna, because in reality it is Krishna who maintains everyone. Eko bahunam yo viddhati kama. But if the king does not conduct himself as the representative of Krishna, then he is not fit to be the ruler of the people in general. Then Krishna either incarnates to destroy such rulers, or he empowers his devotees to actually end the rule of such a king. So, this is a very important point.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna creates, maintains and annihilates by his unlimited energies."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain Krishna's energies and how he works through them, emphasizing that Krishna is always full of prowess. He also highlights the importance of cows, brahmanas, and devotees for the general welfare of all living beings.

There are so many non-devotional elements. So, Srila Prabhupada further explains, Krishna creates, maintains, and annihilates by his unlimited energies. The shastras say that Krishna has nothing to do personally, but that doesn't mean he is inactive. He works through his energies, he acts through his energies, and his energies are simply following his will. Exactly according to his will the different energies will work and they will carry out Krishna's instructions or Krishna's desires. Even though Krishna creates, maintains, and annihilates, still he is always full with prowess and does not deteriorate in potency. In the material world we have experienced when we expand our energy, unless we renew, we feel exhausted, whereas Krishna, he employs his energies for so many different activities, but his energy never reduces. He is always full of all energies. Further Srila Prabhupada says the cows, the brahmanas, and the devotees of the Lord are all objects of special attention. Cows, brahmanas, and devotees. Krishna particularly is interested in the welfare of the cows and the brahmanas and devotees. Now all these cows, brahmanas, and Vaishnavas are object of special attention because they are very important factors for the general welfare of all

**Summary:** The speaker analyzes Kunti Devi's different forms of address to Lord Krishna in her prayer, focusing on the term 'Krishna Sakha' and explaining how addressing Krishna in relation to his intimate devotees is pleasing to him.

living beings. Now, different forms of address of Kunti Devi in this last prayer. Kunti addresses Lord Krishna as Krishna Sakha. Why? Because she knows although Arjuna is her own son, but Lord Krishna is more intimately related with Arjuna than with her. This is a fact. So, Kunti wants to please Krishna by addressing him in his relationship with Arjuna. So, Kunti wants to please Krishna by addressing him in his relationship with his intimate devotees. That is another secret we have to learn from the Srimad Bhagavatam, from the Acharyas, from pure devotees, that they know how to please Krishna. The very way of addressing Krishna by making a reference to his intimate relation with his pure devotees, that is very, very pleasing to Krishna. Just like Krishna is addressed as Devaki Nandana, Yashodha Nandana, Nanda Nandana. These are all ways of addressing Krishna, indicating thereby that Krishna has an intimate relationship with his devotees.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna specially saved Draupadi and just Draupadi had to call out Krishna's name Govinda please say me that's all Krishna immediately responded"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Krishna's relationship with Draupadi, his appearance in the Vrishni dynasty, and his role in relieving the earth's burden by destroying demoniac kings.

Now, the term Krishna also refers to Draupadi also. So, Krishna Saka also indicates Krishna's relationship with Draupadi. Draupadi was saved from being insulted when Duryodhana and Karna attempted to strip her naked. Krishna specially saved Draupadi, and just Draupadi had to call out Krishna's name, Govinda please save me, that's all. Krishna immediately responded. So even Draupadi is a very special devotee of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Kunti also addresses Lord Krishna as Vrishni Rishabha, the chief of the Vrishni dynasty or the best of the descendants among Vrishni. It is because Krishna appeared in this Vrishni dynasty that this dynasty became famous. Kunti already has mentioned just as Malaysia and the Malaya hills became famous because of the sandalwood that grows there. Sandalwood can grow anywhere, but since it happens to be growing in Malaya, so therefore the Vrishni dynasty also became famous after Krishna appeared in the Vrishni dynasty as the son of Vasudeva. Kunti Devi also addresses Lord Krishna as they destroy the political parties or royal dynasties that disturb the earth. Earth is simply overburdened by demoniac kings, by those who exploit the innocent citizens. The earth is overburdened, whereas when the earth's burden is relieved, when Krishna appears or when one of incarnations of Krishna appear in this world, then the earth

**Key Quote:** "King is meant to be the representative of God"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the role of a king as the representative of God, emphasizing Krishna's supremacy and the importance of devotional service for understanding God, contrasting it with the impersonal conception.

feels relief. Now generally in the monarchy system the king is honored very, very gorgeously. Why? King is meant to be the representative of God. So king should not be treated as an ordinary person, particularly when the king is a devotee of Krishna. So in Sanskrit king is also called Naradeva, which means God in human form. So his duty, the king's duty, is same as Krishna's duty, that just like God maintains all living beings, same way the king is a supreme citizen in this state and is responsible for the welfare of all the citizens of this state. So Prabhupada makes this point, Krishna is not impersonal, Krishna is the supreme person, but each one of us we are limited, Krishna is unlimited. This difference always exists between us and Krishna. Then our individual persons is such that we have limited knowledge, we are limited opulences, but Krishna has unlimited forms or opulences or knowledge. Krishna is unlimited. So we can never compare ourselves with Krishna, but at the same time we can understand we are very, very tiny and we do possess some of the qualities which Krishna has got. So therefore the understanding of God is possible only if we engage in pure devotional service. Now in the impersonal conception we are not able to understand exactly who or what is God. They simply deny different attributes of God without realizing that God cannot be understood simply by reading some books or simply by hearing some descriptions. We have to hear from the right source, we have to read the right books written by a devotee.

So now Suta Goswami is explaining what happened after Kunti offered her prayers to Krishna, who was leaving Hastinapura in order to go back to Dwaraka. So Suta Vacha Prathayetham Kalapadai. Prathayetham Kalapadai. Parinoota khilodayah mandam jahasa vaikuntho mohayanivamayayah. The meaning of this verse is, Suta Goswami said, "The Lord, thus hearing the prayers of Kunti Devi composed in choice words for his glorification, mildly smiled. That smile was as enchanting as his mystic smile." He said, "The Lord, thus hearing the prayers of Kunti Devi composed in choice words for his glimpsing power."

So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "Anything that is enchanting in the world is said to be a representation of the Lord." Ultimately, Krishna is always the source of everything, in this world, in the spiritual world, everywhere. He is the ultimate source. Janmad yasiya taha. He is the ultimate source. Aham sarvasya prabhavo. So, anything enchanting is a representation of Krishna. Now, the conditioned souls, that means the living entities in this world who are trapped in the illusory energy, they are enchanted by Krishna's mystic powers.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the enchantment of devotees with that of conditioned souls, emphasizing Krishna's pleasure with sincere prayers, even if imperfect.

But the devotees of Krishna, the pure devotees, are also enchanted in a different way by the glories of Krishna. And for the devotees, Krishna always bestows his blessings. So, Sri La Pravupada says, just like Krishna has many energies which work differently. So, Kunti Devi prayed to the Lord just to enunciate a fragment of his glories. The Lord's glories are unlimited, because he is an unlimited personality. He is the unlimited personality. Everybody else is limited. Only Krishna is unlimited. Now, devotees, when they glorify the Lord, they glorify him with chosen words, Kalapadaihi. And therefore, the Lord is known as Uttama Shloka. The best of poetry is composed to describe the Supreme Lord. Uttama Shloka. Now, Sri La Pravupada says one important point here, that any amount of chosen words is not sufficient to enumerate the Lord's glory. Yet, the Supreme Lord is satisfied by the prayers offered by different pure devotees, because the prayers are offered by his...

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is pleased with that."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a father pleased by a child's broken language to illustrate Krishna's acceptance of sincere prayers, and introduces the concept of Maya as both illusion and mercy.

beloved devotees, he accepts them. Prabhupada gives an example, just like a father is satisfied even by the broken linguistic attempts of the growing child. This is a common experience for us that when a child speaks in the beginning in a broken language, it is very pleasing to the father. So similarly, even a beginner in Krishna consciousness offers sincere prayers to Krishna, Krishna is pleased with that. But Krishna's devotees who know Krishna, they always offer wonderful prayers which are composed by chosen words. Here in this verse, the word maya has been used. Maya has got two different meanings. One meaning of the word maya is delusion or illusion. And another meaning of the word maya is mercy. Now in this verse, the word maya has been used by Sita Goswami in the sense of mercy. It is the Lord's mercy upon Kunti Devi, who offered wonderful prayers,

**Key Quote:** "If Krishna is pleased and even smiles a little, then the whole universe will be pleased."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's mercy and the idea that pleasing Krishna leads to universal satisfaction, as the universe is part and parcel of Him.

that Kunti Devi was able to please the Lord by offering him wonderful prayers. So it's the mercy of the Lord that he accepted those prayers, and in return, he mildly smiled at Kunti Devi, indicating acceptance of the prayers, wonderfully offered by Kunti Devi. So Srila Prabhupada says, if Krishna is pleased and even smiles a little, then the whole universe will be pleased. See, Kunti Devi has pleased the Lord by prayers, and Krishna is pleased by Kunti Devi's prayers, then Krishna is pleased means the whole universe is pleased. Tasmanti trade jag. If Krishna is pleased or satisfied, then the whole universe will be satisfied. Why? Because the whole universe is a part and parcel of Krishna only. But why not? Only then will we become liberation, reciprocatedband using many forms and microphones.

#### Analogy of the body, Centrality of Krishna, Root of manifestation

**Key Quote:** "Similarly, till Krishna is pleased. You cannot make the whole world happy. Not possible."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of satisfying hunger to illustrate the importance of pleasing Krishna, the speaker emphasizes Krishna's central role in creation.

Krishna will be satisfied if we do so. Just like it is given elsewhere in the Bhagavatam, prāṇopahārācchayathendriyāṇo, just like the parts of the body, they are working. Just like when there is food in the stomach, then the hunger is mitigated and one feels satisfaction. So, Srila Prabhupāda gives an example here. Even though we have various senses, which can be satisfied in different ways by sense gratification, if a person is hungry, then the sense gratification will not work till the hunger is mitigated. Similarly, till Krishna is pleased, you cannot make the whole world happy. Not possible. Now we should always remember Krishna is the central point of this entire creation. And Krishna is also like the root of this manifestation. Lord Krishna is the root of this manifestation. So, just like you water a tree by pouring water at the root of the tree, similarly, by satisfying Krishna, you can satisfy all the others.

#### Krishna as the source, Material and spiritual creation, Maya as forgetfulness

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So, when you forget Krishna, that is maya."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna is the source of both material and spiritual creation, and defines Maya as the forgetfulness of Krishna.

Krishna declares in the Bhagavad Gita, "I am the source of everything." So, Krishna being the source, when we please Krishna or satisfy Krishna or make an offering to Krishna, then everyone becomes satisfied. Now, Srila Prabhupada further explains that the material creation of Krishna is the source of everything. The material creation and the spiritual creation are both creations of Krishna, but they are existing side by side. Even though they are existing side by side, the material creation is another part of the spiritual creation. Just like the cloud in the sky is a creation of the sunshine. Sunshine is not created by the cloud, but the cloud is created by the sunshine. So, when the cloud is created by the sunshine, it covers the very sunshine, which was the cause of its creation. But actually, can the cloud cover the sun or sunshine? Not possible. So, the cloud, when it covers, it covers our vision. It covers our vision. Similarly, maya means absence of Krishna consciousness. So, when you forget Krishna, that is maya, and that is a condition of all the living beings in the world. And that is a condition of all the living beings in the world. And that is a condition of all the living beings in the world. And that is a condition of all the living beings in this world who are taken birth by force of karma. They are forgetful of Krishna.

#### Krishna's all-pervasiveness, Overcoming Maya, Offering prayers with feeling, Following devotees

**Key Quote:** "So, when we come to Krishna consciousness, then there is no more maya."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Krishna's presence in every atom and heart, and how Krishna consciousness helps overcome Maya, emphasizing the importance of offering prayers with feeling and following the example of great devotees like Kunti.

Therefore, they are in maya. In this material world, Krishna is all-pervading. He has entered into every atom. He has entered into everybody's heart. Why are we unable to see Krishna who sits in our heart? Because we have been covered by the illusion of maya. That is the only reason. So, when we come to Krishna consciousness, then there is no more maya. No more maya. Now, Srila Prabhupada says another important point. Offering prayers to Supreme Lord means offering prayers with feelings. We are persons. Krishna is the Supreme Person. So, there is an exchange between the devotee and the Lord. What is that exchange? That exchange is that we offer a praise to Krishna feelingly. So Srila Prabhupada is telling us that Krishna is Uttama shloka, glorified by the choicest poetry, but all these poems or all these songs and all these creations are actually full of meaning, full of meaning and very beautifully composed, and many many prayers are there because Krishna has so many devotees and they offer wonderful prayers. So we should learn these prayers and following the footsteps of great devotees like Kunti, we should offer such prayers to Krishna that will be pleasing to Krishna.

So this verse describes the Lord's departure from Hastinapura to Dwaraka after Yudhishthira had been installed as the emperor of the world after the battle of Kurukshetra. He accepted the prayers of Srimati Kunti Devi, and he is now preparing to leave, but he was stopped by Yudhishthira, and it is explained by Srila Prabhupada what was the kind of interaction between King Yudhishthira and Krishna. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "No one could make Lord Krishna stay at Hastinapura when he decided to start for Dwaraka, but the simple request of King Yudhishthira that the Lord remain there for a few days more was immediately effective. This signifies that the power of King Yudhishthira was loving affection, which the Lord could not deny. The Almighty God is thus conquered only by loving service and nothing else."

**Key Quote:** "Formerly the whole planet was known as Bharatvarsha."
**Summary:** This segment explains the historical significance of Hastinapura, the prevalence of Vedic culture, and the concept of Bharatvarsha encompassing the entire planet.

He is fully independent in all his dealings, but he voluntarily accepts obligations by the loving affection of his pure devotees. So Srila Prabhupada explains in another place the significance of the word Gajasa Hwayam that is used in these words. The capital of the world empire was called in those days Hastinapura or Gajasa Hwaya. Gaja means elephant. Hasti also means elephant. Formally the kings used to keep many, many horses and elephants. And in those days, there was only one king ruling the entire world, and the capital of that king who was ruling the whole world was Hastinapura. So there was only one flag, and these things are mentioned in the Srimad Bhagavatam. There were not many states, and the world was under one culture. Which culture? The Vedic culture. The advanced people in those times were Aryans. Now Srila Prabhupada explains Indo-European stock are also Aryans. They came from Central India and Central Asia. That is the history. Caspian Sea. Prabhupada gives an example. What today is called Caspian Sea was the place of Kashyapa Muni. From word Kashyapa comes the word Caspian. Formerly, another example Srila Prabhupada gives, formerly the capital of Afghanistan was known as Gandhara Desha. Now it has become Kandahar by historic context. By historical references, Srila Prabhupada says, it will be ascertained that the whole planet was known as Bharatvarsha, unlike now what is called as Bharat or Bharatvarsha is only the sub-continent of India. Formerly the whole planet was known as Bharatvarsha, and before it was known as Bharatvarsha, the whole planet, it was called Ilaavrata Varsha.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Mahabharata means greater Bharata."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the Mahabharata as the history of greater Bharatvarsha and Krishna's acceptance of Kunti's prayers.

But since the time of King Bharata, who was the forefather of the Pandavas, the planet was called Bharatvarsha, and throughout the planet there was Vedic culture, and Srila Prabhupada says the treasures are still available, and the history of the whole world is called Mahabharata. Mahabharata means greater Bharata. It is like nowadays we have greater channels. Greater Chennai, greater Mumbai. So those days when Mahabharata was compiled, it means history of the greater Bharatvarsha, the entire planet. The king of Hastinapura, once again Prabhupada is telling, was the emperor of the whole world, of this whole planet, earth planet. There were other states, but they were paying tax to the emperor. Now Krishna, after receiving the nice prayers by Kunti Devi, nicely composed and accepted the prayers by the word which is indicating that, Badham. Badham means, "Yes, that's alright." He smiled. Krishna smiled because whatever Kunti had said, that is true. There is no exaggeration. So Krishna smiled because whatever Kunti said, she was so pleased to enunciate the glories of Lord Krishna. Krishna, because she knows what is Krishna. In this way, Krishna was preparing to return to Dwaraka. Now Yudhishthira Maharaj requested Krishna, "My dear Krishna, my dear brother, if you kindly stay for a few days more, be very nice."

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "If we increase our love for Krishna, we will be able to do everything."
**Summary:** This segment highlights that love for Krishna allows devotees to 'purchase' Krishna, influencing his actions.

So Prabhupada explains, Krishna is fully independent. He could have refused. "No, I cannot stay more. I have to go." But here it is said, premna. Premna means out of love. Yudhishthira implored Krishna, "Please stay back a few more days." So it is to be understood that Maharaj Yudhishthira cannot order the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but by love, everything is possible. Therefore, Srila Prabhupada says, if we increase our love for Krishna, we will be able to do everything. If we increase our love for Krishna, then Krishna becomes purchased by us. In an earlier verse, in the prayers by Kunti Devi, she said, Namo Akinchanavittaya. Akinchanavitta. He is the property of the pure devotees. Krishna is the property of the pure devotees. So that same point, Prabhupada is telling here, if we increase our love for Krishna, we will be able to do everything. Then Krishna becomes purchased by us. Krishna agrees. Whatever his loving devotees say, that is his kindness. Krishna is actually everyone's order giver.

**Verse References:** BG 1.21-22
**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "We can purchase Krishna by love."
**Summary:** This segment uses the example of Arjuna ordering Krishna as his chariot driver to illustrate how love allows devotees to influence Krishna.

But he accepts the order of his devotee. Now another example Srila Prabhupada gives, when Krishna was driving Arjuna's chariot, it is described in the beginning of the Bhagavad Gita. Arjuna said, Senayorubhayor madhyeratham sthapayam echchuta. So what is the meaning of this, my dear Krishna? You are achchuta. Achchuta means one who never falls back. So, Arjuna is telling Krishna, "You accepted the post as my charioteer, Parthasarathi." So, Krishna has to carry out the order of the king who is the master on the chariot. And chariot driver, after all, is supposed to take the order from the master and accordingly drive the chariot. But, Arjuna knew, Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead. Arjuna was very clear. Only, out of friendship, Krishna agreed to become Arjuna's chariot driver. So, when Arjuna requested Krishna, radham sthapayam echchuta, just place my chariot between the two armies. He was little hesitating that I am ordering Krishna who is the supreme personality of Godhead. But then, in spite of that, Arjuna is reminding Krishna also, although you are my master, for the time being, but because you have voluntarily accepted to become my chariot driver, therefore, I am asking you, it is not out of disrespect. So, Krishna also responded by telling, "Yes, I am willing. This is the position."

**Key Quote:** "all departments of knowledge are really meant for finding out Krishna."
**Summary:** This segment explains that understanding God through Vedic study is difficult, as Krishna is veiled by Yogamaya, but all knowledge ultimately aims to find Krishna.

So, Prabhupada says, "We can purchase Krishna by love." And that is stated in the Brahma Samhita. Veda Shudurla. Dhurlabham adhurlabham atma bhaktau. Dhurlabha means very, very difficult to obtain. So, Brahma says, if you officially study the Vedas, to find out God, or to know about God, that is very, very difficult. So, for those who are trying to understand God by cultivating knowledge of the Vedas, or searching for God in the Vedas, it is very, very difficult for them to obtain Krishna. Krishna also says in the Bhagavad Gita, Naham Prakash Sarvasya Yogamaya Samavrtha. "I do not expose myself to everyone, because I am covered by the Yogamaya curtain." So, also Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, Vedash Sarvair Ahameva Vedyaha, that all departments of knowledge are really meant for finding out Krishna. So, whichever branch of knowledge you take, Veda means all branches of knowledge, chemistry, physics, politics, sociology, medicine, whichever branch of knowledge that is there in the Vedas, the aim is to find out Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "the purpose of all education, the purpose of studying the Vedas, the purpose of getting any knowledge, is to know Krishna."
**Summary:** This segment narrates Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's Krishna-centered teaching of grammar and concludes that the ultimate goal of all knowledge is to know Krishna for a successful life.

And, this was actually taught by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. When he was teaching grammar to his students, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, at a very young age, he became a scholar in Sanskrit grammar. So, he was teaching his students, he had opened a small school, and he was explaining what is called as Dhatu. Dhatu means verb in Sanskrit grammar. So, he was explaining simply Krishna. Krishna. Through all the methods of teaching different aspects of Sanskrit grammar, he would only teach about Krishna. That's all. The students somehow became a little dissatisfied. That means, Nimai Pandit, he was known as Nimai Pandit, he simply explains Krishna, Krishna, Krishna in everything he speaks or everything he teaches, he only explains Krishna. But, actually, that's the real point. Whatever is the subject matter, the goal is to understand Krishna, to know Krishna. That's the perfection of all knowledge. So, the Chaitanya Charitamrita, which describes this particular pastime of the Lord, Chaitanya Charitamrita says, these students, they are Adhama Paduya, inferior, very low grade students. They are not interested in understanding God or Krishna. They want some grammar. For what purpose? What is the use of learning the grammar without knowing Krishna? So, Prabhupada concludes, the purpose of all education, the purpose of studying the Vedas, the purpose of getting any knowledge, is to know Krishna. That is the ultimate goal of all education. And, if we understand Krishna, if we know Krishna, our life is ultimately completely successful. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "As the rightful claimant for the throne, the whole battle of Kurukshetra was fought and millions were massacred, were killed in the battle. So Yudhishthira is thinking, for me to be enthroned as the emperor of the world, so much of massacre, it is not, he feels it is not justified."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Yudhishthira's grief over the massacre in the battle of Kurukshetra, fought for him to be enthroned, and the immense scale of the battle.

So it is being described here by Suta Goswami that Yudhishthira was very much aggrieved for the huge massacre that had happened as a result of the battle of Kurukshetra. So Srila Prabhupada explains this elaborately in the purport: "The pious king Yudhishthira was mortified because of the mass massacre of human beings in the battle of Kurukshetra, especially on his account." So it is explained, why Yudhishthira was so aggrieved? "This was visible mainly in the Bodhisattvas nativity. And yet all none could pretty see it." So in some sense it would seem that the rules of the Yudhishthira contraption was actually a result of that conflict. But the understanding of which is that Yudhishthira was feeling much aggrieved regarding the things about whom he did not want to see, because in one sense there was no need of fighting. As the rightful claimant for the throne, the whole battle of Kurukshetra was fought and millions were massacred, were killed in the battle. So Yudhishthira is thinking, for me to be enthroned as the emperor of the world, so much of massacre, it is not, he feels it is not justified. But on the principle of justice, Yudhishthira was to replace Duryodhana. The whole clique of politics centered around this point, and all the kings and residents of the whole world became involved in this fight between the rival brothers. Lord Krishna was also there on the side of King Yudhishthira. It is said in the Mahabharata, Adiparva, that 640 million men were killed in the 18 days of the battle of Kurukshetra, and some hundreds of thousands were missing.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the historical authenticity of the Mahabharata and Ramayana as itihasas, histories of Vedic culture, focusing on the stories of Lord Ramachandra and the Pandavas/Kauravas.

Practically, this was the greatest battle in the world within 5000 years. So, there is a detailed description in the Mahabharata about this entire episode of the battle, events leading to the battle. And it is an authentic historical record, this itihasa, itihasa means history. And two famous itihasas based on the history of Vedic culture, are the Ramayana and Mahabharata. So, as you are aware, Ramayana is the history of Lord Ramachandra, the incarnation of the Supreme Lord appearing on the earth and ruling the entire world from Ayodhya. And Mahabharata is the history of the Pandavas and Kauravas, and they are ruling the world.

**Key Quote:** "So, after the battle, Krishna and these sages headed by Vyasa, they all tried to pacify and explain and convince Yudhishthira that Yudhishthira is not responsible for this killing."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Krishna and other sages tried to convince Yudhishthira that the battle was justified and that he was not responsible for the killings, but Yudhishthira remained unconvinced.

So, Prabhupada further explains in the purport, this mass killing simply to enthrone Maharaja Yudhishthira was too mortifying for whom? For Yudhishthira. So, he tried to be convinced with evidences from histories by great sages like Vyasa and by the Supreme Lord Krishna himself, that the fight was justified, because the cause was just. So, justifying the fighting in spite of the huge number of people who died in this battle, in spite of that big number of deaths, the sages headed by Vyasa and Krishna himself, both of them, they wanted to pacify Yudhishthira and explained to him by historical evidence of previous instances where such big battles were fought for the sake of justice to prevail in this world. Duryodhana had occupied the post by cheating the Pandavas, by banishing them to the forest, by his so many tricks and by force, though Yudhishthira was powerful, but he was just being very morally upright in every instance that Duryodhana cheated the Pandavas, headed by Yudhishthira. So, after the battle, Krishna and these sages headed by Vyasa, they all tried to pacify and explain and convince Yudhishthira that Yudhishthira is not responsible for this killing. But Maharaj Yudhishthira could not be satisfied, even though he was instructed by the greatest personalities of his time. Somehow, Yudhishthira was not convinced, and that will be described in the rest of this chapter, towards the end of this chapter.

#### superhuman action, Krishna's purpose, Bhishma Dev

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna's purpose of Yudhishthira not getting convinced is that Krishna wanted to perform still more superhuman action."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses why Krishna didn't convince Yudhishthira, suggesting it was to allow Yudhishthira to receive instructions from the dying Bhishma Dev.

How Yudhishthira was not convinced that this battle was justified. Now, Krishna is being described in these words as the performer of superhuman actions, Adbhuta Karmana. Krishnena Adbhuta Karmana. But in this particular instance of trying to convince Yudhishthira, neither Krishna nor Vyasa could convince King Yudhishthira. They could not. So, does it mean Krishna failed to be a superhuman actor? The answer is no, certainly not. How do we understand this? Krishna did not fail in his attempt to convince Yudhishthira. Why? Because Krishna is the supreme lord, He is the Ishwara, supreme controller, and he is seated as a super soul in the hearts of both King Yudhishthira and Vyasa Deva. So, Krishna is in the background, but he is the supreme controller. So, Krishna's purpose of Yudhishthira not getting convinced is that Krishna wanted to perform still more superhuman action. As super soul of King Yudhishthira, Krishna did not allow King Yudhishthira to become convinced by the words of Vyasa and others including himself, because Krishna's desire was that Yudhishthira should hear instructions from the dying Bhishma Dev, from the dying Bhishma Dev.

**Key Quote:** "Even though Bhishma was fighting on the opposite side... Bhishma is great devotee. He has affection for the Pandavas. He knows the Pandavas cause is just. Still Bhishma had to fight on the side of Duryodhana."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights the unique situation of Bhishma, a great devotee who knew the Pandavas' cause was just, yet was obligated to fight for Duryodhana.

Now, Bhishma was also another great devotee of the supreme lord Krishna. Even though Bhishma was fighting on the opposite side, this is very, very unique situation. Bhishma is great devotee. He has affection for the Pandavas. He knows the Pandavas cause is just. Still, Bhishma had to fight on the side of Duryodhana. Now the supreme lord Krishna also wanted that at the last stage of his material existence, the great warrior Bhishma Deva should see Krishna personally at the time of his quitting the body, and Bhishma should also see his beloved grandchildren, the Pandavas, and thus pass away very peacefully, because Bhishma Deva was not at all satisfied to fight against the Pandavas, because he knew Pandavas cause is just. So Prabhupada explains the reason why Bhishma Deva was constrained to fight on the side of the Kauravas. The reason is that Kshatriyas are very stern people, and therefore Bhishma Deva, he was obliged to take the side of Duryodhana. Why was he obliged to take the side of Duryodhana? Because Bhishma was maintained at the expense of Duryodhana.

**Key Quote:** "Bhishma actually was the one who was supposed to rule the whole world, but he voluntarily gave up for the sake of his father."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the story of Bhishma's sacrifice, giving up his claim to the throne for his father's happiness and his subsequent obligation to Duryodhana due to being maintained by him.

Now elsewhere Prabhupada explains that actually the kingdom belonged to Bhishma Deva. How is that? Bhishma was the eldest son of the emperor Shantanu, and the emperor, when he actually retired, this Shantanu was a forefather of the Pandavas and Kauravas. When he retired, Bhishma should have taken charge of ruling the whole world as the emperor. But because Shantanu wanted to marry one daughter of a fisherman, one Satyavati, hmm, it's a very long history. So Shantanu wanted to marry the daughter of a fisherman, Satyavati, but Satyavati's father refused, because he calculated that the son born of my daughter through this emperor will not be able to inherit the post of the emperor, because the elder son has got a son through his first wife. So what is the use of marrying my daughter to this emperor? So he refused, this fisherman refused Shantanu. Shantanu said okay. But when Bhishma found out that my father has been refused, he went to the fisherman and said, what is the reason you are refusing to marry your daughter to my father? So then the fisherman explained. Bhishma said, I forsake the claim to the throne. The son born of your daughter will be the next emperor. Then Bhishma thought that the fisherman will accept. The fisherman said okay, the son born of my daughter will be the emperor, but after that son, your son will claim the throne of the whole world, because you are forsaking, but he may not forsake. So then Bhishma agreed to remain a brahmachari, not to marry, and that way Shantanu was able to marry that fisherman's daughter Satyavati. So Bhishma actually was the one who was supposed to rule the whole world, but he voluntarily gave up for the sake of his father. Therefore Krishna, Bhishma is not actually a dependent, not really a dependent, but he assumed a humble position that Duryodhana maintained me, and so he fought on the side of the Kauravas. I will stop here.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how Krishna orchestrated the delusion of Yudhishthira and Arjuna to facilitate the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita and the instructions of Bhishma.

In this session, we will be discussing two verses, the 47th and the 48th verses of the 8th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 47th verse: आह राजा धर्म सुतः चिन्तयन् सुरुदाम् वधं प्राकृतेन आत्मना विप्रा स्नेह मोह वशंगतः. The meaning of this verse is: King Yudhishthira, son of Dharma, overwhelmed by the death of his friends, was aggrieved just like a common materialistic man. O sages! Thus deluded by affection, he began to speak. Suta Goswami is describing how Yudhishthira was aggrieved and what did he say, how did he express himself. So he was overwhelmed just like a common man. Now Srila Prabhupada explains something very significant in the purport. Srila Prabhupada says, King Yudhishthira, though he was not expected to become aggrieved like a common man, became deluded by worldly affection by the will of the Supreme Lord Krishna, just as Arjuna was apparently deluded on the battlefield of Kurukshetra before the war began, again by the arrangement of Krishna only. Both Yudhishthira and Arjuna are pure devotees. All the five Pandavas are pure devotees. So there is no question of them becoming deluded by Maya. So it is Krishna's arrangement for Arjuna to become deluded, so that Krishna could speak Bhagavad Gita for our benefit. Similarly, Krishna wanted Bhishma to instruct Yudhishthira. And through Yudhishthira, Krishna wanted Bhishma to instruct the whole world about the intricacies of Dharma. And for that purpose, he was able to tell the whole world about the intricacies of Dharma.

#### body vs. soul, duty, Krishna's plan

**Key Quote:** "Just like this cloth we are wearing is simply an external covering for the real person within the dress."
**Summary:** This segment focuses on the distinction between the body and the soul, emphasizing the importance of fulfilling one's duty without being attached to the material body, and reiterates Krishna's plan behind Yudhishthira's delusion.

Krishna arranged that Yudhishthira should become overwhelmed by worldly affection for the loss of so many people in this battle. Srila Prabhupada explains in this purport, a man who sees knows well that the living entity is neither the body nor the mind, but is transcendental to the material conception of life. You have heard this many times in the Bhagavad Gita and all the scriptures, it is explained, we are spirit soul, we are not the body, we are not the mind. Both the gross body and the subtle body are coverings for the real person within the body, that is the spirit soul. The common man thinks of violence and non-violence in terms of the body, but that is a kind of delusion. Just considering the body alone is a big mistake. Everyone is duty bound according to one's occupation. Occupational duties, swadharma or varnashrama dharma. A kshatriya is bound to fight for the right cause regardless of the opposite party. In this case, Yudhishthira was fighting against his own cousins, the Kauravas. But for the right cause, a kshatriya should not refuse to fight. That is what Krishna explains in the Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna also. In discharge of duty, one should not be disturbed by annihilation of the material body, which is only an external dress of the living soul. In the Bhagavad Gita in the second chapter, Krishna explains, just like this cloth we are wearing is simply an external covering for the real person within the dress. Similarly, the body itself, the physical body is simply an external covering of the spirit soul. And when it is worn out, then one discards that. That is what is called death, discarding this body and accept a new body. All this was perfectly known to Yudhishthira Maharaj. But by the will of the Supreme Lord Krishna, he became just like a common man, because there was another great idea behind this delusion.

#### Bhishma's instructions, akshauhini, warfare

**Key Quote:** "King Yudhishthira would be instructed by Bhishma, as Arjuna was instructed by Lord Krishna himself."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the purpose of Yudhishthira's delusion, which was to receive instructions from Bhishma, and then details the composition of an akshauhini and the scale of the Kurukshetra war.

Krishna had another plan, why Yudhishthira should become deluded. What is that great idea? King Yudhishthira would be instructed by Bhishma, as Arjuna was instructed by Lord Krishna himself. This was the idea for Yudhishthira to become deluded because of the massacre, mass massacre. The 48th verse: अहो मे पश्यत अज्ञानम् हृदि रुढम् दुरात्मनः परकीयस्य एव देहस्य अहो मे अक्षौहिणीर् हतः. The meaning of this verse is, King Yudhishthira said, O my Lord, I am the most sinful man. Just see my heart, which is full of ignorance. This body, which is ultimately meant for others, has killed many many phalanxes of men. Phalanx means akshauhini in Sanskrit. Then the purport should be appropriate to explain what is the count of a phalanx or akshauhini division. A solid phalanx of 21,870 chariots, 21,870 elephants, 109,650 infantry, and 65,600 cavalry is called an akshauhini. Chariots here mean chariot fighters. And elephants means on elephant back there are powerful warriors who fight from elephant back. And infantry means those on foot, soldiers on foot. And cavalry means those who are on horseback, fighters on horseback. So, these four kinds of fighters are there in a battle in the Vedic times, in the Vedic culture. So, akshauhini division is very very big. 21,000 and odd chariots, 21,000 and odd elephants, 109,000 infantry, and 65,000 odd cavalry. So many. And like this how many divisions were there totally on the battlefield of Kurukshetra? 11 on the Kaurava side. 11 akshauhini divisions on the Kaurava side, and 7 akshauhini divisions on the Pandava side. Totally 18 akshauhini divisions were fighting in this battle of Kurukshetra.

#### responsibility, Yudhishthira's perspective, body's purpose

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Yudhishthira as the most pious king of the world takes for himself the responsibility for killing such a huge number of living beings because the battle was fought to reinstate him on the throne."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Yudhishthira's sense of responsibility for the deaths in the Kurukshetra war and his understanding of the body's purpose as service to others.

So, Prabhupada further explains, many akshauhinis were killed on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. That's a fact. Maharaj Yudhishthira as the most pious king of the world takes for himself the responsibility for killing such a huge number of living beings because the battle was fought to reinstate him on the throne. Yudhishthira is seeing from this perspective. After all, Duryodhana was ruling very nicely, even though he was not the rightful claimant. But he was ruling. He was a Kshatriya ruling properly. He was guided by proper Brahmanas who were expert in state administration. So, just for the sake of me to become the emperor, so much of killing. It's not justified. So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport the thinking of Yudhishthira. What was his thinking like? This body is after all meant for others. It is meant for others. While there is life in the body, it is meant for the service of others, paropakaara. And when it is dead, it is meant to be eaten by dogs and jackals or maggots. After all the body will be, when the soul leaves the body after death, the body is either burnt away to ashes in a fire, cremated, or it is buried and it will be eaten away by maggots underneath the earth. Or some people just leave the body for being eaten by other birds or vultures or other animals. So, in any case, the body is going to be finished. So, but Yudhishthira is sorry because for such a temporary body, such a huge massacre was committed. In terms of Yudhishthira seeing from a perspective that after all the body is meant for doing some welfare activity while I am living. And what have I done? Just because I want to be the emperor, such a huge massacre. This is not at all justified, not at all justified.

**Key Quote:** "It's meant for doing welfare activity for the other people, paropakaara."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Arjuna's and Yudhishthira's reactions to the war, highlighting the conscientious nature of pure devotees and emphasizing that the human body should be used for welfare activities rather than sense gratification.

So, this is Yudhishthira's way of thinking. And further verses will explain how he is the most pious king and he is very sensitive to what has happened. So, Yudhishthira is behaving like this because he is a pure devotee. A pure devotee is very very conscientious. Arjuna, he is thinking, okay, we are all ready to fight. But what are the consequences of such a ghastly war? What are the consequences? He is thinking about it. Is it really necessary to fight in this battle? And whom am I going to kill? My own kinsmen? And for what? For just getting a throne, ascending a throne for ruling the world? And I am also simply going to fight against my own grandfather and teacher, Drona, Bhishma, who are my respectable superiors? I don't want to fight. This is the way Arjuna responded upon seeing the army of the Kauravas before the battle was about to begin. Now, Arjuna was overwhelmed before the battle began. Krishna spoke Gita. And Yudhishthira was overwhelmed after the battle. And both of them were instructed. Arjuna was instructed by Krishna, and Yudhishthira was instructed by Bhishma. Bhishma is a Mahajana. He is an authority. So, it is correct to say that after all the body is not meant for simply enjoyment as emperor or some enjoy some power. No, it's not meant for that. It's meant for doing welfare activity for the other people, paropakaara. That's what it is meant for. And a human being has got this sense of reasoning, developed intelligence by which he can understand what is the real purpose of this existence in this body. That a human being can understand. The lower creatures cannot. So, human beings should not simply utilize the body for sense gratification. That's the conclusion. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of Yudhishthira Maharaj's lamentation after the Kurukshetra war, highlighting the immense loss of life and Yudhishthira's feeling of responsibility.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chaiva Narottamam Deviim Saraswatiim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udhirayet. In this session, we will be discussing the 49th and the 50th verses of the 8th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 49th verse: The meaning of this verse is, "I have killed many boys, brahmanas, well-wishers, friends, parents, preceptors, and brothers. Though I live millions of years, I will not be relieved from the hell that awaits me for all these sins." So Yudhishthira Maharaj is affected by the massacre that happened in the battle of Kurukshetra. It was a World War. The whole world was divided into two parties: those on the side of the Pandavas and those on the side of Kauravas. So The Mahabharata says 640 million people were dead at the end of 18 days of the battle of Kurukshetra. So when Yudhishthira Maharaj was killed by the massacre, he went to the scene of the battlefield. He saw the number of dead people and he was overwhelmed with a feeling that I have been responsible for this entire killing. Now how is it that he's responsible? Because the whole battle was fought.

**Key Quote:** "Only a pure devotee can properly rule this world and actually guide the people to become Krishna conscious, to get out of this material entanglement."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the reasons behind the war, focusing on Duryodhana's evil intentions and Krishna's divine plan to establish the Pandavas, pure devotees, as rulers to guide people towards Krishna consciousness.

Yudhishthira Maharaj as the emperor of the world. Of course, it was the rightful claim of the Pandavas to rule the world after the death of Pandu, who was the ruling emperor. But Dhritarashtra, being the caretaker king while the Pandavas were very small, their father King Pandu, Emperor Pandu, he died untimely, early. So then Dhritarashtra was made the caretaker king because there was nobody else to take charge of ruling till Yudhishthira grew up and became sufficiently powerful. He was trained and an adult to actually take charge of ruling the kingdom, ruling the entire world. So Dhritarashtra, as the caretaker king, developed the desire that his sons, the Kauravas, headed by Duryodhana, should rule and not the Pandavas. So Duryodhana being evil-minded, it is described in the Bhagavad Gita, Dhritarashtra durbuddhe yudhe priyochikiri shavaha. Durbuddhi, evil-minded Duryodhana, he planned and plotted to kill the Pandavas and eliminate them before they could even become adults and could actually stake the claim for ruling the entire world. But Duryodhana was unsuccessful because the Pandavas, being pure devotees, were always protected by Krishna. It was Krishna's plan that the Pandavas should actually be ruling the entire world because they are the proper representatives of Krishna, the Supreme Lord, being pure devotees of Krishna. Only a pure devotee can properly rule this world and actually guide the people to become Krishna conscious, to get out of this material entanglement. That's the whole plan of the Supreme Lord in this material world.

#### Purpose of material creation, Conditioned souls, Liberation, Role of a Kshatriya king

**Key Quote:** "The purpose of this creation is to give a chance to the conditioned souls."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the purpose of material creation as an opportunity for conditioned souls to realize their spiritual nature and return to the spiritual world, emphasizing the role of a Kshatriya king in guiding people towards liberation.

Sometimes people wonder, what is the purpose of this creation? The purpose of this creation is to give a chance to the conditioned souls. All of us are called conditioned souls. We are conditioned by this material nature. We develop desires to enjoy, thinking that we are this body, we belong to this world. And our life continues birth after birth after birth because we have so many varieties of desires for enjoying. But actually Krishna's purpose is different. Krishna wants us to realize we don't belong here because we are spirit, soul, we are not the body. And as spiritual beings, we can never be really satisfied and happy by material pleasures, by material enjoyment, by material lordship. We can never be satisfied or happy. So Krishna wants us to realize this. And for this purpose, Krishna has created this world in such a way that in the human form of life, we have developed intelligence. And if we are guided on the spiritual path of emancipation, of liberation from material bondage, then very easily we are able to understand and act appropriately under proper guidance and become completely free from all entanglements and go back to our original position in the spiritual world to enjoy eternal life of bliss and knowledge. This is the whole plan of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the purpose of creation: to liberate all the living beings, especially the human beings. And a proper Kshatriya ruling the human beings, ruling this world and particularly guiding the human beings on this path of liberation. It is possible that everyone can be liberated if they are guided by a king like Yudhishthira.

**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada on the sins of war, particularly the killing of innocent beings, and reiterates Yudhishthira's acceptance of responsibility for the mass killing.

A Krishna conscious king. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "Whenever there is a war, there is certainly a massacre of many innocent living beings, such as boys, brahmanas and women, whose killing is considered to be the greatest of sins. Innocent people should not be killed. They are all innocent creatures and in all circumstances killing of them is forbidden in the scriptures. Maharaj Yudhishthira was aware of these mass killings. Similarly there were friends, parents and preceptors also on both sides and all of them were killed. It was simply horrible for him to think of such killing and therefore he was thinking of residing in hell for millions and billions of years." Yudhishthira Maharaj accepts responsibility for this mass killing because only for the sake of enthroning Yudhishthira the whole battle was fought. And so many people were killed.

#### King's duty, Yudhishthira's humility, Self-aggrandizement, Pure devotee's sensitivity

**Key Quote:** "A pure devotee is very thoughtful, is very sensitive, he is very very careful in every action and he always considers the consequences of any action that he performs."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the apparent contradiction of a king's duty to kill miscreants versus Yudhishthira's feeling of guilt, highlighting Yudhishthira's humility and a pure devotee's sensitivity to the consequences of their actions.

The 50th verse: naino rājña prajābhartur dharma-yuddhe vadho dviṣāṁ iti me natu bodhāya kalpate śāsanam vachaha. The meaning is, there is no sin for a king who kills for the right cause, who is engaged in maintaining his citizens, but this injunction is not applicable to me. A king has to engage in violence when there is a necessity of protecting innocent creatures, of protecting the weaker sections of society, of protecting women, of protecting saintly persons, of protecting brahmanas. Then he has to actually kill the miscreants. That's the duty of the king. But Yudhishthira Maharaj is thinking that even though a king has got a duty to kill the miscreants, but this killing in this battle is not applicable, is not proper for King Yudhishthira. That's what he's thinking. The Purport: Shrila Prabhupāda says, "Maharaj Yudhishthira thought that although he was not actually involved in administration of the kingdom, just being carried on well by Duryodhana without any harm to the citizens, he caused the killing of so many living beings only for his personal gain of the kingdom from the hands of Duryodhana. The killing was committed not in the course of administration but for the sake of self-aggrandizement, and as such he thought himself responsible for all the sins." This is Yudhishthira Maharaj's thinking. A pure devotee is very thoughtful, is very sensitive, he is very very careful in every action and he always considers the consequences of any action that he performs. Before performing the action there is so much of thinking, there is so much of precautions taken.

#### Peace negotiations, Duryodhana's obstinacy, Kshatriya dharma, Avoiding war

**Key Quote:** "Yudhishthira Maharaj tried peace negotiations with Duryodhana and the Kauravas. In so many ways he tried to avert this battle."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts Yudhishthira's efforts to avoid the war through peace negotiations, highlighting Duryodhana's obstinacy and the Pandavas' willingness to compromise, even asking for just five villages.

As you are aware, in the Mahabharata it is described that to avoid this battle, Yudhishthira Maharaj tried peace negotiations with Duryodhana and the Kauravas. In so many ways he tried to avert this battle. He did not like the idea of fighting against the Kauravas in order to get back his rightful claim for the kingdom. But Duryodhana was obstinate and he would not give the kingdom back to the Pandavas. Of course it is a very long story. Story in the sense it is a historical incident that really happened. It is not a fictitious story. Actually the Kauravas headed by Duryodhana they usurped the kingdom of the Pandavas by cheating them in a gambling match. And after they promised to return the kingdom after the Pandavas had completed 13 years of exile living in the forest. When they came back Duryodhana refused to give back their kingdom. So then war became inevitable because a Kshatriya when challenged he cannot refuse to fight. So Duryodhana said you fight and defeat us and then you take your kingdom. So Kshatriya never begs for kingdom. Of course it was a rightful claim. Yudhishthira was not begging Duryodhana. But Yudhishthira did not like the idea of fighting and killing the Kauravas and so many others. He knew that it is going to be a world war. So to avoid that world war Yudhishthira tried peace negotiations. The Pandavas reduced their request for peace by averting the battle by just asking five villages for the five brothers. Even Duryodhana was not willing to give this much to the Pandavas.

**Key Quote:** "So the Pandavas as devotees their life is very very simple...They are as pure devotees they are completely free from the desire for sense enjoyment."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the Pandavas' simple life as devotees, their detachment from material comforts, and reiterates Yudhishthira's feeling of guilt for the massacre caused by the war, despite Duryodhana's obstinacy.

Why were the Pandavas asking? Because they are duty bound to maintain themselves by ruling over citizens, by ruling over people. So they collect taxes and maintain themselves. So the Pandavas as devotees, their life is very very simple. Anyway, thirteen years they have spent in exile. They are so magnanimous souls. They are as pure devotees, they are completely free from the desire for sense enjoyment. A devotee maintains his body simply for the sake of doing some devotional service to Krishna. That's all. He maintains his existence only for serving Krishna. And for serving Krishna what is required? Krishna is happy even if any devotee offers him in worship a leaf, a flower, a fruit or little water. So devotees live a very simple life and they are engaged in a devotional service. So the Pandavas did not have, even though they were born in a royal family and they were living in a palace before they were sent to exile. They were living in royal comforts as Kshatriyas ruling half the world. But as devotees they did not want any of these comforts. So the Pandavas reduced their request and they asked Duryodhana for five villages and Duryodhana refused. So war was inevitable. So even though Duryodhana's obstinacy was the cause for the entire battle, Yudhishthira is now thinking that this massacre that has happened, he considers himself responsible and therefore he is very much feeling guilty of being the cause for this massacre, mass killing.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the importance of protecting five categories of people in Vedic culture: brahmanas, cows, women, children, and old men, emphasizing the king's role in providing special care.

The story of the hair of Queen Draupadi. In the purport, Shrila Prabhupada explains, "Insulting the chaste lady Draupadi cost them their very life." It's very, very dangerous, and Prabhupada explains very nicely in the purport: In the glorious days, or days before the advent of the age of Kali, the brahmanas, the cows, the women, the children, and the old men were properly given protection. So, five categories of persons are mentioned who require special protection. Of course, in the Vedic culture, the King protects all the citizens impartially. But, in spite of being impartial to all the citizens, the king gives special care or protection for five categories of persons: the brahmanas, the cows, the women, the children, and old men.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the reasons for protecting brahmanas and cows, highlighting their roles in spiritual advancement and nourishing the brain for higher understanding.

Now why? That is explained by Srila Prabhupada very nicely. Number one, why protection should be given specially for brahmanas? It is explained here, the protection of the brahmanas maintains the institution of varna and ashrama, the most scientific culture for attainment of spiritual life. The brahmanas are the ones who give direction to the rest of the society for everyone to attain spiritual life. Having got the human form of life, everyone is eligible as a human being. So brahmanas are protected, means the rest of the society will get proper direction for spiritual advancement to attain spiritual life. Number two, why cows have to be protected? That is explained as follows: The protection of cows maintains the most miraculous form of food, that is milk, for maintaining the finer tissues of the brain for understanding higher aims of life. Human intelligence is special, because a human being has developed intelligence to understand spiritual aim of life or higher aim of life than merely satisfying the senses in gross or subtle ways. So this higher aim of life is missed out if the brain tissues are not properly nourished. Therefore cow's milk is especially meant for human beings in order to nourish their brain tissues to understand the spiritual goal of life. And Srila Prabhupada many times has explained this point that cow's milk is a miraculous form of food. For whom? For the human beings, for the progressive human beings.

**Key Quote:** "The protection of women maintains the chastity of society by which we can get a good generation for peace, tranquility and progressive life."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of protecting women to maintain chastity and ensure a good progeny, and introduces the concept of garbhadana samskara for conceiving spiritually advanced children.

Number three, this describes why women should be protected. The protection of women maintains the chastity of society by which we can get a good generation for peace, tranquility, and progressive life. The future depends on the quality of the progeny that human beings are born with, producing now. Now how can we ensure that there is a good progeny? By protecting the women. Number four, why children should be protected? The protection of children gives the human form of life its best chance to prepare the way of liberty from material bondage. Such protection of children begins from the very day of begetting a child by the purificatory process of garbhadana samskara, the beginning of pure life. So, certainly in modern society many people do not know what is this garbhadana samskara or the beginning of pure life, that before a man and woman combine, they perform this garbhadana samskara or preparation of their consciousness in order to attract a spiritually advanced soul to take shelter of the parents as their child.

generation being produced for a good future. Number five, why old men should be protected? The protection of the old men should be protected by giving them a chance to prepare themselves for better life after death. Of course, the entire human life is preparation for a better life after death, but at least if one has not begun this preparation before old age comes, at least after retirement, after getting old, one should and must dedicate oneself completely for this preparation. That's why old men should be protected. Now Srila Prabhupada explains this complete outlook is based on factors leading to successful humanity. Success in the human form of life is something different from the success which people who do not know what is the goal of human life, what they think is success. So Srila Prabhupada says this complete outlook is based on factors leading to successful humanity as against the civilization of polished cats and dogs.

**Key Quote:** "Human life is no better than animal life if one is simply engaged in the same for animal activities"
**Summary:** The speaker differentiates human life from animal life based on intelligence and the ability to attain spiritual life through the varna and ashrama system.

Human life is no better than animal life if one is simply engaged in the same four animal activities: ahara nidra bhaya maithunam cha samanyam etat pasubhi naranam. There are four common activities for both the animals, pasubhi, and naranam, and for the human beings. What are the four common activities? Ahara, food, we all require food, our living is based on food. Nidra, sleep. Bhaya, defense mechanism against some danger for the body. And maithunam for procrastination, creation, there is a need of engaging in sex life. So these are common activities of the animals and human beings, but a human being is distinguished because of possessing a developed intelligence by which the human being can make a permanent solution to all problems of material existence by attaining spiritual life. So for attaining spiritual life, there has to be a proper organized effort in the society, in the human society. And that organized effort is called the scientific system of varna and ashrama. Every human being is classified according to guna and karma

And importantly, all are guided by the qualified brahmanas in order to attain spiritual life by practicing certain basic principles meant for the human being, civilized human being. Now, Srila Prabhupada says, the killing of the above mentioned innocent creatures is totally forbidden for the benefit of the human being. It is forbidden because even by insulting them, one loses one's duration of life. We have a fixed duration of life when we are born, but this duration of life will not remain with us throughout our life intact. It is not going to remain intact. We can reduce our duration of life by insulting. By insulting any of the five categories of persons, by insulting a brahmana or a cow or a chaste woman or innocent children or old men, by insulting any of them, our duration of life is shortened.

**Key Quote:** "To insult a chaste woman means to bring about disaster in the duration of life."
**Summary:** The speaker connects the lack of protection for women in Kali Yuga to the birth of unwanted children and uses the example of Draupadi's insult to illustrate the disastrous consequences of disrespecting chaste women.

And here is an example that Prabhupada gives. In the age of Kali, they are not properly protected. And therefore, the duration of life of the present generation has shortened considerably. Why are we seeing shortening of the duration of life nowadays? Because the above five categories of personalities are not given proper protection. That is well known. In the Bhagavad Gita, it is stated that when the women become unchaste, for want of proper protection, there are unwanted children called Varna Sankara. Varna Sankara means children born of unprotected women. Such children are actually born with so many demoniac qualities, and they actually spoil the entire human society because of their bad behavior. And the whole society becomes degraded because of such unwanted children. So that is because women are not protected. To insult a chaste woman means to bring about disaster in the duration of life. Dushasana, a brother of Duryodhana, insulted Draupadi, an ideal chaste lady, and therefore the miscreants died untimely. All the Kauravas, 100 sons of Dhritarashtra, they all died simply because Draupadi was insulted in that assembly when there was a gambling match. So they tried to strip her naked, and they were unsuccessful because Krishna protected Draupadi. But nonetheless, their duration of life was shortened, and they all died untimely, Akala Mrtyu. So, duration of life is shortened when one insults a chaste lady.

The meaning of this verse is, "I have killed many friends of women, and I have thus caused enmity to such an extent that it is not possible to undo it by material welfare work." This is continuing from the previous few verses where Yudhishthira Maharaj, after visiting the battlefield after the war was over, his son was killed, he had seen the massacre that has taken place. Millions, 640 million people were dead, and he is feeling very guilty that just for me to be enthroned as the emperor of the world, this huge killing has happened. Therefore, he is expressing his...

**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of Grihamedhi (materialist) and how they inevitably commit sins even unintentionally while pursuing material prosperity.

He is assuming responsibility for killing different kinds of people as a result of this battle. So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, the Grihamedhis are those whose only business is to perform welfare work for the sake of material prosperity. There are two words that are used in the scriptures, Grihamedhi and Grihastri. Grihamedhi is a person who doesn't have any spiritual understanding of life, simply works on the basis of, "I am the body," and simply works for maintenance of the body, for giving pleasure to the body, for maintaining the body, and the false ego dictates that, "I am this body and all the body is mine. The bodily connections are mine." This is the outlook of a Grihamedhi, and such a Grihamedhi, whatever work he does, he does only for the sake of material gain. He has no understanding of spiritual perspective of life itself. So, such Grihamedhis, they perform welfare activity only for the sake of material prosperity. Now, these material prosperity is sometimes hampered by sinful activities. Why? Why is it hampered by sinful activities? Because a materialist is sure to commit sins even unintentionally in the course of discharging

material duties. That's the nature of this material world. Even if a person knows what is sin and wants to avoid sinful activities, he cannot avoid that simply by being engaged in material duties. So it is said here, to get relief from such sinful reactions, the vedas prescribe several kinds of sacrifices. Unintentionally committed sins, there is a prescription in the vedas, different kinds of sacrifices are prescribed for those on the path of material gain through the scriptural directions. So further, Srila Prabhupada says, it is said in the vedas that by performing the ashwamedha yagna or horse sacrifice, one can get relief from even brahma hatya, killing of a brahmana. Among all the types of sinful activities a person can commit in the human form of life, the most grievous type of sinful activity is this killing of a brahmana, killing of a cow, and killing of a brahmana. Krishna is worshipped as a brahmana hita yacha. Krishna is worshipped as the topmost well-wisher of the cows and the brahmanas.

maintain this brahmanical culture based to protect the brahmanas and cows especially. But Yudhishthira Maharaj's thinking is different. So Yudhishthira Maharaj actually performed this ashwamedha yagna in order to atone for unintentional sinful activities, but he thinks that even though by performing such yagnas one can generally become free from sinful reactions, he thinks that for him it is not possible to get relief even by performing ashwamedha yagna from the great sins he has committed. What happens when a war takes place? Srila Prabhupada explains, in war either the husband or the brother or even the father or sons go to fight. When they are killed, a fresh enmity is created, and thus a chain of actions and reactions increase which is not possible to be counteracted even by thousands of ashwamedha yagnas. In a particular battle, one particular family people are killed, kshatriyas, then the women are so much, the surviving family members, the women and children unprotected, and then there is enmity. Lelakshmi may be described as the first family in violence, but in the great days there is that a woman named lelaki or a woman called lelaki who is a nice lady and a very kind person, the child killed her son left her child to his mother-in-law also with her husband and his wife the two lovers had a very good relationship and now they say that they are not sharing the battle and that is why they say that the FX is not that they can not make it in this way when they find out that they can not do it in their own way then the gravedigger of the vale will say that he has no power over them and son of Yadav is again leaving them alone after their loss become enemies of the new ruling king.

action and reaction. So, Srila Prabhupada says the way of karma is like that. Material activity or work in this material world is like that. We are always entangled in a chain of action and reaction. It creates one action and another reaction simultaneously and thus increases the chain of material activities, binding the performer in material bondage. So, what is the way out of this chain of actions and reactions? In the Bhagavad Gita, Srila Prabhupada says, in the 9th chapter, 2 verses, 27th and 28th verses, the remedy is suggested that such actions and reactions on the path of work can be checked only when work is done on behalf of the Supreme Lord. Only by offering the work or doing the work on behalf of the Supreme Lord or offering the results of the work to Krishna, can one be freed from the reactions. The battle of Kurukshetra was actually fought by the will of the Supreme Lord, Shri Krishna. Krishna, as it is evident from his version, that is Krishna's version, and only by Krishna's will was Yudhishthira placed from the throne of Hastinapura. So actually Yudhishthira Maharaj is a pure devotee, and it is Krishna's intention that a king like Yudhishthira Maharaj rules the whole world because he is the proper representative of Krishna in this material world.

**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that the Pandavas were not tainted by sin because they acted on Krishna's orders, while non-devotees bear the responsibility for wars fought for personal gain.

factually no sin whatsoever touched the Pandavas who were only the order carriers of the Lord. For the Pandavas there is no sin because they are pure devotees. They do everything for pleasing Krishna. They do everything on behalf of Krishna. They carry out Krishna's orders. It is this ground in the Mahabharata, after the battle was over and Yudhishthira Maharaj was to be enthroned, he did not want to rule the world that way, but Krishna wanted it. Therefore, Yudhishthira Maharaj accepted to rule the world. So this is the real nature of devotee, detached from everything material, but for the sake of the Supreme Lord, a devotee accepts anything and everything for the sake of serving the Lord. That's the nature of a devotee. So Srila Prabhupada says, for others, that means those who are non-devotees who declare war out of personal interest, the whole responsibility lies on them. That means for those who are non-devotees, when they are involved in a war in which massive killing happens, they are responsible for that killing if they have declared war out of personal whims or for their own sake. Here Yudhishthira Maharaj tried for peace negotiation. Yudhishthira Maharaj sent even Krishna to the yodana for peace negotiation. But Krishna also could not convince Duryodhana to stop this battle, to avoid this war.

**Key Quote:** "Because a pure devotee never kills anyone except on the order of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna orchestrated the war to remove the burden of the earth and that demons killed by Krishna or his devotees are purified of their sins.

So it was inevitable that Yudhishthira had to fight this battle, and Krishna wanted it because Krishna's plan was to remove the burden of the earth. The earth was overburdened by demoniac kings before the appearance of Krishna, and the Pandavas appeared simply for assisting Krishna in his pastimes because they are his pure devotees. So Krishna reduced the burden by killing so many demons. And finally, those demons who still remained after Krishna killing them, he gathered all those demons on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, and he wanted his pure devotees, the Pandavas, to kill these demons on his behalf. So actually the demons killed by Krishna are so much benefited that their sinful reactions are completely nullified because being killed by Krishna. When some demons, any demon is killed by a pure devotee, similarly the demon is purified of all sinful reactions because a pure devotee never kills anyone except on the order of Krishna. Because a pure devotee kills somebody only on the order of Krishna, the person who is killed even by a pure devotee is nullified, his sinful reactions are completely nullified.

The meaning of this verse is, as it is not possible to filter muddy water through mud, or purify a wine-stained pot with wine, it is not possible to counteract the killing of men by sacrificing animals.

**Key Quote:** "A sacrifice recommended in the scriptures is never meant for killing animals."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's perspective that Vedic sacrifices involving animals were not intended for killing but for rejuvenation and testing the efficacy of Vedic mantras chanted by qualified brahmanas.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, Ashwamedha Yajnas or Gomeda Yajnas, sacrifices in which a horse or a bull is sacrificed, were not, of course, for the purpose of killing the animals. This is a very important point to be understood here. A sacrifice recommended in the scriptures is never meant for killing animals. Even though, actually, in such a sacrifice, a horse or a bull is killed, it is not meant for killing. How do we understand this? So, Lord Chaitanya explains that such animals sacrificed on the altar of Yajna were rejuvenated and a new life was given to them. See, in all such sacrifices, even though there is a horse or a bull, that killed horse or bull is rejuvenated by giving it new life. In some cases, the soul in the animal's body is promoted immediately to the human form of life. It was just to prove the efficacy of the hymns of the Vedas. In the Vedas, in the Vedic sacrifice, there are four kinds of priests. There is the priest who chants the mantras, and the mantra chanting should have the power, the purity of the brahmana, who has perfected his mantra chanting, because of which the chanting will be effective. And in case the brahmana who is chanting the mantras is unable to revive an animal, because his chanting is not sufficiently powerful, then there is a referee priest who actually takes over and actually he chants the mantras to revive the animal, the animal which is sacrificed, and he also chants for the sake of the sacrifice. So, the whole process is to give new life to an animal, and for the testing of the chanting of the mantra, such an act is done.

**Key Quote:** "In this age of quarreled hypocrisy, that is Kali Yuga, there is no possibility of performing the yajnas perfectly, for want of expert brahmanas who are able to conduct such yajnas."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the impossibility of properly performing Vedic sacrifices in Kali Yuga due to the lack of qualified brahmanas and the potential for incurring sinful reactions from improperly conducted sacrifices.

Kill an animal and give it a new life. By recitation of the hymns of the Vedas in the proper way, certainly the performer gets relief from the reactions of sins. In such sacrifices, when mantra chanting is done by qualified brahmanas, then the yajaman, the performer of the sacrifice, he gets relief from reactions of sins. But, in case of such sacrifices improperly done under inexpert management, surely one has to become responsible for animal sacrifice, like it is happening in Kali Yuga. They kill animals, but they don't have qualified brahmanas to chant mantras to revive the animal. There are no qualified brahmanas who can chant mantras in this way. In the scriptures it is explained, there is an arani mantra, which a brahmana who performs sacrifices, yajnik brahmana, chants. By chanting the arani mantra, he is able to generate fire by the power of the mantra. To light a sacrificial fire, a brahmana does not use a matchbox, or some other device, to spark a fire. No. He uses arani mantra. So, that's the power of sound. Subtle sound, vibration is like that. But, in Kali Yuga, we don't have qualified brahmanas who can chant in this way. This is one of the main reasons why all sacraments, all sacrifices of this kind, are particularly forbidden in the age of Kali. That's what Srila Prabhupada says here. In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy, that is Kali Yuga, there is no possibility of performing the yajnas perfectly, for want of expert brahmanas who are able to conduct such yajnas.

**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Such meat eating is never pardoned."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of meat shops in Calcutta that falsely associate animal sacrifice with religious offerings to illustrate how animal killing in Kali Yuga leads to karmic consequences for everyone involved, comparing it to a gang of conspirators committing murder.

So, Srila Prabhupada says elsewhere, that in Calcutta, there are some meat shops which sell animal flesh. Now, they say Kali Prasad. What is the reason why they call their shop as Kali Prasad, meat shop? Because, they make a show of killing a goat, and offering a piece of the goat flesh to Kali. But, there is no qualified brahmana who can actually chant the mantras to revive the goat in performing this sacrifice of killing the goat. So, in the absence of a qualified brahmana chanting properly the mantras to revive the killed animal, the killer and the person who actually partakes the flesh of the killed animal, actually six kinds of people are responsible for this killing, and are punishable by the laws of karma. The person who rears the goat, the person who transports the goat, the person who sells the goat, the person who kills the goat, the person who purchases the flesh, the person who cooks the flesh, the person who eats the cooked meat, all of them are punishable for the killing of the goat. It's exactly like a murderer is punished by state laws. Exactly like that. So, people are unaware. In modern times, people are unaware what is the kind of punishment that awaits them for indulging in such meat eating. Such meat eating is never pardoned. The animal killing involved in such meat eating, and not only the person who kills the animal, everyone else involved in that, are all equally responsible for the killing. They are like a gang of conspirators who commit a murder. Exactly like that.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the impossibility of properly executing animal sacrifices in Kali Yuga and uses the examples of muddy water and a wine-stained pot to illustrate the principle that sinful actions cannot be purified by similar actions.

So, in Kali Yuga, there is no possibility of anybody properly executing Ashwamedha Yajna or Gomidha Yajna or even the goat sacrifice to Kali, which is called Ashwamedha Yajna. So, anybody properly executing Ashwamedha Yajna or Gomidha Yajna or even the goat sacrifice to Kali, which is recommended in the scriptures for meat eaters, there is no possibility that they can do that properly because there is no qualified Brahman. Now, Prabhupada says further in purport, Maharaj Yudhishthira therefore gives a hint to performing sacrifices in the age of Kali. Yudhishthira Maharaj is telling that in the age of Kali, there is no possibility that simply because somebody has killed men by killing animals in a sacrifice, they cannot get rid of the sinful reaction of killing men. He gives examples, two examples he gives, just like it is not possible to filter muddy water through mud. So, you have to have a filter which is clean, which is free of mud. Then only you can filter muddy water and get clean water. But if the cloth itself has got mud, the filtering cloth, then how can you filter muddy water through that and get clean water? Similarly, he gives another example, you cannot purify a wine stained pot by washing it with wine. You have to wash it with pure water. Then only you can cleanse away the wine stained pot. Similarly, simply by sacrificing animals, they can purify water. So, you can purify water by washing it with clean water. Similarly, you can purify the blood stained pot with pure water. Similarly, you can purify water with...

**Key Quote:** "One of the offenses is, do not perform any sinful activity on the strength of chanting Hare Krishna, thinking that even if a sinful person has committed a sin, by chanting Hare Krishna, his sinful reaction is nullified."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of avoiding sinful activities, especially meat eating, intoxication, gambling, and illicit sex, for devotees who chant Hare Krishna, explaining that chanting is not a license to sin.

...clean Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu particularly taught this Harinama Sankirtana Yajna. This is what he taught. But one should not indulge in animal killing and counteract it by performing the Harinama Yajna. There are some offenses to be considered in chanting Hare Krishna, in performing Sankirtana Yajna. What are the offenses? One of the offenses is, do not perform any sinful activity on the strength of chanting Hare Krishna, thinking that even if a sinful person has committed a sin, by chanting Hare Krishna, his sinful reaction is nullified. That is only for unintentional, inadvertent sins committed in spite of taking all care to avoid sin. Only such care. So, a devotee who chants Hare Krishna should be very responsible, should lead a responsible life, should completely avoid all sinful activities, especially avoid four types of sinful activities in Kali Yuga: meat eating, intoxication, gambling and illicit sex. Completely avoid them. And be careful not to perform any other sinful activities. So, then only, while chanting Hare Krishna, if accidentally there is some sin committed, then Krishna will pardon. This sinful reaction is nullified by chanting Hare Krishna. Krishna pardons. Those who are devotees of the Lord never kill an animal for self-interest. For their personal sake, they never kill an animal. Never. And, as the Lord ordered Arjuna, they do not refrain from performing the duty of a Kshatriya.

**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that the principle of Ahimsa does not excuse a Kshatriya from performing their duty and concludes that the ultimate goal is to act according to the will of the Lord, which is possible only for devotees dedicated to Krishna.

The principle of Ahimsa is, do not harm other creatures by indulging in violence. But, that does not mean a Kshatriya. A Kshatriya will not do his duty of killing miscreants. That is within the purview of Dharma, laws of Dharma. So, Krishna told Arjuna that by fighting in a Dharma Yudha, you will not incur sin. By not doing your duty, by avoiding, by not participating in a Dharma Yudha, you will incur sinful reactions. That is what Krishna tells Arjuna in Bhagavad Gita. That is being cited by Prabhupada here. The whole purpose, therefore, is served when everything is done for the will of the Lord. This is possible only for the devotees, who act according to the will of the Supreme Lord. It is devotees. Devotees' life is dedicated to Krishna. Therefore, they act only according to the will of the Lord. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Lord Shri Krishna caused three well-predicted well-performed Ashwamedha yajnas or horse sacrifices to be conducted by Maharaj Yudhishthira and thus caused his virtuous fame to be glorified in all directions like that of Indra who had performed 100 such sacrifices."
**Summary:** The lecture begins with the speaker reciting prayers and then introducing the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (1.8.6) that will be discussed, explaining that Yudhishthira's three horse sacrifices equaled Indra's fame from 100.

Om Agyanati Miran Dasya Gyanan Janishalakaya Chakshurun Militam Yena Tasmai Shri Gurave Namaha Nama Om Vishnu Padaya Krishna Preshtaya Bhutale Shri Mate Bhakti Vedanta Swamin Nithinamine Namaste Saraswate Deve Gauravani Pracharine Nirvishesha Shunyavadi Pachatya Deshatarine Jaya Shri Krishna Chaitanya Prabhu Nithyananda Shri Advaita Gadadhara Shiva Sadhi Gauravakta Vrinda Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Devim Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayamudhiya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam.

The meaning of this verse is: Lord Shri Krishna caused three well-predicted, well-performed Ashwamedha yajnas, or horse sacrifices, to be conducted by Maharaj Yudhishthira and thus caused his virtuous fame to be glorified in all directions like that of Indra who had performed 100

#### Srimad Bhagavatam, Parikshit Maharaj, Pandavas, Devotees

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So the Bhagavatam concerns not only description of the Supreme Lord and one or two devotees but actually concerns the Supreme Lord in relationship with his variegated devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the context of the verse, relating it to the questions of the sages of Naimisharanya and the birth of Parikshit Maharaj, emphasizing the importance of the Pandavas as pure devotees and the Bhagavatam's focus on the Lord's relationship with various devotees.

such sacrifices. So the comparison is made here. Yudhishthira performed only three horse sacrifices, but his fame equaled that of Indra, who performed 100 Ashwamedha yajnas. Another name for Indra is Shatakrtu, one who has performed Shata—Shata means 100—100 horse sacrifices. So how is this? Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, this is something like the preface to the performances of Ashwamedha yajna by Maharaj Yudhishthira. Now here, we should remember Suta Goswami is describing a past incident, a historical incident about the Pandavas. This is actually based on the questions asked by the sages of Naimisharanya to give the background: how is it that Parikshit Maharaj met Shukadev Goswami and heard the entire Bhagavatam from Shukadev Goswami? So, in order to describe the birth of this Parikshit Maharaj, the incidents leading to that are being described here because they will help us understand better the fact that who is Parikshit Maharaj, how he is a Mahabhagavata by birth itself, and how his activities are glorious. Even his preparation for death is very, very, very glorious. So everything is glorious about the exalted Mahabhagavata Parikshit Maharaj. So the description, because Parikshit is the grandson of the Pandavas, therefore the description is being given here. Pandavas themselves are Mahabhagavatas; they are pure devotees of the Supreme Lord, all the five of them. So therefore, the Bhagavatam concerns not only description of the Supreme Lord and one or two devotees, but actually concerns the Supreme Lord in relationship with his variegated devotees, yes, unlimited devotees, all relating with him in their own particular relationship. So we understand that from the Srimad Bhagavatam

#### Yudhishthira, Kurukshetra, Krishna, Pure Devotees, Kingship

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna actually conducted this battle of Kurukshetra in order to enthrone his pure devotee as the emperor of the world."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the historical context, including the end of the Kurukshetra war and Yudhishthira's enthronement, explaining that Krishna orchestrated the war to establish a pure devotee as ruler to guide citizens back to Godhead.

because all such descriptions are there. So therefore, the historical incident of Yudhishthira Maharaj, the end of the battle of Kurukshetra, this narration began when Ashwatthama attempted to kill—sorry, Ashwatthama killed the five sleeping sons of Draupadi, and he was punished. That was the seventh chapter, and the eighth chapter begins by telling that after that Yudhishthira, Yudhishthira was enthroned as the emperor of the world, and Krishna actually conducted this battle of Kurukshetra in order to enthrone his pure devotee as the emperor of the world. Why? Because a pure devotee carries out the mission of the Supreme Lord in this material world. What is that mission of the Supreme Lord in this world? The Lord has created this world in order to give a chance to the conditioned souls to try to enjoy materially and prepare themselves, especially in the human form of life, to actually return to their original consciousness, Krishna consciousness. So this is the whole program, and to facilitate this understanding and acting properly and preparing oneself to return to the original consciousness, the king has to guide the citizens of his kingdom in such a way that they all prepare themselves to go back to Godhead. And therefore, Krishna wants pure devotees to rule this world. So the Pandavas are pure devotees of Krishna; therefore, Krishna wants the Pandavas to rule the world. The Kauravas are not devotees of Krishna; therefore, Krishna arranged the battle of Kurukshetra in which the Kauravas were completely destroyed. So here, after Yudhishthira was enthroned as the emperor of the world, he performed three Ashwamedha yagnas again by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna.

#### Yudhishthira, Indra, Opulence, Pure Devotion, Fame
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/g_bpM5E5wRU?t=445
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The fame of Maharaj Yudhishthira was not less than that of Indra."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's explanation of Yudhishthira's comparison to Indra, highlighting that despite Indra's greater opulence, Yudhishthira's fame was equal due to his pure devotion to Krishna.

Now Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, the comparison of Maharaj Yudhishthira to the king of heaven is significant. In what way is it significant? Srila Prabhupada explains, the king of heaven is thousands and thousands of times greater than Maharaj Yudhishthira in opulence. Naturally, the opulence of the inhabitants of the heavenly planets is much, much, much, much more than those of the inhabitants of the earthly planets, and correspondingly, the king of heaven is many, many, many millions of times more opulent than the emperor of this earthly planet or this world. Yet it is described in the purport here, the fame of Maharaj Yudhishthira was not less than that of Indra. How is that so? The reason is that Maharaj Yudhishthira was a pure devotee of the Lord. See Maharaj Yudhishthira's special position. What is that? He is a pure devotee of Krishna. All the five partners, they are pure devotees of Krishna, and by Lord Krishna's grace only was King Yudhishthira on the level of the king of heaven. So the fame of Yudhishthira was because of his being a pure devotee of Krishna. A pure devotee is naturally very famous without any endeavor for attaining fame. By his actions, a pure devotee automatically becomes, naturally becomes, very famous. So Srila Prabhupada explains that even though King Yudhishthira performed only three Ashwamedha Yajnas, whereas the king of heaven performed hundreds, still Yudhishthira's fame was equal to that of Indra. So now Srila Prabhupada says that is a prerogative of the devotee of the Lord.

#### Krishna, Devotees, Equality, Mercy, Sunlight Analogy
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/g_bpM5E5wRU?t=595
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "A devotee of the Lord is more glorified because he is always in touch with the all great Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the potential perception of Krishna being partial, clarifying that Krishna is equal to all but devotees are glorified due to their constant connection with Him, using the analogy of sunlight reaching different places based on their receptive power.

Now here is a very important point, that somebody may think that Krishna is partial to his devotees. So Srila Prabhupada says no, Krishna is not partial to his devotees. The Lord is equal to everyone, equal to everyone, but a devotee of the Lord is more glorified because he is always in touch with the all-great, all-great Supreme Lord. This is the position of the devotee. He never forgets Krishna, Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is always in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead under all circumstances and all conditions, at all times, always, always in touch. So therefore, the pure devotees are naturally glorious. Now Srila Prabhupada gives an example here. The sun rays are equally distributed, but still there are some places which are always dark. This is, you can understand this example, it is not difficult, that the sun is shining brightly in the sky and distributing the rays equally, not only for this planet but for millions of other planets also. The sun is distributing the light and heat, but there are some places where the sunlight does not, does not reach at all. Those places will always be dark, always be dark. This is not due to the sun, but to the receptive power. Different places receive different quantity of sunlight when the sun is shining in the sky. That is dependent on the receptive power of the particular place. That is different.

#### Mercy, Krishna, Conditioned Souls, Part and Parcel, Rebellion
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/g_bpM5E5wRU?t=739
**Verse References:** BG 4
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Krishna wants us with him, but we are forgetful, we are rebellious, we are envious, we want to be separate, we want to be independent."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna freely gives his mercy and wants to deliver all conditioned souls, as everyone is part and parcel of Him, but our forgetfulness and rebellious nature prevent us from realizing this.

Similarly, now we understand this example, we can compare this example. Those who are sent percent devotees of the Lord get the full-fledged mercy of the Lord, which is always equally distributed everywhere. The Lord is equal to everyone. He freely gives away his mercy. He wants everyone to go back to him. That's why he speaks Bhagavad Gita. That's why he personally comes so many times in different incarnations. Personally he comes, he sends his representatives. He wants, he wants to deliver all the fallen conditioned souls because everyone belongs to him. Krishna in the fourth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita says, "Every living being is mine." Yajnatvana punarmoham evam yasyasi pandava sarvabhutani asheshani drakshasi atmani atomai. He says, "Every living entity is my part and parcel." Mamaivam shojeevaloke jeevabhutasanata vanatana. Eternally we are part and parcel of Krishna, so we have the same nature as Krishna, spiritual nature. So Krishna wants us with him, but we are forgetful, we are rebellious, we are envious, we want to be separate, we want to be independent. This is a fact. Many people may not agree, but with a cool and sober head, if you think over, you understand who you are essentially in a sense, and then you consider this, then you will realize and you will actually very easily be able to rectify your misconception and discover the mercy of the Lord, which is equally available for everyone always.

**Key Quote:** "The pure devotee of the Lord, who are 100% pure devotees, they get the full fledged mercy of the Lord because they want it."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that pure devotees receive the full mercy of the Lord because they are open and receptive to it, while others do not take it, and then ends the session.

So Prabhupada says the pure devotee of the Lord, who are 10% pure devotees, they get the full-fledged mercy of the Lord because they want it. They are open for receiving it, and others don't want it. They don't take it. That's all. It's available, but they don't take it. I'll stop here.

**Key Quote:** "Lord Shri Krishna then prepared for his departure."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam describing Krishna's preparation for departure from Hastinapura.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 7th verse of the 8th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Aamantrya Pandu Putramshcha Shaineyodhava Samyutaha Dwaipayana Adibhir Vipraihi Poojitai Pratipoojitaha. The meaning of this verse is: Lord Shri Krishna then prepared for his departure. He invited the sons of Pandu after having been worshipped by the brahmanas headed by Srila Vyasadeva. The Lord also reciprocated greetings.

#### Krishna's Supremacy, Varnashrama, Brahmanas, Kshatriyas
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/YfW_uuY71Z8?t=106
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna's position as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally a fact."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that although Krishna was acting as a Kshatriya, the Brahmanas worshipped Him because they knew Him to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead, emphasizing Krishna's eternal position.

We should understand the historical incidents in the proper context that Krishna came from Dwaraka in order to conduct the battle of Kurukshetra, and after the battle of Kurukshetra, Yudhishthira was enthroned as the Emperor, and Krishna, having completed his mission in visiting Hastinapura, is now preparing for his departure to go to Kurukshetra in order to return to Dwaraka. That is being described here, that Krishna prepared for his departure, and when he was leaving Hastinapura, the Brahmanas headed by Srila Vyasadeva worshiped Krishna. So, that is explained by Srila Prabhupada in the purport. Apparently, Lord Sri Krishna was a Kshatriya and was not worshipable by the Brahmanas. The convention is Kshatriyas should worship Brahmanas. That is the Varanashrama division of the society, members of the society. But the Brahmanas present there in Hastinapura, headed by Srila Vyasa Deva, all knew him, that is, knew Krishna, to be the personality of Godhead, and therefore they worshipped him. So, they were not wrong in worshipping a Kshatriya. The Brahmanas were not wrong because even though Krishna was playing the part of a Kshatriya, Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead under all circumstances, at all times, in all places.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "He does not lose his position even though he may assume a subordinate position."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's unchanging position as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even when He assumes a subordinate role, like that of Arjuna's chariot driver.

In the material world, everybody's position is a temporary, changeable position. Krishna's position as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally a fact, no matter what activities are performed by Krishna. Krishna may perform the role of the chariot driver of Arjuna, but that does not make Krishna come down to a lower position. No, he does not come down in his position. His position remains the same, absolute, always the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That's how, even though he is seated on the chariot of Arjuna as the chariot driver, Sarathi, but still when Arjuna was perplexed, Krishna instructed Arjuna, and through Arjuna, the entire human society in the subject matter of Bhagavad Gita. So when he is speaking as Bhagavad Gita, he is speaking as the Supreme Lord. In fact, his actions, all his actions are performed in his original position only. He does not lose his position even though he may assume a subordinate position. He may assume an unequal position, but his position is unchanged.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Those who know Krishna properly, they always understand he is Eternal Lord, and he is eternally the controller, eternally the master, and he is eternally worshipped by everyone."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that the Brahmanas, led by Vyasadeva, knew Krishna's true nature and worshipped Him accordingly, and that Krishna reciprocated greetings to honor social order.

So therefore, the Brahmanas headed by Vyasadeva in Hastinapura, they knew Krishna to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Eternal Lord, at all times, circumstances, at all times. So therefore, they properly worshipped him. Those who know Krishna properly, they always understand he is Eternal Lord, and he is eternally the controller, eternally the master, and he is eternally worshipped by everyone. Hmm. The Lord reciprocated the greetings just to honour the social order that a Kshatriya is obedient to the orders of the Brahmanas. Now, when the Brahmanas offer something to Krishna, Krishna reciprocates properly, receiving it, just to honour the social custom. Hmm. That a Kshatriya is obedient to the orders of the Brahmanas. That is social custom. Although Lord Sri Krishna was always offered the respects due the Supreme Lord from all responsible quarters, the Lord never deviated from the customary usages between the four orders of society.

**Verse References:** BG 4.13
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Society can be perfectly organised in that way."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the varnashrama dharma, explaining that Krishna created the four divisions of society based on qualities and work, and that the goal is ultimate liberation through performance of one's duty and worship of Vishnu.

In the fourth chapter of Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says, chaaturvarnyam maya-srishtam guna-karma-vibhaga-saha. He says, it is I who have created these four divisions of social orders in human society: chaaturvarnyam brahmana-kshatriya-vaisa-shudra. Society can be perfectly organised in that way: the intellectuals, the administrators, the business class, the productive class, that is the business class, and the labourers. And different people have different skills, different qualities. They are born under different influences of the gunas. Accordingly, they can be engaged properly in some livelihood, means of livelihood. But everybody is entitled, eligible for ultimate liberation in the human form of life. And that's what the whole varnashrama dharma is about: how to worship Vishnu by performance of your duty in such a way that you will actually be ultimately liberated from material bondage.

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "As soon as he seated himself on the chariot to start for Dwaraka, Krishna has seated himself."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna observed social customs to set an example and then introduces the next verse where Uttara hurries towards Krishna in fear.

So Krishna never deviates from the customary usages between the four orders of society. The Lord purposely observed all these social customs so that others would follow him in the future. See, to set an example, Krishna says in the third chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, yad yad acharati shrestha ha tattadeve tarojanah sayat pramanam kurute lokas tad anuvartate. Then, in the next verse, the eighth verse, it is said here, gantum krta matir brahman tvarakam ratam asthitah upalebe abhi dhavantim uttaram bhaya vikvalam. The meaning of this verse is, as soon as he seated himself on the chariot to start for Dwaraka, Krishna has seated himself. He has made preparations for his departure and he is seated on the chariot. He saw Uttara hurrying towards him in fear.

#### Uttara, Dependence on Krishna, Pure Devotees, Protection
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/YfW_uuY71Z8?t=623
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Lord protects everyone, but one who depends completely upon him is especially looked after by the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Uttara's situation and emphasizes the complete dependence of the Pandavas on Krishna's protection, explaining that pure devotees are especially cared for by the Lord.

Uttara is the wife of Abhimanyu, the daughter-in-law of Arjuna and Subhadra, whose son is Abhimanyu. Abhimanyu was killed in the battle of Kurukshetra. So, Uttara had lost her husband in the battle. So, she was hurrying towards Krishna in fear. Now, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, all the members of the family of the Pandavas were completely dependent on the protection of the Lord. Why? Because they are all pure devotees of the Lord. All the members of the family of the Pandavas, all of them are pure devotees of the Lord. And the symptom or characteristic of a pure devotee is complete dependence, dependence on the protection of the Lord. In fact, for anyone, there is no other protection outside the protection of Krishna. That's a fact. That's true for everybody, not just for the pure devotees. But, pure devotees know this fact and they always seek shelter of Krishna's lotus feet, Krishna's protection. Because the members of the family of the Pandavas are completely dependent on protection of the Supreme Lord, therefore, the Lord protected all of them in all circumstances. It is reciprocal. The Lord protects everyone, but one who depends completely upon him is especially looked after by the Lord. The father is more attentive to the little son who is exclusively dependent on the father. The example is being given by Srila Prabhupada. The father has many children. The grown up ones may not require as much care and attention and protection as much as the little one. So, the little son who is exclusively dependent on the father, the father is more attentive. Similarly, the pure devotees who are especially completely dependent upon him, the Lord is more attentive.

#### Uttara's Prayer, Protection, Death, Mrtyuloka

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "O Lord of Lords, Lord of the Universe, You are the greatest of mystics. Please protect me for there is no one else who can save me from the clutches of death in this world of duality."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Uttara's prayer for protection from death, emphasizing that only Krishna can save one in this world of duality, and concludes by stating that the reason for her fear will be explained in the next verse.

And in the ninth verse, Uttara is telling the Supreme Lord, uttaro vacha pahi pahi mahayogin deva deva jagatpate nanyam tvad abhayam pashye yatra mrtyu parasparam. The meaning is that Uttara said, O Lord of Lords, Lord of the Universe, You are the greatest of mystics. Please protect me for there is no one else who can save me from the clutches of death in this world of duality. There is no one who can save me in this world of duality from the clutches of death. This world is called Mrtyuloka, a place where death is certain for everyone who takes birth. Krishna describes in the Bhagavad Gita, jatasyahi dhruva-mrtyur dhruvam janma-mrtyasya ca. For anyone who has taken birth in the material world, death is certain. That means this body, life in this body is going to come to an end. It is not going to be there forever. The soul is eternal, but the life in this body is not eternal. So that time comes when we have to quit the body, that is called death. So in this world of death, who can save anyone except Krishna? Nobody else can save. So therefore, Uttara is telling, please protect me for there is no one else who can save me from the clutches of death. So therefore, the response of the Lord also will be described and before that Uttara's prayer is not complete. Why is she asking for protection? That will be explained in the next verse. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the significance of Bhishma's instructions to Yudhishthira and the liberation attained through Krishna consciousness at the time of death, referencing Srila Prabhupada's purport.

in the presence of Lord Krishna. So the first verse: Suta Vacha Iti Bheeta Praja Drohat Sarva Dharma Vivitsaya Tato Vinashanam Praagat Yatra Deva Vrata Apatat. The meaning of this verse is: Suta Goswami said, "Being afraid for having killed so many subjects on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, Maharaj Yudhishthira went to the scene of the massacre. There Bhishma Deva was lying on a bed of arrows about to pass away." A new chapter. This will describe Bhishma's instructions to Yudhishthira to pass away from Kurukshetra to Yudhishthira and also Bhishma offering wonderful prayers before quitting his body. Bhishma offering wonderful prayers to Krishna. He was fortunate that Krishna was present in front of him when Bhishma was to quit his body. That's Krishna's blessing on Bhishma Deva, who was, who is a great devotee of Krishna, one of the Mahajanas of the ideal devotees of Krishna. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "In this ninth chapter, as it is billed by Lord Sri Krishna, Bhishma Deva will impart instructions to King Yudhishthira on the subject of occupational duties, Sarva Dharma Vivitsaya. Bhishma Deva will impart about occupational duties, Sarva Dharma Vivitsaya. Bhishma Deva will also offer his last prayer to the Lord on the verge of passing away

from this mortal world and thus become liberated from the bondage of further material engagements. Those who are Krishna conscious at the time of death, they don't have to take birth again in this material world, they straight go back to Godhead. No more birth in this material world, no more material existence. So Bhishma Deva was fortunate to be able to offer his last prayer to the Lord on the verge of passing away from this mortal world. Mortal world is the place of death. There is no such death in the spiritual world because in the spiritual world nobody has a material body, everybody has a spiritual form. There is no death. Of course, for the spirit soul there is no death even in this world, but the spirit soul has to keep on taking different material bodies one after another and that is the sum and substance of material existence, samsara, repetition of birth and death. But in the spiritual world there is no birth, there is no death, there is no material body, there is no material

**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of 'Praja' as all living beings, not just humans, and emphasizes the king's responsibility to protect all creatures within his domain.

that's the perfection of life. So Srila Prabhupada explains in another place that King Yudhishthira, he was such a responsible for his life that he was a great devotee of his life and he was a responsible person that he became afraid that I've killed so many Praja. Now the word Praja is very important to understand. Praja just doesn't mean the human population of a particular place, it means all the living beings or creatures were born in a particular place. So when we say Praja of this Bharata Varsha it means not only human beings who have taken birth in Bharata Varsha but even the animals, the birds, the trees, all the creatures they are called Praja. So Srila Prabhupada explains pra means in that word Praja prakrishta roopena there is a meaning in sanskrit for each word so the word is also um formed by combining pra ja ja means jayate takes birth so every living entity takes birth in some particular place whether it is a tree or a bird or an insect or an animal or a human being they take birth in a particular place so when people understand this if somebody has taken birth in america they are called american national national why american national because they could take birth in america so the government extends a certain facilities for those who have taken birth in america they consider them as american national similarly prabhupada is telling what about the animals which are taken birth in america whatever you the trees which are taken birth in america what about them they also require protection the government or the head of the state or the king of a particular country has to give protection not only to the human beings but even to the animals the birds the trees that is the duty and that is the proper responsibility that's the proper way of taking responsibility for a

So then it is said tato vinashanam praagat he wanted to understand from the place where the fighting was held. He wanted to understand what is to be done about this huge number of people who are killed what is to be done about it. So he is going to hear from Bhishma and Bhishma is the authority who can speak on Dharma. Now Dharma does not mean some religious faith as people think Dharma means the occupational duty occupational duty. Dharma means the word dharma also means the intrinsic quality of so in all these senses particularly in this context it is occupational duty. What is the duty of a king who actually was involved in this battle when so many 640 million kshatras. No one. Nobody. were killed in this battle. So, what is his duty now? Is there sinful reaction? Is there any kind of atonement? Is there any way out of avoiding the reactions, atoning for the reactions? So, he is going to hear from Bhishma. So, that is the significance of this particular shloka. And it is also told Bhishma, because along with Yudhishthira, Krishna also went driving the chariot of Arjuna. And in the presence of Krishna, Bhishma was fortunate to quit his body. That will be described in detail in the later part of the chapter.

**Key Quote:** "Even if Krishna comes in front of us, are we able to recognize he who is the supreme personality of God?"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the difficulty in recognizing Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even when He is present, using the example of Duryodhana's failure to recognize Krishna during the peace negotiations before the Kurukshetra war.

And since Bhishma Deva knew of his glories, he worshipped him duly. If you remember, in an earlier verse, it was described when the Pandavas were coming to the battlefield where Bhishma was lying on a bed of arrows. Krishna accompanied the Pandavas. So, Bhishma was very, very fortunate and blessed to have Krishna in front of him when he was about to quit the body. Krishna is directly present in front of Bhishma. And here it is said, even if Krishna comes in front of us, are we able to recognize he who is the supreme personality of Godhead Krishna? Not necessarily, because Krishna looks like a human being. We may think when Krishna comes in front of us, here is another human being, and we may not be able to recognize him. It is said in the scriptures, even when Krishna incarnated five thousand years back on the earth planet and moved around in human society, many, many people thought he was an ordinary person. He was another human being. They could not recognize him because he looked like a human being, and we may not be able to recognize him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A very good example is there in the Mahabharata when Krishna went with the peace proposal on behalf of Maharaja Yudhishthira before the Battle of Kurukshetra was about to begin, to avoid that battle, world war. It was not just a battle, it was a world war. Yudhishthira wanted to negotiate for peace and Duryodhana refused, so Yudhishthira thought, let me send Krishna. Krishna went to Duryodhana, but Duryodhana thought Krishna is another king of Dwarka, another politician, and he thought Krishna is very diplomatic in bringing a peace proposal from Yudhishthira. So Duryodhana did not recognize Krishna as a Supreme Personality of Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "Bhishma Deva is one of the Mahajanas...who know the religious principles perfectly and who know the goal of the practice of all religious principles is simply to understand Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Bhishma Deva's position as one of the Mahajanas, who possess perfect knowledge of religious principles and understand that the ultimate goal is to understand Krishna, and highlights the significance of Bhishma's instructions to Yudhishthira in the Mahabharata.

Got it? And Krishna, in order to convince Duryodhana that Krishna is not an ordinary person, Krishna showed one of his universal forms to Duryodhana, and Duryodhana thought Krishna is using some mystic power to bewilder Duryodhana, to force him to accept the peace proposal. Duryodhana said, I am not going to be carried away by your display of some mystic power. See, in spite of Krishna showing to Duryodhana I am not an ordinary person, Duryodhana could not recognize. So it is important to note here, it is said since Bhishma Deva knew of his glories, he worshipped Krishna duly. Bhishma Deva is one of the Mahajanas. The Mahajanas are twelve great personalities in this universe who know the religious principles perfectly and who know the goal of the practice of all religious principles is simply to understand Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to attain the lotus feet of the shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna is the goal of following all religious principles. This is known only to the Mahajanas. Bhishma Deva is one of the Mahajanas. He knows who is Krishna. He knows who are the living entities. He knows what is this world, why this creation, what is the goal of life. All these things are known to Bhishma, and Bhishma's instructions to Yudhishthira forms the bulk of the wisdom given in the Mahabharata. Over three Parvas, out of 18 Parvas, Bhishma's instructions to Yudhishthira are covered. Bhishma Parva, Anushasana Parva and Shanti Parva. Three Parvas. Parvas are big volumes of which the Mahabharata is constituted or divided. So 18 Parvas are there and out of those 18, three of them, the bulk of the Mahabharata is describing Yudhishthira's, sorry Bhishma's instructions to Yudhishthira on the

He is not an ordinary person. He is not another King. He is not just a powerful King. He is the Supreme Lord of all Lords. He is above everyone including the topmost Devatas, Brahma, Shiva, everybody. So that Bhishma Deva knew. In the Purport Srila Pravapath says the Lord's omnipotency is displayed by simultaneous presence in every place. Krishna is present everywhere in every place in the material world, in the spiritual world, everywhere. This is called omnipresence. He is present everywhere. And that is because of his omnipotency.

**Key Quote:** "Even though you're so tiny your consciousness is spread throughout the body similarly it is explained in the scriptures Krishna in his form as Garbhodakashayi Vishnu has entered this universe."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of the individual spirit soul's consciousness spreading throughout the body to explain how Krishna, as Garbhodakashayi Vishnu, is present and conscious throughout the entire universe.

Powerful, so he can be present and he is present everywhere. To give you an example, each one of us, we are very, very tiny spirit soul. It's a small particle of spiritual atom, very, very tiny. How small? One by ten thousandth part of the tip of the hair point in size. So that small tiny spiritual atom is inside the heart of this body. Now the consciousness of that tiny spirit is spread everywhere in the body. Compared to that tiny, very, very small spirit soul, this body is quite big, and the conscience is spread so perfectly all over the body that if an ant bites the tip of your toe, you immediately come to know about it. An ant may bite you somewhere in the top of your head, you immediately come to know about it. Any part of the body the ant bites, you immediately come to know about it. So even though you're so tiny, your consciousness is spread throughout the body. Similarly, it is explained in the scriptures, Krishna in his form as Garbhodakashayi Vishnu has entered this universe. He is present as Vishwatma, the soul of the universe. So just like my consciousness is spread throughout the body, even though I am just in the heart region, a very tiny spirit soul, similarly, even though Krishna is the spirit soul, the supreme spirit within the universe, his consciousness is spread throughout the universe. The gigantic universe consists of millions of planets. Each planet have millions of living beings. Everywhere throughout the universe, Krishna's consciousness is spread. So he is conscious of every part of the universe. Not only he is present within the universe, he has entered the universe, he has entered the heart of every living being. Every living being's heart is present.

**Key Quote:** "Vaishnava philosophy clearly explains the truth that the atma and paramatma are two not one though in the scriptures it is explained that the atma and paramatma are one in quality both are spiritual by nature qualitative equality."
**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between the individual soul (atma) and the Supreme Soul (Paramatma), refuting the Mayavada philosophy that claims they are one and the same, and emphasizing the Vaishnava understanding of their distinct quantitative differences despite qualitative similarity.

So he is also conscious of every body. In fact, that is the difference between ourselves and Krishna, atma and paramatma. There is so much of, so many different philosophies describing whether the atma and paramatma are two distinct different entities or they are one. Most people are misled by the mayavada philosophy which says atma and paramatma are one. Vaishnava philosophy clearly explains the truth that the atma and paramatma are two, not one. Though in the scriptures it is explained that the atma and paramatma are one in quality, both are spiritual by nature, qualitative equality. Quantitatively, they are distinctly different. Quantitatively, the tiny spirit is only conscious of one body. I am conscious of my body, you are conscious of your body, another person is conscious of his or her body only, whereas Krishna is conscious of everybody. Krishna is conscious of billions and trillions and innumerable bodies, everybody. So this is distinctly different in terms of quantity, omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient.

He is all-knowing. He is all-powerful. He is present everywhere, every nook and corner. So that Krishna is present in front of Bhishma Deva. So don't wrongly think Krishna is an ordinary person or just another powerful king. No. Krishna is the supreme person, the Personality of God. So here the word that is used by Vyasa Deva to describe this, Asinam Jagadishwaram. Jagadishwaram. The lord of the universe. The lord of the universe is sitting in front of Bhishma Deva. So and it is said here, Krishna manifests his transcendental form by his internal potency, mayaya upatvigraham. Krishna's form is completely transcendental. You know, it looks like a material form of a human being. It is not a material form. Krishna's form is completely transcendental. And Bhishma knew about this. And therefore Bhishma duly worshipped him. Bhishma did not receive him as another king. No. Bhishma knew. Here is the supreme personality of God. He duly worshipped him.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of the joint family system and the role of elders in guiding and caring for the younger generation, drawing a parallel to Bhishma's role in raising the Pandavas.

So this is a very touching scene. On the battlefield, after the battle is over, Bhishma is ready to quit his body. The Pandavas have come there, arrived there. The Pandavas were sitting near Bhishma Deva, overtaken with affection for their dying grandfather. The Pandavas could remember how Bhishma Deva actually took charge of their protection when Pandu died early, when the Pandavas were very young. So Bhishma took charge of the upbringing of the Pandavas. So they were naturally feeling so much affection for Bhishma Deva. They were very grateful. So Bhishma Deva met the Pandavas. And as far as Bhishma Deva is concerned, He was very happy to see the Pandavas getting back their kingdom, which was rightfully theirs. Only because of injustice by the Kauravas, the Pandavas were deprived so far of their kingdom. So Bhishma Deva... covered by the Kauravas. So far the Pandavas were deprived so far of their kingdom. So Bhishma Deva was overwhelmed with love and affection and there were tears in his eyes. He was very happy that the Pandavas got back their kingdom after the battle of Kurukshetra. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, when Maharaj Pandu died, his sons were all small children and naturally they were brought up under the affection of elderly members of the royal family, specifically by Bhishma Deva. This is the very culture that the joint family system that prevails. Earlier, especially in the ancient times, everyone was properly taken care of by the elderly members of the family, especially the younger ones were taken care of by the elderly members of the family.

**Key Quote:** "Now in the modern society, this joint family system is no longer prevalent and therefore the children are missing out a great deal of wisdom that they could have got from the elders of the family in a joint family system."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the joint family system with modern nuclear families, highlighting the lack of elderly care and guidance for children in the latter.

So in a joint family system, the elders are there to guide the youngsters in every respect. It's not that we learn only by going to a particular school or going for some specific skill development only. No, one can learn simply by being in the association of great personalities, of responsible people. Just by observing, just by being in the association, so many things can be learned. Now in the modern society, this joint family system is no longer prevalent and therefore the children are missing out a great deal of wisdom that they could have got from the elders of the family in a joint family system. In these nuclear families, if... let us say, the mother or the father is not at home, the children are deprived so much of elderly care. And the conditions are becoming worse when both the parents have to go to work and the children are under the care of some maids or some neighbors or some daycares.

**Summary:** The speaker details Duryodhana's envy and cheating of the Pandavas, and Bhishma's difficult position as he was bound to support the caretaker king, Dhritarashtra.

such as Bhishma Dev. up bringing of these Pandavas in the palace, Hastinapura palace. Later on when the Pandavas were grown up, they were cheated by cunning Duryodhana and company. The Kauravas, especially Duryodhana. Duryodhana was very very envious of the Pandavas. Very envious of the Pandavas, because he knew that even though his father was the caretaker king, because of Pandu's early death, and the Pandavas were not of age, they were not mature to assume the throne. So Bhishma had taken a vow never to occupy the throne. So Bhishma could not take charge of ruling. And then Dhritarashtra was disqualified because he was blind. But in the absence of a suitable king to rule the whole world in the Kuru dynasty, so Bhishma instructed Dhritarashtra to be the caretaker king. The son of Pandu will inherit from his father, the kingdom. Pandu was the eligible king when he was ruling, but he died early. And therefore, Yudhishthira had to take charge, but Yudhishthira had to wait. So in the meantime, this Dhritarashtra was the caretaker king. They were cheated by cunning Duryodhana and party. So many ways Duryodhana cheated the Pandavas by an unfair gambling match. And before that also, he was occupying the throne and giving the Pandavas some small place, some insignificant place, to rule. So it was just plain cheating. No doubt about it. But Bhishma Deva, even though he knew the Pandavas were innocent and were unnecessarily put into trouble, Bhishma Deva could not take the side of the Pandavas for political reasons. Bhishma was being maintained by Dhritarashtra and Dhritarashtra was the caretaker king. So Bhishma thought that since Dhritarashtra was the caretaker king, he could not take the side of the Pandavas for political reasons. So Bhishma was being maintained by Dhritarashtra and Dhritarashtra was the caretaker king.

minded cunning cheating mentality asuri swabhava this is Duryodhana and Duryodhana was supported even not only by Dhritarashtra even his younger brothers they were also supporting him so whole gang of cheaters and cunning persons cunning fellows so Bhishma was feeling very very sorry for the Pandavas that he could not take their side and when the battle was fought Bhishma had to fight on the side of the Kauravas and Bhishma was very very straightforward and upright and righteous person so he would not cheat the Kauravas when fighting on their side but in spite of that because it will be extremely Because of Krishna, the Pandavas were protected in spite of the Kauravas being very very strong, they could not win the battle. So when Bhishmadeva saw his most exalted grandsons, the Pandavas, headed by Maharaja Yudhishthira, sitting very gently at his side, the great warrior grandfather could not check his loving tears which were automatically flowing from his eyes. So he was very very satisfied and happy that my grandsons, the Pandavas, who were cheated by Duryodhana, now they have got back their kingdom. They got back their kingdom. And Bhishmadeva knew it very well. The Pandavas are very very righteous, so virtuous, so they rule the kingdom perfectly. The citizens, the whole world will be benefited by Pandavas ruling the world. Krishna also wanted that. He wanted the Pandavas, his devotees, to rule the world. Not the non-devotee party of Duryodhana. No. That's why Krishna arranged the battle of Kurukshetra. And it is explained, Krishna arranged to assemble all those miscreants who had escaped the various times when Krishna was engaged in killing the demoniac natured persons. Krishna came to reduce the burden of the earth which was overburdened by demoniac forces. So all those who were remaining, they were assembled by Krishna's arrangement on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. All of them were killed. So Bhishma was very very happy. And Krishna arranged that Bhishma see the Pandavas after they had won the battle, and he could die peacefully, satisfied that there was justice ultimately for the Pandavas.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Yudhisthira's unwavering adherence to Dharma, which Duryodhana exploited to cheat the Pandavas and send them into exile.

So Bhishma Deva is speaking to the Pandavas. He is very much in line, not just with your sup& tú & phimbs factory, he is in line with our spiritual warp positions, very happy that the Pandavas have won the battle, and he's shedding tears of ecstasy seeing the Pandavas having won the battle of Kurukshetra and got back their lost kingdom. So he is now remarking, "What terrible sufferings and what terrible injustices you good souls suffer." The Pandavas are headed by Yudhishtira. Yudhishtira is the son of Dharma, Yama Dharma Raja, Yama Raj, the one who gives justice. He administers justice to all those souls at the end of their human beings, at the end of their life. If they have deviated from the religious principles, then according to the degree of violation, they are given suitable punishment by Yama Raj. So Yudhishtira, as a son of Yama Raj, he knows perfectly what is Dharma, and he was very, very strictly following all the religious principles. And that was how Dyuryodhana was able to cheat Yudhishtira and the Pandavas, even though sometimes Bhima would actually protest against Yudhishthira's being very, very righteous against Duryodhana's cheating. Then even when Duryodhana, there was a lot of people who cheating, Bhima would protest, but still Yudhishthira would not break any religious principle in order to avoid getting cheated by Duryodhana. Duryodhana took undue advantage, knowing very well that Yudhishthira is very righteous, he took undue advantage of that, and that is how Yudhishthira was, and the Pandavas were cheated and sent away to exile in the forest for 13 years.

**Key Quote:** "Shakuni decided I am going to completely destroy this Kuru dynasty so in order to destroy the Kuru dynasty he plotted with this Duryodhana knowing very well that Duryodhana wants to cheat the Pandavas"
**Summary:** The speaker details Duryodhana's sinister plan to keep the Pandavas in perpetual exile and Shakuni's motivation for destroying the Kuru dynasty due to his sister Gandhari's marriage to the blind king Dhritarashtra.

And Duryodhana was ruling for 13 years, and he was making all plans that when they come back, his plan was never that they should come back. You know how cleverly Duryodhana had sent them away in exile. He had sent them away for 12 years they live in the forest, and the 13th year, the last year, one year they live incognito, they have to hide somewhere. And if Duryodhana and party discover where they are hiding, then another 13 years they will go for exile. Duryodhana's plan was that he will have his informers everywhere, and wherever the Pandavas go for hiding, he'll discover, he'll point out the Pandavas are hiding here, and then send them again in 13 years. So he thought, "As long as I'm alive, or as long as the Pandavas are alive, I'll be ruling, because wherever the Pandavas are, I'll discover where they are hiding and send them again and again 13, 13, 13, 13 years." This was the plan, that sinister plan this Duryodhana had made in consultation with his maternal uncle Shakuni. Shakuni was very much angry at the Kuru dynasty because his beautiful sister Gandhari, who was the most eligible princess before she was married, she was married to the blind king Vritrashtra. So he was very, very unhappy, "My sister did not get a suitable husband." That was what Shakuni, the brother of Gandhari, was thinking. So when he saw that he could not stop Gandhari getting married to Dhritarashtra, then the blind king, he decided, "I am going to marry Vritrashtra, completely destroy this Kuru dynasty," because Dhritarashtra was the head of the Kuru dynasty as the emperor of the world. Of course, he was a caretaker king, but still Shakuni decided, "I am going to completely destroy this Kuru dynasty." So in order to destroy the Kuru dynasty, he plotted with this Duryodhana, knowing very well that Duryodhana wants to cheat the Pandavas, and in that way the Pandavas will not be able to rule the Kuru dynasty, successors will not be able to rule the world properly. He wanted that the Pandavas should not rule the world by being cheated of their claim for the throne. So he and Duryodhana plotted to cheat the Pandavas in a gambling match.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how Shakuni used his gambling expertise to ensure Yudhishthira's defeat, leading to the Pandavas' exile, and reiterates Bhishma's lament about the injustice they faced.

You see, this is, this is how Duryodhana was not very, very intelligent in that sense to have cheated the Pandavas, but Shakuni, he was expert in this gambling. So he, he arranged in such a way that always Duryodhana will win and Yudhishthira will lose the match, and that's how Yudhishthira lost everything and simply was sent away to the forest. So Bhishma Dev was remarking, "Oh, how terrible it is that you good souls, you don't deserve to actually suffer in this way, because you're upright, you're morally upright, you're following all the religious principles perfectly, still you have to suffer so much injustice."

**Summary:** The speaker recounts the story of the shellac palace, Duryodhana's attempt to burn the Pandavas alive, and how Vidura's warning allowed them to escape through a secret tunnel.

And he's further telling, "You did not deserve to remain alive under those tribulations." They should have died so many instances. For example, they were sent to a palace which is built with shellac, combustible material. But Vidura came to know about this and secretly informed Yudhishthira, and Yudhishthira with the help of Vidura actually managed to escape this plot by Duryodhana. Duryodhana and Pati, they were living with the Kauravas in the same palace, but Duryodhana once made this plan that, "Why the Pandavas should share the palace with us? Let us build them a beautiful palace, a very, very nice palace elsewhere, and then let them live separately. Why they should share, why we should share?" So he built another palace, beautiful palace, but he had arranged the palace into a mountain that it be built with combustible material, shellac. And when the Pandavas have gone and settled down there, suddenly one day he will arrange to set it on fire and they'll be burnt alive inside before they can escape, because immediately the fire will spread everywhere. So this was Duryodhana's plan. And because Yudhishthira came to know from Vidura before even moving to that new palace, Yudhishthira arranged to secretly dig a tunnel from underneath that new palace. And they escaped, Pandavas escaped before it could be set on fire. In fact, the Mahabharata says the Pandavas themselves set it on fire and escaped.

Through the tunnel. So when it was completely set on fire, everybody thought the Pandavas are inside that palace and they have been burnt alive. So even Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana, they knew that the Pandavas were not safe. They knew that they were supposed to be cheated in this way. But still, because of Dhritarashtra's blind affection for his son, unworthy son Duryodhana, and Duryodhana's enviousness and jealousy towards the Pandavas, that this whole plot was carried out. And they thought that they had effectively gotten rid of the Pandavas. But actually the Pandavas had escaped. So he was not going to escape. He was not going to escape.

**Key Quote:** "Morality is always on the side of the righteous persons who are God-conscious people. Those who are godless, they can never be morally upright. Never, never."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the Pandavas were protected by Brahmanas, God (Krishna), and religion because of their righteousness, contrasting this with the lack of morality in godless individuals like Duryodhana.

So he was not going to escape. But he was not going to escape. So he was not going to escape. So, here it is said, all these types of terrible injustices, they actually were able to avoid being killed because of the protection by the Brahmanas, God, and religion. Brahmanas, because Brahmanas always bless those who are righteous, those who are following religious principles. Brahmanas will never extend blessings to sinful people, to unrighteous people like Duryodhana. They can never get the blessings of Brahmanas. Similarly, God, Krishna. Krishna is always on the side of Dharma. In the end of the Bhagavad Gita, it is said, "Morality is always on the side of the righteous persons who are God-conscious people. Those who are godless, they can never be morally upright. Never, never." Sometimes they make a show of being morally upright, but that is just a show. It is cheating, actually. It is to... To fool innocent people that we are very morally upright. We are truthful. We are honest. We are hardworking. But actually, if somebody is godless, even if they make a show of being honest, it is no real value. It is no real value. So, like that, Bhagavad Gita teaches us that morality is always with the god-conscious people, not with godless people. Always with the divine-natured people, never with demoniac-natured persons. Never. They cannot be morally upright. Not possible. So the Pandavas were protected, as Bhishma Deva is telling, by Brahmanas, by God, Krishna, and by religion.

The religious principles itself, is a protection. Those who follow religious principles, that religion, those religion, religion itself protects them. In the sense, the administrator of religious principles, Yama. Yama will always protect those who are following religious principles. He will punish those who are law-breakers, those who are irreligious, those who are going, violating religious principles. And this is the reason always, the Pandavas did not actually get killed, so many times, they were attempted to be killed.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 13th verse of the 9th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on Bhishma's recollection of Kunti Devi's suffering after Pandu's death.

In this session we will be discussing from the 13th verse of the 9th chapter of the first canto of Sriman Bhagavatam.

The meaning of this verse is, this is spoken by Bhishma, he is speaking to the Pandavas, as far as my daughter-in-law Kunti is concerned, upon the great general Pandu's death, she became a widow with many children and therefore she suffered greatly, and when you were grown up, she suffered a great deal also because of your actions. So Bhishma Deva is recollecting the history of the Pandavas, particularly Kunti Devi, she suffered more than the others, the Pandavas themselves.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Kunti's challenges as a widow raising five children, including Madri's decision to perform Sati and entrust her sons to Kunti's care.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the third quote, the sufferings of Kunti Devi are doubly lamented. She suffered greatly because of early widowhood and to get her minor children brought up in the royal family. Kunti Devi was one of the wives of the great general Pandu and Madri was the second wife. When Pandu died early, the children are all very small, three sons of Kunti Devi and two sons of Madri. Totally Pandu had five sons. Now Madri decided to actually perform the Sati rite, that means she wanted to quit her body along with the funeral of General Pandu on his death. It is called Sahagamana in Sanskrit and she entrusted her sons to the care of Kunti Devi and Kunti took responsibility for raising not only her three sons but even her co-wives two sons. So all the five Pandavas came under the care of Kunti Devi and Kunti Devi herself, she is without any protection as far as her husband is concerned, so she had to take shelter of the parents of Hastinapura which was having Dhritarashtra as the caretaker king and of course Bhishma was there and Vidura was also there in the palace. Bhishma was like the

father-in-law of Kunti Devi. Pandu's father Vichitravirya and Vichitravirya's brother was Bhishma, so Pandu's uncle, Bhishma was Pandu's uncle. So Bhishma had taken a vow to rule the kingdom, not to sit on the throne as the emperor of the world, he forsaken his claim and Vidura was not entitled. Vidura was one of the brothers of Dhritarashtra and Pandu, so Vidura was not entitled because he was the son of a maidservant, so Dasiputra, so he had no claim for the throne, but he was very, very wise, very intelligent and Dhritarashtra relied on his guidance, his advice, more than guidance it was advice. So both Vidura as the brother-in-law of Kunti Devi and Bhishma as the father-in-law of Kunti Devi, they were actually sympathetic to the Pandavas and therefore Kunti was under the care of the elders in the royal palace of Hastinapura.

**Key Quote:** "Kunti had to suffer a great deal of trouble from this envious Duryodhana and his brothers also and when Kunti's children were grown up she continued to suffer because of her son's actions"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the threats from Duryodhana and the continued suffering of Kunti, attributing it to destiny and the control of higher authorities.

But there were attempts by Duryodhana supported by Dhritarashtra to kill the Pandavas before they could even grow up, become adults. So Kunti had to suffer a great deal of trouble from this envious Duryodhana and his brothers also. And when Kunti's children were grown up, she continued to suffer because of her son's actions, whatever she is a widow. So once her sons were grown up, they had taken charge or responsibility of ruling, but they were denied the kingdom which was rightfully theirs, they were denied by so many tricks. So because the Pandavas had to suffer due to cheating by all of us, Kunti along with her sons had to simply suffer, so her sufferings continued. That's what Prabhupada is telling, her sufferings continued. This means that she was destined to suffer by providence. Providence is destiny according to one's own past actions and according to whatever is destined, whatever is given out by the higher authorities in the material world, everybody is under the control

We cannot make this out by the action of Kala, the influence of the gunas and the past reactions, reactions of the past activities we have performed that we are carrying as the load of karma. So Kala, Karma, Guna all three are very subtle. So as far as the modern civilization is concerned, they are independent about these controls, they are like animals, in the language of Bhagavatam, they are like donkeys and cows, animals. But those who are guided by the scriptures, those who are guided by their devotees, those who are guided by learned authorities in the Vedic language, they know that everyone is bound up by Kala, Karma and Gunas.

**Key Quote:** "Kunti Devi was destined to suffer by providence this is called providence it is beyond our control so here Prabhupada says one has to tolerate such suffering which is destined without being disturbed in the mind"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of tolerating suffering destined by providence, drawing from Vedic culture and Prabhupada's teachings.

So therefore it is said here, Kunti Devi was destined to suffer by providence. This is called providence, it is beyond our control. So here Prabhupada says, one has to tolerate such suffering which is destined without being disturbed in the mind. This is the training that is required for somebody who is born and brought up in the Vedic culture. Then the fourteenth verse, sarvam kala pritam manye bhavatam chayat apriyam sapalo yad vashe loko vayoriva ghanavadi. The meaning of this fourteenth verse, in my opinion, this is all due to inevitable time under whose control everyone in every planet is carried just as the clouds are carried by the wind. So this is the explanation given by Bhishma Deva that inevitable time, karma kala pritam sarvam kala pritam manye. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, there is control by time all over the space within the universe.

**Key Quote:** "There is control by time all over the space within the universe as there is control by time all over the planets you see total control by kala"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the pervasive control of Kala (time) in the material world, contrasting it with the eternal nature of the spiritual world.

As there is control by time all over the planets, you see total control by kala. Kala is a representative of the supreme lord in this material world. The action of kala is only in the material world, it is not there in the spiritual world. Spiritual world is eternal, material world has got a limited duration of existence. So there is creation, maintenance, destruction, then there is some time when there is nothing happening, inactivity, again creation, maintenance, destruction, inactivity, again creation, maintenance, destruction, inactivity. This is perpetually going on, perpetually it is going on. So everyone who takes birth in this material world at the beginning of creation, they are completely controlled. So it is said here, all the big gigantic planets including the sun are being controlled by the force of air as the clouds are carried by the force of air. The clouds are scattered in the skies and they don't remain in one place, they are carried by the wind. Similarly the big gigantic planets they are floating and they are not stationary, they are moving in their orbit all by the force of the wind. Similarly the inevitable kala or time controls in the action of the air and other elements above the vayu or wind or the air, there is the control of kala. Kala is representative of the supreme, everything therefore is controlled by the supreme kala, a forceful representative of the lord within the material world.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses how even pious individuals like Yudhisthira experience suffering due to the influence of time, emphasizing the importance of faith and guidance from religious principles.

So now the important thing what Prabhupada explains here, you should understand carefully, thus Yudhisthira should not be sorry for the inconceivable action of time. Everyone has to bear the actions and reactions of time as long as one is within the conditions of the material world. Actions and reactions are coming continuously, we should learn to bear them. Yudhisthira should not think that he had committed sins in his previous birth and is suffering the consequence. Generally a person suffers due to some past deeds, but somebody who is very, very pious, very strict in following all the principles like Yudhisthira is not suffering because of his past sinful actions. It is said here, even the most pious has to suffer the conditions of material nature, but a pious man is faithful to the lord for he is guided by the bona fide brahmana and vaishnava following the religious principles. So pious people they are guided by the brahma, the religious principles, then brahmanas and vaishnavas and they are also surrendered to the supreme lord. So these three guiding principles should be the aim of life, one should not be disturbed by the tricks of eternal time. So one should not worry even though I am following the religious principles why am I suffering, so one should not grudge being controlled by time despite being a true follower of religious principles. This is the important part.

I will stop here, thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "O how wonderful is the influence of inevitability over time, it is irreversible, otherwise, how can there be reverses in the presence of King Yudhishtira..."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 15th verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on the influence of time and the seemingly paradoxical situation of the Pandavas despite their righteousness and Krishna's presence.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 15th verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Sriman Bhagavatam. This chapter describes the passing away of विश्म देवा in the presence of Lord Krishna. यत्र धर्म सुतो राजा गदा पानिर भृको दरहा कृष्णोस्त्री गांडीवं चापं सुरित कृष्णस्ततो विपत. The meaning of this 15th verse is, "O how wonderful is the influence of inevitability over time, it is irreversible, otherwise, how can there be reverses in the presence of King Yudhishtira, the son of the demigod-controlling origin, Bhima, the great fighter with the club, the great bowman Arjuna with his mighty weapon Gandiva, and above all the Lord, the direct belligerent of the Pandavas." So this is a verse spoken by निष्म; he is describing the influence of time, तार्वा, it is irreversible under all circumstances. Now he is explaining, look at the situation of the Pandavas, particularly he mentions

**Key Quote:** "Though we prefer happiness than distress, it is actually illusory, both happiness and distress are illusory, they are effect of illusory."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes performing one's duties according to religious principles, understanding the illusory nature of material happiness and distress, and maintaining the single-pointed aim of returning to Godhead.

पाता की शक्ति के लिए नहीं बिलाएंगे, Param Velayut insignificant creatures, we have to do our duties depending upon the law, and our aim should always be to go back home, back to Godhead, where we actually are meant to live eternal blissful life full of knowledge in the association of the Supreme Personality of God. Because here, both happiness and distress are effect of the illusory energy. Though we prefer happiness than distress, it is actually illusory; both happiness and distress are illusory, they are effect of illusory. So the transcendentalists advise us, follow the religious principles under proper guidance of a bona fide spiritual master in the association of great Vaishnavas, and come to the platform of self-realization, where you will be able to perceive the effect of the illusory energy as either illusory happiness or illusory distress. That is called the duality of this material world. Dvandva Mohena Bhadra Dvandva Moha. So that is the nature of this material existence, nobody can change that. So therefore we are advised, you do your duties, depending on Krishna, and always have the single-pointed aim of going back to Godhead,

**Key Quote:** "O King, no one can know the plan of the Lord, Shri Krishna, even though great philosophers inquire exhaustively, they are bewildered."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the 16th verse, explaining that even great philosophers and deities cannot fully understand the Lord's plan, and that Yudhishthira's bewilderment is negated by Bhishma, one of the twelve authorized Mahajanas.

In the 16th verse, it is said, Narhyasya Karhi Chitrajan Pumaan Veda Vinit Siddham Yad Vijignaasaya Yukta Mukhyanti Kavayokihi. The meaning of this 16th verse is, this is Bhishma addressing Yudhishthira, "O King, no one can know the plan of the Lord, Shri Krishna, even though great philosophers inquire exhaustively, they are bewildered." So it is a fact that by analyzing things in this material world, by becoming learned in the material world, by learning in the Vedic literature, one cannot ascertain what is exactly the plan of the Lord in different times, in different places, for different people. Even though great philosophers inquire exhaustively, they are bewildered. Kavayokihi Mukhyanti, they are bewildered. It explains this in the first part. The bewilderment of Maharaj Yudhishthira over his past sinful acts and the resultant sufferings is completely negated by the great authority of Bhishma. Yudhishthira was lamenting, "I am responsible for the massacre of millions of people in this bad and poor chamber. Just to enthrone me, so many people have to die." So, he was bewildered by seeing the number of deaths. And therefore, this bewilderment is completely negated by Bhishma. Now what is Bhishma's position? One of the twelve authorized Mahajanas, those who know religion perfectly. Among the created beings, only twelve personalities are described as Mahajanas. These are described as authorities in understanding the workings of nature.

#### limitations of understanding, abiding by the Lord's orders, going back to Godhead

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Rather, we should abide by the orders of the Lord, the instructions given by the Lord, and pray to the Lord for His mercy to be able to maintain the single desire to go back to Godhead"
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the futility of trying to understand the Lord's plan, as even Brahma and Shiva cannot fully grasp it, and advocates for abiding by the Lord's instructions and striving to return to Godhead.

Bhishma wanted to impress upon Maharaj Yudhishthira that since time immemorial, no one including such deities as Shiva and Brahma could ascertain the real plan of the world. Shiva and Brahma are the topmost devatas. Of course, above them is Vishnu or Krishna. But other than Vishnu or Krishna, who is the supreme one, everyone else is unable to properly understand what is the plan of the Lord. So what can we understand about it? We, human beings on the earth, what can we understand? When great devatas like Brahma and Shiva themselves cannot understand the plan of the Lord, human beings can never, never, never understand it. It is useless also to inquire about it, about the plan of the Lord. Rather, we should abide by the orders of the Lord, the instructions given by the Lord, and pray to the Lord for His mercy to be able to maintain the single desire to go back to Godhead in His association, in Krishna's association, in Krishna's personal abode, as a pure devotee of the Lord. This is the whole program. Other than this, everything else is simply the reactions, and reactions of the Kala, Karma, that's all, interactions.

#### following Krishna's orders, Pandavas' suffering, establishment of virtue

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Even exhaustive philosophical inquiries of great sages cannot ascertain the plan of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that even great sages cannot understand the Lord's plan and that the Pandavas' suffering was part of Krishna's plan to establish virtue, even if it meant temporary hardship for his devotees.

You can never understand. So Prabhupada says, "Even exhaustive philosophical inquiries of great sages cannot ascertain the plan of the Lord." Great sages also do not know exactly what is the plan. So we are instructed by the Acharyas, by our spiritual master, that simply abide by the orders of Krishna without argument. There are people who argue to get into debates, but they are never able to ascertain the truth or the reality of this material world. It is wisdom given to the greatest of philosophers. So it is now being concluded that the sufferings of the Pandavas were never due to their past deeds. Pandavas are pure devotees. They are participating in Krishna's Leela in the material world. The Lord had to execute the plan of establishing the kingdom of virtue, and therefore his own devotees suffered temporarily in order to establish the conquest of virtue. So this is Krishna's plan. Even his devotees have to temporarily suffer.

**Key Quote:** "Bhishma Deva was a great devotee of the Lord. But he chose to fight against the Pandavas by the will of the Lord."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Bhishma's satisfaction at seeing Yudhishthira on the throne despite fighting against him, emphasizing that Bhishma's actions were in accordance with the Lord's will to demonstrate that even a powerful fighter cannot win on the wrong side.

Because after this, Vigishtha is going to rule. Everything will be very nice after the passing of Vishnu Deva. Bhishma Deva was certainly satisfied by seeing the triumph of virtue, and he was glad to see King Yudhishthira on the throne, although he himself fought against Yudhishthira. Bhishma is also a pure devotee. He is doing his duty of fighting on the side of Kauravas because he will never take back Kauravas. But, Bhishma was certainly very happy because Yudhishthira was ascending the throne. Even a great fighter like Bhishma could not win the battle of Kurukshetra. Why? Because Lord Krishna wanted to show that the wise cannot conquer virtue. Virtue is always the supreme. Bhishma Deva was a great devotee of the Lord, but he chose to fight against the Pandavas by the will of the Lord. It is the will of the Lord that Bhishma Deva should fight against the Pandavas. Why? Because the Lord wanted to show to the whole world that if a powerful fighter like Bhishma cannot win on the wrong side—he has taken the side of Kauravas—he can never win even though he is the most powerful fighter.

**Key Quote:** "To simply accept the inconceivable plan of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses verse 1.9.17 of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining Bhishma's advice to Yudhishthira to accept the Lord's plan and take care of his subjects.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 17th verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Tasmalidam Daivatantram Vyavasya Bharatarsyabha Tasyanu Vihito Anatha Natham Pahi Praja Prabho. The meaning of this verse is, O best amongst the descendants of Bharata, I maintain therefore that all this is within the plan of the Lord. Accepting the inconceivable plan of the Lord, you must follow it. You are now the appointed administrative head, and my Lord, you should now take care of those subjects who are now rendered helpless. So Yudhishthira is being advised by Bhishma to simply accept the inconceivable plan of the Lord. This is the Lord's plan. Yudhishthira should rule the world. So Yudhishthira should not think that it was his selfish desire because of which the battle was fought. No, this is Krishna's plan. The battle should take place to actually bring together the miscreant demons who burden the earth and to actually finish the battle. So that plan of the Lord is inconceivable. The Pandavas are instructed to follow the plan of the Lord. Now Yudhishthira is the appointed administrative head. He should take care of the subjects, especially those who are rendered helpless after the battle.

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Lord teaches the world by teaching the devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a mother-in-law teaching a daughter-in-law through her own daughter to explain how Krishna teaches the world through his devotees, and how even pious people undergo tribulations.

So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, the popular saying is that a housewife teaches the daughter-in-law by teaching the daughter. There is a Vedic culture that a young girl who gets married, she is trained up. When she goes to her husband's house, she is trained up by the mother-in-law. But the mother-in-law cannot directly teach the daughter-in-law because the daughter-in-law is totally new to the house. So she teaches by teaching her own daughter with whom she is very, very familiar. And while she is teaching the daughter, the daughter-in-law has got ample opportunity to learn also. So if the daughter is making a mistake, she can learn. She can be easily corrected. So the daughter-in-law can learn by the teaching of the mother-in-law and the mistakes made by the sister-in-law. Both is possible. So like that, the example is given. Lord teaches the world by teaching the devotee. Devotee doesn't require the teaching, but the Lord teaches the world by teaching the devotee. Through Arjuna, Bhagavad Gita was spoken. Through the Pandavas, Krishna is teaching the whole world how even pious people may have to undergo some tribulations, which are the actions and reactions of the three modes.

**Key Quote:** "There is no other purpose of this creation."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the purpose of creation is to practice Krishna Consciousness and return to Godhead, highlighting the Lord's internal guidance to sincere devotees.

So this word is simply meant for practicing Krishna Consciousness while you move out of life and go back to consciousness. There is no other purpose of this creation. The devotee does not have to learn anything new from the Lord because the Lord teaches sincere devotee always from within. The Lord is seated in everyone's hand, but for the devotee, the Lord is giving constantly the directions. TESHAM SATHATAYUKTANAM BHAJATAM PRITI KURVARKAM DADAMI BUDDHI YOGAMTAM YENAMAM UPAYANTITE. Krishna directs the devotee from within the heart how to ultimately attain the abode of the Lord. And if the Lord is teaching from within the heart of the devotee, what is the need for the devotee to learn externally from the Lord? What is the need? But the Lord is doing that. He is teaching from within the heart because the Lord actually wants to instruct the whole world through His instructions given to the devotees who go to the quiet.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Suffering is also mercy."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna teaches less intelligent people through devotees and that a devotee should accept tribulations as a benediction, quoting Brahma's prayer that suffering for a pure devotee is the mercy of the Lord.

Whenever therefore a show is made to teach the devotee, as in the case of the teachings of Bhagavad Gita, it is for teaching the less intelligent men. Krishna wants to reclaim all the conditioned souls who are His own part and parcel, who are suffering in this material world. Krishna doesn't like that. As a father doesn't like His children to suffer. Krishna is our Supreme Father. We are all His children in the material world. So Krishna doesn't want us to suffer. Therefore Krishna comes and He teaches the less intelligent people through different means. A devotee's duty, therefore, is to ungrudgingly accept tribulations from the Lord as a benediction. There is a verse in the Bhagavad Gita: tattenu kampamsu saveksha māno bhunjāna evātma kṛtaṁ vipākam pradvāvapurvir vidanam namaste jīveta yogukti padesad āyapa. Lord Krishna actually is very kind to His devotees. This verse I just quoted, tattenu kampamsu saveksha māno, is a verse which is a prayer offered by Brahma to Krishna. After the Brahma vimohana leela, what is Brahma telling? That when a devotee suffers, a pure devotee, when a pure devotee suffers miseries, those are the mercy of the Supreme Lord only.

**Key Quote:** "Let me suffer for whatever past sinful activities I have performed."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how a devotee prays to suffer for past sins and engages in devotional service without being disturbed by difficulties, and how Bhishma advised Yudhishthira to take responsibility for administration to protect the citizens after the battle.

Suffering is also mercy. bhunjāna evātma kṛtaṁ vipākam. The devotee always prays to the Lord, My dear Lord, let me suffer for whatever past sinful actions I might have performed. This is pure devotional service. Let me suffer for whatever past sinful activities I have performed. Once a devotee prays like that, then he simply engages in his duties in Krishna consciousness without being disturbed by any difficulties, any material calamities or material trouble. Without being disturbed by that, he simply engages in devotional service to Krishna. Always tries to remain devotional. The Pandavas were advised by Bhishma Deva to accept the responsibility of administration without hesitation because Krishna wants pure devotees like the Pandavas to rule this world for the welfare of all the citizens. The poor subjects were without protection due to the battle of Kurukshetra. They would have lost their elders, they would have lost their...

**Key Quote:** "None of them are real."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that pure devotees accept tribulations as favors from the Lord, understanding that happiness and distress are interactions of the gunas and that anything favorable for devotional service is auspicious.

...the others who were fighting in the battle, who were protecting them. They would have lost all those persons. So therefore, Bhishma is advising Yudhishthira, take care of these Prajams who are left without any superior help, with the help of some other well-to-do people. So therefore, Bhishma is advising Yudhishthira. Srila Prabhupada, a pure devotee of the Lord, accepts tribulations as favors from the Lord. How is it possible that I am getting some suffering and I should think it is a mercy of the Lord? It is only possible if we understand that both happiness and distress are interactions of the Gunas. None of them are real. They are interactions of the Gunas. So while Gunan interaction is happening, we foolishly interpret something according to our conditioning as nice or bringing joy, based on how it gratifies our senses. What is the basis when I say something is auspicious or in the material world something is not auspicious? It is something which is favorable for devotional service and the other thing is what is unfavorable for devotional service. So this should be the understanding of the devotees that all pure devotees accept any difficulties they face in this world as mercy of the Supreme Lord. Since the Lord is absolute, there is no mundane difference between happiness and distress or between tribulations and favors. There is no difference.

**Key Quote:** "Devotional service is the only way to prepare oneself to go to this personal abode of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that devotees also face problems, but these are directly related to the Lord and help them become fixed in Krishna consciousness, emphasizing that devotional service is the only way to reach Krishna's abode and that Krishna consciousness helps overcome difficulties.

Therefore, the influence of Kala that cannot be reversed, that cannot be avoided, as much as non-devotees undergo problems, devotees also have to face some problems. But these problems that devotees face are, if they are pure devotees, it is directly related to the Lord. It is directly given by Krishna. It is given by Krishna for the sake of making his devotee fixed up in Krishna consciousness. When there are dangers, when there are difficulties in Krishna consciousness, a pure devotee by facing those dangers actually becomes strong spiritually within the heart. This one has to actually remember all this. That devotee does not mean no more problems. That is not the correct understanding of Kali Bhakti. Current understanding of Bhakti is that devotional service is the only way to prepare oneself to go to this personal abode of Krishna. There is no other way. There is no other possibility. So therefore, this correct understanding, it is not an adjustment of the mind. It is a training for the mind to realize the purity of the original scriptures and to abide by all the injunctions of the Shastras which are relevant to us without carrying any grudge within the heart. Without carrying any grudge. This is important. So how to remain cheerful even while going through some hell and that is through all the activities of Krishna Consciousness. Any activity in Krishna Consciousness will actually help us to overcome the difficulties or dangers we may face.

**Key Quote:** "Bhishma Deva is revealing, Krishna is the original personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** Bhishma Deva reveals Krishna's true identity as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, despite his appearance within the Vrishni dynasty.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 18th verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. एशवै भगवान साक्षाद आध्यो नारायण फुमान मोहयन मायया लोकम गूडश्चरति वृष्णिशूम्. The meaning of this verse: This Shri Krishna is no other than the inconceivable original personality of Godhead. He is the first Narayana, the supreme enjoyer. But he is moving amongst the descendants of King Vrishni just like one of us, and he is bewilderingly bewildering us with his self-created energy. This verse is spoken by Bhishma Deva. He is addressing the Pandavas and all the assembled sages. Bhishma Deva is revealing the identity of Shri Krishna. Shri Krishna appeared as one of the members of the Vrishni dynasty. Vasudeva, the father of Krishna, belonged to the Vrishni dynasty, descendant of King Vrishni. So Krishna appeared as the son of Vasudeva. In that dynasty, he is counted among the members of the Vrishni dynasty. So even though he is moving amongst the descendants of the Vrishni dynasty as one of them, he is actually the supreme personality of Godhead. He is not another living being. So who can recognize this? Only the pure devotees can recognize Krishna. Only the pure devotees can recognize Krishna. Others cannot. So therefore, Bhishma Deva is revealing, Krishna is the original personality of Godhead.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains the deductive process of receiving Vedic knowledge through discipline succession, contrasting it with the ascending process of modern scientific research.

Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport very nicely. Srila Prabhupada says, "The Vedic system of acquiring knowledge is the deductive process." What is the meaning of deductive process? It descends or comes down from Krishna to Brahma to Narada to Vyasa. Successively, the knowledge is handed down, without any change, as it is. Without any change, the knowledge is handed down. This is the deductive process. As opposed to this, there is the ascending process. Ascending process is the method of currently we know something by our own efforts. As opposed to this, there is the ascending process. By our own efforts, collective efforts, individual and collective efforts, we have done some amount of research in science. We know something. But further on they keep doing more research, and they add to the knowledge base. So this is the ascending process, going from the known to the unknown, little by little, but the process is fraught with so many problems. Those problems are not there in the Vedic system of deductive process, a descending process. The perfect complete knowledge is given by Krishna, the source of all knowledge, the all-knowing Supreme Personality Buddha Krishna. He gives that knowledge to Brahma, the first created being in the whole universe, whole creation. And Brahma receives that knowledge and he hands down that knowledge to his sons and disciples. So it is perfect knowledge, it is complete knowledge, and it is properly transmitted and received without any change, without any speculation, without any errors, without any additions or subtractions without any of

**Key Quote:** "The perfect system of learning is to receive it from authority if you had a proper authorized source then what you receive from that source is perfect perfect knowledge the very same system is accepted universally as truth but only the false arguer speaks against it"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of accepting Vedic knowledge through authorized sources in discipline succession, contrasting it with the blind faith people place in modern science, and how people are taught not to believe the Vedas.

those. So that is the Vedic system. So Srila Prabhupada says further, "The Vedic knowledge is received perfectly by discipline succession from authorities." Discipline succession means guru to disciple, then the disciple to his disciple, he becomes the next guru, and he hands over to his disciple. That's called the discipline succession. The Dharma Narada Vyasama 물어 ramana Bastiani like that is coming now the Ricardo Vasивa, Dr. Hernandez de Soto, is the master of dharma различiamo come down. Such knowledge is never dogmatic as ill-consumed by lesson intelligent persons. There are people who don't accept this knowledge which is coming down in parampara. They think it is dogmatic. The mother is the authority to verify the identity within the father and the few the identity of the father. She is the authority for such confidential knowledge. A child, how can a child know who is my father? The mother has to say such and such gentleman is your father. Other than that, there is no other way. Therefore, authority is not dogmatic. In the Bhagavad-Gita, this truth is confirmed in the fourth chapter, in the second verse of the fourth chapter, and the perfect system of learning is to receive it from authority. If you had a proper authorized source, then what you receive from that source is perfect, perfect knowledge. The very same system is accepted universally as truth, but only the false arguer speaks against it. Now Prabhupada is pointing out a particular problem with the present generation of people who don't accept this method of receiving from authorities in discipline succession. For example, modern space crafts fly in the sky, and when scientists say that they travel to the other side of the moon, men believe these stories blindly because they have accepted the modern scientists as authorities. Isn't that what is happening? They say we have gone to the moon and we didn't find any life there and some rocks they have got it and that's the end of the story of moon exploration. Now the people simply believe the scientists because they accept the scientists as authorities. The authorities speak and the people in general believe them. But in the case of Vedic truths, they have been taught not to believe. When it comes to the Vedas, Vedas are perfect knowledge handed down discipline succession as it is coming from the ultimate source of everything Krishna, but people have been taught not to believe. Even if they accept them, they give a different interpretation. There are some people who accept the Vedas, but they give their own interpretation. Each and every man wants a direct perception of Vedic knowledge, but foolishly they deny it if something cannot be directly perceived using their five senses. This is the system of science, so called science, modern science, that what is acceptable is what is perceivable by the five senses. There are things which are not perceivable by the five senses, but doesn't mean that you don't accept

**Key Quote:** "Bhishma Deva is one of the twelve Mahajanas who knows the principles of transcendental knowledge."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the limitations of relying solely on the five senses for knowledge, using the example of the mind, and how rejecting Vedic authority leads to moral degradation, while highlighting the authority of Bhishma Deva and even Shankaracharya in accepting Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

them. For example, we have something called the mind. Now the mind is not perceived by the five senses. You cannot see the mind, you cannot touch the mind, you cannot smell the mind, you cannot taste the mind, you cannot feel the mind, you cannot hear the mind. Now does it mean that the mind doesn't exist? We all know I have got a mind, you have got a mind, everybody has got a mind, and we say mind is very disturbed, our mind is not peaceful, our mind is peaceful. We accept for sure that there is each one each and every person has got a mind. Now if it is not perceived by the five senses, does it mean it doesn't exist? That's what they say, the scientists, modern day scientists say that this is their this is their way of ascertaining what is in existence, what is reality. This means that the misguided man can believe one authority, the scientist, but will reject the authority of the Vedas. The result is that people have degenerated. Without Vedic guidance, with a guidance of Vedic knowledge, people have become godless, they have become they have become very very they have become very much their moral values are are degrading, they are losing good values just because they are rejecting the authority of the Vedas. Now Prabhupada says here is an authority speaking about Shri Krishna as the original personality of Godhead and the first Narayana. Bhishma Deva is an authority. Even such an impersonalist as Acharya Shankara has said in the beginning of his commentation on the Bhagavad Gita that Narayana, the personality of Godhead, is beyond the material creation. Narayana Paro unavyaktat. This is the Bhagavad Gita BASSHA by Shankaracharya. The universe is one of the material creations, but Narayana is transcendental to such material paraphernalia. This is what told by Shankaracharyam. Now about Bhishma Deva, Prabhupada says Bhishma Deva is one of the twelve Mahajanas who knows the principles of transcendental knowledge. These twelve Mahajanas are mentioned in the Srimad Bhagavatam. So Bhishma Deva is one of them. His confirmation of Lord Shri Krishna's being the original personality of Godhead is also corroborated by the impersonalist Shankara.

#### Krishna as Supreme Personality of Godhead, Authority of Acharyas, Narayana expansions, Receiving transcendental knowledge

**Key Quote:** "So this is the way of receiving transcendental knowledge."
**Summary:** The speaker reinforces the acceptance of Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, supported by various Acharyas and scriptures, and explains the concept of Narayana expansions in the spiritual world, concluding with the importance of receiving transcendental knowledge through authorized sources.

All other Acharyas have also confirmed this statement and thus there is no chance of not accepting Lord Shri Krishna as the original personality of Godhead. So Bhishma Deva is one of the twelve Mahajanas. He is declaring Krishna to be the supreme personality of Godhead. Shankara Acharya is one of the Acharyas about who is explained the Vedic texts, and he accepts Krishna as the supreme personality of Godhead. The other Acharyas, Madhavacharya, Ramanujacharya, Lord Chaitanya, so many Acharyas, they have all accepted. They are confirming. So there is no question of not accepting Krishna as the supreme personality of Godhead. And even Brahma has confirmed this in the Bhagavatam, in the 10th canto, 14th chapter, 14th verse. So Krishna is the first Narayana. In the spiritual world, what is the meaning of first Narayana? Prabhupada explains this. In the spiritual world, there are unlimited number of Narayanas who are all the same personality of Godhead and are considered to be plenary expansions of the original personality of Godhead Krishna. Krishna expands as Balarama. Balarama expands as Sankarsana. Sankarsana expands as Narayana. So there are many Narayana forms, each Vaikuntha planet having one form of Narayana. There are unlimited Vaikuntha planets, unlimited forms of Narayana predominating each Vaikuntha planet. So this is the explanation given in the Bhagavatam, in the Vedas, in the Upanishads. So this is very very clear, perfect knowledge. But it has to be accepted based on the authority of Bhishma Deva, based on the authority of Shankaracharya, based on the authority of the other Acharyas, based on the authority of Brahma, Narada, Vyasa. So this is the way of receiving transcendental knowledge. That is the conclusion.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is known very confidentially as the Supreme Personality of God only through pure devotional service."
**Summary:** Bhishmadeva explains that Krishna's glories are known confidentially through direct contact by pure devotees engaged in transcendental loving service, who experience different rasas in their relationship with Him.

The meaning of this verse is, O King, this is Bhishmadeva addressing King Yudhishthira. O King, Lord Shiva, Narada, the sage amongst the demigods, Devarshi, and Kapila, the incarnation of Godhead, all know very confidentially about his glories through direct contact. This verse is spoken by Bhishmadeva to King Yudhishthira and all the other assembled sages that Krishna is known very confidentially as the Supreme Personality of God. This verse is spoken by Bhishmadeva to King Yudhishthira and all the other assembled sages that Krishna is known very confidentially about his glories through direct contact because they have direct access to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which common men do not have, because he is the transcendental personality. So, in our material condition, we are not able to see him, we are not able to approach him, we are not able to perceive him, we are not able to understand him. He is an inconceivable personality, he is a very, very great personality, he is a transcendental personality, etc. So, Prabhupada explains in the purport to this verse, "Pure devotees of the Lord are all Buddhas, or persons who know the glories of the Lord in different transcendental loving service." Bhagavad Gita has explained that Krishna can be known only through pure devotional service. So, those who are established in pure devotional service, they are called pure devotees of the Lord, and they engage always in transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord. And in that way, they know the glories of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Of course, the glories of the Supreme Lord are unlimited, because he is an unlimited personality. He is the unlimited personality. But, they know the glories according to the service they render and the revelation by the Supreme Lord. They know the glories. As the Lord has innumerable expansions of his plenary form, there are innumerable pure devotees of the Lord, because the Lord is not limited to one form. He has many, many, many, many forms. So, accordingly, he has many, many, many, many devotees of each of the form. Many devotees.

**Summary:** The lecture identifies the twelve Mahajanas, great devotees of the Lord, and notes that Bhishmadeva, himself one of them, only mentions three names in the verse.

Now, these devotees are engaged in pure devotional service in different humors, different rasas. Humor means rasa. Some are situated in sakya rasa, some are situated in vatsalya rasa. Just like Arjuna is situated in sakya rasa. He is a friend of Krishna. Yashoda and Nanda Maharaj are situated in vatsalya rasa. Radharani, Lalitha, Vishakha, they are situated in madhurya rasa. So, like this, there are different devotees situated in different rasas in their relationship and devotional service to Krishna. Ordinarily, there are twelve great devotees of the Lord. They are called the Devotees of the Lord. They are called the Devotees of the Lord. They are called the Devotees of the Lord. They are called Mahajanas. Their names are mentioned here by Prabhupada: Brahma, Narada, Shiva, Kumara, Kapila, Manu, Prahlada, Bhishma, Janaka, Shukadeva Goswami, Bali Maharaj and Yamaraj. Twelve names. Four sets of three names were mentioned. Twelve names. Bhishmadeva, although one of them, Bhishmadeva himself is one of the Mahajanas, twelve Mahajanas. Although Bhishmadeva himself is one of the Mahajanas, twelve Mahajanas. Although Bhishmadeva himself is one of the Mahajanas, he has mentioned only three important names of the twelve who know the glories of the Lord. He has mentioned only three important names of the twelve who know the glories of the Lord. Which three names has he mentioned? In this verse, the names are mentioned of Shiva, Narada and Kapila. So he has mentioned three names out of twelve names. He himself is one of them.

#### Anubhava, Devotional Service, Revelation, Bhava

**Key Quote:** "As we progress in devotional service, more and more revelation about Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, happens within our heart, within our consciousness."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how devotional service leads to a better understanding of Krishna, culminating in the stage of bhava, where one understands the absolute nature of Krishna and experiences ecstasy.

Srila Vishwanath Chakraborty Thakur is another Acharya. He is a previous Acharya. In the Gaudiya Vaishnava Sampradaya, he is one of the great Acharyas of the modern age. He explains, what does he explain? That Anubhava or the glory of the Lord is first appreciated by the devotee in ecstasy, manifesting the symptoms of perspiring, trembling, weeping, bodily eruptions, etc., which are further enhanced by steady understanding of the glories of the Lord. So, this is a little technical thing. Let me explain this. As we progress in devotional service, more and more revelation about Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, happens within our heart, within our consciousness. Just like in the beginning, we just are told, chant Hare Krishna, and you hear about Krishna from the Bhagavad Gita, from the Bhagavad, through the medium of the pure devotees or their representatives, who repeat what the pure devotees are explaining. So, this practice of Sadhana Bhakti gradually leads to a better understanding of Krishna as the transcendental personality. Transcendental personality means he is not like one of us. He is not like... He is not like an ordinary, a created being. He is not a created being. He is the original Lord. He never accepts a material body. He never accepts a material body. He never has a material body. He doesn't require a material body. He has a transcendental form. He has the transcendental supreme form. So, he comes and incarnates in that same form. So, these things we will understand gradually as we practice devotional service, by chanting, hearing, reading, doing some practical service, worshipping the Deity, etc. All these different ways of rendering service to Krishna, if we engage in those different activities, gradually our heart becomes cleansed of misgivings, of misconceptions, of ignorance, and we become enlightened, gradually. It takes time. So, as the enlightenment... As the enlightenment increases, as the knowledge about Krishna becomes more and more revealed in the heart, we come to a stage called bhava. Bhava is the stage where we are able to understand the absolute nature of Krishna. He is non-different from his name, from his quality, from his activity, from his paraphernalia, from his... From his code, from his form, from his deity, from his descriptions in the Bhagavatam, he is non-different. All are identical, absolute, personality of Godhead.

#### Anubhava, Ecstasy, Ashtasatvika Vikara, Krishna-Yashoda Relationship

**Key Quote:** "Anubhava is appreciated by the devotee in ecstasy."
**Summary:** The lecture elaborates on anubhava, a subdivision of bhava, characterized by ecstasy and physical symptoms like perspiring and trembling, using the example of Yashoda binding Krishna with a rope.

In that bhava, there are different sub-divisions, one of which is explained here as anubhava. Anubhava is appreciated by the devotee in ecstasy. Ecstasy means bhava. Ecstasy means bhava. Ecstasy means bhava. So, in the stage of bhava, there is ecstasy, and that ecstasy means one is able to experience extreme joy, spiritual joy, through symptoms like perspiring, trembling, weeping, bodily eruptions, etc. There are eight such symptoms called ashtasatvika vikara. There is a change in the body. The body cannot contain the spiritual transformation. There is a transcendental joy called ecstasy. So, therefore, there are changes in the body. And these are all symptoms which are manifest in this body, which confirms that the devotee has advanced to the stage of being able to experience the ecstasy because of coming to the stage of bhava, advancing to the stage of bhava. Now, these symptoms of bhava, like perspiring, trembling, weeping, etc., are further enhanced by steady understanding of the glories of the Lord. There is an initial understanding of the glories. We begin to understand the glories of the Lord. And then after that the devotional service continues and the understanding becomes steady. It is not an effect that is experienced for a little time and then the effect is gone. No, it becomes steady, it becomes continuous. Such different understandings of bhava are exchanged between Yashoda and the Lord as a small child, the son of mother Yashoda. The Lord binding Krishna, Yashoda binding Krishna with the rope, Damodar Leela and in the chariot driving by the Lord in the exchange of love with Arjuna. These are not ordinary activities.

#### Krishna-Arjuna Relationship, Subordination, Love, Glories of the Lord

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The glories of the Lord which are exhibited in this being subordinated before his devotees is another feature of the glories of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Krishna's relationship with Arjuna, highlighting how Krishna assumes a subordinate position as Arjuna's chariot driver out of love, showcasing another aspect of His glories.

Or Krishna driving the chariot of Arjuna, Partha Sarathi on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. This is also an exchange of love between the Lord and his pure devotee Arjuna. Krishna has no need to do anything. Bhati is engaged in activities and relationship with his devotees out of love for them. And the devotees also, they are engaged in serving Krishna in their relationship with Krishna in different ways. So, in some of these exchanges of love, the Lord assumes an equal position or a subordinate position. In the case of Arjuna, normally Arjuna and Krishna as friends are on an equal platform. But, when Krishna agreed to become the chariot driver of Arjuna, then Krishna assumed the subordinate position. Arjuna is ordering Krishna. In the first chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, this statement is there by Arjuna to Krishna: "Kindly take my chariot between the two armies who are assembled for fighting in the battlefield of Kurukshetra." Arjuna is ordering Krishna. Now, the special feature of such an exchange is explained here by Prabhupāda. The glories of the Lord which are exhibited in this being subordinated before his devotees is another feature of the glories of the Lord. You see, when the Lord agrees to become subordinate of Krishna, he agrees to become subordinated by the devotees because he is the Supreme Lord. He is always the Lord. He is always the Master in all circumstances. But, he agrees to become subordinate in the exchange of love. So, it is another feature of the glories of the Lord. It is the glory of the Supreme Lord. Even though he is unconditionally always the Supreme Lord, he agrees to become subordinate to his devotees out of love for the devotees.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord says, I put my devotee into difficulty and thus the devotee becomes more purified in exchanging transcendental bhava with me."
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by explaining that the difficulties experienced by devotees, like the Pandavas, are not material problems but opportunities for exchanging transcendental bhava with the Lord and becoming purified.

So, Prabhupāda says, even the Pandavas experiencing some difficulties, that is another exchange of transcendental bhava between the Lord and the devotees, the Pandavas. So, the Lord says, "I put my devotee into difficulty and thus the devotee becomes more purified in exchanging transcendental bhava with me." So, don't think the Pandavas experiencing difficulties is any kind of material problems which ordinary conditioned souls experience in their daily life. No, it is not that at all. The devotees are always free from material miseries even in the material world. But, apparently they sometimes become distressed. But, that is due to the Lord putting them in difficulty to exchange transcendental bhava.

#### Krishna's energies, Paramatma, Guidance, Devotional service

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna is already the chariot driver and counsel of every living being."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Krishna is present everywhere through his energies and as the Paramatma, guiding everyone from within, and that his role as Arjuna's chariot driver was due to Arjuna's devotional service.

The sun is identified with every inch of the sun rays. The sun is somewhere in the spiritual sky, millions of miles away from the earth, but the sunshine is coming to the earth and providing heat and light and energy and sustaining life on this planet. So that sunshine is, in one sense, not different from the Sun. It is the energy of the Sun, and we can identify the Sun as full of this energy, which we call sunshine, sun rays. Similarly, the Lord is distributed by his different energies. The Lord is present by virtue of his being present as energy, his own energy spread everywhere. He is Paramatma, the Supersoul, present in everything that is present in the universe and in the universe and in the universe, and everyone has a supreme guidance. Not only Krishna's energies are spread everywhere in this material world as a material energy, he has also entered into everyone's heart, every living being's heart, as the Supersoul, as the Paramatma. That is another form of Krishna, who is an expansion of Krishna, who has entered into everybody's heart, and he is giving guidance to every living heart, and he is giving guidance to every living being from within the heart. Therefore, Krishna is already the chariot driver and counsel of every living being, Sarathi. He is not just guiding Arjuna alone; he is guiding everyone as the Paramatma in their heart. So, therefore, Prabhupada is explaining how, when Krishna exhibits himself as chariot driver of Arjuna, there is no change in his exalted position. He is already seated in Arjuna's heart as the Paramatma. He is guiding Arjuna, so externally when he apparently becomes the chariot driver of Arjuna and guides Arjuna while driving his chariot, there's no change in his position. So it is only because of the devotional service that Arjuna wants to render to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna being absolute there is no difference between his superior position and inferior position in his relationship with his devotees he remains always the supreme lord"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the absolute nature of Krishna, explaining that there is no difference between his superior and inferior positions, and that all his actions are loving reciprocations with his devotees.

Otherwise, to give guidance to Arjuna, Krishna is already in Arjuna's heart. What is the need for Krishna to come externally, appear as the chariot driver of Arjuna? There is no need. Then Prabhupada explains he does that for the sake of teaching the others, not Arjuna. For the sake of teaching others, he speaks the Bhagavad-Gita to Arjuna. Even though he is a chariot driver of Arjuna, he is the Lord, and he speaks Bhagavad-Gita, and through Arjuna, he is instructing and educating the whole world. So this is the absolute nature of Krishna. For Krishna, there is nothing superior and inferior action. When he is instructing Arjuna as the spiritual master of Arjuna, he is in apparently in a superior position. Arjuna is submitting, surrendering, and Arjuna is inquiring from Krishna, "Kindly guide me, kindly instruct me, kindly enlighten me," and Krishna is instructing, enlightening Arjuna, so superior position. When Arjuna is ordering, "Take my chariot between the two armies," Krishna is in an inferior position apparently, but actually, it is explained Krishna being absolute, there is no difference between his superior position and inferior position. In his relationship with his devotees, he remains always the supreme Lord. He may assume any—He may do any activity, inferior or superior according to our calculation, but as far as Krishna is concerned, it is simply his loving reciprocation with his devotees, whether it is Mother Yashoda, whether it is Radharani, whether it is Arjuna, whether it is any devotee, even Bhishma. We will hear how Bhishma is praying to Krishna, "Kindly be present before me at the time of my death, quitting the body."

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udhirayet In this session we will be discussing from the 22nd verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This chapter is entitled The Passing Away of Bhishma Deva in the Presence of Lord Krishna. Tathapi Ekanta Bhakteshu Pashya Bhupanukampitam Yanme Asums Tyajatasakshat Krishnodarshanam Aagataha The meaning of this verse is, Yet despite his being equally kind to everyone, he has graciously come before me while I am ending my life, for I am his unflinching servitor. Bhishma has already described Krishna, that Krishna is the absolute personality of Godhead. He is present in everyone's heart. He is equally kind to everyone. He is free from the false ego of differentiation. Therefore, whatever he does, he is equi-balanced. He is free from all material inebriety. Now further, he is describing Krishna's kindness upon himself, that when he is about to quit his body, Krishna has come in front of him. Now this is a very, very... Because Bhishma is describing his position as his unflinching servitor.

#### Dependence on Krishna, illusory energy, limitations of material affection

**Verse References:** BG 9.29
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This is the position of every one of us, that we have no other protector other than Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the idea that true protection comes only from Krishna, as material affection is limited by the illusory energy and the modes of material nature.

Unflinching servitor, the word used is Ekanta Bhakteshu. Ekanta Bhakta. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, The Supreme Lord, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, Sri Krishna, although equal to everyone, is still more inclined to his unflinching devotee who is completely surrendered and knows no one else as his protector and master. This is the position of every one of us, that we have no other protector other than Krishna. Why do I say that? Because, even though in the material world we have our well-wishers, our parents, or our near and dear family members, who actually, within the heart, they have a sense of affection. For us, each one of us has got somebody who is very dear to us. Even then, all this affection is on the platform of the illusory energy. This truth is not known to most people in this world. I don't mean to say that people make a show of being affectionate while they don't have any affection in the heart. I don't mean that. What I mean is, each one of us, we are in ignorance about our real self. We are completely under the clutches of the three gunas, three modes of material nature. So, we are not able to express our affection when our consciousness gets bewildered by the influence of the external energy. So, even though I want to give protection to somebody whom I consider as my very, very, very dear relative or friend, still, because I myself am a person who is a person, I am not able to express my affection. Not in a secure position, how can I give protection to somebody else when my own position is very, very insecure? So therefore, who is the person who can really give everyone real protection, who is above the three gunas, who's transcendental to the modes of material nature? So that is explained by Prabhupada.

#### Eternal life, illusory energy, spiritual vs. material platform, absolute dependence on Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Having unflinching faith in the Supreme Lord as one's protector, friend and master is a natural condition of eternal life."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the temporary nature of material life under the influence of the illusory energy with the eternal life attained through absolute dependence on Krishna on the spiritual platform.

So Srila Prabhupada further says, Having unflinching faith in the Supreme Lord as one's protector, friend and master is a natural condition of eternal life. This is exactly what I mentioned, that it is natural for all of us to seek Krishna's protection, provided we are situated on the spiritual platform, the condition of eternal life. Right now, what is our condition? We are under the clutches of the illusory energy and therefore our life in this body is temporary. We are on the material platform of the three gunas in which there is creation, maintenance, and destruction. The characteristic of Raja Guna is creation. The characteristic of Sattva Guna is maintenance. The characteristic of Dhamma Guna is destruction. So this body is created and that is when we say birth takes place and then this body is maintained when we say there is sustenance of this body the body is maintained and then at a certain time after a limited duration of time this body will be destroyed. This body cannot be maintained anymore. We say death. Death means the destruction of the body. So it is totally different on the spiritual platform. We as each one of us is spirit soul. It is totally different. A living entity is so made by the will of the Almighty that he is most happy when placing himself in a condition of absolute dependence. See the nature of spiritual life is such that there is absolute dependence on Krishna. And material life means there is relativity. Somebody I can depend more somebody I cannot depend as much somebody else may be somewhat dependable all these relativities exist but there is no one I can absolutely depend on because nobody is fully secure themselves. Their own position is always shaky. In terms of their material body anyone who is in a position of security anyone who possesses a material body because of taking birth under the illusory energy their own position is insecure. So what security they can give to others when their own position is not secure. The opposite tendency is the cause of fall down.

**Key Quote:** "The root cause of all troubles is there in false egotism."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the tendency to be independent of Krishna, driven by false egotism and the desire to lord over material nature, is the root cause of all troubles and the fall down of the living entity.

The tendency to be independent of Krishna's protection. The living entity has to be and has this tendency of falling down by dint of misidentifying himself as fully independent to lord it over material nature or material world. We have this tendency because of the enviousness towards Krishna or because of the desire to lord over like Krishna. Krishna is the supreme lord. He is the absolute lord of everyone and everything. So trying to imitate Krishna trying to compete with Krishna trying to forget Krishna all these tendencies cause the fall down of the living entity from Krishna's protection. The root cause of all troubles is there in false egotism. As soon as one desires to be independent of Krishna or one desires to lord over others or take Krishna's position or imitate Krishna immediately there is this false ego. This is the root cause of all problems. That covers our original consciousness of complete dependence on Krishna. To become secure and safe under the protection of Krishna under the absolute protection of Krishna means to draw towards the supreme lord Krishna in all circumstances. And that is what Bhishma Deva is teaching all of us.

#### Unflinching devotion, Krishna's protection, relationship of the soul, Bhishma's example

**Key Quote:** "The appearance of Lord Krishna at the deathbed of Bhishma ji is due to his being an unflinching devotee of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that Krishna's appearance at Bhishma's deathbed is due to his unflinching devotion and emphasizes that the relationship between the soul and the Supreme Soul is eternal and not based on bodily connections.

The appearance of Lord Krishna at the deathbed of Bhishma ji is due to his being an unflinching devotee of the Lord. So when somebody is a pure devotee under all circumstances, unfailing in all circumstances, then the Supreme Lord protects such a devotee always, especially when the devotee has to quit the body at the time of death. That is a critical moment in one's life. Arjuna had some bodily relation with Krishna because the Lord happened to be his maternal cousin. But he did not have any physical relation with Krishna. But Bhishma had no such bodily relation. When Krishna helps the Pandavas, somebody may think that, Oh, because Krishna is related to the Pandavas through some bodily relationship. Actually, there is no bodily relationship between Krishna and anybody. Krishna does not have a material body. So where is the question of bodily relationship? But even if for the sake of his Leela, he appears as the son of Devaki or Vasudeva. Vasudeva and Kunti are having that blood relationship. Vasudeva is the brother of Kunti. So Kunti's sons, the Pandavas, and Vasudeva's son Krishna, through such relationships between Vasudeva and Kunti, they are related as maternal cousins. But what about Bhishma? Bhishma has no such bodily relationship. So therefore, Prabhupada says, in the case of Bhishma, the cause of attraction was due to the intimate relation of the soul. So how is it that Krishna appeared in front of Bhishma? And Bhishma is acknowledging that very kindly the Supreme Lord has appeared when I am about to quit the body. It is because of the relationship of the soul. And that relation is eternal. It is never based on any bodily connections. It is a relationship between the soul with the Supreme Soul.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by explaining that while Krishna has no material body, he is pleased when addressed in terms of his loving relationships, and ultimately, Krishna appeared to Bhishma because of their eternal relationship as Lord and unflinching servitor.

Yet, it is particularly explained by Prabhupada here, because the relation of the body is very pleasing and natural, the Lord is more pleased when he is addressed as the son of Maharajananda, the son of Yashoda, the lover of Radharani. Though the Lord has no bodily relationship, but when he appears to have some relationship through his Deela of appearing as the son of Yashoda and Nanda, and he appears to have a loving relationship with Radharani, so then when he is addressed as Radharamana, Radhakanta, Yashodanandana, Nandanandana, he is very, very, very pleased. So, we have to understand this point that Krishna has appeared because Bhishma is the unflinching servitor of the Lord, which is an eternal relationship with the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains how attentive devotion, meditation, and chanting the holy name can liberate a devotee from fruitive activities at the time of death.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 23rd verse of the 9th chapter.

of fruitive activities exactly at the time of quitting the body. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, yoga means concentration of the mind detached from all other subject matter. Simultaneously, concentration of the mind on the lotus feet of Krishna, or on the holy name of Krishna, or on the form of Krishna, this transcendental form of Krishna, while simultaneously being completely detached from all other subject matter. So such concentration, Srila Prabhupada explains, is Samadhi, the highest perfection of yoga, or cent per cent engagement in the service of the Lord. Even though a devotee may not be engaged in Ashtanga Yoga practice, in Bhakti Yoga also the same perfection of Ashtanga Yoga called Samadhi, or cent per cent absorption in the Supreme Lord, is possible by cent per cent engagement in devotional service of the Lord, either through chanting or through hearing or through worshipping or through remembering the Lord's pastimes, the Lord's form, the Lord's name.

Atmaniveenam, last one. By such practice of yoga, or linking up in the service of the Lord, one is recognized by the Lord himself, as it is explained in the Bhagavad Gita concerning the highest perfectional stage of samadhi. In the Bhagavad Gita, 6th chapter, Krishna explains this total absorption of the mind in devotional service is actually Samadhi. The Lord calls such a rare devotee the best amongst all the Yogis: Yoginam api sarvesham madhgate na antaratmana sraddhavan bhajate yomam same yukta tamo matah. Yukta, yukta tara, yukta tama. Positives, comparative and superlative. So, the best amongst all Yogis, yukta tamo matah, Yoginam api sarvesham, among all Yogis, the best amongst all Yogis is a devotee who is totally absorbed in devotional service of the Supreme Lord 24 hours a day.

Even though physically we may be doing so many activities, even though mentally we may be engaging in different kinds of thoughts, but in the background, the consciousness, which is the energy of the soul, is a very important consideration. What is the background consciousness? Generally, those who are non-devotees, their background consciousness is that of sense enjoyment, or self-gratification, the sense of independent existence without any connection with Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a sense of consciousness, independent existence, is actually the reason for the material bondage.

And the Lord is very, very merciful and kind to his pure devotee, unflinching servitor. Thus, by chanting his holy name before quitting the body, the yogi is at once transferred by the internal energy of the Lord to one of the eternal planets, where there is no question of material life and its concomitant factors. See what happens at the time of death, the devotee quits the body, chanting the holy name of the Supreme Lord, because he has practiced chanting constantly, always. Satatam kirtayam domaam. Kirtaniya Satatam. The devotee is at once transferred by the internal energy of the Lord. This has been explained by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. This Daivim Prakriti is referring to the internal energy of the Lord, the personal energy which is specially meant for his devotees. For the Lord and his devotees, this personal energy which is the yoga maya, antaranga shakti, spiritual energy.

So this gunamayi maya offers an obstacle for those who want to get out of this material existence. It offers an obstacle, duratyaya. And the yoga maya or the atma maya, personal energy of the Lord, simply transfers the devotee immediately, at once, to the eternal planets. And what is the nature of eternal planets? Parastasma tu bhavonyo vyakto vyakta sanatana. Sanatana. Those planets are sanatana, where there is no question of material life and its concomitant factors. Material life is characterized by repetition of birth and death. And between birth and death, there is janma mrittyu jara vyadhi dukha dosha anudarshanam. Again and again, repeatedly, we have to face these concomitant factors of disease, old age, death, rebirth, disease, old age, death and rebirth. We have to keep on facing these concomitant factors. In the eternal planets, there is no death, there is no old age. This knowledge is not known to many people.

That there is another world, Parastasmatubhavonyo, Anyabhava, that is transcendental, Paraha. Parambhavam, or Parambrahma, Paramdhama. So this Paramdhama, that transcendental world, that is unknown to people. They read Bhagavad Gita, but because they are not guided by the proper authority, therefore they do not know that Krishna doesn't belong to this world. They do not know Krishna is a transcendental supreme personality. He has his personal abode. He is inviting us, please come back to my personal abode. Don't remain in this material world which is subject to creation and destruction repeatedly. Bhutva Bhutva Praliyate. Everything is explained in the Bhagavad Gita very clearly. But if you are not guided by a pure devotee, spiritual master, you will never understand all these things merely by your reading the Gita, or following some translation which is done by a speculator, non-devotee. You will never understand all these facts. So here it is explained that simply by practicing devotional service and preparing oneself to be able to chant the holy name at the time of death, one can simply transfer oneself to the eternal planets where there is no repetition of birth and death.

Lord Krishna. What is the identity of Krishna? Though he appears as a son of Vasudeva and Devaki, though he appears to be like one of the descendants of the Vrishni dynasty, a Kshatriya, but he is not a Kshatriya, he is not a person of this world, he is the transcendental Supreme Personality. So Shri La Pravapada says in the purport, Bhishma Deva knew well that Lord Krishna is the original Narayana, Govindam Adi Purusham Tamaham Bhajwami, this is what is said in the Brahma Samhita, by Lord Brahma, he declares Govinda or Krishna, Ishwaraha Paramahakrishnaha, he is the original Supreme Personality of God.

plenary expansion of Lord Krishna, that Bhishma Deva knew. So he did not consider Krishna as an ordinary person. Indirectly, he desired Lord Shri Krishna to manifest himself in his four-handed feature of Narayana. Bhishma Deva is preparing to quit the body because he had the blessing from his father that he could quit his body whenever he desired. In what sense, whenever he desired, what does it mean? It means that he can choose the most auspicious moment to quit the body. Again, this is explained in the Bhagavad Gita, that for somebody who is not a pure devotee of Krishna, they have to select an auspicious time to quit the body in order to escape rebirth.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the fate of those with material desires, who are forced to take rebirth, with that of devotees, who are directly taken by Krishna to the spiritual world.

In order to escape rebirth. For a common person, generally, because the person has some material desires, he has the right to quit the body. So he has to quit the body. Such a person has to take birth again in this material world to fulfill those desires. But somebody who is free from all material desires, even such a person, if he is not a devotee, he has to quit the body at an auspicious time. That means the passage of the soul from this material world to the spiritual world is controlled by higher authorities, in the case of non-devotees. For devotees, Krishna directly takes charge. As was explained in the previous words, at once, by Krishna's arrangement, a pure devotee is transferred by the internal energy to one of the eternal planets, as soon as the devotee quits the body. As soon as. So that's not true for non-devotees.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Bhishma's humility as a Vaishnava, highlighting his desire to see the Lord's face at the moment of death despite being guaranteed to go to Vaikuntha.

body. Now why is Bhishma desiring this? That Srila Prabhupada says, a Vaishnava is always humble in his behavior. This is Bhishma's humility as a Vaishnava. Why is it said that Bhishma is humble? Because it is explained by Prabhupada, although it was certain that Bhishmadeva was approaching Vaikunthadharma just after leaving his material body, still as a humble Vaishnava he desired to see the beautiful face of the Lord, for after quitting the present body, he might not be in a position to see the Lord anymore. See, this is the humility of the Vaishali. Bhishma's mind is completely absorbed in the thought of Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So he is guaranteed to actually go to the Vaikuntha planet after quitting his material body, because he is absorbed in that kind of thought. But then, he is doubly ensuring that he wants, at the last moment of quitting the body, to see the beautiful face of the Supreme Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Bhishma's desire to see Krishna's lotus face at the time of death and references the Bhagavad Gita to explain how devotees who are always absorbed in Krishna can leave their bodies at any time.

That's why the description is there, that Kalevaram yavad idam hinomi when I quit this body, prasanna-hasa-aruna-lochi na ullasat mukham bujaha. The lotus face of the Lord may be visible to me at the time of quitting the body, because the Lord has come personally before Bhishma Deva. So, as a humble Vaishnava, he is thinking, I may not be able to see the Lord after I quit this body. Of course, that is assuming that he may not actually go back to the spiritual world. In that case, he still, till the last moment, he wants to be having darshan of the Lord, the last darshan he wants to have. A Vaishnava is not puffed up, although the Lord guarantees his pure devotee entrance into his abode. Krishna says, for his pure devotees, in the 8th chapter, Krishna explains this in the Bhagavad Gita, for my devotees, they can quit their body any time, because they are always absorbed in thinking of me,

Like this, a devotee, such a devotee, who is constantly engaged, tesham satata yuktanam bhajatam priti purvakam. So, such a devotee, Krishna guarantees that such a devotee will straight be transferred to the eternal world of the personal abode of the Supreme Lord. So, Bhishma says, as long as I do not quit this body, that's what Bhishma Deva is telling, yavad idam hinomi aham kalevaram as long as I do not quit this body, this means, Prabhupada says, the great general Bhishma Deva would quit the body by his own will. He was not being forced by the laws of nature.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that unlike ordinary people who are forced to leave their bodies, Bhishma had the blessing from his father, Maharaj Shantanu, to choose the time of his death.

For ordinary people, who are not yogis having that perfection of being able to quit the body at the chosen auspicious moment, for those who are not such yogis, they are forced to leave the body at a certain time by the laws of nature, higher laws. And all such people generally are attached to their body because they don't want to quit the body and they are forced and if they refuse to quit the body, the Yamadutas are there to force them to leave the body. They cannot remain against the laws. Whereas Bhishma, because he is blessed by his father, Maharaj Shantanu blessed Bhishma, who was his son, Shantanu's son Bhishma, was blessed by Shantanu, that you be blessed to quit your body at the auspicious time of your choice. So, Bhishma was very, very powerful. He could stay in his body as long as he desired. He got this benediction from his father.

So therefore, Bhishma very humbly, he is praying to the Lord. He desired that the Lord stay before him in his four-handed Narayana feature so that he might concentrate his attention upon this Narayana feature and thus be entranced in that meditation.

But additionally, he wants that now that the Supreme Lord has appeared in front of me, let me concentrate my attention on his lotus face, beautiful lotus face, and be situated entranced in that way, by concentrating my attention on his lotus face. He is thinking that just in case my mind is not pure at the time of quitting this body, by such concentration of my attention on the lotus face of the Supreme Lord, Krishna, my mind will be sanctified

by thinking of the Lord. Then, in such a state, if he quits his body, he did not mind wherever he might go. A pure devotee actually is not very anxious that he has to quit this world and go to the spiritual world, the personal abode of the Lord. The devotee is not very anxious about that. Why? Srila Prabhupada says here, a pure devotee is never anxious to go back to the kingdom of God. Though, that is the destination of the pure devotee, and it is guaranteed by the Supreme Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that a pure devotee is always dependent on the Lord's mercy and is ready to serve the Lord anywhere, even in hell, because their only business is to serve the Lord's mission.

Hmm? Aha! In the Bhagavad Gita, punar janma naiti mam eti sorjuna Krishna guarantees this for his devotees, pure devotees, that mam eti, they come back to me, my abode, madbhava magata. Hmm? Several places. So, a pure devotee is completely dependent on the good will of the Lord. A devotee is never proud to think that I am a pure devotee. I am entitled to enter the personal abode of the Supreme Lord after quitting this body. He never thinks like that. So, a pure devotee always is dependent on the mercy of the Supreme Lord. And, even if the Lord wants him to go to hell, a devotee is ready. Hmm? In the sense that, a devotee is ready to serve the Lord anywhere, even in the material world, even in hellish planets, because the devotee's only business is to serve the mission of the Lord in this material world, especially the mission of the Lord to actually deliver the condition, and deliver the condition source. So, that, in that way, a pure devotee doesn't particularly desire to go to the spiritual planet. Anywhere the Lord wants him to serve, the devotee is ready. So, I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes Bhishmadeva's authority on religious principles (Dharma) as one of the twelve Mahajanas, highlighting the confidential nature of Dharma and its understanding by great personalities.

Now here is the most important part of the Mahabharata. In the Mahabharata, the conversation between Yudhishthira and Bhishmadeva on principles of religion, dharma, is the bulk of the Mahabharata. Three parvas cover this conversation and the instructions Bhishmadeva gives to Yudhishthira about dharma. Bhishmadeva is one of the twelve great authorities in matter of understanding dharma. The Mahabharata says, Sattvam Nihitam Guhayam. The most confidential understanding of what is dharma is hidden in the heart of such great personalities called Mahajanas. Mahajana Yena Gata Sapanta. So Bhishmadeva is the most authoritative personality to speak on religious principles.

**Summary:** This segment describes Yudhishthira's grief and remorse after the Kurukshetra war, emphasizing the magnitude of the massacre and how even Krishna couldn't pacify him, leading to Bhishmadeva's role in providing solace and guidance.

Yudhishthira was put into a situation where he was aggrieved at the massacre that took place just for Yudhishthira to be enthroned as the Emperor of the world. Six forty million Kshatriyas were killed in that battle of Kurukshetra which lasted just 18 days because huge armies, totally 18 Akshohini divisions of armies, were participating in that battle, which is actually a world war. So Yudhishthira, after the battle was over and he had won, the Pandavas had won the battle, but seeing the Massacre, Yudhishthira was aggrieved and he could not be pacified by so many other saintly persons, sages, and even Krishna himself could not pacify Yudhishthira. He was thinking, "I am the most sinful person on the surface of this planet earth. Look at my greed for becoming the Emperor. I have become responsible for this huge massacre." So Yudhishthira was to be pacified by Bhishma Deva. This is Krishna's arrangement. So Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport that Bhishma Deva, speaking in that appealing tone, convinced Maharaja Yudhishthira that he was very soon passing away, who, it is Bhishma Deva. Bhishma Deva soon going to pass away and Maharaja Yudhishthira was inspired by Lord Shri Krishna to ask him of the

principles of religion. It is Krishna who is seated in the heart of Yudhishthira, and Krishna who is seated in the heart of Bhishma Deva. Krishna is seated in everyone's heart as the Paramatma, and particularly devotees are guided by the supreme Lord in the heart always. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita in the third chapter, 17th verse, that it is explained for the liberated souls there are no duties to be performed as prescribed in the scriptures. So does it mean that liberated souls don't follow any authority, they whimsically act? No, the liberated souls are not required to go by the principles of the Shastra of the Lord, Shastra, because they are constantly in touch with Krishna within the heart. It is Krishna only who has given us the Shastra. The Shastras are meant for those who are not in touch with Krishna within the heart, the conditioned souls, and the liberated souls, they are receiving direction from Krishna within the heart.

every moment. Every moment they're receiving the directions. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita, in the third chapter, 17th verse. So it is said here by Srila Prabhupada that Krishna inspired Yudhishthira to ask Bhishma Deva about the principles of religion, and Krishna inspired Bhishma Deva to speak even though Bhishma was in a very, very difficult situation. Bhishma spoke about the principles of Dharma elaborately to Yudhishthira. This also coincided with Bhishma waiting for the most auspicious time to quit his body because he had such a benediction from his father. Bhishma had a benediction that he could quit his body according to the time of his choice. This particular choice is not available for most souls who are forced to quit their body at a particular time of death when the lifespan is exhausted. Our lifespan is taken away with every sunrise and sunset.

**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Bhagavad Gita is the complete knowledge for every human being on the surface of the earth in every aspect of their duties in different stages"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the perfection of life through Krishna consciousness and criticizes the superficial understanding of the Bhagavad Gita, asserting that it contains complete knowledge for all aspects of human life.

We have a fixed duration and we have to leave the body, which is called death, at a particular time when our lifespan is exhausted. But somebody like Bhishma Deva, they have this perfection, Siddhi, it's called Siddhi, that they can quit the body whenever they choose to. That means they can select the most auspicious time for quitting the body. This is explained in the 8th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. You see, everything is there in the Bhagavad Gita, but unfortunately people don't study Bhagavad Gita under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, therefore they are misled into thinking Bhagavad Gita is some kind of scripture which is merely talking about do your duty. Don't be attached to result. Most people, if you ask them what do you know about Bhagavad Gita, they only tell these two things. They have no understanding that Bhagavad Gita is the complete knowledge for every human being on the surface of the earth in every aspect of their duties in different stages. Now Bhishma will explain, it will be told in a later one.

verse, he explained Dharma pertaining to four varanas and four ashramas, varana dharma, ashrama dharma. So those details are there in the Mahabharata, but Bhagavad Gita contains the essence. The essence is given in the Bhagavad Gita. So Bhishma Deva spoke about Dharma to Yudhishthira in the presence of many people. Verse, he explained Dharma pertaining to four varanas and four ashramas, varana Dharama Dharama Svarga dharma, ashrama dharma, ashrama Dharama Svarga and other dans office place you superior to many great sages including Vyasadeva. Vyasadeva was present also when Bhishma was instructing Yudhishthira. Now Bhishmadeva was lying on a bed of arrows at the time when Yudhishthira approached Bhishmadeva. So he was greatly aggrieved in that condition lying on a bed of arrows. So one should not have asked him any question at that time, but Lord Krishna wanted to prove that his pure

devotee like Bhishmadeva is always sound in body and mind by dint of spiritual enlightenment. See, somebody is sent person, Krishna conscious, then irrespective of the condition of the body or the mind, they are perfected. So inside this house, they are tightly situated in Krishna consciousness always. So they are ready to speak on the principles of Dharma, on the principles of Krishna consciousness at any time you may approach them. This was demonstrated by Srila Prabhupada also. Towards the end of his manifest presence in this world, Srila Prabhupada has had over a lifetime of service to the Brahmins in the Brahmins. He was always in every place to meet the Brahmins. So in that time, the Brahmins and the weak and initiated, but still he was surrounded by devotees who were constantly chanting the Hare Krishna mantra and Prabhupada used to receive reports about preaching all over the world in so many centers and he would give directions when they were, when the disciples were asking questions and he was dictating purpose of Bhagavatam. The last chapter that Srila Prabhupada translated and gave purpose of the Bhagavatam was the 10th canto, 13th chapter. You can go through that 10th canto, 13th chapter translation and purpose by Srila Prabhupada. He was dictating, he was very, very weak, but the consciousness was perfectly clear. Devotees have actually recorded that, then they have transcribed as they usually did, always were doing that even before, so Prabhupada was giving perfect

knowledge coming in the parampara, perfect knowledge. So it is described here, in any circumstances, a devotee of the Lord is in perfect order to speak the right way of life. And Maharaj Yudhishthira, he preferred to solve this problematic questions by asking Bhishma Deva rather than ask anyone else present there because many great saintly persons and sages arrived there understanding that Bhishma Deva is going to quit his body at the most auspicious time and that privilege that Bhishma had, not everyone has got that, it's very rare and this is the perfection of life to quit the body, to be able to go back to Godhead, to be able to go back to Godhead, that is the, that is the perfection of one's life, no more taking birth again. So Bhishma Deva was ready to quit his body actually because he was fully Krishna conscious. He could have quit any time, but taking a humble position, he decided to quit his body at the time, at the most auspicious time, Uttarayana Punyakala, it's called, and while he was waiting, he spoke to Yudhishthira about the principles of religious duties and Prabhupada says that worship of his devotee is more valuable than the worship of Lord Krishna himself. So Krishna wants to glorify his devotees while devotees want to glorify Krishna. Krishna wants to glorify his devotee and Krishna wanted to glorify Bhishma, therefore Krishna inspired Yudhishthira to ask questions about Dharma to Bhishma.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 26th verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Purushasvabhava Vihitam Yathavarnam Yathashramam Vairagya Rago Padibhyam Amnatobhaya Lakshanam. The meaning of this verse is: At Maharaj Yudhishthira's inquiry, Bhishma Deva first defined all the classifications of caste and orders of life in terms of the individual's qualifications. Then he systematically, in two-fold divisions, described counteraction by detachment and interaction by attachment. So the description continues by Suta Goswami to the sages of Naimisharanya that this conversation between Yudhishthira making inquiry about caste and orders of life, about dharma, and Bhishma replying is given in great details in the Mahabharata, but the summary is given here.

**Key Quote:** "Everything goes by quality not by birth"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Varna Dharma, explaining the four divisions of society (Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras) based on their acquired nature and occupational duties, emphasizing that it is based on qualification, not birth.

So Bhishma first of all explained Varna Dharma. A civilized society is divided into four Varanas based on occupational duties, occupational engagements, according to their acquired nature. So those in Sattva Guna, their acquired nature is suitable for doing Brahmanical duties: Brahmanas. Kshatriyas, their acquired nature is Rajoguna. So they are suited for doing occupation of a Kshatriya: administrative duties, protection against harm of the innocent people, saintly persons, weaker sections of society. And the Vaishyas, their acquired nature is a mixed mode of passion and ignorance. So they are suited for doing Vaishya duties. They are the economic generators of the society. And the Shudras are mostly in the mode of ignorance, and they are mentioned in the Mahabharata. They are meant for doing some labor. They are meant to engage in the service of the upper three divisions: Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas. Everything goes by quality, not by birth, not by some hereditary title. No. It goes by qualification. So in terms of the individual's qualifications, he described Varana Dharma. What is Brahmana Dharma? What is Kshatriya Dharma? What is Vaishya Dharma? What is Shudra Dharma?

**Key Quote:** "Everyone should get free from bondage"
**Summary:** The speaker briefly mentions Ashrama Dharma, the spiritual divisions of life, and emphasizes that the ultimate goal of both Varna and Ashrama Dharma is to liberate everyone from material bondage.

And he described the Dharma of the different Ashramas. Ashrama is spiritual division: Brahmachari, Grahastha, Vanaprastha, Sanyas. So Brahmachari Dharma, Grahastha Dharma, Vanaprastha Dharma, Sanyas Dharma, everything Bheeshma Deva described systematically. Then he also described counteraction by detachment and interaction by attachment. So Srila Prabhupada explains these things in the purport. Prabhupada has written elaborate purport. I don't have time to go through the whole purport. I will try to cover some important points that the conception of the four Varanas and four Ashramas as planned by the Lord Himself, as described in the Bhagavad Gita: Chatur Varnyam Mayasrishtam Gunakarma Vibhagshah, is to accelerate transcendental qualities of the individual person so that he may gradually realize his spiritual identity and thus act accordingly to get free from material bondage with your conditional life. See, the goal is that everybody should be freed from bondage, not just the brahmanas, not just some few educated or learned people. No. Everyone should get free from bondage, and that's possible by following the Dharma. Anyone and everyone can actually become liberated.

**Verse References:** BG 4.13
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "That is not Varnashrama Dharma"
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the common misunderstanding of Varnashrama Dharma as a system of artificial domination, clarifying that it is meant to train individuals for self-realization and liberation, distinguishing human life from the activities of animals.

That is the whole idea. In the Mahabharata, it is most elaborately explained by Bhishma Deva in the Shanti Parva beginning from the 60th chapter. Prabhupada has given reference. Where do you get details? Here it is briefly explained. It is just mentioned. It is not even explained. But Prabhupada gives a little explanation here. Now the Varnashrama Dharma is most often misunderstood, especially in the modern times, that this caste system has created artificial domination of Brahmanas or Brahmanas and Kshatriyas over the other sections of society. No. That is not Varnashrama Dharma. That is a misinterpretation. That is the degradation of the Varnashrama Dharma. When unqualified people claim to be Brahmanas or Kshatriyas, they tend to exploit the weaker sections of society. That is not Varnashrama Dharma. So Varnashrama Dharma is prescribed for the civilized human being just to train him to successfully terminate human life. What is successful termination of human life? Self-realization to attain self-realization and thereby become free from material bondage.

**Key Quote:** "One cannot be called a civilized person without acquiring the above mentioned preliminary qualities"
**Summary:** The speaker outlines nine preliminary qualities necessary for a civilized person, according to Bhishma Deva, and mentions that each Varna has specific occupational duties outlined in the Vedas.

So self-realization is distinguished from the life of the lower animals who are simply engaged in four activities: eating, sleeping, fearing, and mating. So Bhishma Deva advised for all human beings, not just for Brahmanas or not just for some people. No, 9 qualifications. What are they? Not to become angry, not to lie, not to equally distribute wealth, to forgive, to beget children only by one's legitimate wife, to be pure in mind and hygienic in body, not to be inimical toward anyone, to be simple. And the ninth one is to support servants or subordinates. It is explained here by Srila Prabhupada based on the description given by Bhishma Deva in the Mahabharata. One cannot be called a civilized person without acquiring the above mentioned preliminary qualities. Then there are specific qualities by which Brahmanas work, the Kshatriyas work, the Vaishyas work, and the Shudras work. Everybody has got specific occupational duties mentioned in the Vedas.

**Key Quote:** "controlling the senses is the most essential qualification"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the specific duties of Brahmanas (controlling the senses), Kshatriyas (giving charity), and how their roles contribute to a perfect society where Brahmanas guide and enlighten the population.

Now briefly Prabhupada says for the intelligent men, that is the Brahmanas, controlling the senses is the most essential qualification. Now it is the basis of morality. Why control the senses? It is the basis of morality. So if an intelligent man abuses his position, if he does not follow the Vedic way of life, he should seriously study Vedic literatures, especially Bhagavatam and Bhagavad Gita, and it is imperative that such a person willing to study should approach a bona fide spiritual master. He should not do anything which is forbidden in the Shastra. For the Kshatriya, it is especially advised to give charity and never accept charity in any circumstances. Kshatriya especially should give charity. So the Kshatriyas were meant to support the Brahmanas by giving them profuse charity, and thereby the Brahmanas could give free service to everyone in the society in matter of guiding them, giving them direction, enlightening them, and helping them whenever they were in difficulty. So this is the perfect society as described

**Summary:** The speaker describes the duties of Kshatriyas (protecting the weaker sections), Vaishyas (protecting cows and growing grains), and Shudras (rendering service), emphasizing the importance of each role in maintaining social order.

in the Shastras. Now one of the important duties of the Kshatriya is to actually protect the weaker sections of the society, the rest of the society, by not pretending to become non-violent when there is a need to chastise the miscreants, the rogues, the thieves, the plunderers. They should be severely chastised by using violence by the Kshatriyas. Then the Vaishyas, they should particularly protect cows and grow sufficient grains and agriculture and distribution of foodstuff, especially meant for the Vaishyas, and Kshatriyas were given charge of protection of the citizens. Vaishyas were given charge of protection of the cows, Goraksh, and they used to produce profusely agricultural produce and milk and milk products. And then the Shudras, they have no independence because they are not sufficiently intelligent enough to use their independence, so they are meant to render sincere service to the upper three sections so that they can get all their comforts of life simply by rendering service to the higher classes because as soon as a Shudra accumulates wealth, he should never be given money because as soon as he accumulates wealth, it will be misused for sinful activities in wine, women, and gambling.

And that's what we see happening today. Whoever is not intelligent enough to utilize accumulated wealth, they will misuse it for sinful activities, and that's what is happening. Population becomes degraded. In Kali Yuga, it is said population becomes degraded to the level of Shudras or even lower than that, Chandala. The Shudras should always be provided with all the necessities without giving them money so that they are satisfied in all respects and they don't have accumulated wealth to misuse them. And the upper three sections, they should maintain the Shudras under all circumstances. Never should the Shudras be abandoned by any of the upper sections.

**Summary:** The speaker briefly explains the Ashramas (Brahmachari, Grahastha, Vanaprastha, Sanyas) as progressive stages for developing spiritual qualities and achieving self-realization, highlighting the roles of attachment and detachment in different Ashramas, and concludes the lecture.

And the Ashramas, the student life Brahmachari, Grahastha the householder life, the retired life Vanaprastha, and the renounced life, it is progressively meant for developing spiritual qualities and progressing in self-realization systematically, and that is also explained by Bhishma Deva in detail. And the household life is for one who is attached, and Vanaprastha and Sanya's orders of life are meant for those who are detached. Hmm, householders are generally attached to family and so many family paraphernalia, but the Brahmachari Ashram is especially meant for training both the attached and the detached so that the goal is self-realization. Either somebody is attached or somebody is detached, but the goal is self-realization. That should not be forgotten. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Charity is not to be given to somebody who is poor, somebody who is handicapped. No, that is not charity. That's not dāna. That is different. That's called daya."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of charity (dāna) according to Vedic culture, emphasizing that it should be given to those engaged in spiritual activities, differentiating it from compassion (daya) which is given to the needy.

So, Śrīla Prabhupāda says briefly about these different types of dharmas. These are explained elaborately in the Mahābhārata. It is given. So, here he says, to give charity is one of the householder's main functions. Among the four āśramas—Brahmachārī, Grahastha, Vānaprastha, and Sannyāsa—the Brahmachārī's, Vānaprastha's, and Sannyāsa's is, don't earn money, don't have a means of living, don't have a means of getting their livelihood. So, they are dependent on bhikṣa. They beg or live by whatever is available easily in nature. So, the Grahasthas have to do this charity, giving dāna to whom? To Brahmachārīs, to the Vānaprasthas, and Sannyāsas. All three are engaged in spiritual activities exclusively. So, charity is to be given to somebody exclusively devoted to spiritual activities. Charity is not to be given to somebody who is poor, somebody who is handicapped. No, that is not charity. That's not dāna. That is different. What is that called? That's called daya. See, try to understand the difference between dāna and daya. Prabhupāda explains this elsewhere. Daya means to show compassion to somebody who is less privileged, who is, let's say, a handicapped person, who is not able to do any work to earn money. You may support such a person by giving some help, but that is not dāna. That is called daya. It's compassion. A doctor may give free treatment to some poor person who is sick or diseased. That is called daya. That is not dāna.

**Key Quote:** "So Prabhupāda explains the concept is that everyone's energy is generated or borrowed from the reservoir of energy of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the roles of different ashramas in Vedic society, emphasizing the importance of charity from householders to those dedicated to spiritual life, and explaining that all energy originates from Krishna and should be returned to Him through loving service.

Dāna is specifically the householder, or those having wealth, giving charity only to those who is exclusively engaged in spiritual activities. And in the Vedic culture, the varnāśrama dharma is followed strictly. In such a society, the brahmachāris, the vāna-prasthas, and sannyāsīs, they don't do any activity other than spiritual activities. So a brahmachāri has got specifically the duty to learn, to get trained up, how to practice spiritual life. That is the main duty of a brahmachāri. A householder should give charity, and a person in the retired and in the renounced order of life, Vāna-prasthas and sannyāsīs, should practice penances and austerities. These are general functions for all the ashramas. Actually, the brahmachāri training is such that they should understand all the property in the entire world belongs to Krishna, the supreme personality of Godhead. No one can claim any proprietorship over anything. Therefore, the life of the householder is meant to give charity, especially to the brahmachāris, vāna-prasthas, and sannyāsīs. So Prabhupāda explains the concept is that everyone's energy is generated or borrowed from the reservoir of energy of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, the resultant actions of such energy must be given to the Lord in the shape of transcendental loving service.

**Key Quote:** "Whatever we do, whatever we undergo as penance, whatever we sacrifice, whatever we eat, whatever we give in charity, must be offered to Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of rivers returning to the sea to explain that our energy, borrowed from Krishna, should be returned to Him. He quotes Bhagavad Gita to support the idea that all actions should be offered to Krishna, and explains that giving to Brahmacharis, Vanaprasthas, and Sannyasis is a way of giving to Krishna.

Rendered to Krishna. The example is given: the rivers draw water from the sea through the clouds and again go down to the sea. Similarly, our energy is borrowed from the Supreme Source, the Lord's energy. It must be returned to the Lord. That is the perfection of our energy. And Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, whatever we do, whatever we undergo as penance, whatever we sacrifice, whatever we eat, whatever we give in charity, must be offered to Krishna: yad karoṣi yad aṣṇāsi yad yahoṣi dadāsi yad yad tapasyaśi kaunteya tath kurusva madharpanam. Now, why Krishna is telling that we should give it to Krishna? Krishna is not in need. He is the source. He is the reservoir of everything. He's got unlimited wealth. So why we should give in charity to Krishna? It is actually through giving to actually the Brahmacharis and the Vanaprasthas and Sannyasis, we are giving to Krishna because they are going to utilize it for spiritual activities. In that way, it goes back to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "So the proper utilization is minimum required for your own maintenance, you definitely do utilize whatever you are earning or whatever your wealth you have inherited or earned or got from nature."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that giving charity is not renouncing something that belongs to you, but returning something that ultimately belongs to the Lord. He then transitions to discussing Rajadharma, emphasizing that the king's role is to guide citizens towards self-realization, not just sense enjoyment.

So when you give charity, actually it is going back to the original source from where you have got your wealth. So giving charity is not that something which belongs to you, you are renouncing. No, you are actually possessing something which does not belong to you. So the proper utilization is minimum required for your own maintenance. You definitely do utilize whatever you are earning or whatever your wealth you have inherited or earned or got from nature. You definitely utilize a portion of that for your own maintenance, for your subsistence, yourself, your family members, and the balance should be returned to the Lord to whom it belongs through the spiritualist, transcendentalist. That way it is going back to the Lord because the transcendentalist will only use whatever bhiksha they get for the Lord's service and not for any other purpose. Rajadharma is a great science. It is the science of ruling perfectly the kingdom, guiding the citizens so that they understand the goal of human form of life is self-realization and not sense enjoyment.

**Key Quote:** "The kings were systematically trained to become not merely tax collectors, but to become munificent in giving charity to the saintly persons."
**Summary:** The speaker continues discussing Rajadharma, highlighting the king's duty to perform sacrifices for the prosperity of the subjects and to ensure they live a life aimed at self-realization, contrasting this with modern political diplomacy.

The kings were systematically trained to become not merely tax collectors, but to become munificent in giving charity to the saintly persons. So for the prosperity of the subjects, the kings were supposed to do sacrifices. When sacrifices are performed, there is plenty of supply by the arrangement of the Supreme Lord through the agents called the Devatas. And the greatest duty of the king was to ensure that he leads the citizens in attaining ultimate salvation from material bondage. So this is Rajadharma. This is totally different from modern training in political diplomacy. This is not Rajadharma. Political diplomacy is mainly how to govern the citizens so that ultimately the citizens are going to attain complete liberation from material bondage. And it is also explained here that the taxation law was very simple. The king had a right to take one-fourth of the production made by the citizens. And who would produce? Mainly the vaisyas. And people were not grudging in parting with one-fourth of their produced wealth because that wealth which the king collected as taxes was used for providing for the citizens in so many ways. And the citizens also were rich in agriculture and animal husbandry. Therefore, they had enough grains, fruits, milk without any need for artificial ingredients like soaps and toilets and cinemas and bars. None of these things are required. Neither people had any of those in the Vedic culture.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the Vedic culture, where people were directed towards self-realization, with modern times, where wealth is often misused for sense gratification.

So this is what people were directed to live, a life mainly aimed at self-realization, not that they have wealth, they misuse that for sense gratification in so many sinful ways as is happening in the modern times. No. So that the Rajadharma was then moksha dharma. Salvation is ultimately possible by conquering the principles of lust, anger, unlawful desires, avarice, and bewilderment.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Moksha Dharma, explaining that liberation is achieved by conquering negative qualities like lust and anger. He also touches upon the roles of women in Vedic culture and the importance of pleasing the Lord.

So this is explained in the Mahabharata by Bhishma to Yudhishthira, which Bhishma is instructing. Learn to forgive people's mistakes and to become free from unlawful desires. One should not make plans, plans for enjoyment. By spiritual culture, one can be unlawful, but not more than what is minimum required. Excess sleep means one becomes lazy, one becomes dull, one becomes lethargic, and everything is spoiled by excess sleep. Sleep is very, very important. つ Cha All Explain R The Dream Insight What Suppuhan What To Why O S Name This Head Association So What Is ное so many sinful activities like that. So Bhishma Deva explained so many things. As far as the women class are concerned, they are accepted as a power of inspiration for men. So women should always be chaste, and in this way, the women will be a source of inspiration for the men under whose protection they are supposed to live. This is the Vedic culture. So like this, there are so many things. The most important thing Bhishma Deva explained is the process of pleasing the Lord, bhagavad-dharma.

How to please the Lord. So we should understand every one of us ultimately is eternal servant of Krishna and simply by worshiping the Lord but with simple ingredients but with devotion if one offers even one leaf or little water to the Supreme Lord Krishna that is the easiest way of pleasing the Lord but the important thing is bhakti, devotion. So in this way, one will actually guarantee ultimate liberation by worshiping the Lord and pleasing him through our activities. I'll stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Puranas, Itihasas, Mahabharata, and Ramayana are factual historical narrations, countering the British propaganda that they are mythology.

In this session we will be discussing from the 28th verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Dharmartha Kama Mokshamscha Sahopayan Yathamune Nanakhyana Nanak Aakhyana Itihaseshu Varanaya Masatatvavit. The meaning of this verse is: Then he described the occupational duties of different orders and statuses of life, citing instances from history, for he was himself well acquainted with the truth. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport to this verse, incidents mentioned in the Vedic literatures such as the Puranas, Mahabharata and Ramayana are factual historical narrations that took place sometime in the past, although not in any chronological order. So this is a very, very important understanding for all of us that the British propaganda was that our Vedic scriptures, especially the Puranas, Itihases, like Ramayana, Mahabharata, are all mythology. The word mythology comes from the word myth. Myth means something which is not a fact. As opposed to the British propaganda that all these are imaginary stories, the correct understanding is that the Puranas, Itihases, Mahabharata, Ramayana contain factual historical narrations.

**Key Quote:** "So the descriptions in the Puranas and the Itihasas is meant to eradicate our darkness of ignorance, enlighten us about reality, about facts, not some imaginary stories."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates that the descriptions in the Puranas and Itihasas concern incidents in different planets and universes, including the spiritual world, and are meant to enlighten us about reality.

Puranas, Itihasas, Mahabharata, Ramayana contain factual historical narrations. They are all cent percent fact, though many of the descriptions may not match our present day experience of the world we live in now. We should always remember that the descriptions in the Puranas and the Itihasas, Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. concern descriptions of incidents that take place in different planets of this universe. And sometimes the descriptions are there of incidents that take place in other universes. And of course there is description of incidents that happen in the spiritual world beyond all the material universes. So that will never tally with our experience because we do not know what is the spiritual world. We do not know what are the upper planets. We do not know what are hellish planets. That is because of our ignorance. So the descriptions in the Puranas and the Itihasas is meant to eradicate our darkness of ignorance, enlighten us about reality, about facts, not some imaginary stories.

**Key Quote:** "We are simply concerned with the instructive lessons of such incidents even though they are not in order by our limited range of understanding"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the events in Vedic literature are not always presented chronologically, but the important point is the lesson we can learn.

So this has to be very properly understood and digested. Then only the reading of the Puranas, hearing of incidents in the Vedic literature will be taken seriously. So further Srila Prabhupada says, such historical facts being instructive for ordinary men were assorted without chronological reference. Just like to give in the Bhagavatam, the disappearance of Krishna is described in the 14th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 14th chapter is entitled The Disappearance of Krishna. The Disappearance of Lord Krishna. And the appearance of Krishna is described in the 10th canto of the first chapter, or 10th canto of the third chapter, first, second and third. So it is not chronologically arranged that first this happened, then this happened, then this happened. Always. Sometimes there is a description which is not necessarily in the chronological order, not necessarily in the order in which they occurred, but the important point is there is some lesson for us to learn and that lesson is important. Besides that Srila Prabhupada continues to explain, they happen on different planets, nay in different universes, and thus the description of narrations is sometimes measured by three dimensions. Our experience of life on this planet in the present age is limited. In former ages the demigods used to visit the earth planet and they were visible to ordinary men, but in Kali Yuga the demigods are not visible, they generally don't come to this earth planet.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the limitations of our understanding and the importance of accepting knowledge from authoritative sources, even if it's beyond our current experience.

In the Kali Yuga, even if they do come, they are not visible to us. So just because they are not visible doesn't mean they don't exist. Further Srila Prabhupada says, we are simply concerned with the instructive lessons of such incidents even though they are not in order. By our limited range of understanding, our understanding is very, very, very limited. We don't even know the life forms that exist in the bottom of the oceans. The scriptures inform there are 9 lakh or 900,000 varieties of aqueducts that exist in the ecology of the universe, and how many do we know? We hardly know some few hundred, that's all we do not know. We do not know of a kind of fish called Timmy Gila which can actually devour huge whales. That's a description in the Shastra, perfect description, perfect knowledge. Where do we have experience of a Timmy Gila? We don't even know such a aquatic exists, we do not know that. So we should not just accept what tallies with our understanding or our conceptions or our experience, we should accept things because the source is perfect and authoritative.

**Key Quote:** "People should not simply do anything and everything for the sake of earning money."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how spiritual practice qualifies us to perceive reality, and how the Varna Ashrama system is designed to help civilized people achieve self-realization.

And they are giving us knowledge about things which is beyond the range of our experience or understanding. And when we qualify, we are able to perceive this reality described in the scriptures. When we qualify, there is a way of acquiring these qualifications by spiritual practice. And that is what is being taught in the Vedic literature. Dheeshma Deva described such narrations before Maharaj Yudhishtira in reply to his different questions. Yudhishtira asked so many questions about Dharma. So, Varna Dharma and Ashrama Dharma. This is for civilized people. Varna Ashrama system. The society is divided into four parts, four occupational divisions according to the acquired nature. We have discussed this in the previous verses. And Brahmana Dharma, Kshatriya Dharma, Vaishya Dharma, Shudra Dharma. So, that is way of dividing the society for the sake of everyone having a common goal or aim of self-realization. That is the reason the particular occupations are recommended. People should not simply do anything and everything for the sake of earning money. No, they should not do anything sinful. So, to avoid sinful activities means to prepare oneself to advance in spirituality, to go back to the spiritual life, and prepare oneself to go back home, back to Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "They don't even know that we are accountable for every activity we do."
**Summary:** The speaker laments that modern education misses the goal of self-realization and the understanding that we are accountable for our actions, both in this life and the next.

That is the whole program. Now, the goal itself is missing in the modern education system. They do not know that we are eternal. Each one of us is eternal. They do not know this. So, the goal itself is missing. So, then where is the relevance? Studying the scriptures and living a life based on the goal of ultimate self-realization. They do not understand this. They don't even know that we are accountable for every activity we do. Not only now because of the government or the police force or some material laws that we know are enforced. Also, after quitting this body, next life we are accountable. All our actions are accountable. If I do some sinful activities in this life, I may have to suffer in this life itself the reactions for those sinful activities. I may not suffer in this life, but I will have to suffer in the next life or in future lives. So, these are certain laws that are working.

**Key Quote:** "The perfect Prayas Chitta for all types of sinful activities. Simply chant Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the human form of life offers an opportunity to correct sinful activities, and the best way to do so is by chanting the holy name of the Lord.

Now, why do the scriptures ordain that certain sinful activities, the reactions are given only in the future lives? Because in the human form of life, if I have done a sinful activity, I have got an opportunity to correct myself. Because human being has got developed intelligence. So, he can, he or she, any human being can correct their sinful activity done unknowingly or done accidentally, done inadvertently. Somehow, by force of circumstances, somebody did something wrong. They can correct themselves. That's called Prayas Chitta. And the best Prayas Chitta as described in the Bhagavatam is simply to chant the holy name of the Supreme Lord. The perfect Prayas Chitta for all types of sinful activities. Simply chant Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Therefore, people have to be educated in the subject matter of the Puranas, especially the Bhagavat Purana or the Bhagavatam and the Itihasis, two important Itihasis. There are many, many historical narrations in the Vedic literature. But the important ones, the two most important ones are the Ramayana and Mahabharata. And it is presented in a very, very interesting way, in the form of stories. But these stories are not imaginary stories. These stories are factual narrations, historical narrations. So they are real persons. Pandavas, the Kauravas, and the personalities in the Ramayana, Dasharatha, his queens, the monkeys, Hanuman, Sugriva. They are all real persons. And they actually had so much of power. They had so much of devotion. Hanuman, the topmost devotee of the Supreme Lord Ramachandra. The best devotee, among the best devotees who is engaged in Dasya, relationship as the servant of the Supreme Lord Ramachandra.

The meaning of this verse is, while Bhishma Deva was describing occupational duties, the sun's cores ran into the northern hemisphere. This period is desired by mystics who die at their will. So Bhishma Deva was specially blessed to quit his body at the most auspicious time so that he could make his destination going back home, back to Godhead. So that most auspicious time is being described in this verse as Uttarayana Kunya Kala. So Bhishma Deva was waiting for this most auspicious time to quit his body

**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing the yogi's ability to control their body and mind to choose their destination after death, a science not taught in modern education.

because he had that Siddhi. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, "The perfect Yogis or mystics can leave the material body at their own sweet will at a suitable time and go to a suitable planet desired by them." See, not only are they able to leave the body at an auspicious time, but also they can go to the planet they desire to go, which means first of all, they have full control over their senses. Their body is made up of senses. They have completely control over their senses. They have completely control over their mind because they are able to fix their attention on the particular destination they want to go. So this is a great science, and this science is not taught in our ordinary schools, colleges, modern day education system. This science is not at all taught

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the material and spiritual skies, explaining that the material world is characterized by darkness and ignorance, while the spiritual world is illuminated by Krishna's effulgence.

niet practically unknown even to the most so-called learned scholars of the modern education system. They do not know this. In the Bhagavad Gita, Srila Prabhupada says in the 8th chapter, it is said that self-realized souls who are exactly identified themselves with the interest of the Supreme Lord can generally leave the material body during the time of the fire gods effulgence, and when the Sun is in the northern horizon, and thus achieve the transcendental sky. See, there is a spiritual sky beyond this material sky. Parastasmatubhavonyo vyakto vyaktatsanatanah Paravyoma, the spiritual sky. The material sky is what we can see with these eyes, and we understand there are so many other planets in the material sky. Some are called upper planets, some are called lower planets where the conditions of living are different than those on the earth. But beyond all these material planets, beyond this universe, beyond all the material universes, there is a spiritual sky, and in the spiritual sky, there are spiritual planets, and the spiritual sky is illuminated by the personal bodily effulgence of Krishna. It's called Brahma Jyoti effulgence, spiritual effulgence. So there is no darkness. Then in the spiritual world, the material world is characterized by its being always dark, and therefore there is a necessity of illumination either by sunlight or moonlight or by fire or electricity. There is a need of illumination in this material world, otherwise by itself, the material world is dark, a dark place. Darkness means the absence of light because of which we cannot see in darkness. Our eyes are able to see only when there is light illumination. In darkness, we cannot see

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on ignorance as a characteristic of material existence and emphasizes the importance of Vedic scriptures as a source of enlightenment and knowledge.

Secondly, darkness also means ignorance. That is a characteristic of material existence. We are always in ignorance unless we become enlightened by acquiring the proper knowledge from the perfect authority, the perfect source. So that perfect source is the Vedic literature. The scriptures, the Vedic scriptures is the perfect source for this knowledge which will enlighten us. Who am I? What is this world? What is beyond this material existence? What is spiritual existence? Who is God? What is my relationship? What is my identity? Everything is a subject matter of the Vedic scriptures.

**Key Quote:** "Perfection of yoga means attainment of such supra mental states that means the mind is completely controlled"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the perfection of yoga, enabling one to leave the body at will and travel to other planets without material vehicles, contrasting this with the limitations of materialistic science.

So Prabhupada mentions here about achieving the transcendental sky, spiritual sky. In the Vedas, these times are considered auspicious for quitting the body, and they are taken advantage of by the expert mystics who have attained perfection in this system of yoga practice. The expert mystics, that means the yogis, Ashtanga yogis, they are called ashtanga yogis. They practice ashtanga yoga. Bhishma Deva was an expert mystic yogi or ashtanga yogi, so he had perfected the method of leaving the body at an auspicious time. So therefore, he was waiting for the rottrayana punya kala, and Srila Prabhupada says further, "Perfection of yoga means attainment of such supra mental states," that means the mind is completely controlled, and mind is actually elevated in the thought process, thinking process, and mind is elevated to the concept of mind and consciousness. There is no other state of mind to a spiritual level where one will be able to leave the body as desired. Yogis can also reach any planet within no time without a material vehicle. This yogic method of traveling within this universe or even beyond the universe is not a gross method that we know of ordinarily. There is no need of a vehicle, a material vehicle. Besides that, a material vehicle is useless when we are to travel to the planet sun. Sun is full of fire, so which material vehicle will withstand that? We know of now our modern day spacecraft and rockets and sputniks and all these, how they can withstand the temperature of the sun, so you cannot go to the sun planet

**Key Quote:** "So please try to understand that leaving this earth planet and going to another planet requires that we acclimatize our selves our body to the conditions prevailing there"
**Summary:** The speaker continues discussing planetary travel, emphasizing the need to adapt the body to different planetary conditions and reiterating that spiritual knowledge is a real science, exemplified by Bhishma Deva.

neither you can go in this body. So please try to understand that leaving this earth planet and going to another planet requires that we acclimatize ourselves, our body to the conditions prevailing there. So the yogis, they are able to leave this body, and in a suitable material body, they are able to go to the higher planets or to the spiritual world, the transcendental world in the suitable form. So transcendental world they can go only in a spiritual body, and upper planets also they can go in a suitable subtle body, not a gross body. The upper planets, the gross bodies are useless. One can't even go beyond a certain range of the atmosphere of the earth. The yogis can reach the highest planetary system within a very, very short time, and this is impossible for the materialist. See, yogis means they are transcendentalists as opposed to materialists. Well, no knowledge of transcendence or spirituality, spiritually they are zero. This modern day scientists, they're spiritually zero, so they are never able to reach the highest planetary system by any means. They cannot. They don't even know of its existence, what is Brahma loka. Even attempting to reach the highest planet will take millions of years at a speed of millions of miles per hour by the process that the modern day scientists talk about travelling in outer space. It will take them millions of years at a speed of millions of miles per hour, which means those planets are really, really, really far. They are very, very far, astronomical distances. That's what we hear about from the scientists, they're so far away. So Shilpa Pune Prabhupada says, this is a different science altogether. It's a science. It's not some mythology. It's not some fiction. It's not some imaginary story. It is fact, 100% fact, and Bhishma Deva knew well how to utilize it. He had to learn from the proper source, the spiritual knowledge, the spiritual techniques. Bhishma Deva knew this.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that while pure devotees don't need to wait for an auspicious time to die, Bhishma Deva waited to instruct his grandsons as desired by Krishna.

And therefore, he was just waiting for the suitable moment to quit his material body, and the golden opportunity arrived when he was instructing his noble grandsons, the Pandavas. Bhishma Deva, even though he could quit his body at any time he desired, he chose to quit his body at the auspicious time of Uttarayana Punni. One more confidential understanding we get from the Srimad Bhagavatam is that Bhishma Deva is a pure devotee of Krishna. The Bhagavad Gita says, for a pure devotee of Krishna, there is no need to quit the body at an auspicious time only. Of course, those who are practicing Ashtanga Yoga, they have to quit the body at an auspicious time in order to be able to go to the spiritual world for eternal life, full of bliss and knowledge. But those who are Bhakti Yogis or pure devotees like Bhishma Deva, they don't have to quit the body at an auspicious time. They can quit any time and their destination is always the spiritual world. They have only one destination, that is the personal abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the spiritual world. So devotees need not wait for the auspicious time. Now Bhishma Deva here, it is described, was waiting for the suitable moment so that he could instruct his grandsons as desired by Krishna. So devotees need not wait for the auspicious time. Now Bhishma Deva here, it is described, was waiting for the suitable moment so that he could instruct his grandsons as desired by Krishna.

Krishna desired that Bhishma Deva instruct the Pandavas, especially Yudhishthira who was aggrieved at the massacre that had taken place due to the battle of Kurukshetra, to enthrone Yudhishthira as the emperor of the world. So Yudhishthira's grief was mitigated by instructions given by Bhishma Deva. Also, Bhishma Deva was lying on a bed of arrows, but his mind and his intelligence was in perfect order in spite of the most uncomfortable situation in which he was lying there on the battlefield bed of arrows. So he was detached from the physical pain, completely detached because of his being situated in Krishna consciousness. That's a proof of Krishna consciousness. He was speaking perfectly the perfect knowledge to his grandsons when they were inquiring about Dharma. He spoke, the greatest authority on Dharma was speaking on Dharma. Yudhishthira was asking about Dharma. Bhishma is the Mahajana, so he's speaking about Dharma perfectly. So that is being now explained here that Bhishma instructed the Pandavas and chose the

**Key Quote:** "Krishna wanted to glorify Bhishma."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains the context of Yudhishthira visiting Bhishma on his deathbed, highlighting Krishna's desire to glorify Bhishma and instruct Yudhishthira on Dharma.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the third verse of the ninth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Bhagavanapi Viprarshe Rathena Sadhananjayaha Satair Vyarochata Nripaha Kuvera Iva Guhyakaihi. The meaning of this verse is, O Sage amongst the Brahmanas, Viprarshe, Lord Sri Krishna, the personality of Godhead, also followed, seated on a chariot with Arjuna. Thus, King Yudhishthira appeared very aristocratic, like Kuvera, surrounded by his companions, the Guhyakas. So the description continues, as I mentioned in the previous session, Yudhishthira Maharaj is going to the site of the battlefield where Bhishma is lying on the bed of arrows, ready to quit his body at his chosen time, and Yudhishthira is very much affected by the massacre, so he is going to consult Bhishma, and it is Krishna's will that Bhishma should instruct Yudhishthira specially at the last moment before he quits his body. Krishna wanted to glorify Bhishma. Bhishma is one of the Mahajanas, and he is such a great personality that he instructed Yudhishthira in the intricacies of what is Dharma, what is real religious principles. In all details he instructed, and that is the bulk of the Mahabharata, Bhishma instructing Yudhishthira, and Yudhishthira asked so many questions about Dharma.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna was on the side of the Pandavas therefore the Pandavas were most powerful."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's role as Arjuna's chariot driver and the significance of Krishna being on the Pandavas' side, contrasting it with Duryodhana's materialistic calculations and inability to understand the true source of power.

So the description here is that Krishna also accompanied the Pandavas. Now, Krishna was seated on a chariot with Arjuna because in the battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna voluntarily agreed to be the chariot driver of Arjuna. This is because of Arjuna's friendship with Krishna. Krishna said he is not going to fight on any side in the battle, but whichever side he is going to be present, he is just going to give the instructions or the strategies how to fight, but he himself is not going to fight, he is not going to use any weapon in the battle. So Arjuna requested Krishna to be his chariot driver and to instruct him and direct him in the battle, in fighting the battle. And Krishna's army, the Yadu army, was on the Kaurava side. They were all well equipped to fight, so it seems like it was not so much of a powerful support that the Pandavas had, but actually the reality is, the truth is, Krishna was on the side of the Pandavas, therefore the Pandavas were most powerful. That Duryodhana could not understand. He was a materialistic person, so he was making some material calculations. Oh, we are very strong. Duryodhana was thinking that Bhishma is on our side, Dronacharya is on our side, Karna is on our side, the whole Yadu army is on our side, even though Krishna is on the side of the Pandavas, Krishna is not going to fight. So he is making material calculations, but as Sanjaya says, even before the battle begins in Dhritarashtra, that at the end of the Bhagavad Gita, Sanjaya says that Yatra Yogeshwara Krishna Yatra Partho Dhanurdhara Tatra Sri Vijaya, so victory belongs to the Pandavas because Krishna is on the side of the Pandavas, and Krishna is there, Arjuna is there. Krishna and Arjuna, they are Narayana and Nara. Arjuna is no ordinary person. Arjuna is the pure devotee of Krishna, and Krishna is a supreme personality of Godhead, so that Duryodhana is unable to understand. Those who are materialistic, those who are demoniac, they are unable to understand this.

**Key Quote:** "Bhishma always felt very sorry for the Pandavas suffering injustice at the hands of Kauravas."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Krishna's desire to give darshan to Bhishma and elaborates on Bhishma's sympathy for the Pandavas' suffering and his obligation to the Kauravas due to being maintained by them.

Any case, Krishna accompanied the Pandavas who were actually going to visit Bhishma. Now, Krishna wanted to actually give his darshan to Bhishma, especially at the time of Bhishma quitting his body. That is Krishna's mercy on his devotee. Bhishma is pure devotee, the Pandavas are pure devotees, so therefore Krishna was accompanying the Pandavas, and Yudhishthira, it is described here, appeared very aristocratic like Kuvera surrounded by his companions, the Guhyakas. Now, that is explained by Srila Prabhupada in the purport: Lord Sri Krishna wanted the Pandavas to be present before Bhishma Deva in the most aristocratic order so that he might be pleased to see them happy at the time of his death. Bhishma always felt very sorry for the Pandavas suffering injustice at the hands of Kauravas. Bhishma knew the Pandavas cause is just, but still why was he fighting on the side of the Kauravas? Because he was obliged to the Kauravas who were maintaining him. Actually, the entire kingdom belonged to Bhishma. He was the inheritor, but he voluntarily gave up, and because he voluntarily gave up, Dhritarashtra's father, Vichitravirya, became the emperor. That is Bhishma's brother. Bhishma gave up, so but still Bhishma, because he was, he had renounced the claim for the throne, he was being maintained as the elder member of the family in the royal family, he was looked after nicely.

**Key Quote:** "Bhishma was not very happy with the injustice that the Pandavas had to suffer at the hands of the Kauravas"
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain Bhishma's feelings towards the Pandavas and the Kauravas, and then transitions to explaining the comparison of Yudhishthira to Kuvera due to the wealth acquired for the Ashwamedha Yagna.

But he considered himself maintained by Duryodhana, Dhritarashtra, by the Kauravas when they were caretakers, and the Kauravas never gave the kingdom to the Pandavas, so Kauravas were all the while ruling, and they were giving the maintenance to the kingdom to Bhishma and Drona. So Bhishma and Drona, though they knew the Pandavas cause is just, still because they were maintained by the Kauravas, they had to fight on the side of Kauravas. This is etiquette. So Bhishma was not very happy with the injustice that the Pandavas had to suffer at the hands of the Kauravas, so at the last moment of his life, he was very happy to see the Pandavas get back their rightful claim to the throne of Hastinapura, the ruling of the entire world, and he also was, might have been pleased to see the Pandavas in a very aristocratic order because they deserve that. They are the proper claimants to the throne, and their cause is just, and they are very, very righteous in their conduct, and they are very law abiding. They are followers of Dharma. Yudhishthira particularly, he was very, very meticulously following the principles of Dharma, so Krishna wanted to actually make Bhishma very satisfied seeing the Pandavas very aristocratically taking charge of ruling the the world at the end of the battle of Kurukshetra. Now the comparison is made to Kuvera, why? Because Kuvera is the richest of all the demigods. He is the treasurer of the demigods. Kuvera is very rich, so Yudhishthira, he was very, very rich at the end of the battle of Kurukshetra, so it is explained that Yudhishthira was to perform Ashwamedha Yagna as advised by the sages, and for that he required money.

**Key Quote:** "Brahmanas were completely detached."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Maruth Maharaj's grand Ashwamedha Yagna and the immense wealth given to the Brahmanas, emphasizing their detachment from material possessions and their focus on spiritual pursuits.

And he sent his brothers to fetch wealth for performing the sacrifice because at the end of the battle of Kurukshetra, the treasury was empty, so they had to fetch wealth. So Krishna instructed Arjuna that there is lot of gold lying somewhere in the Himalayas. Now, Krishna knew this because Krishna is of course the supreme personality who has got the super soul in everyone's heart. Formerly there is, there was one a king, one emperor of this earth planet, Maruth Maharaj. He had performed a very, very grand Ashwamedha Yagna, and in that Yagna, he had spent lot of money. He had given lot of gold in charity to the Brahmanas who were performing the the sacrifice, and those Brahmanas, they were given so much gold that the Brahmanas were completely detached. They used to live a very simple life, even though they were respected the most in the society. They were given lot of charity specially by the Kshatriyas and the Vaishyas, but they never were attached to living a a aristocratic life. No, they kept their life very simple because they were devoted to to culture, to cultivating knowledge. They were devoted to to worshipping Krishna, worshipping God, and they were actually always very, very careful not to be overpowered by greed or lust or anger or or enviousness. You see, when somebody becomes very rich, there is a possibility that they may go on accumulating more and more wealth unnecessarily just out of greed. They may try to accumulate more and more wealth.

**Key Quote:** "Brahmanas want to be free from greed."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the role of Brahmanas in guiding society towards spiritual goals and the importance of detachment from material desires, then returns to the story of Arjuna fetching gold and earning the name Dhananjaya.

But Brahmanas want to be free from greed kama, krodha, loba, moha, mada, matsarya, then only they are in a proper position to guide and direct the entire society, the rest of the society. The Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras are guided by Brahmanas towards the higher aim of life, the spiritual goal, self-realization. Otherwise, the material world is entangling, and people easily forget what is the final goal of life, and they simply remain in material existence simply suffering repeated birth and death. So the Brahmanas always are enlightened. They maintain their position in that enlightened state of of having cultivated spiritual knowledge. They never want to be overpowered by greed or envy, so therefore these Brahmanas left behind all that golden utensils and golden plates and golden different varieties of golden paraffin that was given to them as dana, as charity. That was left behind, and that was lying there. Nothing happens to gold. It will be lying there, so Krishna directed Arjuna, go to that place and fetch all that gold and give it to your brother Yudhishthira for performing Ashramida Yajna. So that's how Arjuna got the name Dhananjaya. He is the one who fetched wealth for gold, especially gold for Yudhishthira to perform the Ashramida Yajna, so therefore he got the name Dhananjaya. Arjuna got the name.

So Yudhishthira was able to actually get so much gold for the sake of performing Ashramida Yajna, and that's that's the way Yudhishthira appeared very, very rich when he was visiting Bhishma accompanied by all the sages and also accompanied by his brothers who were who were riding on chariots driven by horses which were decorated with golden ornaments, so that's the description here. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Bhishma's focus on Krishna and explains why Krishna appeared to him in a four-handed Narayana form, emphasizing the personal relationship between the devotee and the Lord.

So something very interesting here is happening. Bhishma has stopped speaking. He was instructing the Pandavas. The Uttarayana Punikala has arrived, the auspicious time for him to quit the body, and he stopped speaking. Now after stopping speaking, he withdrew his mind from everything else and fixed his eyes, and thereby even his mind, upon the original personality of God at Sri Krishna. Sri Krishna was right in front of Bhishma. Remember, Krishna came along with the Pandavas to that spot where Bhishma was lying on the battlefield on the bed of arrows. So Krishna is in front of Bhishma. Bhishma fixed his attention, his eyes, his sight completely on Krishna. Now how did Krishna appear to Bhishma Deva? Krishna appeared in a four-handed form to Bhishma Deva. Why? Because Bhishma's relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead is as the four-handed Narayana dressed in yellow garments. That is the relationship of the Lord and Bhishma Deva.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna manifests in various forms according to the devotee's relationship with Him, highlighting that this relationship is spiritual and transcends material circumstances.

That is the relationship of the Lord and Bhishma Deva. So the Supreme Lord is one and his original form is the two-handed Shyama Sundara form, Krishna form. Even Krishna as Shyama Sundara is the form in which he relates with the Gopis, the young Gopis headed by Radharani. The same Krishna is present as a small child. The same Krishna is present as a five-year-old boy, covered boyfriends and the same Krishna is present before the Pandavas as the king of Dwarka, and the same Krishna is present before Bhishma Deva in this form as the four-handed Narayana. So the same supreme Lord is present in different forms according to the relationship of the devotees with the Lord. So Lord is one but his forms are according to the relationship the devotee has with the Lord and this relationship is a spiritual relationship. It is nothing to do with the material body that we have at present, the material situations we are in. It is nothing to do with this material world or material situation or circumstances.

**Key Quote:** "The most important form is the human form...The essence of material existence is misery."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the rarity and importance of human life, explaining that its primary purpose is to escape the inherent suffering of material existence.

It is totally different than this material situation. So it will be explained by Prabhupada this particular point: In the momentous hour of leaving this material body, Bhishma Deva set the glorious example concerning the important function of the human form of life. Of all the different species of life in this material world, the most important form is the human form. The Bhagavatam says Durlabham manusham janma. It is very, very, very rare that a living being in this material world gets the human form. It is very rare because there are millions and billions and trillions of living beings in so many different forms: insects and birds and animals and aquatics and plants, and trees and shrubs and reptiles, and all kinds of other life forms are there, and they outnumber the human form. Just like if I stand in a particular place, just say I occupy about 6 inches by 6 inches square flat land. Now if I dig just 1 inch down into that 6 inches by 6 inches square, there will be millions of microbes inside that. There will be so many worms. There could be so many insects. So we have no idea that the human form of life is very rare. It is very rare and it is very precious because in the human form of life, the most important function is to prepare ourselves to get out of this material existence, the essence of which is misery. The essence of material existence is misery. In any form, in any place, in the material world, there are always miseries.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore if one is absorbed in thoughts of the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna, He is sure to go back to Godhead without any doubt."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that true happiness and eternal life are attained by cultivating Krishna consciousness and remembering the Lord at the time of death.

And we don't want miseries. We are always desiring happiness. We always want to be joyful. We always want to be satisfied. We want eternal life. So that is possible by preparing ourselves in the human form of life to quit the body in the way Bhishma Deva is teaching us, by preparing ourselves to quit the body in proper consciousness. Then we go to the spiritual world for eternal life without any difficulty. We are directly transferred immediately if we are in the right conscious in the time of death. So it is explained by Prabhupada further: The subject matter which attracts the dying man becomes the beginning of his next life. This is the science described in the Bhagavat Gita. It is said, that ils invecousوا In this body there is a final moment of life in this body. That is called the moment of death. At that time, whatever is the subject matter that is attracting the person who is quitting the body, who is dying, that becomes the basis of the beginning of the next life. So Prabhupada says, therefore if one is absorbed in thoughts of the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna, he is sure to go back to Godhead without any doubt.

**Key Quote:** "Whoever at the time of death quits his body remembering me alone, that means remembering Krishna, at once attains my nature. Of this there is no doubt."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how to achieve perfection in life by constantly thinking of Krishna, even while performing daily duties, and emphasizes the importance of chanting Hare Krishna.

So how is perfection attained in this uniformed life? To be absorbed in thoughts of the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna always, so that even at the time of death we are absorbed in thought of Krishna, we go back to Krishna Loka, where we belong. Otherwise if we have some other thoughts, we have to take birth again in this material world. Again we will take birth, which means that continuation of suffering the miseries of material existence. So if you want to put an end to all material miseries and want eternal life, full of bliss and knowledge in this spiritual world in association with Krishna, then you should practice absorbing your mind in thoughts of Krishna. And how is this done? Srila Prabhupada explains in the introduction to the Bhagavad Gita: This is most easily practiced by practicing chanting of Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. So in the Bhagavad Gita, this is explained very elaborately in the 8th chapter verses 5 to 15. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita: Whoever at the time of death quits his body remembering me alone, that means remembering Krishna, at once attains my nature. Of this there is no doubt. Krishna's nature is completely transcendental, so one will get spiritual nature. And the general rule is, whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail. So Krishna tells Arjuna, therefore Arjuna should always think of me in the form of Krishna and at the same time carry out your prescribed duty of fighting with your activities dedicated to me and your mind and intelligence. And if your mind is fixed on me, you will attain me without doubt.

**Key Quote:** "Bhakti Yoga is the easy process."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Bhakti Yoga with Ashtanga Yoga and Jnana Yoga, highlighting the ease and accessibility of Bhakti Yoga for attaining spiritual liberation.

Tasmat sarveshu kaaleshu. All the time if we are practiced thinking of Krishna by mind being absorbed in Krishna, even while doing our routine duties, Maa Manusmara Yudhya Cha, Krishna says two things: You remember me and you also do your duties. So that is to be practiced. That has to be practiced. So Prabhupada says you practice chanting Hare Krishna. So even while you are doing ordinary work, you practice chanting Hare Krishna. It is a matter of the consciousness, the background consciousness with which we do any activity. That is important. He who meditates on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his mind constantly engaged in remembering me, undeviated from the path, he, O Arjuna, is sure to reach me. So Krishna is describing. And in the scriptures, there are two different recommendations. One is the method of Ashtanga Yoga, other one is the method of Bhakti Yoga. So Ashtanga Yoga method is one who at the time of death fixes his life air between the eyebrows, and in full devotion engages himself in remembering the Supreme Lord, will certainly attain to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the Ashtanga Yoga method. And then there are the Jnanis who practice chanting Om. For them it is described: Persons learned in the Vedas, Jnanis, they should study the Vedas, who utter Omkara and who enter into Brahman and who are great sages in the renounced order, enter into Brahman. So this is three different: the Jnana process, the Yoga process, Ashtanga Yoga process, and the Bhakti process. The Bhakti process is simply to be engaged in devotional service and in that state of always being engaged in devotional service, one simply quits the body whenever, anytime, and simply goes back to Godhead. So that is the advantage for the Bhakti Yogis as opposed to the Ashtanga Yogis and the Jnana Yogis. The Jnana Yogis very, very difficult process. Ashtanga Yoga also very difficult process. Bhakti Yoga is the easy process. So therefore the Bhagavad Gita recommends practice Bhakti Yoga.

**Summary:** The lecture delves into the nature of the material body, describing it as full of inauspiciousness and made of undesirable substances, highlighting the ignorance in adoring it and forgetting its true nature.

at the end of this life in the human form of body. So here it is described, 'by pure meditation.' This is the practice of the ashtanga yoga, pure meditation upon whom? Upon the Supreme Lord in the heart. Now Krishna says, 'I am seated in everybody's heart.' So it is Krishna only who's seated in everyone's heart. Therefore, Bhishma Deva, by pure meditation, looking at Lord Shri Krishna, of course, for Bhishma, there is no need to focus his attention on the inside of the heart, no need, because Krishna was right in front of him. The same Krishna was seated on the heart, was right in front of Bhishma Deva. So Bhishma Deva simply had to fix his mind upon the form of Lord Krishna standing in front of him, and by doing so, Bhishma was at once freed from all material inauspiciousness. This material body is full of inauspiciousness in so many ways. What is this body made up of? Flesh and blood and bone and stool and mucus and urine and all kinds of obnoxious things. So this body, which we adore so much just because of some facility for sense enjoyment, we give a lot of value to the body, and we are forgetting that this body, after all, is something material and not made up of very nice substances. It is now simply packaged with a covering called the skin. It's in another place in the Bhagavatam described, it's a leather bag, a skin bag made up of three elements called vata, pitta, and kapha. Vata, pitta, and kapha, air, vata is air, and pitta is bile secretion, and kapha is mucus, obnoxious things, mucus and stool and urine and bone and flesh and blood, all horrible things, and we adore this body so much in ignorance. This ignorance, actually, you should understand from the scriptures that this body is not at all auspicious.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how Bhishma, by focusing on Krishna's transcendental form, was freed from material inauspiciousness and became situated in Krishna consciousness, emphasizing that identification with the material body is due to forgetfulness of our eternal relationship with the Lord.

you should understand from the scriptures that this body is not at all auspicious. It is full of inauspiciousness. So Bhishma Deva, by fixing his attention on Krishna, the transcendental form of Krishna in front of him, completely being absorbed in meditation on Krishna, he was freed at once from all material inauspiciousness. His conscience became completely spiritualized, Krishna consciousness. He became situated and complete Krishna consciousness and was relieved of all bodily pains caused by arrow wounds, all bodily pains completely gone because the consciousness is differently absorbed. Thus, all of the external activities of his senses at one stop. So Prabhupada explains, what is this external activities of the senses? So Prabhupada says in the purport, the material body is completely destroyed and the consciousness is completely destroyed. So this material energy is actually illusory energy, and this body is due to the illusory energy effect upon the soul, the spirit soul. So each one of us, we are not the body, we are spirit soul. We are completely spiritual by nature, but when there is the influence of the illusory energy, we become bewildered, we forget ourself, and we identify with the material body, which is the covering for our real self. Further, Sri Lakshmi says, identification with the material body is due to forgetfulness of our eternal relationship with the Lord. All of us, each one of us, we have an eternal relationship with Krishna because we belong to Krishna. We have a relationship with Krishna in the spiritual world. We have a relationship with Krishna in the spiritual world, but we forget that when we are situated in the material body, by the influence of the illusory energy, we forget Krishna, we forget our relationship with Krishna, and we identify with

**Summary:** The lecture continues by explaining that the identification with the body and mind is an illusion, which is removed by devotion to Krishna, comparing Krishna to the sun and material energy to darkness, which disappears upon Krishna's arrival.

this body as myself. If you ask me, 'Are you?' I describe myself in terms of my body and mind, body and mind, which is not the real self, which is not me, which is my covering. There is a subtle covering called the mind and a gross covering called the material body, the external gross body. For a pure devotee of the Lord like Bhishma Deva, this illusion was at once removed as soon as the Lord arrived. As soon as Krishna came in front of Bhishma Deva, by just fixing his attention on Krishna, who is the most attractive personality, most attractive beautiful form in the whole creation, that supremely attractive Krishna came in front of Bhishma Deva. Bhishma Deva at once fixed his attention on Krishna, and all his illusion was gone. You, of course, as a pure devotee, was never an illusion, but even if there was any material pain or material inauspiciousness, that is all completely, that is, that disappeared when Krishna arrived in front of Bhishma Deva. So how does it work? Prabhupada explains by giving example from the Chaitanya Charita Amrita, Lord Krishna is like the Sun, Krishna's Surya Sama, and the illusory external material energy is like darkness, Maya Hoy Andhakar. Maya, material energy, illusory energy is like darkness. Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is like the Sun. In the presence of the Sun, there is no possibility that darkness can stand, just like in the morning when the Sun rises, there is no darkness that remains which was there at the night when the Sun was not in the sky. Similarly, just on the arrival of Lord Krishna, all material contamination is completely removed, and Bhismadeva was thus able to be transcendentally situated by stopping the

**Summary:** The speaker explains that when we are not Krishna conscious, our consciousness is limited to the body and mind, leading to impure material activities through the senses, emphasizing the difference between material and spiritual senses.

activities of the impure senses in collaboration with matter. This requires little explanation now. When we are not Krishna conscious, then our consciousness is limited to our body and the mind. In such a state of consciousness, we are acting, we are performing activities with our senses, with the body, in collaboration with matter. That means the original senses, which are our spiritual senses, they are the ones we are utilizing for performing material activities through the covering called the body, the material senses like the hands, the legs, the eyes, the ears. We are seeing through the eyes, we are hearing through the ears, we are utilizing our hands for different activities or the legs for walking or for any any other purpose, material purposes. So all this is impure because it is material, it's impure. The soul is originally pure, and also the senses, original senses are pure senses, spiritual senses. By material contamination, the senses assume the role of imperfection and impurity. So when we are covered by the material body, we identify with the body, and we wrongly think that my this material hand is my real hand, or the material eyes, this whole arrangement called the material eye, I think that is my eyes. I am completely forgetful of my spiritual eye, which is different from this material life, my spiritual hand different from my material hand. All my spiritual senses are different from my material senses. The material senses are covering

Then our original senses, spiritual senses, are awakened, and we act with our spiritual senses. We act spiritually through with spiritual senses. We act, perform spiritual activities, the same activities, and through the material senses, we perform material activities, the same activities. So spiritual life means awakening our spiritual senses by contact with Krishna. This contact with Krishna is very easy through chanting and hearing the holy name of Krishna, chanting and hearing the holy name of Krishna, Hare Krishna. When I say Hare Krishna, Krishna appears in the form of transcendental sound on my tongue, and Krishna appears in the form of sound, so I hear that sound, and thereby I contact the transcendental personality Krishna in the form of this transcendental sound. So then immediately I am freed from this material misconception, material covering. I'm free in the level of the consciousness, then I can perform spiritual activities in spiritual consciousness. So this is the whole process of bhakti yoga. This has to be practiced, just like I say Hare Krishna, I am freed from the material misconception, but again after saying Hare Krishna, when I stop saying Hare Krishna, again I go back to my original consciousness, material consciousness. So by practice, we learn to come out of this material consciousness, and when we are completely out of the material consciousness by always being in Krishna consciousness, then no more this material covering will be effective, will be situated in our spiritual position, in spiritual consciousness. We'll discuss

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Devim Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Raye.

TRIBHUVANA KAMANAM TAMALA VARNAM RAVIKARA GAURA VARAMBARAM DADHANE VAPURALAKA KULAVRTANAN AABJAM VIJAYA SAKHE RATI RASTUMENA VADHYA. The meaning of this verse is, Shri Krishna is the intimate friend of Arjuna. He has appeared on this earth in his transcendental body, which resembles the bluish color of the tamala tree. His body attracts everyone in the three planetary systems, upper, middle and lower. May his glittering yellow dress and his lotus face, covered with the paintings of sandalwood pulp, be the object of my attraction, and may I not desire fructive results.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna has got three kinds of energies... internal potency, his external potency and his marginal potency."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, elaborating on Krishna's three energies: internal (spiritual), external (material), and marginal (living beings), and their respective functions and influences.

So here is a description of the beautiful transcendental form of Shri Krishna, who is standing before Bhishma while Bhishma is quitting his body. Bhishma is very, very fortunate that Krishna has actually blessed him by his presence, actual presence. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, When Shri Krishna by his own internal pleasure appears on earth, he does so by the agency of his internal potency. What is the meaning of this statement? Krishna has got three kinds of energies. Krishna is the supreme person, he has got energies which are serving him, which are working for him. So everything he does through the agency of his energy. He personally has nothing to do because his energies carry out whatever he wants to do according to his will. Simply he has to decide or will to do something and it is carried out perfectly. These three categories of energies are his internal potency, his external potency and his marginal potency. Internal potency is a spiritual energy and it is meant for Krishna's own purposes exclusively. The external potency is the material energy meant for the conditioned souls. And the marginal potency consists of the living beings, innumerable, countless living beings, some of whom are in the material world, the conditioned souls. Majority of the living beings belonging to the marginal potency are in the spiritual world as pure devotees of Krishna. So, some very, very small number compared to the number of living beings who are pure devotees in the spiritual world, the number of living beings in this material world as conditioned souls are very small number.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna never comes in contact with the illusory energy or the material energy."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain how Krishna uses his internal potency when he appears in the material world and how the illusory energy affects conditioned souls but not Krishna or his pure devotees, and how Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva act as directors of the material energy under Krishna's will.

So, when it is said here by Srila Prabhupada that Krishna appears on this earth, by the agency of his internal potency, that is for his own purpose the internal potency is employed. Internal potency is completely spiritual as opposed to the external potency or the material energy which has an influence on all of us conditioned souls. It influences us by its illusory nature. The illusion that is created for enabling we conditioned souls to try to enjoy independent of Krishna, to try to think that I am independent, to try to think that I can be the lord of whoever I want to lord over. This is the necessity of the illusory energy acting on the conditioned souls. So, Krishna never comes in contact with the illusory energy or the material energy. Even when he comes to this material world, this material world is working by the action of the illusory energy or the material energy. But such illusory energy cannot act on Krishna, cannot or does not act on the pure devotees like Prabhupada, like Arjuna. The illusory energy does not act on them, the Pandavas. They are all pure devotees. And Krishna is the master, the controller of all energies including the material energy. But he directs the material energy through his directors, through his expansion as Vishnu and empowered living being as Brahma and through his incarnation as Lord Shiva. Brahma acts as the director of Rajoguna. Vishnu directs Satvaguna and Shiva directs the Tamoguna. Now, they three, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are acting as the directors exactly according to the will of Krishna. There are several verses in the scriptures to substantiate this explanation.

**Key Quote:** "When Krishna comes to this material world, it is said here, he comes by his internal potency... he appears in his transcendental form."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna appears in his transcendental form, untouched by material energy, and that his form is uniquely attractive, surpassing any beauty found in the material universe.

Now, when Krishna comes to this material world, it is said here, he comes by his internal potency. So, exactly according to his will, his internal potency also will act for his own purposes. And then, he appears in his transcendental form. Unlike us, even though we have a spiritual form, our spiritual form is covered by a material body or a material form. Krishna never is covered by any material body or material form. He comes in his transcendental form. That form looks like a human form, but it is his original form. Now, the attractive features of his transcendental body are desired in all the three worlds, namely the upper, middle and lower planetary systems. It's so beautiful, Krishna's form is so beautiful that everyone who can get an opportunity to see that beautiful form, they are attracted by all the attractive features. There are many, many attractive features of Krishna's beautiful form, transcendental form. Now, another important point Prabhupada says in this purport is that nowhere in the universe are there such beautiful bodily features as those of Lord Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Arjuna was always a conqueror because the Lord was his friend."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Arjuna's position as a conqueror due to his friendship with Krishna, and why Bhishma addresses Krishna as 'Vijaya Sakhe' (friend of Arjuna), highlighting Krishna's pleasure in being associated with his devotees and the different transcendental humors (Rasas) in their relationships.

Now, if there is some particular feature that is very attractive for everyone, nobody else in the entire universe possesses such beautiful features. It's not possible. Therefore, the conclusion is that Krishna's transcendental body has nothing to do with any material creation, with any materially created form. It is completely different. Arjuna is described here as the conqueror and Krishna is described here as his intimate friend. Now, Bhishma Deva is remembering the particular dress of Lord Krishna which Krishna put on as the driver of Arjuna's chariot. Krishna was acting as the Sarathi or the driver of Arjuna's chariot. He was having a particular dress. That dress Bhishma is remembering. Now, while fighting was going on between Arjuna and Bhishma, Bhishma's attraction was drawn by the glittering dress of Krishna. And indirectly, Bhishma is admiring his so-called enemy Arjuna for possessing Lord Krishna as his own friend. Hmm, Arjuna was always a conqueror because the Lord was his friend. And Bhishma Deva takes this opportunity to address Lord Krishna as Vijaya Sakhe meaning friend of Arjuna. Why is he addressing Krishna as friend of Arjuna? Because Krishna is always pleased when he is addressed conjointly with his devotees who are related with him in different transcendental humors. Humors means Rasa. There are five spiritual Rasas which the devotees relish in their relationship with Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Devotees are simply by remembering Krishna's beautiful form... able to completely situate themselves on the transcendental platform and they are never touched by the material energy."
**Summary:** The speaker lists the five spiritual Rasas and explains how devotees can elevate themselves to the transcendental platform by remembering Krishna's form, name, activities, and qualities, thus remaining untouched by material energy.

Hmm, Shanta Rasa, Dasi Rasa, Sakya Rasa, Vatsali Rasa, Madhuri Rasa. Depending on the type of relationship, they relish different Rasas. Arjuna is situated in Sakya Rasa. Therefore, Vijaya Sakhe, Vijaya Sakha Sakha is addressing form of address. So Vijaya is another name of Arjuna. So Arjuna's friend that is Krishna. While Krishna was the charioteer of Arjuna sun rays glittered on the dress of the Lord and the beautiful hue created by the reflection of such rays was never forgotten by Bhishma Deva. Devotees are simply by remembering Krishna's beautiful form, Krishna's beautiful smile, Krishna's beautiful address or Krishna's beautiful features or Krishna's name, Krishna's form, Krishna's activity, Krishna's quality, anything they are able to completely situate themselves on the transcendental platform and they are never touched by the material energy. So Bhishma Deva remembering Krishna's beautiful form as the chariot driver of Arjuna he is able to immediately situate himself on the platform of Krishna consciousness. Now, Bhishma is himself a great fighter and as a great fighter he was relishing the relation of Krishna in the chivalrous humor. It's called virya rasa. There are five primary rasas and seven secondary rasas. One of the seven secondary rasas devotees have with Krishna is called virya rasa, chivalrous humor. Bhishma is situated in a relationship with Krishna as his devotee in the virya rasa or chivalrous humor. So, transcendental relation with the lord in any one of the different rasas or humors is relished by the respective devotees in the highest ecstasy.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing that each devotee relishes their specific relationship (Rasa) with Krishna to the highest degree, using Bhishma's chivalrous humor (Virya Rasa) and Radharani's Madhuriya Rasa as examples.

This is very important to understand that a particular devotee's own relationship with Krishna is relished by the devotee to the highest degree. If Bhishma is situated in virya rasa relationship with Krishna, Bhishma relishes virya rasa to the highest degree. Radharani is situated in madhuriya rasa relationship with Krishna, she relishes that to the highest degree. Arjuna is situated in friendly relationship with Krishna, he relishes that friendly relationship to the highest degree. So, any of the rasas are relished to the highest degree by the respective devotees. I will stop here.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (1.9.34) describing Bhishma's remembrance of Krishna on the battlefield, focusing on Krishna's appearance and the arrows striking Him.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Devim Saraswateem Vyasam Tatham Jaya Mudhi Rayet. In this session we will be discussing from the 34th verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Shreemad Bhagavatam. Yudhi Turaga Rajo Vidhumra Vishvak Kachalulita Shramavarya Lankratasye Mama Nishita Sharair Vibhidhyamana Tvachi Vilasat Kavachestu Krishna Aatma. The meaning of this verse is: On the battlefield where Shri Krishna attended Arjuna out of friendship, the flowing hair of Lord Krishna turned ashen due to the dust raised by the hooves of the horses, and because of his labour, beads of sweat wetted his face. All these decorations intensified by the wounds dealt by my sharp arrows.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Bhishma's transcendental relationship (Virya Rasa) with Krishna, emphasizing that Krishna's transcendental body cannot be harmed and that understanding these concepts requires hearing from pure devotees.

Bhishma Deva, he is fixing his mind on Shri Krishna by remembering the different transcendental forms of the Lord on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. Bhishma, as has been explained earlier, is situated in a transcendental relationship called Virya Rasa with Lord Shri Krishna, so Krishna enjoys that fighting with Bhishma. And in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, Krishna is not fighting, Arjuna is fighting. So Bhishma is attacking Arjuna as the enemy, but Krishna is trying to protect Arjuna. So, Bhishma is releasing arrows to kill Arjuna, but Krishna is intercepting those arrows and those arrows are striking Krishna's transcendental body. Now, the transcendental body, as will be explained by Srila Prabhupada, cannot be wounded, cannot be destroyed, cannot be cut. It is completely spiritual. So, that is the difficult part to understand for a common man. Therefore, we have to hear such descriptions from the lips of a pure devotee who will explain perfectly how to understand these dealings between the lord and his devotees.

**Key Quote:** "The lord is the absolute form of eternity, bliss and knowledge."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's nature as eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, and discusses the five primary relationships (rasas) with Krishna: shanta, dasya, sakya, vatsalya, and madhurya.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains elaborately in this purport. The lord is the absolute form of eternity, bliss and knowledge. Eternity, his body, his form, his existence is eternal. Sat, chit, knowledge, full of knowledge, ananda, full of bliss. As such, transcendental loving service to the lord in one of the five principles, namely, shanta, dasya, sakya, vatsalya and madhurya—that is neutrality, servitorship, fraternity, filial affection and conjugal love—is graciously accepted by the lord when offered to the lord in genuine love and affection. Everyone has a specific relationship with Krishna, every living being. So, the perfection of our life is to reinstate ourselves in that relationship with Krishna, loving relationship with Krishna in one of the five primary relationships. So Sri Bhishma Deva is a great devotee of the lord in the relation of servitorship. There are secondary rasas and primary rasas. Primary rasas are based on the primary relationship, and while exchanging this rasa with the supreme lord, there are secondary rasas also in the course of exchange of the primary rasa. That is what gives rise to variety of the rasas exchanged in the activities of that relationship.

**Key Quote:** "Thus his throwing of sharp arrows at the transcendental body of the lord is as good as the worship of another devotee who throws soft roses upon him"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Bhishma's actions, though seemingly harmful, are a form of worship, and that Krishna's body is not pained due to its transcendental nature.

So Bhishma is situated primarily in the relationship of dasya as a servant, as a servitor. Thus his throwing of sharp arrows at the transcendental body of the lord is as good as the worship of another devotee who throws soft roses upon him. So how is Krishna receiving these arrows shot by Bhishma? Krishna is receiving it exactly like another devotee offers soft roses while worshipping the lord. For Krishna both are same, there is no difference. Why? Because Bhishma is a devotee. It appears that Bhishma Deva is repenting the actions he committed against the person of the lord. The way Bhishma is describing here in his prayers, it appears like he is repenting, 'Why did I shoot arrows at the supreme lord, or why did my arrows which are meant for striking Arjuna go and hit Krishna, my worshipable lord?' But factually the lord's body was not at all pained due to his actions.

**Key Quote:** "This material body is not our identity... we are eternally devotee of Krishna in the spiritual form"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the material body with the spiritual form, emphasizing that our true identity is as eternal devotees of Krishna, not as the temporary material body.

This is a transcendental existence. This we understand from the Bhagavad Gita. Spirit or spiritual form, transcendental form is of a different quality than material form. We know this material body is subject to being wounded. When somebody shoots an arrow at my body then my body can become wounded, but Krishna's form or body is not material, his body is not matter. Both he himself and his body are complete spiritual identity, spiritual. It is spiritual and Krishna has his identity as the supreme lord. This material body is not our identity. I appear like a human being because I have got a human like material body, but actually I am not this body, neither my identity is a human being. This is in this life my mind and body system works like a human beings mind and body. In another life if I have the body of a Devata then I will act and behave like a Devata. If some other living being has got the body of a dog then the living being in that dog's body will behave and act like a dog. But we are neither dog nor we are human nor we are Devata, we are eternally devotee of Krishna in the spiritual form. So that form, spiritual form, is not having an identity based on this material coverings. This is not our identity.

**Key Quote:** "Spirit is never pierced, burnt, dried, moistened etc... spirit is always uncontaminated and indestructible"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the spiritual form is indestructible, uncontaminated by matter, and eternal, referencing the Bhagavad Gita and Skanda Purana.

So Krishna's identity is he is the supreme lord and he is the supreme lord in a spiritual form. As Krishna, spirit is never pierced, burnt, dried, moistened etc. Spirit cannot be destroyed by anything, by any of the elements, by fire, by water, by air, by wind, by some weapon, material weapon made of one of the elements like metal or any of those elements, it cannot be destroyed. This is vividly explained in the Bhagavad Gita chapter verses 11 to 30, clearly it is explained. So also it is stated in the Skanda Purana, this confirmed in the Skanda Purana also, spiritual form cannot be destroyed by any weapon. It is said there that spirit is always uncontaminated and indestructible. Spirit is never contaminated by matter. Even in our case, even though there is a material covering for our original spiritual form, still that spiritual form or spirit cannot be contaminated by matter. This remains like a superficial covering only and it cannot be destroyed. Spiritual form cannot be destroyed, it is eternal form. It cannot be distressed nor it can be dried up, it cannot be distressed the spiritual form.

**Key Quote:** "Lord Vishnu in his incarnation appears before us, he seems to be like one of the conditioned souls... just to bewilder the asuras"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how Krishna appears to be like a conditioned soul to bewilder non-believers (asuras) who try to harm Him, emphasizing that the Lord is completely spiritual and cannot be killed.

There is no question of distress. When lord Vishnu in his incarnation appears before us he seems to be like one of the conditioned souls materially encaged. Encaged means material body has trapped us in this body or we have become imprisoned in this body, but that imprisonment is at the level of consciousness because the spirit soul is not a physical entity. So imprisonment here means I am conditioned now. Vishnu appears to be like one of the conditioned souls just to bewilder the asuras or the non-believers who are always alert to kill the lord even from the very beginning of his appearance. The asuras or the demons, they are always envious of Krishna and because they are envious of Krishna when Krishna appears they want to kill him. Kamsa wanted to kill Krishna and Ravana wanted to kill Rama, you have heard this from the scriptures, because foolishly they were unaware of the fact that the lord is never killed for the spirit is never annihilated. Lord is completely spiritual so how can he be killed by anybody by any weapon, not possible. Therefore Bhishma's piercing of the body of lord Krishna is a sort of bewildering problem for the non-devotee atheist.

**Key Quote:** "Bhishma Deva appreciated the all-merciful attitude of the lord because he did not leave Arjuna alone"
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by explaining how non-devotees are bewildered by Bhishma's actions, while devotees understand the pure devotion and kindness in the relationship between Bhishma and Krishna, ending with gratitude and Hare Krishna.

The non-devotees hear this they will ridicule you, consider Krishna as god, but how is Bhishma able to pierce his body by shooting sharp arrows? So non-devotees cannot understand, but those who are devotees or liberated souls are not bewildered by this description. They are not bewildered by this description. Nothing happens to Krishna as far as his transcendental form is concerned, it cannot be affected by any of the weapons. Bhishma Deva appreciated the all-merciful attitude of the lord because he did not leave Arjuna alone although he was disturbed by the sharpened arrows of Bhishma Deva, nor was he reluctant to come before Bhishma's deathbed even though he was ill-treated by Bhishma on the battlefield. See Krishna is so kind to his devotees, he understands the devotees mood of serving and therefore he did not mind the sharpened arrows of Bhishma when Bhishma was fighting on the battlefield, nor did he become reluctant to come in front of Bhishma when Bhishma was about to quit his body. So therefore Bhishma's relationship with the lord is one of pure devotion and that is to be understood in this exchange between Bhishma and the supreme lord. I will stop here, thank you very much.

In this session we will be discussing from the thirty-fifth verse of the ninth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, continuing the prayers by Bhishma Deva to Lord Krishna. The meaning of this verse is, "In obedience to the command of his friend, Lord Sri Krishna entered the arena of the battlefield of Kurukshetra between the soldiers of Arjuna and Duryodhana. And, while there, he shortened the life-spans of the opposite party by his merciful glance. This was done simply by his looking at the enemy. Let my mind be fixed upon that Krishna."

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is actually nobody's order carrier."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Krishna, despite being the Supreme Lord, acts as an order carrier for his devotee Arjuna, highlighting the sweet relationship between them, while clarifying that Krishna is not actually anyone's servant.

This is the glorification of Krishna by Lord, by Bhishma Deva, the great devotee of Krishna. So, it is clear, it is clearly explained here that Krishna simply by his merciful glance can shorten the duration of the life of the enemy to make Arjuna, his devotee, victorious. So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport to this verse, "In the Bhagavad Gita, 1.21-25, Arjuna ordered the infallible Lord Sri Krishna to place his chariot between the phalanxes of the soldiers. He asked Krishna to stay there until he had finished observing the enemies he had to face in the battle. When the Lord was so asked, he at once did so, just like an order carrier. Krishna is actually nobody's order carrier. Everyone is his servant and everyone carries out Krishna's order, whether willingly or unwillingly. Devotees carry out Krishna's orders willingly, and non-devotees are forced to carry out Krishna's orders unwillingly. Because non-devotees are in the material world in forgetfulness of Krishna, but they are forced by Krishna. They are forced by Krishna's material energy to act according to the conditioning. So, nobody is independent among the living entities. Nobody is independent. So, here it is described, the sweet relationship between Krishna and Arjuna, such that when Arjuna ordered Krishna, 'Take my chariot between the two armies,' Krishna did so, just like an order carrier."

**Key Quote:** "Out of his causeless mercy and affection for his pure devotees, sometimes Krishna carries out the order of the devotee like an awaiting servant."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's pleasure in fulfilling the desires of his devotees out of love, comparing it to a father indulging a child, emphasizing that this is not due to any authority of the devotee but pure, transcendental love.

Though he is not an order carrier. And the Lord pointed out all the important men on the opposite side saying, "Here is Bhishma, here is Drona, and so on." The Lord being the supreme living being is never the order supplier or carrier of anyone. Krishna is never the order supplier or order carrier of anyone. Wherever that person may be in the material estimation, there are some people who are very, very powerful, very great. Some people who are not so great. Some people are very insignificant. But Krishna has nothing to do with any of these material positions of different living beings. Out of his causeless mercy and affection for his pure devotees, sometimes Krishna carries out the order of the devotee like an awaiting servant. Krishna takes pleasure in doing this. That my devotee is very dear to me. So if my devotee wants something, I will gladly reciprocate with the devotee, exactly as the devotee wants me to reciprocate. By executing the order of a devotee, the Lord becomes pleased, as a father is pleased to carry out the order of his devotees. Similarly, the Lord is pleased to carry out the order of a small child. You have experienced that a small child may sometimes ask the father like a master commands his servant. "Give me that toy." So the father out of love for the child will actually carry out the order. Not because the child has got any authority or any power. No. Similarly, nobody has authority or power to give orders to Krishna. On the other hand, Krishna is always the order giver.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's willingness to carry out orders is rooted in pure transcendental love and highlights Bhishma Deva's understanding of this relationship, emphasizing the importance of addressing Krishna in connection with his devotees.

And everyone is his servant without exception. But Krishna takes pleasure in executing the order of a devotee because of the devotee, the sweet relationship between Krishna and the devotee. Now, this sort of carrying out orders by the Lord of his devotee is possible only out of pure transcendental love between the Lord and his devotees. And Bhishma Deva was aware of this fact. He therefore addresses the Lord as the friend of Arjuna. Partha Sakha. Vijaya Sakha. As Prabhupada has explained earlier, Krishna is very very pleased if you address him in relationship with his devotees. Keshodanandana. Radhakantam. Gopijanavallabha. Always Krishna in relationship with his devotees. Krishna is never without his devotees. And devotees are never without Krishna. So always both devotees and Krishna like to hear an address which is describing the relationship of the Lord and his devotees. Therefore, Bhishma is addressing Krishna as Partha Sakha. Vijaya Sakha.

**Key Quote:** "Simply by seeing Krishna at the time of death, one is able to get liberation immediately."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how Krishna can shorten or extend lifespan, and how those who died in Kurukshetra attained salvation by seeing Krishna at the time of death, emphasizing Krishna's mercy.

Further, Srila Prabhupada says, "The Lord diminished the duration of life of the opposite party by his merciful glance." Our lifespan, at the time of birth is fixed, of a certain duration is fixed based on our past karma. But that duration, even though it is fixed, it can be shortened or increased by Krishna. If somebody becomes very very sinful, their duration of life is shortened. If somebody is able to please a pure devotee, their duration of life may be extended. So, the duration of life though fixed is subject to being reduced or increased by Krishna or by a pure devotee. So in this case, it is described that the duration of life of the enemy of Arjuna was shortened by Krishna. It is said that all the fighters who assembled on the battlefield of Kurukshetra attained salvation by personally seeing the Lord at the time of death. Krishna was present on the battlefield of Kurukshetra to deliver all those who were eligible because simply by seeing Krishna at the time of death, one is able to get liberation immediately.

**Key Quote:** "Factually, he was merciful to the opposite party because they would not have attained salvation by dying at home in the ordinary course of life."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that Krishna's actions on the battlefield, including shortening the lives of Arjuna's enemies, were not partial but ultimately beneficial, granting them liberation through death in Krishna's presence.

So that is the mercy of Krishna upon the living entities. Therefore, his diminishing the duration of life of Arjuna's enemy does not mean that he was partial to the cause of Arjuna. Somebody may think that Krishna is shortening the duration of life of the enemy. So he is giving benefit to Arjuna in fighting this battle which is not fair. But actually Krishna is not doing this simply for benefiting Arjuna alone. He is also benefiting the enemy. Whether the enemy is dying in the battlefield or the enemy will have to die later on somewhere else, death is certain for every living being who has taken birth in this world. So death cannot be avoided. But if the death is caused by a pure devotee of Krishna, then the person who dies actually attains liberation immediately because of the presence of Krishna, the glance of Krishna. So Krishna benefited the enemy also, not only Arjuna. Factually, he was merciful to the opposite party because they would not have attained salvation by dying at home in the ordinary course of life.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna is always good and impartial, and that both protection and being killed by Krishna are ultimately beneficial spiritually, leading to liberation.

This we have to remember. Somebody may not die on the battlefield, but they have to go back home and they have to die afterwards. Such death is not at all going to give them liberation, ordinary death. Here was a chance to see the Lord at the time of death, and thus attain salvation from material life. See, Krishna's mercy upon the enemies. So therefore, Krishna is always all good. He has no enmity. He has no feeling of partiality. He does not favour one person and deny another person. Never. Krishna never does that. Because every living being is his part and parcel. mamayivamso jivaloke jivabhuta-sanatana. Eternally we are parts and parcel. So how can Krishna be partial to anyone? It's not possible. Therefore, the Lord is all good. And whatever he does is for everyone's good. Krishna's actions are on the absolute platform. So Krishna's protection and Krishna's killing both are good for the person who receives the protection from Krishna or is killed by Krishna. For both of them,

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by urging listeners to avoid material calculations and seek Krishna consciousness, emphasizing that understanding the transcendental nature of Krishna's activities leads to liberation.

it is ultimately beneficial spiritually. Don't make material calculations. That is not going to help the person by some material calculations if they think they are escaping dying on the battlefield. They are forgetting that they have to die sometime later. And at that time, they may not have the benefit of Krishna consciousness. Because we have to take birth again in this material world and suffer the consequences. So to put an end to this miserable existence is possible by coming in contact with Krishna or his pure devotee. Apparently, it was victory for Arjuna. But factually, it was for the good of Arjuna's enemies. Whatever Krishna did was good for Arjuna's enemies also. That way, the Lord is all good. Such are the transcendental activities of the Lord. And whoever understands this also gets salvation after putting his material body. janma karma chame divyam evam yo veti tatvaram yo veti tatvatah. The activities of the Lord are all transcendental. And if we understand the transcendental nature of Krishna's activities, we also become liberated. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

The meaning of this verse is, when Arjuna was seemingly polluted by ignorance upon observing the soldiers and commanders before him on the battlefield, the Lord eradicated his ignorance by delivering transcendental knowledge. May his lotus feet always remain the object of my attraction. So this prayer by Bhishmadeva refers to Arjuna's bewilderment upon seeing the enemy at the beginning of the battle of Kurukshetra, when Krishna eradicated Arjuna's ignorance by speaking Bhagavad Gita. So directly it is a reference to Krishna instructing Arjuna in the subject matter of Bhagavad Gita.

**Key Quote:** "Unlike the modern-day defense ministers or presidents, head of state, who never go to a battlefield to fight or defend the country."
**Summary:** This segment contrasts the Vedic Kshatriya's role of leading from the front with modern leadership, highlighting the courage and chivalry expected of ancient rulers compared to contemporary leaders.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "The kings and the commanders were to stand in the front of the fighting soldiers." They are the system of actual fighting. The kings and commanders were not so-called presidents or ministers of defense as they are today. Prabhupada is comparing the Vedic times when the Kshatriyas with the proper spirit, they would execute their duties boldly, courageously, chivalrously, unlike the modern-day defense ministers or presidents, head of state, who never go to a battlefield to fight or defend the country. They simply sit in closed offices, secure offices and issue commands. They would not stay home while the poor soldiers or mercenaries were fighting face to face. This is not the case with the Kshatriyas like Arjuna. Bhishma, all of them fought in the front line. The soldiers were behind. The generals and the commanders were in the front. This may be the regulation of modern democracy. But when actual monarchy was prevailing, the monarchs were not cowards elected without consideration of qualifications. Nowadays, when we elect a monarch, we elect a monarch. We don't check the qualification of the person who is elected or the person who is able to face the enemy in a battle. We don't check that. Whereas in the former times, a Kshatriya was not a Kshatriya for namesake. He was actually bold, he was brave, he was ready to lay down his life for protecting the citizens in a battle, as it was evident from the battlefield of Kurukshetra, all the executive heads of both parties like Drona, Bhishma, Arjuna and Duryodhana were not sleeping. All of them were actual participants in the fighting, which was selected to be executed at a place of war away from the civil residential quarters.

**Key Quote:** "This means that the innocent citizens were immune from all effects of fighting between the rival royal parties."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the protection of citizens in Vedic society, emphasizing that battles were confined to the battlefield and citizens paid taxes to the ruler regardless of who was in power.

Civilians were not affected by the battle of Kurukshetra because the battle was fought between Kshatriyas only. This means that the innocent citizens were immune from all effects of fighting between the rival royal parties. Citizens were kept safe irrespective of who would rule and if they had to challenge one king had to challenge another king they would fight on the battlefield, not fight in the middle of some other place. No, they would not do that. The citizens had no power, no business in seeing what was going to happen during such fighting. It is not that they are watching some match, wrestling match. No. It's not like that. The citizens were protected whoever was the king. Prabhupada explains they were to pay, the citizens were to pay one fourth of their income to the ruler whether he be Arjuna or Duryodhana. Who was the ruler? The scriptures state…

**Summary:** This segment explores Arjuna's compassion and reluctance to fight, attributing it to his merciful nature as a devotee, while also suggesting that his intelligence was seemingly polluted by illusion.

All the commanders of the parties on the battlefield of Kurukshetra were standing face to face and Arjuna saw them with great compassion and lamented that he was to kill his kinsmen on the battlefield for the sake of the empire. This was Arjuna's beginning reaction when he saw the enemy party. He saw all his own friends and relatives and he felt compassion for them. Why should I kill them? For me to win this battle and rule over the kingdom of the whole world? No, I don't want. Arjuna felt like that. Arjuna was not at all afraid of the giant military phalanx presented by Duryodhana, but as a merciful devotee of the Lord, renunciation of worldly things was natural for him. There is a quality of a devotee. Prabhupada explains in the first chapter of the Bhagavad Gita in one of the purports. Arjuna's kind and soft-hearted nature is the reason why Arjuna was feeling compassion for his enemies. He was not afraid of his enemies. Never. And thus Arjuna decided not to fight for worldly possessions. But this was due to a poor fund of knowledge and therefore it is said here that his intelligence became polluted. kumatim aharad atmavigyaya kumatim, his intelligence became polluted. kumatim. His intelligence was polluted.

Actually as a devotee Arjuna's intelligence cannot be polluted, but it was apparently polluted because Krishna wanted to speak Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna. And through Arjuna Krishna wants to instruct the Bhagavad Gita to all other living beings in this world. It is Krishna's plan to deliver all the conditioned souls in so many different ways.

**Summary:** This segment addresses Arjuna's question about Krishna's ability to impart ancient knowledge, highlighting Krishna's eternal nature and his plan to show mercy to conditioned souls by putting Arjuna in a state of illusion.

Now Arjuna is described as a constant companion of the Lord as is clear on the fourth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. In the fourth chapter Arjuna asks Krishna that you are telling me you spoke this science of yoga to some god millions of years back. Now how can I understand you spoke this millions of years back when I am seeing that you were born at about the same time I was born. So how could he have spoken this knowledge before millions of years to the sun god. So Krishna answers both you and I keep taking birth again and again. You can't remember your previous births I can remember all my previous appearances. So Krishna's position is that he never is any time forgetful of Krishna. Arjuna's position is like that pure devotee's position is like that. But still to show mercy upon the conditioned souls Krishna put Arjuna into a position of becoming illusioned and spoke the Bhagavad Gita to become, make him free from illusion.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is speaking the Bhagavad Gita for the good of all polluted conditioned souls who are engaged in material bondage by the conception of the false material body."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that the Bhagavad Gita was spoken for the benefit of all conditioned souls trapped in material bondage, primarily due to identifying with the body rather than the spirit soul.

Otherwise his devotee can never come under the influence of illusion. Apparently Arjuna's intelligence became polluted because otherwise there would have been no chance to deliver the teachings of the Gita for the good of all polluted conditioned souls. For our benefit Krishna spoke Bhagavad Gita. So it is for our sake that Krishna spoke the Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna. Now Prabhupada explains Krishna is speaking the Bhagavad Gita for the good of all polluted conditioned souls who are engaged in material bondage by the conception of the false material body. We are having this body we wrongly think I am this body each one of us and we are misled by the body to think in terms of material existence. We are simply bound up the more we engage in different activities in this world, material activities, the more we become entangled in this material world. So therefore the Bhagavad Gita is spoken by Krishna to help us understand primarily that we are spirit soul and Krishna suggests a method by which we can come out of this material existence itself by devotional service, by understanding Krishna, by knowing Krishna, by understanding Krishna, by understanding Krishna. So therefore it is explained the Bhagavad Gita was delivered to the conditioned souls of the world to deliver them from the wrong conception…

**Key Quote:** "We are spirit soul but we identify with this body and that is the greatest mistake."
**Summary:** This segment reiterates the fundamental problem of identifying with the body and stresses the importance of re-establishing our eternal relationship with Krishna through transcendental knowledge, which is available to everyone.

This is the fundamental problem all of us have. Each one of us we are spirit soul but we identify with this body and that is the greatest mistake. In ignorance we only think in terms of body that is all. Whereas Krishna speaks Bhagavad Gita to help us get out of this misconception and we should also re-establish our eternal relationship with the Supreme Lord Krishna and with the Supreme Lord Krishna. Nearly getting out of material existence is not enough. We have to also re-establish our lost relationship with Krishna. So therefore Atma Vidya or transcendental knowledge of himself was primarily spoken by the Lord for the benefit of all concerned in all parts of the universe. Krishna is speaking Atma Vidya or Brahma Vidya, transcendental knowledge, spiritual knowledge for the benefit of everyone throughout the universe. There is no restriction or limitation for anyone to take up the instructions of Krishna given in the Bhagavad Gita and make their life successful. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Speaker:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami

#### Transcendental nature of Krishna's actions, Elevating consciousness through remembrance of Krishna
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/idXfNsA7ED0?t=57
**Verse References:** SB 1.9.37
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "And every action of Krishna is completely transcendental."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains that Krishna's actions, even in the material world, are transcendental and elevate one's consciousness.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 37th verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, continuing the prayers by Bhishma Deva. स्वनिगमं अपहाय मत्पतिज्ञाम् रितं अधिकर्तुम् अवप्लुतो रतस्तः दृतरत्थ चरणोभ्या चलत्गुर् हरीरीवहंतुम् इभं गतोत्तरियह. The meaning of this verse is: Fulfilling my desire and sacrificing his own promise, He got down from the chariot, took up its wheel, and ran towards me hurriedly, just as a lion goes to kill an elephant. He even dropped his outer garment on the way. Bhishma Deva is recollecting the different events that happened in the past in relationship with Krishna, and every action of Krishna is completely transcendental. So remembering such events is automatically elevating the relationship with Krishna and elevating one's consciousness to the spiritual platform. So every single activity the Lord performs, He does so on the spiritual plane. None of the activities of Krishna are material, even though Krishna is in the material world. In the past times, He does not come in contact with the material energy at all. He is completely aloof from it.

#### Battle of Kurukshetra, Kshatriya principles, Duryodhana's criticism of Bhishma

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The battle of Kurukshetra was fought on military principles, but at the same time in a sporting spirit like a friend's fight with another friend."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, focusing on the sporting spirit of the Kurukshetra war and Duryodhana's criticism of Bhishma's perceived reluctance to kill Arjuna.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The battle of Kurukshetra was fought on military principles, but at the same time in a sporting spirit, like a friend's fight with another friend." See, they are simultaneously fighting, following the military principles, at the same time in a friendly spirit they are fighting. That's the nature of a kshatriya. A kshatriya doesn't mind losing a battle provided he fights to his best capacity and gives up his life in the course of fighting, sacrifices his life. Such a kshatriya actually is able to elevate himself to the heavenly planets, minimum, by fighting in the proper kshatriya spirit in a Dharma Yudha. So here it is explained by Srila Prabhupada in the purport: Duryodhana criticized Bhishma Deva, allegedly, that he was reluctant to kill Arjuna because of paternal affection. Now see, Bhishma's position is very unique. He is related to both the Pandavas and Kauravas. Both the Pandavas and Kauravas are the grandsons of his brother, Bhishma's brother, so Bhishma is equally related to the Pandavas and Kauravas. He was not acting partially, but Duryodhana criticised like that, that Bhishma is not killing Arjuna because he has some affection for the Pandavas and especially Arjuna. So it is explained by Prabhupada here, "A kshatriya cannot tolerate insults on the principle of fighting because of this..." A kshatriya cannot tolerate insults under client's protection.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Bhishma's vow to kill the Pandavas, Duryodhana's safeguarding of the arrows, and Krishna's plan to have Arjuna retrieve them.

the principle of fighting. Bhishma Deva therefore promised that the next day he would kill all the five Pandavas with special weapons made for the purpose. Bhishma Deva, when he heard this criticism of Duryodhana, he became angry and he took a vow that he is going to kill all the five Pandavas the next day of the battle. Duryodhana was satisfied and he kept the arrows with him to be delivered the next day during the fight. Bhishma prepared five special arrows and Duryodhana thought that Bhishma has prepared these arrows, but if anything happens from now onwards till the next day morning when the battle starts, anything can happen. So Duryodhana said, "Please give me those five arrows and I'll keep them with me safely and I'll give to you tomorrow morning just before the battle begins." Bhishma said, "Okay." By tricks, Arjuna took the arrows from Duryodhana and Bhishma Deva could understand that that was the trick of Lord Krishna. So he took a vow that the next day Krishna would have to take up weapons himself, otherwise his friend Arjuna would die. What happened? Krishna knew that Bhishma has prepared five special weapons and it is safely kept with Duryodhana, so Krishna sent Arjuna, "Go and ask Duryodhana for those five arrows." So Arjuna went to Duryodhana's camp and Duryodhana welcomed him and said yes, and then Krishna and Bhishma Deva were the first... Duryodhana said Arjuna said, "I want the five arrows which Bhishma has prepared and kept it safe. You have kept it safely with you." Duryodhana said, "Okay, I will give you those arrows." He gave away those arrows. And Bhishma came to know that Duryodhana was supposed to safe keep those weapons. In spite of that, by Krishna's trick, the arrows were taken away by Arjuna. So he said, "Never mind. Even if those arrows are not there, I am going to fight very, very vigorously and Arjuna's life is really in danger the next day, unless Krishna will break his promise and take weapons and fight himself to save his friend."

#### Krishna's promise, Bhishma's devotion, Krishna breaking his promise to save Arjuna
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/idXfNsA7ED0?t=500

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna wanted to please his devotee Bhishma by keeping Bhishma's promise, which is more important than his own promise."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the intense battle where Arjuna is about to be killed, leading Krishna to break his promise and rush towards Bhishma, who welcomes being killed by the Lord.

So the next day's fighting, Bhishma Deva fought so violently that both Arjuna and Krishna were in trouble. It was such a fierce battle. Arjuna was almost defeated. The situation was so tense that he was about to be killed by Bhishma Deva the very next moment. At that very moment when Bhishma was about to kill Arjuna, Krishna wanted to please his devotee Bhishma by keeping Bhishma's promise, which is more important than his own promise. Bhishma's promise was that to save Arjuna, Krishna will have to take his weapon. Otherwise, if Bhishma was to take IS or not, Krishna did not have to take it. Krishna promised to not use his own weapon, but left Bhishma with enemies who are his obligations. When Bhishma left, Krishna saw Krishna was not in the right position in the old age and forced him to give up his 2020 success. He promised before the beginning of Kurukshetra's ancient battle, Chris's duty to Kurukshetra, that one day he would not use his wealth on the intimidated battles, and support anorm the Kurukshetra group. When Krishna was killed, Kurukshetra's aid was punched into hold by Arjuna without depending upon his strategy towards safety. But to protect Arjuna, Bhishma's promise was refused. He confessed to Arjuna's promise to Kurukshetra, for which, I never know why he betrayed him, and hurriedly rushed Bhishma Deva in an angry mood as a lion goes to kill an elephant. When there is a fight between a lion and an elephant, both are very powerful, but they are powerful in their own way. So generally lions don't bother elephants, elephants don't bother lions, because both are very powerful. But sometimes when there is a fight between a lion and an elephant, then both will fight very vigorously and the outcome of this fight is uncertain. Sometimes the elephant is victorious, sometimes the lion is victorious. So in this case, Krishna rushed at Bhishma just like a lion goes to kill an elephant. That's the description here. Now while Krishna was going in that angry mood, charging at Bhishma Deva, he dropped his covering cloth on the way and out of great anger he did not know that he had dropped it. Bhishma Deva at once gave up his weapons and stood to be killed by Krishna, his beloved Lord. For a devotee, if the Lord is going to kill me, that is the greatest blessing, because the devotees know, Lord's killing and Lord's protection both are absolute. There is no difference. So Bhishma did not mind Krishna killing him. He said that is the best way to ensure that I will be completely purified and I will get ultimate salvation and liberation.

**Key Quote:** "So there was no possibility of Arjuna's death because the Lord himself was on the chariot, but because Bhishma Deva wanted to see Krishna take up some weapon to save his friend Arjuna, so the Lord created the situation making Arjuna's death imminent."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the battle ended due to Kshatriya principles and that Krishna orchestrated the situation to fulfill Bhishma's desire to see him take up a weapon.

So the fighting of the day ended at that very moment and Arjuna was saved. Because the Kshatriya principle is, if somebody surrenders, then the battle has to be stopped. It cannot continue. One Kshatriya will not kill another Kshatriya if that other Kshatriya surrenders. He will not kill. That's the military principles by which the battle of Kurukshetra was arranged to be fought. So there was no possibility of Arjuna's death because the Lord himself was on the chariot. But because Bhishma Deva wanted to see Krishna take up some weapon to save his friend Arjuna, so the Lord created the situation making Arjuna's death imminent. Krishna created the situation. It should be for Bhishma Deva to show that his promise was fulfilled. Bhishma's promise was fulfilled and that Krishna had taken up the wheel as Bhishma had predicted. So this is a confidential explanation of the Lord's action on the battlefield.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing Krishna's love for his devotees, the sporting spirit of the battle, and the confidential nature of the explanation, distinguishing it from mere political or personal conflicts.

breaking his own promise and taking up the wheel of a chariot in order to save Arjuna while Arjuna's life was in danger when Bhishma was fighting very violently. So it is explained here by Bhishma that the Lord fulfilled my desire because I am his devotee. He broke his own promise. Bhishma will not care for anything else other than fulfilling his devotee's desire. That is Krishna's love for his devotees, his affection for his devotees. So that is being described here by Srila Prabhupada in great detail, the confidential explanation for this whole incident which ordinarily people will not understand. They will think something is going on between Arjuna, Krishna, Bhishma. Something is going on. No, it is not any kind of political diplomacy or not any kind of enmity. It is actually in a sporting spirit the whole battle was fought. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

The meaning of this verse is, May He, Lord Sri Krishna, the personification, the personality of Godhead who awards salvation, be my ultimate destination. On the battlefield He charged me as if angry because of the wounds dealt by my sharp arrows. His shield was scattered and His body was smeared with blood due to the wounds.

**Key Quote:** "The astounding feature of such dealings between the Lord and his devotees is that a devotee can please the Lord by playing the part of an enemy."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the relationship between Krishna and Bhishma, explaining that their apparent enmity on the battlefield was actually a display of special favor and devotion, highlighting the unique way a devotee can serve the Lord even by acting as an enemy.

So this whole description we should remember that that exchange between Bhishma and Krishna is an exchange between the Lord and His beloved devotee. Krishna's form is completely transcendental. There is no possibility of any injury for Krishna's transcendental body. But apparently it looked like Bhishma's arrows were striking Krishna's body and there were some wounds because of the arrow piercing the body. It is actually a leela of the Lord because Bhishma relates with Krishna in the virya rasa relationship. So therefore this show of apparently Bhishma enduring making wounds on the body of Krishna. So Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport, The dealings of Lord Krishna and Bhishma Deva on the battlefield of Kurukshetra are interesting because the activities of Lord Sri Krishna appeared to be partial to Arjuna and at enmity with Bhishma Deva. But factually all this was especially meant to show special favor to Bhishma Deva, a great devotee of the Lord. You see. For a common man, the battle is going on between Pandavas and Kauravas. They are enemies. Krishna is on the side of the Pandavas and Bhishma is on the side of the Kauravas. So Krishna, Bhishma are enemies for a common man's understanding. But the confidential understanding is Krishna is the Supreme Lord and his beloved devotees Arjuna and Bhishma both are there on the battlefield. So Krishna by his inconceivable potency he is able to show favor special favor to Bhishma and at the same time protecting Arjuna completely because Arjuna is his devotee also. So Srila Prabhupada says the astounding feature of such dealings between the Lord and his devotees is that a devotee can please the Lord by playing the part of an enemy.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna wants that bhakti."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna accepts service from devotees in any form, as long as it's offered with devotion, and uses the example of Mother Yashoda scolding Krishna to illustrate the loving and confidential exchanges between the Lord and his devotees.

See the wonderful description here, that a devotee is serving the Lord by becoming the Lord's enemy. The Lord being absolute can accept service from his pure devotee even in the garb of an enemy. Devotee whatever role he plays. Krishna can accept the service because it is with devotion. A devotee serves Krishna always with devotion. Krishna wants that bhakti, whether somebody serves Krishna as an enemy or as a friend in any capacity. The Supreme Lord cannot have any enemy, nor can a so-called enemy harm Krishna. Why? Because Krishna is Ajita or unconquerable. He is infinitely powerful and everyone else is, if at all they have any power, that is given by Krishna and it is very, very, very insignificant power that Jeevas have. So how can Krishna's life be in danger? Krishna is immortal. Krishna is unconquerable. Krishna is infinite power. So this should always be remembered. Don't make the mistake of making material calculations and thinking that Krishna's life was in danger. No. But still Krishna's pastimes are such that he takes pleasure when his pure devotee beats him like an enemy or rebukes him from a superior position, although no one can be superior to the Lord. In Krishna's dealings with his devotees when Krishna assumes the inferior position Krishna doesn't become inferior. He remains the Supreme Lord. Just like Mother Yashoda sometimes scolds Krishna. So Krishna as a small child begins to cry apparently being very much affected by Yashoda's scolding. But actually has Krishna's position changed? He appears to be an inferior, an inferior position as a small child, a helpless child, but actually he is the Supreme Lord and Yashoda is always the devotee who out of love wants to serve Krishna as a mother. It is a loving exchange between Krishna and his devotee. So this is not easily understood by everyone. Only a devotee can understand this confidential dealings of the Lord with his devotees

**Summary:** The speaker describes Srimad Bhagavatam as the exclusive literature on pure devotional service, focusing on the transcendental interactions between the Lord and his pure devotees, which are free from material contamination and difficult for non-devotees to understand.

on the platform of pure love. Mind you these exchanges are simply happening out of the Lord's love for his devotee and the devotee's love for the Lord. These are some of the transcendental reciprocatory dealings of the devotee with the Lord. Bhagavatam is the particular exclusive literature which is telling us about pure devotional service. That's why it's called Amala Purana. The entire subject matter of the Bhagavatam is only this pure devotional service and nothing else. There is nothing about karma, jnana, ashtanga yoga, no. It's only pure devotional service because throughout the Bhagavatam the description is of the Supreme Lord and his interactions with his pure devotees. He has innumerable devotees and particularly Bhagavatam describes the transcendental activities which are completely free from any material contamination. Those who have no information of pure devotional service cannot penetrate into the mystery of such dealings.

**Summary:** The speaker stresses the importance of learning Bhagavatam from pure devotees like Prabhupada to understand the nature of pure devotional service, emphasizing that Krishna's supremacy is eternally true, and non-devotees are often bewildered by his actions and forms.

So you have to hear this Bhagavatam from the pure devotees. Bhagavatam has to be learned from a Bhagavata. Those who know the mystery of such dealings only they can explain properly, like Prabhupada is explaining for us. The elaborate purports Prabhupada has written is to help us understand what is the nature of pure devotional service. Bhishma Deva played the part of a valiant warrior and he purposely pierced the body of the Lord so that to the common eyes it appeared that the Lord was wounded. I have already explained this point, but factually all this was to bewilder the non-devotees. Non-devotees always think that the devotees are sentimental people who think that Krishna is some supreme God. No, it is not the devotee's sentimental feeling because of which Krishna is considered as the supreme. No, Krishna's supremacy is eternally true under all circumstances. He remains the supreme Lord always in the material world, in the spiritual world, before the creation, during the maintenance, during destruction, after the destruction. He is always the supreme Lord. That's his unique position, eternally true. So what happens to Krishna's position? Nothing happens to his position, but as part of his pastimes he assumes different forms, he has different interactions, different types of reciprocation with his beloved pure devotees. Only with his pure devotees

But some actions of Krishna prove even to the non-devotees that Krishna is not an ordinary person. Indra, he sent torrential rain, devastating rainfall. That's the correct explanation, description, devastating rain in Vrindavan and Krishna simply lifted the Govardhan hill and held it up like an umbrella to protect the inhabitants against devastating rainfall. So then Indra came to his senses. Who is this small boy? He is my lord. He is my master. He is a supreme personality of Godhead. I am foolishly thinking he is an ordinary boy. So, every time a non-devotee or even sometimes the devatas they mistake Krishna to be an ordinary person or a person of this world, Krishna proves to them by his actions that he is the ultimate controller, supremely powerful personality of Godhead. The all-spiritual body of the Supreme Lord cannot be wounded. This we should always remember. Never forget this and a devotee cannot become the enemy of the Lord. Bhishma Deva cannot become the enemy. Had it been so, Bhishma Deva would not have desired to have the very same Lord as the ultimate destination of his life. What is the prayer here? Sabhavatume Bhagavan Gathir Mukundaha. That very Lord who on the battlefield was on the opposite side, enemy's side, may that Lord, Bhagavan Mukundaha be my ultimate destination. Had Bhishma Deva been so, had Bhishma Deva been an enemy of the Lord, Lord Krishna could have annihilated him even without moving. Does Krishna require to take one wheel of a chariot, break his promise, get down from the chariot and attack Bhishma? Is it necessary for Krishna, the Supreme Lord to do that? No. So there was no need to come before Bhishma Deva with blood and wounds, but he did so because the warrior devotee wanted to see the transcendental beauty of the Lord decorated with wounds created by a pure devotee. Krishna is beautiful regardless of the form he assumes. Now this is the form he has assumed for the sake of his devotee and this form is also very, very beautiful

**Key Quote:** "At the moment of death, let my ultimate attraction be to Shri Krishna, the personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (1.9.39) focusing on Bhishma Deva's prayer to be attracted to Krishna at the time of death and how seeing Krishna on the battlefield granted liberation.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudhirayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 39th verse of the 9th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, continuing the prayers by Bhishma Deva. Vijaya Ratha Kutumba Aatta Totre Dhritahaya Rashminita Sriyekshaniye Bhagavati Rati Rastume Mumurshor Yamiha Nirikshahata Gataswaroopam. The meaning of this verse is, at the moment of death, let my ultimate attraction be to Shri Krishna, the personality of Godhead. I concentrate my mind upon the chariot driver of Arjuna, who stood with a whip in his right hand and a bridle rope in his left, who was very careful to give protection to Arjuna's chariot by all means. Those who saw him on the battlefield of Kurukshetra attained their original forms after death.

**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the concept of Swaroopa (original form), our eternal relationship with Krishna, and how attaining this relationship is the ultimate goal of life.

Just try to picturize, Krishna is having a whip in his right hand, he is having the reins of the horses in his left hand, he is driving the chariot of Arjuna, and whoever saw Krishna on the battlefield, they attained their original forms after death. So, this is the perfection of life to attain one's Swaroopa, the original form. Each one of us, we belong to the spiritual world. In the spiritual world, we have a specific eternal relationship with Krishna, and our goal of life should be to attain that eternal relationship.

**Key Quote:** "Even for a moment, a pure devotee does not forget the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the difference between a pure devotee and a conditioned soul, highlighting the constant Krishna consciousness of a devotee and comparing the process of Bhakti Yoga to Ashtanga Yoga in attaining Samadhi.

After quitting this body, by preparing through practice of Bhakti Yoga. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, "A pure devotee of the Lord constantly sees the presence of the Lord within himself, because of being transcendentally related by loving service." Such a pure devotee cannot forget the Lord for a moment. Even for a moment, a pure devotee does not forget the Lord. And the conditioned souls have almost completely forgotten the Supreme Lord, even though they also have a relationship, eternal relationship. So, a pure devotee always being Krishna conscious is called trance, Samadhi. The mystic yogi tries to concentrate upon the super soul by controlling the senses from all other engagements, and thus he ultimately attains Samadhi. The Ashtanga Yoga process is a difficult process, very, very difficult process. But with great austerity, Ashtanga Yogis try to control their senses, their mind, withdraw the mind from all sense objects, focus it upon the form of the Lord in the heart, and fix it on this super soul, and become absorbed in meditation on this form of the super soul in the heart. And in that way, gradually, they attain Samadhi. A devotee more easily attains Samadhi or trance, by constantly remembering the Lord's personal feature along with His holy name, fame, pastimes etc.

**Key Quote:** "The concentration of the mystic yogi is mechanical whereas that of the pure devotee is natural in pure love and spontaneous affection."
**Summary:** The lecture describes the transcendental nature of Krishna's pastimes and the loving exchange between the Lord and his devotees, contrasting the mechanical concentration of a mystic yogi with the spontaneous affection of a pure devotee.

What is Vishwadevar doing now? Krishna is present in front of him, he just fixed his attention on Krishna, and he is reminding himself of all the past events, which are all completely transcendental, because they are in relationship with Krishna, transcendental personality of God. Simply by remembering them, which are very, very dear to the heart of the devotee, with great relish the devotee recollects all the incidents connected with and the interactions with Krishna with great, because every interaction is a loving exchange between the Lord and his devotee, that's the nature of the interaction. Therefore, Srila Prabhupada says the concentration of the mystic yogi and that of the devotee are not on the same level. The concentration of the mystic yogi is mechanical, whereas that of the pure devotee is natural in pure love and spontaneous affection. The devotee doesn't have to exert himself, oh, I have to remember Krishna, no.

**Key Quote:** "Our heart actually is full of love for Krishna in the pure state of our consciousness."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how material contamination clouds our innate love for Krishna, and explains the eternal nature of Krishna's pastimes, using the analogy of the sun rising in different parts of the world.

No, it is natural because it's spontaneous affection. Our heart actually is full of love for Krishna in the pure state of our consciousness. Right now, because of the material contamination and all the material desires we have developed in association with the gunas, our heart has become clouded, contaminated. Otherwise, if we purify the heart by the proper method, then the pure consciousness naturally awakens our devotion, our love for Krishna, and that is what is described by Srila Prabhupada here. Bhishma Deva was a pure devotee, and as a military marshal, he constantly remembered the battlefield feature of the Lord as Parthasarathy, the chariot driver of Arjuna, because Bhishma was related that way. He remembers that particular feature of Krishna as the chariot driver of Arjuna, Parthasarathy. Therefore, the Lord's pastime in Parthasarathy is also eternal. It is not a temporary display because Krishna agreed to be Arjuna's chariot driver for the sake of this battle that is described here 5000 years back, which took place now. It is an eternal feature. As Partha Sarathi, the past times of the Lord are going on. How do we understand? After it is over in this universe, in another universe the same past time continues. Then after it is over in that universe, then another universe. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu explains this eternal past times in the material world

**Summary:** The lecture continues to elaborate on the eternal nature of Krishna's pastimes, explaining how they occur continuously across different universes, and mentions the eternal associates of the Lord.

as just like the sun is continuously rising in different parts of the world as the time is progressing. Let us say now it is evening 7.40. Okay. In Bangalore or India 7.40 p.m. But in some other part of the world it is 6.40 p.m. Another part of the world it is 8.40 p.m. So, the sun appears to be moving but actually it is all relative motion. And the sun is continuously rising or setting in different parts of the world as time progresses. So similarly, Krishna is continuously performing his pastimes in one universe after another universe after another universe after that, another universe, like that. The pastimes of the Lord beginning from his birth at the prison house of Kamsa up to the Leela at the end. This is described in the eleventh canto, the pastime of the Lord, ending his pastimes in this material world and going back to his spiritual above. All these pastimes all move one after another in all the universes, just as the clock hand moves from one point to another.

#### Bhishma's Vision, Parthasarathi, Lord's Forms, Devotee Relationship

**Key Quote:** "Bhishma Deva never forgot the beautiful feature of the Lord as Partha Sarathi, which even Arjuna could not see."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights Bhishma Deva's unique vision of Krishna as Parthasarathi and emphasizes that the Lord displays different forms according to the relationship he has with each devotee.

And in such pastimes his associates like the Pandavas and Bhishma are constant eternal companions. Not all the persons on the battlefield of Kurukshetra are eternal companions, only some select a few devotees are eternal companions, just like the Pandavas and Bhishma as mentioned here. So Bhishma Deva never forgot the beautiful feature of the Lord as Partha Sarathi, which even Arjuna could not see. Arjuna was being the Lord. So Arjuna could not see that form as Partha Sarathi, which Bhishma saw. Arjuna was behind the beautiful Partha Sarathi while Bhishma Deva was just in front of the Lord. As far as the military feature of the Lord is concerned, Bhishma Deva observed this with more relish than Arjuna. So this is an important point to note. For the sake of Bhishma, Krishna is displaying the particular form which Bhishma relates with. The Lord has so many forms, unlimited number of forms, because he has unlimited devotees, and each devotee relates with the Lord in a particular form, and that form the Lord displays for that particular devotee.

**Key Quote:** "Everyone attained their original spiritual form after death, because Krishna was present on the battlefield when they were dying."
**Summary:** The lecture explains that those who died on the battlefield of Kurukshetra attained their original spiritual form due to Krishna's presence, and emphasizes the importance of one's consciousness at the time of death.

Now Srila Prabhupada explains the point that, everyone attained their original spiritual form after death, because Krishna was present on the battlefield when they were dying. So Srila Prabhupada says, all the soldiers and persons on the battlefield of Kurukshetra attained their original spiritual form, like the Lord, after their death. Because by the causeless mercy of the Lord, they were able to see him face to face on that occasion, at the time of death. yamyam vapi smaranbhavam tyajati ante kalevaram. At the time of quitting the body, at the time of death, last moment of life in this body, whatever the state of consciousness, that same state one will attain without fail in the life after death. The soul is eternal. But what life will the soul attain after quitting this body? That depends on the consciousness in time of death. So, whoever saw the Lord at the time of his death face to face, because the Lord is completely transcendental, spiritual, they all attained their original eternal spiritual form.

**Key Quote:** "Till one breaks this cycle of repetition of birth and death by engaging in devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the cycle of birth and death, the foreign nature of material forms, and how devotional service is the key to liberation and attaining one's original spiritual form.

The conditioned souls rotating in the evolutionary cycle from the aquatics up to the form of Brahma, are all in the form of Prasannis, the form of Maya, all our forms of material body in any species, aquatics up to Brahma, are the form obtained by one's own actions and awarded by material nature. Simply we are rotating in different forms, that's all. In this life, if I don't take to Krishna consciousness, then I'll perform some pious activities or some sinful activities or a combination, and then according to the desires I accumulate, I will get another body, and in that body again there will be some activities, material activities that will lead to another body. So this goes on and on and on till one breaks this cycle of repetition of birth and death by engaging in devotional service and preparing oneself to quit the body in Krishna consciousness. So Srila Prabhupada explains the material forms of the conditioned souls are all foreign dresses. This material body is a covering which is not natural for us, it is an artificial imposition, and when the conditioned soul becomes liberated from the clutches of material energy, he attains his original form, original spiritual form. The impersonalist wants to attain the impersonal brahman effulgence of the Lord, but that is not at all congenial to the living sparks, part and parcels of the Lord. The Mayavadis is the impersonal, they want to merge into the brahman effulgence. The devotees, they want to be situated in their original spiritual form in the relationship with Lord Krishna

**Key Quote:** "The devotees when they take to Krishna consciousness and perfect their devotional service they never come back to the material world after going to the spiritual."
**Summary:** The lecture contrasts the paths of impersonalists and devotees, highlighting the instability of merging into the Brahman effulgence versus the eternal shelter found at Krishna's lotus feet in the spiritual world, emphasizing the devotees never return to the material world.

in a loving devotional relationship always engaged in devotional service, that's the position of the devotee. So the impersonalists, even if, first of all it is very great difficult, with great difficulty they may merge into the brahman effulgence, but they fall down because they don't have shelter of Krishna's lotus feet in the spiritual world. The devotees, when they take to Krishna consciousness and perfect their devotional service, they never come back to the material world after going to the spiritual. The impersonalists, even if they elevate themselves to the brahma jyoti, they fall down because there is no shelter.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Krishna's relationships with the Pandavas, highlighting his role as a younger cousin and intimate friend, while emphasizing that they all recognized him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

before him. We have to note that Krishna is referred to as Chakri. Chakri means one who carries the chakra, that is Krishna, another name for Krishna, shankhi Chakri, like that there are names for Krishna. So here Krishna is referred to as Chakri and Sreelah Prabhupada explains, Lord Krishna was also a younger cousin of Maharaja Yudhishthira as well as the intimate friend, Lord Krishna and a better beloved Rama Yudhishthir as well as the intimate friend Devasini as well of arjuna. Krishna was related to the pandavas as a younger cousin because by age krishna was younger than yudhishtira maharaj and yudhishtira maharaj's mother kunti and krishna's father vasudeva were sister and brother, kunti and vasudeva. So therefore krishna was the younger cousin of yudhishtira maharaj. Krishna was also related to arjuna in the same way as a cousin but more importantly krishna and arjuna were intimate friends, intimate friends. So in addition to being a cousin arjuna was also intimate friend of krishna but all the family members of the pandavas knew lord krishna as the supreme personality of godhead, all the five brothers dhishtira bhima nakula sahadeva arjuna everyone knew krishna supreme personality of godhead and even draupadi kunti everyone knew krishna is the supreme personality of godhead the lord although conscious of supreme position always behaved in a humanly custom and so he also bowed down before the dying bhishma deva as if he, that means krishna, were one of the younger brothers of king yudhishtira.

**Key Quote:** "the lord although conscious of supreme position always behaved in a humanly custom and so he also bowed down before the dying bhishma deva as if he that means krishna were one of the younger brothers of king yudhishtira"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses why Krishna, despite being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, bowed down before Bhishma, explaining that Krishna behaves in a humanly way to set an example.

Now this is very significant that when the pandavas have come to see bhishma, bhishma is elderly uh person compared to the pandavas, so pandavas grandfather pandu's father father's brother. So in that way the pandavas are perfectly right or correct in bowing down to bhishma deva, grandsons they are offering their respects to the elderly grandfather well-wisher and affectionate grandfather. But why is krishna bowing down before bhishma when krishna is the supreme personality of godhead? Now we have to carefully understand srila prabhupada explains even though krishna is always conscious he is the supreme personality of godhead is eternally so but still he behaves in a humanly way when he comes to this material world for the sake of his pastimes. So krishna behaves in a particular way in a particular situation which we have to understand from the scriptures as explained by the acharyas.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna when he was in Dwaraka whenever he would come back from his assembly house Sudharma after finishing his duties as the king of Dwaraka then he would actually enter his palaces by expanding himself into sixteen thousand one hundred and eight forms"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's actions are meant to teach ideal behavior, giving the example of how Krishna interacted with his queens in Dwaraka, teaching how an ideal husband should behave.

So krishna's personality is not like the personality of a any other human being. Krishna's personality is a lot different than that of any other personality. So the difference can be understood only if we hear our own personality. And let we not get distracted by what is the difference between Ahmad and the lord, we first understand about krishna from the vaishva acharyas as they explain based on the authentic shastras, vaishnava scriptures. So i can give an example, the bhagavatam says of two kinds one action one set of actions Krishna performs in his incarnation as Krishna are those which he wants to teach the common people ideal behavior of a human being. So Krishna when he was in Dwaraka whenever he would come back from his assembly house Sudharma after finishing his duties as the king of Dwaraka then he would actually enter his palaces by expanding himself into sixteen thousand one hundred and eight forms because he had married 16,000 108 Queens princesses and they became Queens because Krishna was the king and he would interact with his Queens exactly like a ideal husband should interact with his wife. Now Krishna knows his position Krishna is also aware that all the queens are are his devotees. The devotees, the queens know Krishna is the Supreme Lord but in his interaction he taught by his own example how a ideal husband should actually take care of his wife.

**Summary:** The speaker continues to illustrate Krishna's role as an Acharya, teaching by example, such as respecting his mothers and giving charity, even though he has no obligation to anyone.

Now Krishna in the morning when he wakes up, he wakes up very early even though he is lying comfortably with his wife, the queen but he wakes up and he performs his duties as a householder. Now these duties are described in the Srimad Bhagavatam 10th cantum, these duties are performed by Krishna to teach how an ideal householder to perform householder's duties. He would go and pay respect to his mothers. Of course, his mother is Devaki. But Vasudeva, his father had 16 queens. So, the other queens of Vasudeva were stepmothers of Krishna. Nonetheless, Krishna would respect all the stepmothers on an equal level with Devaki, his own mother. So, this is ideal behavior of Krishna. They all know Krishna is the Supreme Personality of God. But they also know Krishna is behaving in this way to teach by his own example how an ideal householder should carry out the duties of a householder. Grahasta Ashrama Krishna is teaching by his own example. He would give cows in charity to the brahmanas. Now, the brahmanas know Krishna is the Supreme Personality of God. Krishna has no obligation to anybody. He is in fact the maintainer of everyone. So, what obligation can he have for any brahmana or for any other living being? He is the maintainer of all the living beings. Eko bahunam yo vidhati kama. Krishna is teaching by his own example, but he must teach by his own example. Acharya.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Krishna's actions meant for teaching with those that reveal his supreme power, using the example of Krishna killing demons in Vrindavan and the cowherd boys' reaction, influenced by Yogamaya.

Acharya means one who teaches by his own behavior, by his own actions. So, Krishna's one set of activities are meant for teaching the common man about the proper behavior. Now, Krishna performs another set of actions. Hope this is helpful. Did you take a hint from this? I really liked it. Because this is what I wanted to show you. You may have some doubts about this. But all you need to know is, even when you are unique to his position as the supreme personality you've got it which is the position as a supreme lord is eternally true even though he appears like a human being he is the supreme lord his powers are always with him they are never lost they are never ineffective so for example when he's playing with the covered boys in vrindavan he is like another covered boy but when a demon comes to attack krishna krishna effortlessly playfully he simply kills the demon and the covered boys they are very happy that this some demon came to disturb us and krishna just killed the demon very easily so they are all very happy they embrace krishna well done well done excellent excellent and they continue their play they never pause to think krishna is another covered boy like us how could he have killed that demon we cannot kill how can krishna kill they never think

that is the action of yogamaya by yogamaya's influence everyone participating in krishnalila all the devotees that is all the devotees other than krishna everyone else is devoted krishna so the devotees except balaram of course balaram is not um in the position of a devotee he acts like a devotee but he is not like the other devotees belonging to a different tatva he is actually an expansion of krishna but still for the sake of krishna's pastimes he also behaves like one of the other covered boys he also behaves as a devotee of krishna as another covered boy so um all the covered boys being influenced by yogamaya they forget krishna is the supreme personality of god though they know that the fact is known but for the sake of krishna's pastime they forget that they don't consider that they think krishna is one among them and if you have a friend who is your equal and the friend does something very nice then you appreciate the friend embrace her and that is the reason why all the devotees who worship him are very happy you congratulate him like that the coward boys exactly behave that way with krishna and krishna kills a demon but we understand that demon was no ordinary demon he was sent by kamsa he had so many mystic powers he was a terror for everyone else but krishna effortlessly killed him because krishna is supremely powerful

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Brahma stealing the calves and cowherd boys, and Krishna expanding himself to replace them, bewildering Brahma, to illustrate Krishna's supreme power and to reiterate that Krishna bowing to Bhishma teaches respect.

we understand such activities of Krishna as those of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When Brahma stole the calves and the cowherd boys, Krishna actually expanded himself as a calves and cowherd boys. Now Brahma came back after hiding those calves and cowherd boys who were stolen by Brahma using Brahma's mystic power. He was hiding them somewhere and when Brahma came back after one moment of his time, already one year had passed on the earth and Krishna had expanded himself so nobody knew that the cowherd boys and the calves, original cowherd boys and calves were kidnapped by Brahma and they were hidden by Brahma in some place away from the earth planet and they were all sleeping under the mystic power of Brahma. A spell cast by Brahma by Brahma's mystic power but nobody knows in Vrindavan. How is that? Krishna has expanded exactly resembling each of the cowherd boys and each of the calves and Brahma came and saw there is a second set of the same cowherd boys and calves playing with Krishna. So Brahma was bewildered. He knows he has hidden there, cows and cowherd boys, he has stolen in his particular place and he knows by his mystic power they are all sleeping under the spell of his mystic power. But Brahma also seeing a second set and who are these second set of cowherd boys and calves. Brahma is wondering. So like this, Krishna's second set of activities are those to help and meant for helping us understand Krishna is the Supreme Personality of God so we have to understand when Krishna bows down to Bhishma Deva it is teaching us how a younger one should show respect

#### bhakti, Gopis' devotion, pure devotion, conjugal love

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "They simply want to please Krishna. That's all."
**Summary:** This segment explains Bhishma Deva's prayer to Krishna, focusing on the Gopis' unparalleled pure devotion characterized by selfless love and a desire only to please Krishna, contrasting it with other forms of worship motivated by personal gain or knowledge.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Jai Vanarottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudhirayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 40th verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Lalitha Gati Vilasa Valguhasa Pranaya Niriksana Kalpitoru Manaha Krita Manu Krita Vatya Unma Dandhaha Prakritim Agan Kilayasya Gopa Vadhvaha. The meaning of this verse is, let my mind be fixed upon Lord Sri Krishna, whose motions and smiles of love attracted the damsels of Raja Dharma, the Gopis. The damsels imitated the characteristic movements of the Lord after his disappearance from the Rasa dance. This is yet another precept. This is the same prayer offered by Bhishma Deva to Lord Krishna. Bhishma is fixing his mind upon Lord Sri Krishna and remembering the different pastimes of Krishna. Smaranam, remembering the pastimes of Krishna, remembering the form of Krishna, remembering the name of Krishna, remembering the qualities of Krishna. This is bhakti. This is the practice of bhakti. Here, specifically, Bhishma Deva is remembering Krishna's pastimes with his topmost devotees, the Gopis of Vrindavan. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains what is the characteristic of the Gopis' devotion to Krishna. It is explained by Srila Prabhupada in the purport, By intense ecstasy in loving service, the damsels of Vraja Bhumi, that is the Gopis, attained qualitative oneness with the Lord by dancing with him on an equal level, by embracing him in nuptial love, by smiling at him, by looking at him in joke, and by looking at him with a loving attitude. The Gopis are in a relationship with Krishna in conjugal love. Conjugal love means love between opposite genders. Actually, Krishna is the only male, and everyone else is female. Krishna is the only Purusha, everyone else is Prakriti. So, this love between Krishna and the devotees is natural, is our constitutional position. So, among the devotees of Krishna, the topmost devotees are the Gopis. Now, Srila Prabhupada says, the relation of the Lord with Arjuna is undoubtedly praiseworthy for devotees like Bhishma Deva, because Arjuna's friendship with the Lord was very, very intimate friendship. It was transcendental relationship, not material friendship. But, the relation of the Gopis with the Lord is still more praiseworthy because of their still more purified loving service. Now, how is Gopis' devotional service more purified? To understand that, Srila Prabhupada explains, that according to Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, ramyakachit upasana vrajavadhu vargena yakalpita. The meaning of this is, this is what Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says about the Gopis' devotional service rendered to Lord Krishna. There is no better method of worship than the system invented by the Gopis. Worship of Krishna. The best method of worship is that which was performed by the Gopis of Vrindavan. So, the Gopis' invention of worshipping Krishna was to remain always Krishna conscious without any material profit. That is the super excellence of the Gopis. Super excellent devotional service. They never expected any return from Krishna. That was not their business. Their attitude was not like, Krishna, we have done so much for you. Can you give us some benediction, Krishna? No. They never expected any benediction from Krishna. Though Krishna is the Supreme Lord, who is the only giver of all kinds of benedictions, but the Gopis, they never expected any benediction from Krishna. Gopis' attitude was that you take whatever you like from us, but we do not ask anything in exchange, in return. Nothing. We want nothing. They simply want to please Krishna. That's all. They only want to see Krishna happy. That's all. We have got everything to give you, and we have no need to ask you anything at all.

#### types of devotees, pure vs. mixed devotion, Gopis' supreme devotion

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Whereas, the pure devotees do not want anything in return for their worship or in return for their service to Krishna."
**Summary:** This segment differentiates between devotees who approach Krishna with ulterior motives (Artha, Artharthi, Jignasu, Jnani) and pure devotees like the Gopis, who seek nothing in return for their selfless service, highlighting the Gopis' supreme position in devotional service.

This is the Gopis' worship. Generally, people worship the Supreme Lord either because they are Artha, Artha means they are in distress, or they are in need, or they are Artharthi, or they are desiring some wealth, some money. So, they want some relief from some suffering, or they want some money. Two classes of people, Artha and Artharthi. And another two classes of people who also worship God, Jignasu and Jnani. Jignasu means they are inquisitive to know who is this God, or who is God. Curiosity. And Jnani are the ones who are after pure knowledge of God. In any case, all these four categories of persons who approach Krishna, they are classified as devotees, but they want something in exchange for their worship, for their devotion. They want something. Whereas, the pure devotees do not want anything in return for their worship or in return for their service to Krishna. Because they are approaching Krishna, even such devotees who want something in exchange are classified as devotees. And they do get some spiritual benefit because of approaching Krishna. But they are not pure devotees. Whenever the service is rendered, devotional service is rendered with some motive, expectation of something in return, then the service is not considered pure devotional service. It is mixed devotional service. So, the gopis' activities in devotional service are on the supreme platform of pure devotion. This is the position of gopis. Therefore, Prabhupāda says, the loving service of the gopis is the topmost, is most praiseworthy. And, the gopis, by their service, they practically became one with the Lord of attaining equal footing with the Lord.

#### Gopis' mercy, equality with the Lord, unconditional love, selfish vs. selfless interest

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Lord, Supreme Lord Krishna, is always more satisfied when his pure devotees are glorified."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Bhishma's aspiration for the Gopis' mercy, their equality with the Lord through perfect ecstasy, and the nature of unconditional love between Krishna and the Gopis, contrasting it with the selfish desire of Mayavadis to merge into God's existence.

Now, Bhīṣma's aspiration to remember the gopis at the last stage of his life is to have their mercy also. Devotees generally want mercy of Krishna and his pure devotees. Bhīṣma is teaching us. The Lord, Supreme Lord Krishna, is always more satisfied when his pure devotees are glorified. And, therefore, Bhīṣma Deva not only glorified the activities of Arjuna, but he also glorified the activities of the gopis, the topmost devotees of Krishna. Now, the gopis, their equality, which is being described here, is one of perfect ecstasy, in which the differential conception is completely eradicated. Why? Because, in the gopis' service to Kṛṣṇa, the centrist interest of the lover and beloved all respects that is Krishna has nothing to expect from his devotees and the devotees have nothing to expect from Krishna so in this way both are unconditionally loving each other and that is the way their interest becomes one now the Maya bodies they also want to merge into the existence of God they also want to become one but that oneness is an attempt to extinguish their own individuality in a sense they want to become God so it is actually a selfish interest the Maya bodies interest is a selfish interest because they want to become God in a sense whereas the devotees they want to retain their individuality which is always eternally existing and they want to serve God by determining whether or not they should do that so they want to look at their individuality in a idea of that which is a personal project dreams and their lives and their health their their demands or their desires Krishna maintains his devotees Krishna maintains everyone it's not just his devotees he maintains he maintains everyone but particularly his devotees who are completely dependent on him he never lets down his devotees he never lets down anybody but he never lets down his devotees certainly even if the devotees don't have any demands so such devotees are being glorified by Bhishma Deva I'll stop here thank you very much.

#### Rajasuya Yajna, Yudhishthira, Krishna's glorification

**Key Quote:** "Yudhishthira wanted to glorify Krishna, therefore he performed this Rajasuya Yajna."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of Bhishma Deva's prayer, focusing on Yudhishthira's Rajasuya Yajna and his intention to glorify Krishna.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 41st verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Munigana Nripavarya Sankhulentaha Sadasi Yudhishthira Rajasuya Esham Arhanam Upapedha Ikshaniyo Mamadrishi Gochara Esha Aaviratma. The meaning of this verse is: At the Rajasuya Yajna performed by Maharaj Yudhishthira, there was the greatest assembly of all the elite men of the world, the royal and learned orders. And in that great assembly, Lord Sri Krishna was worshipped by one and all as the most exalted personality of Godhead. This happened during my presence, and I remembered the incident in order to keep my mind upon the Lord. This is yet another prayer by Bhishma Deva to Lord Krishna. Bhishma is remembering Krishna's different pastimes. So one of the pastimes was the performance of Rajasuya Yajna by Yudhishthira. Generally, the Rajasuya Yajna is performed by a king who is on the level of being the emperor of the world, and he wants to establish his supremacy by performing this Rajasuya Yajna. But Yudhishthira's aim was different because Yudhishthira is a pure devotee of Krishna. Yudhishthira wanted to glorify Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Yudhishthira also dispatched such challenging horses all over the world, and every ruling prince and king all over the world accepted Maharaj Yudhishthira's leadership as the emperor of the world."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the historical context of the Rajasuya Yajna, including the tradition of the challenge horse and Yudhishthira's acceptance as emperor.

Therefore, he performed this Rajasuya Yajna. So it is explained by Sri Lakshmi that after gaining victory in the battle of Kurukshetra, Maharaj Yudhishthira, the emperor of the world, performed a Rajasuya sacrificial ceremony. The emperor in those days, upon his ascendance to the throne, would send a challenge horse all over the world to declare his supremacy, and any ruling prince or king was at liberty to accept the challenge and express his tacit willingness either to obey or to disobey the supremacy of the particular king of the world. The world was ruled in different provinces by different kings, but one king was the emperor of the whole world. Generally, the king whose capital was Hastinapura, at least 5000 years back, that was the system. So one who accepted the challenge of the emperor, whichever king, king of a smaller province, he had to fight with the emperor and establish his own supremacy by victory. The defeated challenger would have to sacrifice his life, making a place for another king or ruler. This was the system. So Maharaj Yudhishthira also dispatched such challenging horses all over the world, and every ruling prince and king all over the world accepted Maharaj Yudhishthira's leadership as the emperor of the world.

**Key Quote:** "Such performances required hundreds of millions of dollars and it was not an easy job for a petty king... Under the present circumstances is now impossible in this age of Kali."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the scale and expense of the Rajasuya Yajna, noting its impracticality in the current age of Kali due to the lack of resources and qualified priests.

In terms of the dynasty, Kuru dynasty, Yudhishthira was the descendant of the emperors of the past. So the ruling kings and the princes, they all knew Yudhishthira to be a very, very powerful emperor, so they accepted his leadership. After this, all the rulers of the world under the regime of Maharaj Yudhishthira were invited to participate in the great sacrificial ceremony of Rajasuya. Such performances required hundreds of millions of dollars, and it was not an easy job for a petty king. Such a sacrificial ceremony, being too expensive and also difficult to perform under the present circumstances, is now impossible in this age of Kali. This is something that happened in Dwapar Yuga. Nor can anyone secure the required expert priesthood to take charge of the ceremony. It's not just a question of money alone; even qualified brahmanas are unavailable for performing such sacrifices.

**Key Quote:** "The qualified brahmana has to chant the mantra with purity, then only the mantra will have the potency to give the benefit to the performer of the sacrifice."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of qualified brahmanas and the potency of mantras, describing the assembly of kings and sages at Yudhishthira's capital, and highlighting Krishna's central role.

Because the qualified brahmana has to chant the mantra with purity, then only the mantra will have the potency to give the benefit to the performer of the sacrifice. After being invited, all the kings and great learned sages of the world assembled in the capital of Maharaj Yudhishthira in Hastinapura. The learned society included the great philosophers, religionists, physicians, scientists, and all great sages were invited. That is to say, the brahmanas and the Kshatriyas were the topmost leading men in society, and they were all invited to participate in the assembly. This was the Vedic system. The Vaishyas and Shudras were unimportant elements in society, and they are not mentioned here. Due to change of social activities in the modern age, the importance of the society, the importance of men, has also changed in terms of occupational positions. Today, practically the whole world is run by the Vaishyas. There are no qualified brahmanas or Kshatriyas to occupy the positions of power or to guide those in positions of power. So the times have changed, and Prabhupada explains that during that time, Yudhishthira Maharaj invited all the kings and the learned sages and the great brahmanas for this Rajasuya Yajna. In that great assembly, Lord Sri Krishna was the cynosure of all the people. Everyone wanted to see Lord Krishna, and everyone wanted to pay his humble respects to the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "Everyone's eyes was glued on the beautiful, exceptionally beautiful form of Krishna... This personality is the most beautiful creation of Brahma."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Krishna's unparalleled beauty and how everyone in the assembly was captivated by Him, clarifying that Krishna's beauty is transcendental and not a creation of Brahma.

Now, elsewhere it is described that when Krishna was elected the president of the assembly in that Rajasuya sacrifice, where all great personalities had assembled, everyone wanted to see Lord Krishna. Everyone's eyes were glued on the beautiful, exceptionally beautiful form of Krishna. They all began to wonder, probably this beauty is not to be found anywhere in the whole universe, so very beautiful. They thought this personality is the most beautiful in the whole universe. This personality is the most beautiful creation of Brahma, that's what they thought. Actually, beauty in the material world is relative, that's a fact. But Krishna is not a created person. He is not a creation of Brahma. Krishna is the only exception in that assembly who is not a creation of Brahma. Krishna's beauty is his original transcendental beauty, his transcendental Supreme beauty. So it is not at all surprising for devotees that Krishna was the center of attraction in that entire assembly.

#### Bhishma Deva, Meditation, Krishna's Pastimes, Impersonal Feature

**Key Quote:** "To meditate on the Supreme Lord means to meditate on the activities, the form, the pastimes, the name and fame of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Bhishma Deva remembered Krishna's pastimes and emphasizes the ease of meditating on Krishna's form and activities compared to the difficulty of meditating on the impersonal feature of the Supreme.

Now, Bhishma Deva was also present in that assembly, and he remembered all this and was glad that his worshipful Lord, the personality of Godhead, was present before him in his actual formal presence. Krishna, the Supreme Lord, Bhishma knew the Supreme Lord. He was actually present in front of Bhishma, and Bhishma remembered this incident. So to meditate on the Supreme Lord means to meditate on the activities, the form, the pastimes, the name and fame of the Supreme Lord. Now, this type of meditation is what is performed by the devotees of Krishna. Now, this type of meditation in Bhakti is easier than the imaginary meditation on the impersonal feature of the Supreme. This is stated in the Bhagavad Gita, that to meditate upon the impersonal feature of the Supreme is very, very, very difficult.

**Key Quote:** "To meditate upon the impersonal feature of the Supreme is very very very difficult."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the difficulty of meditating on the impersonal feature of the Supreme, which is described in negative terms and requires imagination and speculation.

There are people who are attached to the impersonal feature of the Supreme, and they attempt to meditate on the impersonal feature. That is very, very difficult because the impersonal feature is described in a negative way. In the Bhagavad Gita also, it is mentioned to meditate on the Supreme, who is inconceivable, who is not having any material form, is formless, is not having any material attributes, is not having any material body. Like that, denying all material attributes, qualities, material form, material names, etc. So what can they meditate upon, really speaking? So they imagine, they try to speculate and imagine something which is beyond everything material, and that is the impersonal meditation.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The devotees meditation however, upon the Lord's factual form, factual pastimes, factual qualities, is very easily done by the devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts impersonal meditation with the ease of meditation on Krishna's form, pastimes, and qualities, highlighting the accessibility of the Lord through devotional service (Bhakti Yoga).

And that is very, very difficult. Srila Prabhupada says it is practically no meditation at all or simply a waste of time because very seldom is the desired result obtained. Meditation means to fix the mind completely upon the Supreme. Now, when there is no definite understanding of the features of the Supreme, the spiritual mind, the spiritual attributes, then it is very difficult to fix the mind. The devotees' meditation, however, upon the Lord's factual form, factual pastimes, factual qualities, is very easily done by the devotees, and therefore the Lord is easily approached by the devotees. This is the way it is also explained in the Bhagavad Gita, in the twelfth chapter itself, the chapter on devotional service, Bhakti Yoga. Devotees very easily approach the Lord. The Lord is non-different from his transcendental activities in the spiritual platform. The Lord is absolute. The Lord is absolute means he is identical with his name, with his form, with his qualities, with his pastimes, with his paraphernalia, with his pure devotees. He is identical. So thinking of the Lord's pastimes is the same as thinking of the Lord. So that is what Bhishma, he was doing, remembering Krishna's pastimes.

Actually, he remembered the Lord's pastime and thereby he wanted to fix his attention on the Lord at the time of his death.

**Key Quote:** "This is the last prayer by Bhishma Deva in this series of prayers given in this chapter."
**Summary:** The lecture begins with prayers and introduces the context of Bhishma Deva offering his final prayer to Krishna while preparing to leave his body.

Om Agyana Timiraandhasya Gyananjan Shalakaya Chakshurunmeelitam Yena Tasmai Shri Gurave Namaha Nama Om Vishnupadaya Krishna Preshtaya Bhutale Srimate Bhaktivedanta Svamin Nithinamine Namaste Saraswate Deve Gauravani Pracharine Nirvishesha Shunyavadi Pashchatyade Shatarine Jaya Shri Krishna Chaitanya Prabhu Nithyananda Shri Advaita Gadadhara Srivasa Adi Gauravakta Vrinda Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudhirayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 46th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, from the 2nd verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Tamimam Aham Ajam Sharira Bhajam Hridi Hridi Dishtitam Atmakalpitanam Pratidrisham Iva Naikadharkham Ekam Samadhi Gatosvi Vidhuta Bhedam Ohaha. The meaning of this verse is: Now I can meditate with full concentration upon that one Lord Sri Krishna now present before me because now I have transcended the misconceptions of duality in regard to his presence in everyone's heart, even in the hearts of the mental speculators. He is in everyone's heart. The sun may be perceived differently, but the sun is one.

**Key Quote:** "The conception of duality is due to ignorance of his inconceivable energy."
**Summary:** The speaker explains common misconceptions about Krishna's presence and expansions, emphasizing that the perception of duality stems from ignorance of Krishna's inconceivable energy.

This is the last prayer by Bhishma Deva in this series of prayers given in this chapter. Bhishma is offering this prayer to Krishna while preparing to quit his body because he had the benediction that he could quit his body at a chosen auspicious moment, and as you are aware, he chose the auspicious Uttarayan Punyakala, generally, which comes during the Shankranti Makara Shankranti. So, here, the last prayer Bhishma Deva is offering to the Supreme Lord clarifying that people have some misconceptions about the presence of the Lord in everyone's heart; there is some misconception. So that is explained by Prabhupada in the purport: what is that misconception and how pure devotees don't have that misconception. Prabhupada says in the purport: Lord Shri Krishna is the one absolute Supreme Personality of Godhead. God is one, Krishna is one, supreme absolute truth is one, but he has expanded himself into his multi-plenary portions by his inconceivable energy. Krishna can expand and Krishna does expand into unlimited forms of his personal self. The conception of duality is due to ignorance of his inconceivable energy. That means to think that Krishna is different, Rama is different, Paramatma is different, Narsimha is different, Vishnu is different; this conception is due to ignorance. All one supreme Lord, though they are present as if they are different persons because their activities are variegated, their forms appear different, and they have their own devotees, they have their own planets in the spiritual sky, they appear on their own schedule in the material world.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is one but he appears in so many different forms and he is present in everyone's heart."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's simultaneous presence in various forms and in everyone's heart as Paramatma, using the analogy of the sun to illustrate this concept.

So the people in general who do not exactly know who is God or what is the nature of his personality, that even though he is one, he is simultaneously present in so many different forms, all transcendental, all equally powerful, though the source of all these forms is Krishna, the original form of which the other forms are expansions, that original form is Krishna: Govindam Adipurusham Tamaham Bhajami. So that is explained in the Brahma Samhita, that is explained in the Bhagavatam: ete chamsh kalapumsaha krishnastu bhagavan svayam. So all the incarnations and the expansions are plenary portions of Krishna, but Krishna himself is the original personality of God, svayam bhagava. He is the original person. In the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord says that only the foolish take him to be a mere human being. Foolish people think Krishna is an ordinary person: avajananti mamudha manushin tanumashritam, that is the verse in the Bhagavad Gita. Such foolish people are not aware of Krishna's inconceivable energies, achinthya shakti. Krishna has achinthya shakti. By his inconceivable energy, he is present in everyone's heart. Krishna has entered into every person's heart. He says that in the Bhagavad Gita: sarvasya chaham hrithi sannyi vishto, and the example is being given, just like the sun is present before everyone all over the world. The sun is one. If the sun appears overhead, you go in any direction hundreds and hundreds of times and thousands of miles, they will all say sun is above their head. How can the sun simultaneously appear overhead for so many people? So that is an example. Krishna is one, but he appears in so many different forms and he is present in everyone's heart. The Paramatma feature of the Lord is an expansion of his plenary portions. Paramatma feature is the Lord in the form of the Lord in the heart of every living being. He expands himself as Paramatma in everyone's heart by his inconceivable energy.

#### Brahmajyoti, Vasudeva, Mahajana, Bhishma Deva

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Vasudeva Sarvamiti... Vasudeva is all in all in everything and there is no existence of anything without Vasudeva."
**Summary:** The lecture discusses the Brahmajyoti as an expansion of Krishna's personal glow and emphasizes the understanding of Krishna as Vasudeva, the ultimate reality, as confirmed by the Mahajana Bhishma Deva.

And he also expands himself as the glowing effulgence of the Brahma Jyoti by expansion of his personal glow. Krishna's form has got unlimited light coming out of it, spiritual light, so that light expands as Brahma Jyoti in the entire spiritual sky. That Brahma Jyoti is the source of illumination in this material world. The sunshine, the moonshine, the light of the fire, the light of electricity, every illumination is an expansion of that Brahma Jyoti, is an expansion of the personal glow of Krishna. This is confirmed in the Brahma Samhita, that Brahma Jyoti is the personal glow: Yasyaprabha Prabhavato Jagadanda Koti is the statement of the Bhagavad Gita Brahma Samhita. Therefore, there is no difference between him, that is Krishna, his personal glow, the Brahma Jyoti, or his plenary portion as all are identical: vadantita tattva vidaha tattvam yajnanam advayam advayagyana non different brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavaniti shabhyati. Less intelligent persons who are not aware of this fact consider Brahma Jyoti and Paramatma features to be different from Krishna. This misconception of duality is completely removed from the mind of Bhishma Deva. So Bhishma Deva knows that Krishna is the original personality of Godhead, he has expanded himself and entered the heart of everyone as Paramatma, and his personal glow is expanded as Brahma Jyoti, that Bhishma Deva knows, and all the pure devotees of Krishna know this. So Bhishma is fully satisfied that Krishna only is all in all in everything, only one who is all in all in everything. So only Krishna who is the ultimate reality in everything in existence. This enlightenment of the truth about Krishna is attained by the great Mahatmas or the great devotees as it is stated in Bhagavad Gita: Vasudeva Sarvamiti Samahatma Sudurlabha. Vasudeva Sarvamiti, Vasudeva is all in all in everything and there is no existence of anything without Vasudeva. So Vasudeva or Lord Sri Krishna is the original supreme person as confirmed now by

a Mahajana. Bhishma Deva is a Mahajana, one of the twelve great authorities in this universe who know the secret or confidential knowledge of Dharma. What is Dharma or who is God? What is the absolute truth? Now both the pure devotees and the neophytes, everyone should try to follow in the footsteps of Bhishma Deva. That is the devotional, that is the way of the devotional line in Bhakti. Always we follow the authorities, the spiritual authorities. We don't concoct, we don't try to imagine, we don't try to discover by our own strength. We never do that because we are limited, we are prone to defects, we are affected by ignorance by the gunas, so therefore it is impossible for us to attempt to discover or find out by our own strength individually or collectively. We follow the spiritual authorities. Now Ravupan explains another important point here, that the worshipable object of Bhishma Deva is Lord Krishna as Parthasarathy. This is described earlier because Bhishma is situated in the relationship of Vediyarasa with Krishna, and the worshipable object of the Gopis is the same Krishna in Vrindavan as the most attractive Shama Sundara. Gopis, they relate with Krishna as Shama Sundara and Bhishma relates with Krishna as Parthasarathy. Now Prabhupada says less intelligent scholars sometimes make a mistake and think that the Krishna of Vrindavan and that of the battle of Kurukshetra are different personalities. This is not correct. Both the forms of Krishna, Parthasarathy and Shama Sundara, are one person, the supreme person, one and only supreme

person Krishna. Even the impersonalist object of destination is Krishna as the impersonal Brahmajyoti, that is also Krishna only, and the yogis destination of Paramatma, yogis meditate on Paramatma in the heart, that is also Krishna only. So even though all are identical with Krishna, still in his personal feature as Krishna, either as Parthasarathy or Shama Sundara, Krishna is present as the person, but in the impersonal feature as Brahmajyoti or in the feature as Paramatma, Krishna is not personally present. This we have to understand. So therefore devotees object is always the personality of God is Krishna. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

#### Krishna Consciousness, Nirvikalpa Samadhi, Total Absorption

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This is the highest stage of perfection, this total absorption."
**Summary:** This segment explains the verse describing Bhishma Deva's passing in Krishna consciousness, defining Nirvikalpa Samadhi as total absorption in Krishna through mind, speech, sight, and actions, and emphasizing that this state is attainable through devotional service.

Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya, Narayanam Namaskritya, Naram Chai Vanarottamam, Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session we will be discussing from the 43rd verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The prayers are over. Now Suta Goswami, who is narrating this whole incident to the sage Sunaimisharanya, he is speaking now. Suta Uvacha Krishna Evam Bhagavati Manovag Drishti Vritti Bhihi Atmani Atmanam Aveshya So Anta Shvasa Uparamat. The meaning of this verse is: Suta Goswami said, "Thus Bhishma Deva merged himself in the Supersoul, Lord Sri Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, with his mind, speech, sight and actions, and thus he became silent and his breathing stilled." So this is the verse that is describing Bhishma Deva has quit his body in Krishna consciousness, because his mind, his speech, his sight and actions are all completely absorbed in Krishna. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "The stage attained by Bhishma Deva while quitting his material body is called Nirvikalpa Samadhi." This is a technical term. What is the meaning of this term Nirvikalpa Samadhi? That is also explained by Srila Prabhupada. Nirvikalpa Samadhi, it is called Nirvikalpa Samadhi because he, that is Bhishma Deva, merged himself into thinking of the Lord and his mind into remembering, remembering his different activities. He chanted the glories of the Lord, that is his speech. And by his sight, he began to see the Lord personally present before him. And thus, all his activities became concentrated upon the Lord without deviation. Samadhi means total absorption. Total absorption of the mind, of the thinking, that is the mind, activity of the mind, the speech, and the sight, and the very self. So, thinking, remembering, glorifying, and seeing, in all these ways, Bhishma was totally absorbed in thought of Krishna. This is the highest stage of perfection, this total absorption, and it is possible for everyone to attain this stage by practice of devotional service. So here, Prabhupada is teaching us that there is the highest perfectional stage to be attained in the practice of devotional service. Devotional service means practicing, focusing our attention on Krishna. Krishna means the Supreme Personality of Godhead. We are focusing our attention on Krishna. He has so many different features. So every possible way if we can absorb our self in thought of Krishna, in thinking of Krishna, in glorifying Krishna, in hearing about Krishna, in seeing Krishna's form either as the Deity or as the personally Krishna is present in the case of Bhishma. He is personally present. So Bhishma is directly seeing Krishna before quitting his body and the beautiful form. He is describing, he has already described in his prayers the beautiful form of Krishna.

#### Devotional Service, Nine Principles of Bhakti, Service Attitude
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/Myj43RT1ytI?t=331
**Verse References:** SB 7
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Devotional service is not something idle."
**Summary:** This segment details the nine principles of devotional service (Shravanam, Kirtanam, Smaranam, etc.) as outlined in the Bhagavatam, emphasizing that bhakti involves active service with a loving attitude towards Krishna, and that any of these practices can lead to perfection.

So this is the highest perfection to be attained and it is possible for anyone provided one practices devotional service. Now devotional service itself, how is it performed? So Srila Prabhupada says based on the explanation in the seventh canto of the Bhagavatam. The devotional service of the Lord Krishna consists of nine principles of service activities. Devotional service is not something idle, simply sitting and doing nothing. No. Devotional service, Bhakti, means devotional service. So it consists of service activities, activities rendered while having a service attitude. I want to serve Krishna to please him. I want to serve Krishna in a loving attitude. And these nine principles of service activities are described in the Bhagavatam seventh canto as: Number one, hearing, hearing about Krishna, Shravanam. Number two, chanting, Kirtanam. Number three, remembering, remembering in Sanskrit it is called Smaranam. Number four, serving the lotus feet of Krishna, Padashevanam. Number five, worshipping, Archanam, Deity worship, specifically Deity worship. Number six, praying, Vandanam, offering prayers, just like Bhishma did. He was remembering Krishna's pastimes. He was praying, offering prayers. He was chanting the glories of Krishna, and like that he was engaged in all possible ways in service activities before quitting his body, totally absorbed in that. So number seven, executing the orders, it's called Dasyam. A servant is specially meant for simply carrying out the orders of the master, just like Hanuman. Whatever Rama ordered, Hanuman simply carried out that order. So that is Dasyam. Then eighth one of the list of nine service activities, eighth one is fraternizing, Sakhyam, acting as a rendering service rather, as a friend of the Lord, friend of Lord Krishna, just like Arjuna, rendering service as a friend of Krishna. And the final one, ninth one, fully surrendering, Atma Nivedanam, total self surrender. Bali Maharaj. Each one of these, we have an ideal described in the Bhagavatam. Any one of them, any one of the nine or all of them are equally competent to award the desired result. That is the highest perfection of total absorption of oneself in the Supreme Lord Krishna, but they require to be practiced persistently

#### Guidance of Spiritual Master, Hearing, Krishna Katha

**Key Quote:** "Bhakti begins with hearing."
**Summary:** This segment stresses the importance of practicing devotional service under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, highlighting hearing (Shravanam) as the most important of the nine principles, and advocating for hearing and reading Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam as Krishna katha.

under the guidance of an expert devotee of the Lord. Who is that expert devotee of the Lord? The bona fide spiritual master. So the bona fide spiritual master gives guidance, gives instructions, helps the disciple to actually practice one or more of these nine items, nine principles of service activities rendered for Krishna by a devotee. And they have to be practiced. In the beginning, it will not be very nicely done, but by repeatedly doing, again and again, abhyasa yoga yuktena cetasa na anyagamina, without deviation of the attention, persistently focused. The attention, mainly the attention, completely focused on Krishna. So of these nine, Srila Prabhupada says, the first item, hearing, is the most important item of all. Bhakti begins with hearing. So the most important item is hearing, shravanam. And therefore, hearing of the Bhagavad Gita and later on Srimad Bhagavatam is essential for the serious candidate who wants to attain the stage of Bhishma Deva at the end. So practice hearing Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam. From whom should you hear? From Srila Prabhupada. For all of us now, we should hear from Prabhupada. Prabhupada has given discourses and he also has written Bhagavad Gita translation and purport, Bhagavatam translation and purport. So we should read or we should hear somebody else reading Prabhupada's book, Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam. And in this way, we should completely become absorbed in the subject matter that is described in the Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam. Both are Krishna katha. Bhagavad Gita is personally spoken by Krishna and Bhagavatam is spoken by Shukadeva Goswami and other great devotees about Krishna. So they are both Krishna katha and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has instructed everyone to hear these two scriptures, Krishna katha as given in these two scriptures, Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam and thereby perfect our devotional selves.

#### Sound Incarnation, Bhagavad Gita, Srimad Bhagavatam, Perfection

**Key Quote:** "His words of the Bhagavad Gita or those of Srimad Bhagavatam are identical with the Lord."
**Summary:** This segment explains that even without Krishna's physical presence, one can attain Bhishma Deva's state of Nirvikalpa Samadhi by engaging with the sound incarnations of the Lord, Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam, and emphasizes the ideal of dying in thought of Krishna.

The unique situation at Bhishma Deva's time of death can be attained even though Lord Krishna may not be personally present. In the case of Bhishma, he was very very fortunate and it's rare that Krishna is personally present before the devotee who is quitting his body. That's very special, very rare. Bhishma Deva was blessed by Krishna. But even if Krishna is not personally present in front of us, when we are quitting the body, we can attain that situation that Bhishma was himself in. In that Nirvikalpa Samadhi, total absorption of the self in Krishna is possible. How? So Prabhupada says, "His words of the Bhagavad Gita or those of Srimad Bhagavatam are identical with the Lord." This is the meaning of Krishna is absolute. Krishna, the person, his form, his qualities, his pastimes, his words, his descriptions, his paraphernalia, his abode, all are identical 100% with Krishna. And there is no difference at all between them. So Prabhupada describes Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam as sound incarnations of the Lord. And one can fully utilize them to be entitled to the stage of Sri Bhishma Deva, who was one of the eight Vasus. Bhishma Deva, before this birth, he was one of the eight Vasus in the upper planets. He took birth as Bhishma and he attained this perfection. Everyone has to quit the body, but quitting the body like Bhishma Deva is the ideal, not dying in ignorance, not dying in thought of something else or someone else, but dying in thought of Krishna. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Jai Vanarottamam Deviim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 44th verse of the 9th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The description is continuing what happened after Bhishma Deva quit his body. Sampadyamanam Agyaya Bhishmam Brahmani Nishkale Sarve Babhu Te Tushneem Vayam Siva Bhishma Dinakya Ye. The meaning of this verse is, knowing that Bhishma Deva had merged into the unlimited eternity of the Supreme Absolute, all present there became silent like birds at the end of the day. Now here is an analogy given that when birds are living in one tree, there are a lot of birds. In the morning they go out searching for food, etc. They go chirping and they come back in the evening around the time of sunset. Again they come back chirping and once they settle down in their particular nest, they become silent.

**Key Quote:** "That's where all of us belong. Everyone, every living entity belongs to the home, our home, that is Kṛṣṇa's personal abode, the unlimited eternity of the Supreme Absolute."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Bhishma's absorption in Krishna at the time of death and explains Srila Prabhupada's interpretation of merging into the unlimited eternity, which means returning to our original home, Krishna's abode.

Something like this happened after Bhishma quit his body. Of course, he was lying there on the bed of arrows. But he chose the most auspicious moment as one who had the benediction to choose an auspicious time to quit the body. But most importantly, he was fully absorbed in thought of Krishna who was personally present before Bhishma Deva. So everyone present there, so many great saintly persons had assembled to witness Bhishma quitting his body. They knew Bhishma was a great personality. He is one of the Mahajanas, one of the ideal devotees in the whole universe. So when he was quitting his body, all the great saintly persons from all over the universe had come. Great sages had come there, assembled there. All of them, they became silent, knowing that Bhishma Deva had attained his perfection of going back home, back to Godhead. That is described here as, He had merged into the unlimited eternity of the Supreme Absolute. So Srila Prabhupada explains what does it mean to merge into the unlimited eternity of the Supreme Absolute. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, To enter into or become merged into the unlimited eternity of the Supreme Absolute means To enter the original home of the living being. This is described by Prabhupāda many times in other places as, let us go back home, back to Godhead. That's where all of us belong. Everyone, every living entity belongs to the home, our home, that is Kṛṣṇa's personal abode, the unlimited eternity of the Supreme Absolute.

**Key Quote:** "Our relationship with Kṛṣṇa is eternal. We are connected with Kṛṣṇa eternally."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the eternal relationship between the living being and Krishna, emphasizing that we are all tiny parts and parcels of Krishna meant to serve Him in loving devotional service.

So Śrīla Prabhupāda says further, the living beings are all component parts and parcels of the Absolute Personality of Godhead. We are all very, very, very tiny spirit souls, part of Kṛṣṇa. Parcel means inseparable part, cannot be separated. Our relationship with Kṛṣṇa is eternal. We are connected with Kṛṣṇa eternally. Only point is that temporarily we may forget when in the material world we forget Kṛṣṇa under the influence of the material energy, we forget Kṛṣṇa. But the relationship is not broken. It is permanently there. It's a spiritual relationship, so it can never be broken. Spirit means eternal. Spiritual relationship is eternal. Therefore, they are eternally related with Him as the servitor and the served. Every spirit soul, every living being, each one of us, we are related with Kṛṣṇa as His servitors. We are meant to serve Him. Don't mistake this to be something like material service. It is actually spiritual service, loving, devotional service. That's the correct explanation. The Lord is served by all His parts and parcels as the complete machine is served by its parts and parcels.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So, we as spirit soul, tiny, tiny, tiny spirit soul, we are totally useless when we are separate from Kṛṣṇa."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of a machine and its parts, the speaker explains that a spirit soul separated from Krishna is useless, and that material activities are also useless because they are not in service to Krishna.

This is an example being given by Prabhupāda to help us understand how we are connected with the Lord. Any part of the machine removed from the whole is no longer important. You can understand this point. Let's say there is a small screw which is holding some particular item in the entire machine, huge machine, several parts. Now that screw, if it falls off, what is the value of this screw? But as long as it is connected with the machine, it is very, very important. It is doing a very specific function and it is very important. So, any part of the machine removed from the whole is no longer important. So, we as spirit soul, tiny, tiny, tiny spirit soul, we are totally useless when we are separate from Kṛṣṇa. Of course, we cannot be separated, inseparable. But if we want to separate or we want to try to separate, then our life is useless. Similarly, any part and parcel of the Absolute detached from the service of the Lord is useless. Now, material activity means so many activities we perform which is not service of the Lord. That is useless. All material activities are useless because they are not of the nature of service of the Supreme Lord Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "When we develop a desire, let me go back home, back to Godhead, where I belong, where life is eternal, full of bliss, full of knowledge, in association with the most loving, supreme personality of Godhead, Krishna, very, very attractive proposition, then that's called the spiritual urge of the living being begins."
**Summary:** The speaker describes life in the material world as a prison and explains that when a living being becomes conscious of this fact, a spiritual urge arises to return to Godhead, which is called Brahma Jijnasa.

The living beings who are in the material world are all disintegrated parts and parcel of the Supreme Whole and they are no longer as important as the original parts and parcels. Originally, we are all part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. So, as original parts, we are very, very important. Now, apart from the living beings in this material world Prabhupāda is telling, there are, however, more integrated living beings who are eternally liberated in the spiritual world. They are eternally liberated. The material energy of the Lord called Durga Shakti or the superintendent of the prison house takes charge of the disintegrated parts and parcels and thus they undergo a conditioned life under the laws of material nature. What is our life in this material world, material existence as we say? It is a life in a prison. Prison because we are originally liberated souls but now we are conditioned by the laws of material nature. The laws of material nature are forcing us to live in this body and this body means full of limitations. When the living being becomes conscious of this fact, just like all of us are now understanding this point as we study here Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavatam, we become conscious of this fact, then the living being tries to go back home, back to Godhead and thus the spiritual urge of the living being begins. When we develop a desire, let me go back home, back to Godhead, where I belong, where life is eternal, full of bliss, full of knowledge, in association with the most loving, supreme personality of Godhead, Krishna, very, very attractive proposition, then that's called the spiritual urge of the living being begins. This spiritual urge is called Brahman. Brahma Jijnasa or inquiry about Brahman. Brahman means Krishna. So inquiry about Krishna. It's called Brahma Jijnasa. Inquire about Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Three things are required to ensure success of Brahma Jijnasa, the spiritual urge: Jnana, Vairagya, Bhakti."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Jnana (knowledge), Vairagya (renunciation), and Bhakti (devotional service) are required for success in Brahma Jijnasa and introduces the three categories of transcendentalists: Jnanis, Yogis, and Bhaktas.

Human form of life is meant for this. Principally this Brahma Jijnasa is successful by knowledge, renunciation and devotional service to the Lord. Jnana, Vairagya, Bhakti. Three things are required to ensure success of Brahma Jijnasa, the spiritual urge. Jnana or knowledge means knowledge of everything of Brahman, the Supreme. We should get proper understanding of who is Krishna or what is Krishna, from the proper source, from the proper authorities. Renunciation means detachment of material affection. In this material world we develop so many different types of material attachments to so many things, to so many material situations, material desires, material objects, material bodies, material relationships. We get attached. So that material affection we have to give up. That is renunciation. And devotional service is the revival by practice of the original position of the living being. Our original position is in the spiritual world in relationship with Krishna as his servant, as his servitor, as his devotee, serving in love. The successful living beings who are eligible to enter into the realm of the Absolute are called the Jnanis, the Yogis and the Bhaktas.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Those who don't render loving service, they have no place in the Vaikuntha."
**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between the destinations of Jnanis and Yogis (impersonal Brahman) and Bhaktas (Vaikuntha planets), emphasizing that only those who render loving service to the Lord can enter Vaikuntha.

Three categories of transcendentalists: Jnanis, Yogis and Bhaktas. Now of these three categories of transcendentalists, the Jnanis and Yogis enter into the impersonal race of the Supreme. In the spiritual world, Krishna is personally present in his personal abode, the spiritual planets, one of the spiritual planets. And outside the spiritual planets is the spiritual sky consisting of the impersonal Brahmajyoti. So the Jnanis and Yogis enter the impersonal Brahmajyoti, not the spiritual planets, not the personal abode of Krishna. But the Bhaktas enter into the spiritual planets known as the Vaikunthas. The spiritual planets, Bhaktas enter. This is basically the third category of transcendentalists: Jnanis, Yogis, Bhaktas. Only the Bhaktas enter into Vaikuntha. In these spiritual planets, the Supreme Lord as Narayana predominates. And the healthy, unconditioned living beings live there by rendering loving service to the Lord in the capacity of servant, friend, parents and fiancée. Four kinds of relationship: Dasya, Sakya, Vatsalya, Madhurya. Different types of relationship different devotees have with the Supreme Lord in the spiritual world. They render service. There the unconditioned living beings enjoy life in full freedom with the Lord. Whereas the impersonalist Jnanis and Yogis enter into the impersonal glowing effulgence of the Vaikuntha planets. So they can't enter because they have to graduate to come to the point of Bhakti, rendering loving service. Those who don't render loving service, they have no place in the Vaikuntha.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that Jnanis and Yogis may fall back to the material world if they don't take to devotional service, while devotees who reach the spiritual planets never return.

So these Jnanis and Yogis, if they take to devotional service, then their spiritual life is successful. If they don't take to devotional service after attaining the Brahmajyoti, then they fall down into the material world. This is explained in the Bhagavatam. They come back to the material world. Whereas devotees, they never come back, having gone once there in the Bhagavad Gita. yad gatva na nivartante taddhama paramam mama. So that is the position of the devotees.

**Key Quote:** "Although he was a human being, as Bhishma he was a human being. But his position was on the level of Brahma."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Bhismadeva's position as a Mahajana, comparing him to Brahma, Narada, and Shiva, emphasizing his spiritual perfection.

That is the greatness of Bhismadeva. So, in the purport, Sri Laprabhupada explains the significance of this way of showing respect to Bhishma Deva. Bhishma Deva was respected both by the human beings and by the demigods. The human beings live on earth and similar other planets in the Bhur and Bhuvara group of planets. Bhuloka, Bhuvarloka. Bhuloka is the earthly planetary system. There are planets which are on this level of the Bhuloka. Loka means a group of planets belonging to a similar category. Bhuvarloka is above Bhuloka, but that is also a planetary system where the humans live, human beings live. But the demigods live in the Svarloka group. Svarloka, heavenly planets. And all of them knew Bhishma Deva as a great warrior and devotee of the Lord. So what is Bhishma Deva's position actually? As a Mahajana or authority, he was on the level of Brahma, Narada, and Shiva. Although he was a human being, as Bhishma he was a human being, but his position was on the level of Brahma. Three other Mahajanas are being mentioned by Prabhupad here. Brahma is the topmost personality in the whole universe. Shiva is greater than even Brahma. Among the Devatas, Shiva is called Mahadeva, greater than even Brahma. And Narada, the topmost devotee of the lord in the whole universe, so Bhishma's position was in an equal level as a Mahajana.

with Brahma, Narada, Shiva. Qualification on a par with the great demigods is possible only an attainment of spiritual perfection, not by material qualifications. One can get such a position as Bhishma got it's only by spiritual perfection. Thus, Bhishma Deva was known all over the universes, and during this time interplanetary travel was affected by finer methods than the futile endeavors of mechanical spacecraft. Prabhupada is comparing in the Vedic times there was interplanetary travel. Demigods used to come to the earth planet, and great yogis and great devotees like Narada, they travel from the earth planet to upper planets. So that was possible by yogic methods, by spiritual methods. Narada, as a pure devotee, simply by desiring to go from swarga loka to bhuloka, he just travels without any separate endeavor at all. Just he desires, let me go to visit Yudhishthira in the palace of Astinapura, he just is there next moment in the palace of Astinapura on the earth from wherever he is before he traveled. So this is unknown to the modern society on this earth planet. So here they are trying to go to other planets by some mechanical spacecraft that is never to happen, especially they cannot travel to upper planets of the category of Swarga Loka. So it is explained by Prabhupada, when the distant planets were informed of the passing away Bhishma Deva, all the inhabitants of the upper planets as well as of the earth dropped showers of flowers.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the showering of flowers is a sign of recognition by demigods and not a mere decoration of a dead body, emphasizing that Bhismadeva's body was spiritualized through devotional service.

to show due respect to the departed great personality. They showered flowers from heaven, and even on the earth they showered flowers on Bhishma Deva because he was such a great personality who quit his body in the ideal way, teaching all of us how to quit the body perfectly. Everybody has to die, but one should not die in ignorance, one should die in knowledge, proper knowledge. So further, Sri La Prabhupada explains the showering of flowers from heaven is a sign of restlessness recognition by great demigods, and it should never be compared to the decoration of a dead body. So in modern times, they have a procession of a person who has quit his body by seating him on a nice throne and carrying the the dead body on the throne in a procession that is called decoration of a dead body. Why? Prabhupada explains here, the body of Bhishma Deva lost its material effects due to being surcharged with spiritual realization, and thus the body was spiritualized as when iron becomes red hot when in contact with fire. So the body of a pure devotee is never material, even if there is some material light that is not material, even if there is some material light that is not material, even if there is some material light at the end of his procession there is a huge shri mithra at that end of the procession which will return to the ark guer sri sri maka what has happened is flavored with the power of spiritual realization by spiritual realization it becomes spiritualized just as a piece of iron placed in red-hot fire gradually becomes red hot and becomes as well as fire similarly this body when completely engaged in pure devotional service before Beschut hatab designatedly this body said and disrupting its Ini искranian mission as one itself is knit on theодcusam very much like the Devacham Stenton that is written in the sri fahiha and Matthias if you followed the following those którego b kendang jr styrage presiding by diestro ot 오케이 elleninki如果ansen septen coron er si phiphan kiya bimaстьaa become spiritualized and this body is as good as a spiritual body it's no longer a material body the body of a fully self-realized soul is not therefore accepted as material.

**Summary:** The lecture distinguishes between honoring spiritually advanced souls and the misuse of 'Jayanti' ceremonies for ordinary people, reserving it for the Lord and His pure devotees.

special ceremonies are observed for such spiritual bodies. The respect and recognition of Bhishma Deva never to be imitated by artificial means as it has become a fashion to observe the so-called jayanti ceremony for any and every common man nowadays, even those who are not spiritually advanced or spiritually perfect, even for them they observe what is called as jayanti ceremony. According to authorized shastras, such a jayanti ceremony for an ordinary man, however exalted he may be materially, is an offense to the body of the lord. Shastras say jayanti is exclusively reserved for the supreme lord and his pure devotees, not for other people who are spiritually ignorant, though they may be materially very, very accomplished. Jayanti is reserved for the day when the lord appears on the earth. When the lord appears on the earth, he appears in his original spiritual form. He appears out of his own sweet will. He comes for the sake of showing his mercy upon the conditioned souls in this world, and he does not come in contact with material energy. He remains in a spiritual uh position. So appearance of the lord is not a secondary thing at all. So Bhishma Deva was unique in his activities and his passing away to the

So this is uh the way Bhishma Deva passed away, nirvikalpa samadhi, completely absorbed in thinking of Krishna, in offering prayers to Krishna, in remembering Krishna's pastimes, in fixing his sight completely on that beautiful form of Krishna who was standing in front of Bhishma Deva. In this way, Bhishma squirting his body or passing away was ideal. So it is it deserves to be shown respect by all others who can follow in the footsteps of Bhishma Deva and also try to achieve perfection of going back home, back to Godhead. So this should not be a a ritual just like nowadays they say such and such a great politicians jayanti they say jayanti now that word jayanti is reserved for the lord it's the day on which the lord appears we say narsimma jayanti the day on which lord narsimma appeared vaishakashukla chaturdashi this year it falls on 15th of may vaishakashukla chaturdashi every year we celebrate narsimma jayanti it is indicating the appearance day anniversary of lord narsimma so the supreme lord appears in this world for the sake of protecting the devotees for the sake of delivering the conditioned souls it's his causeless mercy and his appearance is never to be

So uh Bhishma Deva's passing away is uh ideal, and as Prabhupada has explained in a in previous verses, everyone can achieve this perfection that Bhishma Deva achieved of going back to Godhead simply by practicing devotional service to Godhead. So this is the ultimate goal of Bhishma Deva service, especially by practicing hearing and chanting of all the methods of bhakti. This hearing and chanting is very easy, very effective, very powerful in especially in this kali yuga. The subject matter is important, subject matter of hearing and chanting, either you hear and chant the harikrishna mantra or you hear in chant about Krishna's activities as described in the Bhagavatam or about Krishna's instructions in the Bhagavad Gita. Especially these two books, Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam, are very, very important, and they contain the essence of all Vedic wisdom very nicely described, perfectly described.

#### Bhishma Deva, Yudhishthira's grief, Dhritarashtra's ambition, Pandu's death, Succession

**Key Quote:** "Bhishma Deva was the most affectionate grandfather of the Pandavas, and caretaker of the widow daughter-in-law Kunti Devi."
**Summary:** The lecture begins with an explanation of the verse, focusing on Yudhishthira's grief after Bhishma Deva's death and then delves into the historical context of Dhritarashtra's ambition and the Pandavas' rightful claim to the throne.

In this session we will be discussing from the 46th verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. तस्य निर्हरणादीनि संपरे तस्य भार्गव युदिष्ठिरक कारयित्वा मुहूर्तं दुख्यितो भवत। The meaning of this verse is, O descendant of Bhrigu, शवनका, after performing funeral rituals for the dead body of Bhishma Deva, Maharaj Yudhishthira was momentarily overtaken with grief. So, Suta Goswami speaking this verse, he is addressing Shavunaka Rishi, the sages headed by Shavunaka Rishi. Shavunaka Rishi is addressed as Bhargava, descendant of Bhrigu Rishi or Bhrigu Muni. He is coming in the dynasty of Bhrigu Rishi, Bhrigu Vamsha. So, the description is being given here that Yudhishthira, after Bhishma Deva passed away, he quit his body at the most auspicious moment, and more importantly, he quit his body in the presence of Lord Sri Krishna, and he quit his body while his mind was completely absorbed in thought, in remembrance of Krishna. So, perfect way of quitting the body, ideal for all the devotees, for everyone. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, Bhishma Deva was not only a great family head of Maharaj Yudhishthira, but also he was a great philosopher and friend to him, his brothers and his mother, the entire Pandavas. Kunti is the name of a family, the five Pandavas brothers, and their mother Kunti, Kunti Devi. Since Maharaj Pandu, the father of the five brothers headed by Maharaj Yudhishthira, had died, Bhishma Deva was the most affectionate grandfather of the Pandavas, and caretaker of the widow daughter-in-law Kunti Devi. Bhishma Deva's granddaughter was the daughter of Lord Pundit, Krishna's daughter, Bhishmadeva's brother was Vichitravirya. Vichitravirya's son was Pandu. So, Bhishmadeva's daughter-in-law or Vichitravirya's daughter-in-law was Kuntidevi. In that way, it is being described here, Bhishmadeva's relationship with Kuntidevi. Although Maharaj Dhritarashtra, the elder uncle of Maharaj Yudhishthira, was there to look after them, his affection, that is Dhritarashtra's affection, was more on the side of his hundred sons, headed by Duryodhana. Dhritarashtra was very much unhappy about the fact that Dhritarashtra himself could not ascend the throne of the emperor of the entire world, the throne of Hastinapura, because Dhritarashtra was blind by birth. He was disqualified. And Pandu had taken charge of ruling the entire world as the emperor, and Pandu died. And Yudhishthira should have ascended the throne, but if Dhritarashtra is not dead, would that mean he shall not be a successor? Since Yudhishthira was not an adult, a major—he was not quite eighteen years old—therefore, after Pandu died, as long as Yudhishthira would yield to the throne, a caretaker king was needed. And that caretaker king Bhishma refused because Bhishma had taken a vow not to sit on the throne. He had given a promise to his father. Therefore Dhritarashtra was the caretaker king and Bhishma and Vidura were advising.

**Key Quote:** "Ultimately a colossal clique was fabricated to deprive the five fatherless brothers of the rightful claim of the kingdom of Hastinapura."
**Summary:** This segment details Dhritarashtra's unfair treatment of the Pandavas, the conspiracy to deprive them of their kingdom, and the attempt to kill them in the house of shellac, highlighting Vidura's role in warning Yudhishthira.

They were advisors to Dhritarashtra and the entire royal household. But Dhritarashtra was not fair in his dealings, especially with the Pandavas. So Srila Prabhupada explained, "Ultimately a colossal clique was fabricated to deprive the five fatherless brothers of the rightful claim of the kingdom of Hastinapura." There was a great intrigue common in imperial palaces and the five brothers were exiled to wilderness. This is explained by Prabhupada in another place. What was this? This was a colossal clique that because these Pandavas were great devotees of Krishna and Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana were very materialistic. Naturally, Pandavas were put into many dangerous conditions. That is the policy of Dhritarashtra. How to kill the sons of Pandu? He wanted to kill the five sons of Pandu and usurp the kingdom for his own sons. He could not ascend the throne. So he felt that at least my sons should become the emperors. So he wanted to kill the five sons of Pandu just so that his son can become the emperor. So this was the policy from the very beginning. But the Pandavas, they were very obedient to Dhritarashtra because Dhritarashtra was their guardian, their uncle, elderly uncle, who had taken charge of protecting the five Pandavas and their mother Kunti in the absence of Pandu. So what did Dhritarashtra do? He constructed a house of shellac. Shellac means as soon as you touch one matchstick, immediately the whole palace will be on fire. So he asked his nephews and sisters-in-law Kunti that for some time you go. I constructed a very nice palace for you. You go and live there. Why you have to share this palace? So Vidura, he was very alert. He knew that Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana were plotting to kill the Pandavas. So Vidura informed Yudhishthira very secretly that Dhritarashtra wants to burn you to ashes when you go to that house. Be careful. And Duryodhana could understand that Vidura had already informed. Therefore Duryodhana was very anxious. He was very angry against Vidura. And these are all, this is the politics that was going on in the palace of Hastinapura during the time of the Pandavas and Kauravas.

**Key Quote:** "So although Yudhishthira knew that my uncle is sending me to this house to set it on fire, still he was very obedient."
**Summary:** The segment recounts the various trials faced by the Pandavas, including their escape from the house of shellac, the attempt to poison Bhima, Draupadi's protection by Krishna, and their exile following the rigged gambling match.

So although Yudhishthira knew that my uncle is sending me to this house to set it on fire, still he was very obedient. So he agreed to go. He didn't want to disobey the superior because Yudhishthira was always morally upright. So they dug a subway into that house and they escaped. They dug a subway within that house, a tunnel, and then they escaped. So this is the way they escaped that danger to their life. The five Pandavas along with Kunti. Then another time Bhima was fed a poisoned cake. And again it's described in detail in the Mahabharata. Bhima was also saved. Then they had to meet one man-eater, rakshasa demon, Hidimba. So Bhima fought with him and killed him. And then in the assembly of ruffians, asatsabhaya, they attempted to disrobe Draupadi. But Draupadi took shelter of Krishna and she was protected. Then that is also described in detail in the Mahabharata. And then in a gambling match, which was completely rigged, the Pandavas were totally cheated. And when they lost the match, the terms were that whoever loses has to go and stay in the forest in exile for 13 years, out of which the last year, 13th year, they have to live incognito. They have to hide themselves. So in this way, the Pandavas, they were cheated and their life was in danger. Even when they were living in exile, Duryodhana attempted to attack the Pandavas and kill them. But the Pandavas fought back. And therefore the description is that they could not ultimately kill the Pandavas, though they tried. And in the battle of Kurukshetra, because Krishna was on the side of the Pandavas, the Pandavas could not be defeated by the Kauravas, even though the Kauravas were very powerful.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is always on the side of his devotees."
**Summary:** This segment explains why Krishna sided with the Pandavas, emphasizing the importance of devotion and highlighting Bhishma's knowledge of the Pandavas' eventual victory due to Krishna's presence, concluding with Yudhishthira's grief over Bhishma's death.

Because Krishna was on the side of the Pandavas. So it is described here, even though Bhishma was fighting on the side of the Kauravas, because he was obliged to the caretaker, Dhritarashtra, but still he was a sincerely sympathetic, well-wisher, grandfather, friend and philosopher to Maharaja Yudhishtira. Even up to the last moment of his life, he died very happily seeing Maharaja Yudhishtira ascend to the throne. Otherwise, he would have died long, long back. Instead of suffering agony over the undue suffering of the Pandavas, he would have quit his body long back. But he was waiting for the opportune moment because he knew that the sons of Pandavas would come out victorious. He knew this in the battle of Kurukshetra. And he knew that because Krishna was on the side of the Pandavas. Now why did Krishna take the side of the Pandavas? Krishna is always on the side of his devotees. And who can be a devotee of Krishna? Anyone, everyone can become a devotee of Krishna. But these demoniac minded people, they refuse to become devotees of Krishna. And as a result of that, they keep on suffering. And Bhishma knew Yudhishtira cannot be ultimately vanquished because he is a pure devotee of Krishna. Therefore, Yudhishtira also, he had respect for Bhishma Deva. And he felt great separation when Bhishma Deva quit his body. And therefore, momentarily he was feeling grief on account of the death of Bhishma.

**Key Quote:** "application of the knowledge, that is called realization"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse and explains that while sages possess knowledge, applying it and achieving realization is a different and difficult process.

In this session, we will be discussing the 47th verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Tushtuvur Munayo Hrshtaha Krishnam Tadguhya Namabhihi Tataste Krishna Hridayaha Svashraman Prayayuk Punaha. The meaning of this verse is: All the great sages then glorified Lord Sri Krishna, who was present there, by confidential Vedic hymns. Then all of them returned to the Lord and returned to their respective hermitages, bearing always Lord Krishna within their hearts. So, the description was being given earlier in this chapter that at the time of Bhishma preparing to quit his body, great sages from all over the universe, from all the upper planetary systems, they assembled at the site where Bhishma had made preparations by lying on a bed of arrows, and they all heard Bhishma instruct Yudhishthira in the presence of Krishna. Therefore, after Bhishma's passing away, which they witnessed, how perfectly Bhishma quit his body, that was a lesson for everyone, even all the great sages, because even though the great sages know philosophically, in terms of knowledge, they have knowledge how to quit the body, but in reality, when one has to put that knowledge into practice, that is a different thing altogether. Application of the knowledge, that is called realization.

That realization is not very easy. Of course, the knowledge also is quite difficult to understand, but even if the knowledge is quite difficult to understand, even if somebody somehow acquires that knowledge and gets an understanding, to apply that knowledge, that is only possible by blessings, mercy of great liberated personalities, of great souls, great devotees, great tapasvis, of the Supreme Lord Himself. The mercy is required, and that mercy one has to actually get by submission, by service, by humility. So here the description is given that all the great sages glorified Lord Sri Krishna, who was present there, by confidential Vedic hymns, then all of them returned to their respective hermitages, bearing always Lord Krishna within their hearts.

**Key Quote:** "the devotees of the Lord are always in the heart of the Lord and the Lord is always in the hearts of the devotees"
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's commentary on the verse, highlighting the reciprocal relationship between the Lord and his devotees, where each resides within the other's heart.

This is the description of this verse. So Srila Prabhupada explains, the devotees of the Lord are always in the heart of the Lord, and the Lord is always in the hearts of the devotees. It is described in this verse that the sages who had assembled, they went back to their home always remembering, always bearing Lord Krishna within their hearts. This is the perfection of life, that one is able to constantly think of Krishna, or one is able to constantly remember Krishna, one is able to constantly chant the holy name of the Supreme Lord Krishna. That way they can remain Krishna conscious. Whenever death comes, they are ready to quit the body. That is the practice actually which Krishna himself recommends in the Bhagavad Gita: tasmat sarveshu kaaleshu maa manu smara yudhya ca. So in the Bhagavatam this is described: sadhavo hrudayam mahyam sadhunam hrudayam tu aham maranya tena jananti naaham tebhyo managapi. This means the pure devotee is always within the core of my heart. This is a statement spoken by Lord Vishnu to Durvasamuni. So Vishnu is telling, Supreme Lord Vishnu is telling, the pure devotee is always within the core of my heart, and I am always in the heart of my pure devotee. See, it is reciprocal. Vishnu or Krishna carries always the memory of the pure devotee within his heart, and a pure devotee always carries Vishnu or Krishna within his heart, always, always. So in this way Vishnu is telling, my devotees do not know anything else but me, and I do not know anyone else but them. See, this is the sweet relationship between the Lord and his devotees.

**Summary:** The speaker describes how the Lord is always anxious to guide his devotees on the right path and provides special protection to those engaged in pure devotional service.

Prabhupada said this is a sweet relationship due to unalloyed love and devotion for the Lord. The devotees always see the Lord within themselves, and although the Lord has nothing to do and nothing to aspire for, he is perfect and complete in himself, still he is always busy in attending to the welfare of his devotees. So for the ordinary living people, for the ordinary living beings, the laws of nature is there for all actions and reactions, but the Lord is always anxious to put his devotees on the right path. If somebody is taken to pure devotional service, then in the stage of practice of pure devotional service, sometimes devotees may slip away from the actual path, then Krishna is always watching, guarding, protecting, so he will put back the devotee who is on the pure devotional path back on track. That is a special protection personally given by Krishna to his devotees who are on the path of pure devotional service.

**Key Quote:** "the devotees meaning the pure devotees or those on the path of pure devotional service therefore are under the direct care of the Lord"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the protection offered to devotees with the lack of such protection for those practicing Jnana, Ashtanga Yoga, or Karma Yoga, and explains how the Lord engages in pastimes to show his care for devotees.

This particular protection is only for those who are on the path of pure devotional service. It is not there for those practicing the process of Jnana, process of Ashtanga Yoga, process of Karma Yoga. For them this specific protection is not there personally by the Lord. That protection is not there. So Prabhupada says the devotees, meaning the pure devotees or those on the path of pure devotional service, therefore are under the direct care of the Lord, and the Lord also voluntarily puts himself under the care of his devotees. Only this is the pastime of the Lord. This is the Leela, Krishna Leela, Vishnu Leela. What is that? The Lord appears in this world as a son of his pure devotee, or he appears as an associate of another pure devotee. So that way also the Lord, even though he is completely independent, still he puts himself under the care of his devotees. So all the sages headed by Vyasadeva were devotees of the Lord. This is very important. A sage reaches perfection when he becomes a devotee of the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "a sage reaches perfection when he becomes a devotee of the Lord"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that sages reach perfection by becoming devotees of the Lord, and that all Vedic literature is meant for understanding Krishna.

So by this statement we understand those who are impersonalist sages, they are not exactly perfect in their spiritual life. They have not yet reached perfection of the spiritual life. They are yet to reach perfection because they have not yet taken to the pure devotional service of Krishna, but Vyasadeva, he himself of course is the incarnation of Supreme Lord, but he appears as a sage, and he is conducting himself exactly as a pure devotee, and not only Vyasadeva, the other sages whose names have been mentioned earlier, they were all devotees of the Lord. Therefore, they chanted the Vedic hymns after the funeral ceremony just to please the Lord who is present there personally. Now why did they chant the Vedic hymns? So Prabhupada explains all the Vedic hymns are chanted to please Lord Krishna. All the Vedas, this is confirmed in the Bhagavad Gita in the 15th chapter, 15 verse. Krishna says, vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyo. What is the meaning of this? All the Vedic literature is meant for understanding me. Who is telling this? Krishna. So all the Vedic literature is meant for understanding Krishna, knowing Krishna, and Prabhupada also says all the Vedas, Upanishads, Vedanta are seeking Krishna only, and all Vedas and all hymns, Vedic hymns are for glorifying Krishna only.

**Key Quote:** "only Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is explained, only He is glorified"
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Chaitanya Charitamrita to explain that all Vedic literature glorifies Hari (Krishna), and describes how the sages participated in Bhishma's funeral rituals.

In the Chaitanya Charita Amrita this is explained: VEDE RAMAYANE CHAIVA PURANE BHARATE TATHA ADHAV ANTE CHA MADHYA CHA HARI SARVATRA GIYATE. The meaning of this verse is: In the Vedic literature including the Ramayana, Puranas, and Mahabharata, from the very beginning, ADHAV, to the end, ANTE CHA, as well as in the middle, MADHYA CHA, only HARI, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is explained. HARI SARVATRA GIYATE, only He is glorified, only He is explained, that's all. Therefore, the sages performed the exact activities suitable for the purpose of that occasion. Bhishma quitted his body in perfect Krishna consciousness. The sages who were assembled there, they participated in that funeral rituals, funeral ceremony of Bhishma Deva, great personality, and after that, before leaving for their own hermitages, they glorified Krishna, and how did they glorify Krishna? By reciting the Vedic hymns. Different sages are experts in different portions of the Vedas, and that's how Vyasa Deva, he divided the one Veda into four, and he entrusted each division of the Veda to different sages who are all his disciples and followers.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how the sages chanted Vedic hymns from different Vedas, Puranas, and Itihasas to glorify Krishna, and how they happily departed after witnessing Bhishma's perfect departure.

So whoever was expert in Rig Veda, they chanted the Vedic Rig Veda hymns. Somebody else was expert in Yajur Veda, they chanted the Yajur Veda hymns. Like this, these sages chanted the Vedic hymns to glorify Krishna who was personally present when Bhishma Deva was about to quit his body. That was Krishna's mercy on Bhishma Deva. So the sages, they were all chanting from their Vedic, the Vedic hymns from the different Vedas, and the Puranas and Itihasas. There are 18 Mahapuranas, 18 Upapuranas, and there are also the Itihasas, especially the Ramayana and Mahabharata. All these are meant for glorification of Krishna. They are called the 5th Veda, Panchama Veda Ucyate. Itihasa Purananam Panchama Veda Ucyate, the statement like this in the Chandogya Upanishad, as well as in the Bhagavatam is described, the 5th Veda. So even the experts in the Puranas and Itihasas, they also chanted verses from the Puranas and Itihasas glorifying Krishna. So that is the way they happily departed for their respective hermitages after glorifying Krishna and witnessing the greatest personality of their time, Bhishma Deva, quit his body in perfection thinking of Krishna in Krishna Consciousness.

she was an ascetic. So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari, the father and the mother of Duryodhana and his brothers, were the elder uncle and aunt of Maharaj Yudhishthira. After the battle of Kurukshetra, the celebrated couple, having lost all their sons and grandsons, were under the care of Maharaj Yudhishthira. What happened in the battle of Kurukshetra? All the 100 sons of Dhritarashtra and Gandhari, they were killed in the battle, and even the grandsons. Everyone was killed from Dhritarashtra's side, Kaurava side. Dhritarashtra was very, very confident that his sons will win the battle because they had the best support, but Dhritarashtra, being materialistic, he made a miscalculation, he did not stop the war. So, consider Krishna, even though he was not fighting, actually, he had not taken up any weapons in the battle, he was on the side of the Pandavas.

Yes, Jayastu Pandu Putranam, Esham Pakshe Janardana, whosoever side Krishna is, that side ultimately is going to win.

So, Sanjaya concludes, Yatra Yogeshwara Krishna, Yatra Partho Dhanurdhara, Tatra Shri Vijayo, Bhutir Dhruva, Neetir Matir Mama. Wherever there is Krishna and wherever there is Arjuna, his pure devotee, there, there is certainly victory. So, even before the battle began, Sanjaya predicted and announced to Dhritarashtra that don't expect victory for the Kauravas because Krishna and Arjuna, Krishna and his pure devotee, of course, all the Pandavas are pure devotees, but still, wherever there is Krishna and Arjuna, there, there is victory.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the futility of material calculations, the limited free will of living entities, and the immense power of Krishna.

Pandavas are guaranteed to win. So, all of the material calculations, ultimately, are a failure. Everything actually happens even in the material world, according to the plan of the Supreme Lord, according to the will of Govinda. That's how everything actually is happening, is going on. Though Krishna never takes away the free will of the living entities, he never takes away the free will, but the living entities are very, very, very, very, very tiny. They are insignificant parts of the Supreme Lord, who is unlimitedly powerful. And we have some power, some strength, some knowledge, some ability. We are very, very, very, very, very, very tiny, insignificant, atomic, we are atomic, and Krishna is the complete whole, the total manifestation of the material, spiritual, everything. So, there is no comparison. It is foolish to think that... To think that, I can become God, I can compete with God, Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of humility in the presence of Krishna and contrasts it with the foolishness of trying to compete with God, also discussing the materialist's view of family and legacy.

That is utterly foolish, utterly foolish. So, therefore, only devotees have this sense that, what am I in comparison to Krishna? So, our devotees' humility is very... Reasonable and natural, and it is very meaningful, to take a humble position in presence of Krishna, and always remain so, because eternally that is our position. So, here the explanation is being given that, what is the situation of Dhritarashtra and Gandhari after the battle of Kurukshetra? They lost all... All their sons and grandsons. So, they were passing their days in great agony over such a heavy loss of life, and were practically living the life of ascetics. What did they have to aspire for further in their life? Even materially speaking. Of course, from a spiritual perspective, success in this life, whatever we may do, is if we become Krishna conscious, and put our body in Krishna consciousness, but for materialists they make calculations, I will live my life in such a way that I enjoy my the prime of my youth, and when I become old then my family members, my descendants will take over and they will enjoy life in this material world, power or

wealth or some fame etc., all these things, but that is never to happen, that is never to happen. Everyone meets with defeat, though everyone means all those who are materialistic, they meet with defeat in every step of their life in this material world because Maya is very, very powerful. We are very powerful, we are very powerful, we are very powerful, we are very powerful, we are very powerful, are on the clutches of Maya. Dhritarashtra was similarly in the clutches of Maya, making calculation, oh, somehow let me try to kill the fatherless sons of Pandu, and once the pond, the five Pandavas are killed, then my sons will take over from me. I am the caretaker King, but they will take over and become regular King,

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Krishna's compassion for all living beings and highlights Gandhari's spiritual advancement and asceticism, particularly her faithfulness to her blind husband.

who may be rebellious, who may be envious, who may be not following the principles of Dharma, but still the Lord is always looking upon every living being as his own child, a father looks upon his child same way because Krishna is the supreme father of every living being and Krishna naturally will have concern for the rebellious conditioned suffering souls of this world and Dhritarashtra is one of them like all other suffering souls of this world.

Now, regarding Gandhari, there's a particular mention here, Gandhari was a powerful and powerful woman, who was a powerful woman, who was a powerful woman, who was a powerful woman, who was a powerful woman, who was an ascetic, although she was living the life of a faithful wife and a kind mother. Gandhari, she was not like Dhritarashtra, materialistic, she was very, very, very advanced spiritually. The pravapada says she was on the level of Bhishma as regards Brahmapurias spiritual attainment because she was a very faithful wife of her husband Dhritarashtra. It is said that Gandhari also voluntarily closed her eyes because of the blindness of her husband when she came to know that I am going to get married to a blind King, before her marriage she voluntarily agreed to remain blind whole life voluntarily her eyesight was perfect but she voluntarily agreed to close her eyes whole life because of the blindness of her husband a wife's duty is to follow the husband cent percent and Gandhari was so true to her husband that she followed him even his perpetual blindness in the entire life she followed him.

you know, therefore interaction she was a great ascetic, tapas win increased Tapaswini described here particularly well described here besides this austere T here undertaken the shock she suffered because the wholesale killing of her 100 sons and grandsons also a searchance a whole jam killing of her 100 sons and grandsons also a searchance a whole jam same aggressive really to stop iPads beatings to your mother so she couldn't certainly too much for a woman. They are soft hearted. They are very, very soft in their heart. So Gandhari was very much aggrieved on the loss of all her sons, all her sons. But she suffered all this just like an ascetic, tapasvini. That means she tolerated the suffering, the grief. She tolerated the grief. So Gandhari, although she was a woman, she is no less than Bhishma Deva in character, perfect character. She did all her duties exactly according to the scriptural directions. She was a faithful wife. She was a kind mother. But she knew that her policy was always that Dhritarashtra should not cheat the Pandavas.

That was Gandhari's policy.

This is the great responsibility of the king in the Vedic culture as given in the scriptures.

**Key Quote:** "The responsibility is there for the king towards his citizens ensure the upliftment of the citizens ultimately the citizens have to become Attraction liberated by practicing spiritual life becoming responsible to understand the great opportunity as a human being this is the responsibility"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Rajadharma, the science of kingship, and the king's duty to lead citizens towards spiritual liberation from birth, death, disease, and old age.

Rajadharma, which describes the duties of the Raja or the king, what are the duties of a king, so Prabhupada says Rajadharma is a great science. Elsewhere he describes this, unlike modern diplomacy for political supremacy, being a king or an emperor is actually based on following the science of Rajadharma as given in the Dharma Shastras. The kings were trained systematically to become munificent and not merely be tax collectors, not that I am the king and I enjoy power, wealth, and a nice army and then simply lord over everyone else and try to, you know, suppress any rebellion, quell any uprising. So, this is not the way to rule the kingdom. The responsibility is there for the king towards his citizens to ensure the upliftment of the citizens. Ultimately the citizens have to become liberated by practicing spiritual life, becoming responsible to understand the great opportunity as a human being. This is the responsibility of the king. The kings were trained to perform different sacrifices only for the prosperity of the subjects, only for the prosperity of the citizens. The king was to lead the prajas to the attainment of salvation. That was the great duty of the king. So, Prabhupada says the father, the spiritual master, and the king are all natural leaders of their respective dependents and they are not to become irresponsible in the matter of leading their subjects to the path of ultimate liberation from birth, death, disease, and old age. This is the responsibility whether somebody is a father or somebody is a spiritual master or somebody is a king. Father has got responsibility towards his children and the spiritual master has got responsibility towards his disciples and the king has got responsibility towards the citizens.

You, whom is ruling, so they have to liberate ultimately their dependents from birth, death, diseases, and old age. This is the prerogative of the human being. When you got a human form of life, you are meant to prepare yourself to attain ultimate liberation from these four fundamental miseries which is there throughout the entire material creation. So, Krishna instructs in the Bhagavad-Gita these are four fundamental miseries and one should aim how to get out by cultivating Krishna consciousness under the able guidance, leadership, direction of these superiors.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Vedic kingship with modern administration, criticizing the lack of training and the focus on taxation rather than the welfare of citizens.

In modern days, Prabhupada says, as opposed to what was actually the Vedic culture, modern days the people in general occupy the administration by the strength of manipulated votes, but they are never trained in the primary duties of the king and everyone cannot be trained unless they have some basic qualification. Under the circumstances, the untrained administrators play havoc to make the subjects happy in all respects. They try somehow to make people happy, but it is not going to happen unless they are trained how to ensure happiness of the citizens under all circumstances. So, these modern day administrators, they increase the tax to finance a top heavy administration that is useless for all purposes. They don't do the real duties of an administrator or a king or a government leader or government head. They don't perform their duties.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the role of qualified Brahmanas in guiding kings according to Dharma Shastras like Manu Samhita and the qualities of pious kings.

In the Vedic times or the Vedic culture, Vedic civilization, the qualified brahmanas are meant to give direction to the kings for proper administration in terms of the scriptures like Manu Samhita and the dharma shastras of Parashara, Parashara Smriti. They describe exactly how the king should rule and the king is given instructions and directions according to the codes given in the Manu Samhita and other dharma shastras. So, the brahmanas are well-versed in the dharma shastra, they are well-versed in these scriptures and they give correct advice, correct guidance to the kings. If the king is pious, religious, chivalrous, and munificent, the citizens generally will follow him. It's natural. Such a king is never a lazy, sensuous person living at the cost of the subjects, but he is always alert to kill thieves and decoys in the kingdom to protect the weaker sections of the society. The kings, the pious kings in the former days were not merciful to decoys and thieves in the name of nonsensical ahimsa.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that kings should not be foolishly non-violent when dealing with criminals and gives an example of strict punishment in Kashmir.

It's like modern-day politicians, they say non-violence. No, they should remain silent, never be non-violent when it comes to punishing thieves and decoys. They should never show non-violence principles. Now, the thieves and decoys were punished in an exemplary way so that in future no one would dare commit such nuisance in an organized form. That was the way. Prabhupada says even about 150 years ago in Kashmir, the ruling king was so very strict in punishing the thieves that if somebody dropped, let's say, a gold coin on the way, that gold coin would lie on the street till the actual owner who has lost it comes and picks it up. Nobody else would dare touch that because it's not theirs. The king would punish those who would steal or take somebody else's wealth in such a way that if somebody was caught stealing, their fingers would be cut off. So, this is the way to rule that there will be no nuisance of these thieves, rogues, plunderers, and anti-socials.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the king's duty to help citizens attain liberation and mentions Krishna's teachings in the Bhagavad Gita.

So, Prabhupada says in the purport, the king must know that the human form of life is meant for liberating the trapped soul from the bondage of material conditions. Therefore, the king's duty is to see that the citizens are properly looked after to attain the highest stage of perfection. The king has got a goal, he's got a target, how the citizens can get out of this material bondage. King Yudhishthira followed these principles strictly as will be explained in the next chapter. Not only did he follow the principles but he got approval also from his old uncle who was experienced in political affairs and it was also confirmed by Lord Shri Krishna, the speaker of the philosophy of Bhagavad Gita. See, Krishna spoke Bhagavad Gita first to Sun God because they are to rule in accordance with the teachings of Bhagavad Gita. That's why Krishna spoke to Sun God. Later he spoke to Arjuna, was also a Kshatriya, rulers. Maharaja Yudhishthira is the ideal monarch and monarchy under a trained king like Maharaja Yudhishthira is by far the most superior form of government.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts monarchy under a trained Kshatriya with modern democracy, arguing that unqualified voters in Kali Yuga cannot elect responsible leaders, and concludes the lecture.

Superior to modern republics or governments of the people by the people. Nowadays people are very proud that we have got what is called as democracy. But in democracy, the defect is that the mass of people who elect their leaders or their rulers, they are, especially in the Kali Yuga, they are basically low born, they are ill trained, they are unfortunate and badly associated. This is described in the Bhagavatam. In Kali Yuga people are disqualified in so many ways. So, they themselves do not know the highest perfectional aim of life, therefore votes cast by them actually have no value. And persons elected by such illiterate people, irresponsible votes, cannot be, people elected by such irresponsible votes cannot be responsible representatives like Maharaja Yudhishthira. So, the conclusion is a trained Kshatriya who can rule according to the codes of Dharmashastra is far, far superior than an elected government by the people who do not have the qualification to select a proper government leader. So, I will stop here. Thank you very much.

In this session, we will be discussing from the fifth verse of the ninth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavata: Tatra Brahmarsaya Sarve Devar Shayascha Sattama Rajar Shayascha Tatrasan Drashtum Bharata Pungavam. The meaning of this verse is, just to see the chief of the descendants of King Bharata, all the great souls in the universe, namely the rishis amongst the demigods, brahmanas, and kings, all situated in the quality of goodness, were assembled there. So the background is that the Pandavas, headed by Yudhishthira, along with Krishna, have gone to the scene of the battle of Kurukshetra, and there they have gone to see Bhishma, who is lying on a bed of arrows, and not only the Pandavas, but even all the great souls in the universe. So there was interplanetary travel in those days, and great souls like rishis, all varieties of rishis, Devarishi, rishi among the demigods, Brahmarshi, rishi among the brahmanas, Rajarshi, Rishi among the kings, all of them who are situated in the quality of goodness, Sattva guna, they came to see Bhishma because Bhishma was such a great personality.

**Key Quote:** "The rishis are those who attain perfection by spiritual achievements that means they practice spiritual life and by advancement in spiritual life they are able to attain certain types of perfections"
**Summary:** The lecture discusses the difference between material and spiritual perfections, highlighting the achievements of rishis through spiritual practice and detachment.

explains the rishis are those who have attained perfection by spiritual achievements. There are both material and spiritual methods of attaining different kinds of perfection. This, like my practice of Ashtanga Yoga, one can get what is called Ashta Siddhi, eight kinds of material perfection. One can become very small, one can grow very big, one can become very light, or one can become very heavy, or one may manufacture a planet, one may extend one's subtle hand thousands of miles away and pick up something from a very, very distant place. Like that, different material achievements are possible by practice of Ashtanga Yoga. But the rishis are those who attain perfection by spiritual achievements. That means they practice spiritual life, and by advancement in spiritual life, they are able to attain certain types of perfections, like becoming enlightened in transcendental knowledge, acquiring some powers by which they freely travel from one planet to another planet without any machine, without the help of any aircraft. Like this, the rishis have so many types of perfection. Now Srila Prabhupada says here, such spiritual achievements can be earned by all, whether one is a king or a mendicant. Mendicant means a beggar. So spiritualists keep themselves in a politics taken condition because they don't want to be carried away by wealth, they don't want to become greedy, they don't want to become opulent. So they keep themselves in a very but is taken condition, but they are very humble, they're very simple, they are very straightforward, they work for the welfare of all the people in general in this world. So such rishis are those who have spiritual achievements, and it is possible for anyone to practice this, practice spiritual life, make advancement, and obtain some or all of these spiritual perfections.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Bhishma's status as a brahmarshi and the importance of the quality of goodness (sattva guna).

even material perfection. So further, Srila Prabhupada says, Bhishma Deva himself was also one of the brahmarshis and the chief of the descendants of king Bharata. That means Bhishma Deva, he first attained brahmanical status. That means he engaged in activities by which he became learned, he became self-controlled, he became peaceful, he became a tapasvi, he became very tolerant, he acquired all those qualities by practicing brahmacharya, and then he also became the rishi, brahmarshi, that is one who has achieved some perfection by spiritual advancement. So that is Bhishma Deva's position as a brahmarshi. So to see this brahmarshi, not only because he was a brahmarshi, but because he was the greatest among the uh his transcendentalists of his time, because of his devotion to Krishna, he was among the greatest of transcendentalists. So all great souls came to see that now Bhishma is going to quit his body, how is he going to quit? Srila Prabhupada further clarifies, all rishis are situated in the quality of goodness. In this material world, there are three qualities that are working: goodness, passion, ignorance, or sattva guna, rajoguna, and tamoguna. Of these three qualities, goodness or sattva guna is the best.

**Summary:** The lecture begins to explain about Parvatamuni and his association with Narada, highlighting their ability to travel without material vehicles through yogic siddhis.

So, so many sages assembled there in order to see the passing away of a great soul. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada has explained about some of the sages. He begins by explaining the sage Parvatamuni. He says, Parvatamuni is considered to be one of the oldest sages. He is almost always a constant companion of Naradamuni. Naradamuni and Parvatamuni always travel together, generally. They are also spacemen competent to travel in the air without the help of any material vehicle. So, this science is unknown to the modern man, but about 50 years back, let us say there used to be yogis who would travel from one place to another without the help of a machine. Yogis can travel through the Ganga river. Let us say they are in Haridwar and they want to come to Prayag. So, they take a dip in the Ganga in Haridwar and they come out of the Ganga in Prayag. So, this is a Siddhi, a perfection. And those who are very strict Ashtanga Yogis, when they perfect their Ashtanga Yoga meditation, they are able to actually utilize the Siddhis for their travel. So, one of the Siddhis is they travel through the Ganga river. And so, they travel through a ray of sun. They travel without a machine by simply deciding to go from one place to another. So, like this both Parvatamuni and Naradamuni are able to travel without the help of any material vehicle.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Parvatamuni and Narada's presence at Janamejaya's snake sacrifice and the reasons behind it.

Parvatamuni is also a Devashi or a great sage amongst the Demigods like Narada. Narada is also a devarshi. So it is described here, Parvata Muni was present along with Narada at the sacrificial ceremony of Maharaj Janmejaya, a son of Maharaj Parikshit. After Parikshit, Janmejaya took charge of ruling the world, and Janmejaya once decided to perform a sacrifice, a big sacrifice for which he invited Narada as well as Parvata Muni. In this sacrifice, all the snakes of the world were to be killed. Janmejaya was angry that his father was killed by a snake bird, so he decided to kill all the snakes of the world, but this sacrifice was stopped by uh some mature sages instructing this Janmejaya, don't annihilate the entire race of snakes. No, that is not proper just because one snake somehow bit your father and your father died, it does not mean that you kill all other snakes. So on the advice of the saintly persons, he stopped the sacrifice.

**Summary:** The lecture continues describing Parvatamuni and Narada as Gandharvas, their ability to travel in the air, and their visits to the assemblies of Indra and Kuvera.

So Parvata Muni and Narada Muni are called gandharvas also because they can travel in the air singing the glories of the Lord. Devotees generally sing the glories of the Lord everywhere. So Parvata Muni, Narada Muni, while they are traveling, they are also singing the glories of the Supreme Lord Krishna. So yeah, okay. Since they can travel in the air, they observe Draupadi's Swayamvara ceremony from the air. They didn't have to land on the earth, no. From the air itself, they saw the ceremony, marriage ceremony of Draupadi. It's actually called the Swayamvara ceremony where she selects her own husband. Like Narada Muni, Parvatha Muni used to visit the royal assembly in the heaven of King Indra. So Indra receives great saintly persons and he takes advice from them. So both Parvatha Muni and Narada Muni were regularly visiting Indra. As a Gandharva, sometimes he visited the royal assembly. In the royal assembly of Kuvera, one of the important demigods. Kuvera is the treasurer of the demigods and Kuvera has got a very important position. So the... , Kuvera's assembly, sometimes both of them used to visit. So this is the brief description of Parvatha Muni. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

Now the sage bradashwa is being described by the sages as an introduction to the top in the purport, an ancient sage who used to meet maharan yudhishthiram now and then. In the vedic times, kings who were ruling would receive saintly persons very respectfully and would worship them, inquire from them, hear from them, and take their blessings to rule the kingdom according to the religious principles.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the sage Bradashwa's visits to Yudhishthira and the importance of hearing stories of great personalities for inspiration and guidance, especially during times of exile.

So bradashwa, a great sage, used to visit maharan yudhishthiram now and then. First of all, he met king, this sage narrated the history of maharaj. When yudhishthira and the pandavas were in exile, they were always accompanied by some sages, and the sages used to give association by narrating ancient histories of great personalities. Simply by hearing, they would be able to understand the history of maharaj, and they would be able to actually get inspiration, get the courage to spend their time in the proper manner. Otherwise, what will they do in the forest? They are all kings, they are all chakras. So for a kshatriya to live in the forest and spend time for the past 13 years, the pandavas had to be in exile. So how they spend their time? So the process of bhakti is such that one engages in hearing, chanting, and other such devotional practices in the association of great saintly persons, great devotees, great sages, great rishis like that.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Maharaj Nara, emphasizing his devotion and success despite difficulties, and connects it to the importance of self-realization to escape the miseries of the material world.

So, this sage narrated the history of Maharaj Nara. Nara was another king who lived in an earlier time than the time of the Pandavas, and Nara also underwent a lot of difficulties. But because of his being very much devoted to following religious principles, he was able to actually come out successful, even though he was facing a lot of difficulties. The material world is declared to be a place filled with so many difficulties. That's the nature of this material world. So, if we are fixed on the goal of self-realization, because of which we become qualified to go to the spiritual world at the end of this life, then we don't have to anymore face these miseries or difficulties by taking birth again and again in this place, which is declared to be a place filled with miseries. So, by spending time hearing from saintly persons about great personalities of the past, how they led their life in an ideal way, following the religious principles, taking association from saintly persons, and not losing their focus on the ultimate goal in spite of difficult circumstances. That is what we have to learn from Nara.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Bharadwaja Muni, one of the seven great rishis, and his association with Arjuna's birth, highlighting the importance of austerity in the mode of goodness for spiritual advancement.

That is what we have to learn from these historical narrations. Then Bharadwaja, he is one of the great seven rishis, saptarishis, and was present at the time of the birth ceremony of Arjuna. The powerful rishi sometimes undertook severe penances on the shore of the Ganges, and his ashrama is still celebrated Prayamdhama. The Bhagavatam says, becoming man after acquired power and terrorizing the whole universe, no, not that kind of austerity. That is austerity in the mode of ignorance. We should practice austerity in the moment goodness. Goodness means the ultimate goal of all such austerities or any sacrifices or any other spiritual practices simply for the sake of spiritual advancement by which our existence becomes purified of all material contamination, making us eligible to actually elevate ourselves to the spiritual platform to go back.

**Summary:** The speaker continues describing Bharadwaja, mentioning the unusual birth of his son Dhona and Bharadwaja's desire for peace during the Kurukshetra war.

It is learned that this rishi, while taking bath in the Ganges, happened to meet one of the beautiful society girls of heaven, and thus the discharge semen, which is kept and preserved in an urban pot and from which dhona was born. These are all extraordinary events in the lives of great sages, that in spite of not combining with this society girl so that the rishi could conceive his son in her womb, his semen was kept in a pot from which dhona was born. So dhronacharya is the son of bharadvaja muni. Marshi bharadvaja was a great devotee of dhronacharya, and he was a great devotee of brahma. Once he approached dhronacharya and requested him to stop the battle of kurut ship. Now, ultimately people want peace. They don't want to be engaged in fighting and battle and war. So in that sense, these are all great personalities who are situated in the mode of goodness.

So naturally, they strive for peace. Next is the description of parashurama. He is also called as renuka sutta. Why? Because he is the son of maharshi javadadmi and srimati renuka.

Parashurama instructed the dhanu veda on the science of fighting to dronacharya, who was a brahmana.

Bhishma refused to obey his order, although he was one of the spiritual masters of bhishma deva. Parashurama was a spiritual master, a teacher of bhishma deva. Parashurama fought with bhishma when bhishma neglected his warning. Both of them fought very severely, and at last, parashurama was pleased with bhishma and gave him the divine blessing.

**Summary:** Description of Shukadeva Goswami's travels and attainment of the transcendental realm, followed by an explanation of the Prajapatis' power to generate different species.

Shukadeva Goswami went to the sun planet, with the permission of his father and Narayanji. Descriptions of his travel and space are given in the Shanti Parva of the Mahabharata. Mahabharata is generally understood as containing the narration of the Pandavas and Kauravas, but it contains much much more than that. It is the history of Greater India, Mahabharata. At last, Shukadeva Goswami attained the transcendental realm. He is known by different names, like Araneya, Aranesuta, Vyasaki, and Asatmaja. These are some of the other names of Shukadeva Goswami. Next, Srila Prabhupada describes Tashya Pamuni, one of the Prajapati, the son of Marichi, and one of the sons-in-law of Prajapati Daksha. Kashyapa Pamuni married many daughters of Daksha. Kashyapa Pamuni is the father of the gigantic bird Garuda, who was given elephants and tortoise as eatables. Garuda is the son of Kashyapa Pamuni. Now, how is it possible that a bird can be the son of a Rishi, Kashyapa Pamuni? This is the power of the Prajapatis at the time of the beginning of the creation, at the time of the beginning of the creation of this Universe. Brahma takes birth from Vishnu, Garbhodakshayi Vishnu, and Brahma is empowered to create the Prajapatis. So when the Prajapatis have to further increase the population in different species, they are empowered to generate the different species.

So it's only by being empowered specifically to generate a specific species that the Prajapatis can give birth, can generate different species of living beings. Kashyapa Pamuni married thirteen daughters of Prajapati Daksha and their names are given in the Bhagavad Gita: Aditi, Diti, Dhanu, Kashtha, Arishta, Surasa, Ila, Muni, Prothashwa, Tamra, Surabhi, Sarama, and Kini. He begot many children, both demigods and demons by those wives. Generally the sons of Aditi are called Adityas and the sons of Diti are called Daityas. Daityas are generally demons and Adityas are demigods. From his first wife Aditi all the twelve Adityas were born and one of the Adityas is Vamana, the incarnation of God. This great sage Kashyapa was also presented at the time of Arjuna's birth. Now Arjuna's birth is extraordinary, it's not ordinary because Arjuna is the constant companion of Krishna. So when Krishna appeared as the sage Narayana, Arjuna appeared as his twin brother Nara, Nararishi. So Nara Narayana Rishi are twins,

So they are teaching by their example, Nara Narayana Rishi. So like this, Arjuna's birth is not ordinary. He is a great, he is a pure devotee of Krishna and he participates in Krishna's pastimes on this earth planet, in this material world. Kashyapa Muni received a presentation of the whole world from Parashurama and later on he asked Parashurama to go out of the world. The sinking persons are completely detached. They are not attached to anything. So they teach by their exemplary behaviour how they are completely detached.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the context of the verse, describing Bhishma Deva's impending departure from the body in the presence of Krishna and the assembled Rishis.

So the background for this verse is Bhishma is above the Buddhist body and the Pandavas have come to meet Bhishma Deva to receive instructions from him, especially Yudhishthira, and Krishna has also accompanied the Pandavas, and all the great Rishis from all over the world, all over the universe, they have arrived there. Why? Because a great soul is going to quit his body. Bhishma Deva is one of the twelve Mahajanas, so this quitting the body in the right consciousness is the perfection of one's life. This is what Lord Krishna describes in the Bhagavad Gita: Antakaale Chamam eva Smaran Muktva Kalevaram Yaprayati Samadbhavam Yati Nargajya Samushayaham. Krishna says, "Whoever quits his body remembering me alone attains to my nature." And we will see in this chapter of Bhagavatam, Bhishma Deva is going to quit his body thinking of Krishna, glorifying Krishna, and it is Bhishma's good fortune that Krishna is right in front of him. But still, Bhishma Deva received all the great sages who had come at that time, so he received and welcomed all the great and powerful Rishis because he knew perfectly the religious principles according to time and place.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the third part, expert religionists know perfectly well how to adjust religious principles in terms of time and place. According to time and place some adjustments have to be made. The religious principles are given very elaborately in the dharma shastras, but some adjustment has to be made according to time and place, and Bhishma Deva knew all the principles and therefore he is able to properly receive the great and powerful rishis. Srila Prabhupada says all the great acharyas or religious preachers or reformers of the world executed their mission by adjustment of religious principles in terms of time and place. Just like Srila Prabhupada himself, he went to the western countries and introduced Krishna consciousness among those who are not very familiar with the very culture, though he did not change any essential fundamental principle, but he adapted according to the time and place circumstances. So the acharyas know how to make adjustment of religious principles in terms of time and place. Even in the past Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, all of them made adjustment of religious principles according to time and place. There are different climates and situations in different parts of the world, and if one has to discharge his duties to preach the message of the Lord, he must be expert in adjusting things in terms of time and place.

So Srila Prabhupada has taught us the most essential principles which are absolutely required to make advancement in Krishna Consciousness without spending too much time in preliminaries. Just like we have to maintain cleanliness, external and internal cleanliness, before we do Deity worship, so Prabhupada explained this, that you maintain cleanliness externally by taking bath, wearing fresh clothes, keeping your surroundings clean, and internal cleanliness by chanting Hare Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the purifying power of chanting Hare Krishna and how Srila Prabhupada simplified the process of spiritual advancement, enabling devotees to return to Godhead.

The scriptures say apavitra pavitrova sarvavasthanga topiva yasvare kundari kaksham sabhajya abhyantara suji. One becomes completely purified externally and internally by simply remembering the lotus side supreme god. So how do we remember the lotus side supreme god? By chanting Hare Krishna. So Srila Prabhupada taught us to chant Hare Krishna and thereby purify ourselves and be fit for serving Krishna, for doing Deity worship. Like this Prabhupada has given the essential principles so that we can execute, follow those principles and achieve the purpose of properly practicing the religious principles to make advancement in Krishna consciousness, to achieve perfection of purifying ourselves completely of all material contamination and going back to god.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates Bhishma Deva's position as one of the twelve Mahajanas, emphasizing his knowledge of religious principles and his ability to welcome the assembled sages.

It is said here Bhishma Deva, he is one of the twelve great authorities, mahajanas: twelve mahajanas svayambhu narada shambhu kumaran kapilao manubhu praladha janaka bheeshma valir vayasakhi vayam. This verse in the sixth canton of the Bhagavatam is spoken by Yamaraj. Yamarajis describe the twelve mahajanas. Yamaraj is one of them. Bhishma Deva is also one of the twelve mahajanas, so he perfectly knew all the religious principles and he could make adjustments according to time and place, so therefore he could receive and welcome all the powerful sages assembled there at his death bed from all parts of the universe.

**Key Quote:** "Bhishma Deva as a pure devotee he need not choose an auspicious time for quitting the body neither he has to choose an auspicious place because he is a pure devotee he is guaranteed to go back to Godhead"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Bhishma Deva's benediction to choose the time of his death and contrasts the importance of auspicious timing for non-devotees versus the guaranteed liberation of devotees regardless of time or place of death.

He had a benediction from his father that he could quit the body whenever he desired to by choosing an auspicious moment. That's the sense in which that particular benediction was used because in the eighth chapter of the Bhagavatam Bhishma describes different auspicious and inauspicious times which are applicable for quitting the body. If somebody quits the body at an auspicious time they are able to get out of this material existence and get liberation beyond this material existence. If they quit at an inauspicious time then they cannot go out of this material world letting rebirth again, but that is only applicable to non-devotees. Why? Because devotees whenever they quit their body it doesn't matter because they are Krishna conscious. Whenever they quit their body they are definitely going back to Godhead, they are getting ultimate liberation whenever they quit their body wherever they quit their body it doesn't matter time and place.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing that Bhishma Deva, despite being a pure devotee, waited for an auspicious moment to depart, setting an example for others, and ultimately achieved liberation by focusing on Krishna at the time of death.

So Bhishma Deva as a pure devotee he need not choose an auspicious time for quitting the body, neither he has to choose an auspicious place because he is a pure devotee, he is guaranteed to go back to Godhead, he is already liberated because he is a pure devotee, but still in order to teach others because he was an expert yogi, so he was waiting for the most auspicious moment to quit his body and the great sages knew that Bhishma is an authority in Dharma so they all assembled to witness Bhishma quitting his body at the most auspicious time, Uttarayana Punyakala. But Bhagavatam also describes in this very chapter that Bhishma Deva he quit his body in the presence of Krishna glorifying Krishna fixing his complete attention on Krishna at the time of his death, so both ways Bhishma Deva was successful in quitting his body to attain ultimate liberation. I will stop here.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "These two scriptures are very important and enough for understanding the codes of the Supreme Lord Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verses to be discussed (SB 1.17.12-13), explains the importance of Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam for understanding Krishna's codes, especially for leaders.

In this session, we are discussing two verses, the twelfth and the thirteenth verses of the Bhagavad Gita, of the seventeenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Ko avrishchat tavapadam strin Saurabheya chatushpada Mabhuvams tvadrisha rashtre Raghnam krishnanu vartinam. The meaning of this twelfth verse is: He, Maharaj Parikshit, repeatedly addressed and questioned the bull, 'O son! O son of Surabhi, who has cut off your three legs? In the state of the kings who are obedient to the laws of the Supreme Personality of God Krishna, there is no one as unhappy as you.' So Parikshit was very pained to see the condition of the bull suffering, because it had lost three of its legs, somehow wobbling along on one leg. So he is questioning, who has done this? Purport, by Srila Prabhupada, Prabhupada says in the purport, 'The kings or the executive heads of all states must know the codes of Lord Krishna.' And the codes of Lord Krishna generally mean the Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam. Two scriptures are enough. Though there are varieties of scriptures, many, many, many scriptures, but for the present age of Kali Yuga, these two scriptures are very important and enough for understanding the codes of the Supreme Lord Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "To make an end to all miseries of material conditions human life is a definite goal and a definite purpose as described in scriptures."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam are Krishna Katha and discusses the mission of human life, which is to end the miseries of birth, death, old age, and disease (janma, mrityu, jara, vyadhi).

The Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavad... They are both described by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu as Krishna Katha. Bhagavad Gita is Krishna Katha spoken by Krishna himself. Devotees, so these are two scriptures which are very important, so the king or the executive head must act accordingly in order to fulfill the mission of human life. What is that mission of human life? Which is to make an end to all miseries of material conditions. Human life is a definite goal and a definite purpose as described in scriptures, that we should put an end to all miseries of material existence. And Bhagavad-Gita summarizes these miseries under four headings: janma, mrityu, jara, vyadhi. Janma means the misery of birth, taking birth in this material world. Mrityu means death, the misery of death. And jara means the misery of old age, invalidity due to old age. Old age doesn't mean just having some wrinkled skin or some general weakness, no, it means the invalidity and there are many symptoms of old age which are making life very, very difficult. And fourth one is vyadhi, vyadhi means disease.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the suffering within the mother's womb and reiterates that the mission of human life is to end these miseries by following the codes in Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam.

The construction of the body itself is such that there has to be these four miseries pertaining to the body we have acquired. It's after all in the mother's womb, the development of the body takes place beginning with a very, very, very tiny p-shaped small two particles, the sperm and the ovum combine to form that embryo and then it starts developing in the mother's womb and develops into a nice baby, baby boy or baby girl. Nine months in the mother's womb the development takes place. It's not at all, though it's the most conducive for the development of the body, for the child, the mother's womb is most conducive, but it is not at all pleasant and that's described in the Bhagavatam, third canto, what are the conditions inside the mother's womb which the child experiences in terms of suffering, acute pain, acute pain, that is a misery of birth. We all have gone through it but we forgot after coming out of the mother's womb, you forgot. So to put an end to these miseries is the mission of human life by following the codes given in the Bhagavad...

Gita and the Bhagavad. One who knows the codes of Lord Krishna can achieve this end without any difficulty. Perfect life, leading a perfect life is possible by following the instructions of the Bhagavad-Gita and Bhagavatam. In the Bhagavad-Gita in a synopsis we can understand the codes of Godhead and the Srimad-Bhagavatam the same codes are explained further. Many times Srila Prabhupada says, Bhagavad-Gita is the preliminary study of Bhagavatam or Bhagavatam is the elaborate description of the life full of Brahma. Such quotes are presented in the pages of Srimad Bhagavatam for the guidance of the blind persons who happen to be at the helm of all affairs. Kalau nashtat drishamesha puranarko adhunoditaha. Bhagavatam, it is said, in Kali Yuga people have lost the vision of the goal of human life because of the dense darkness due to the influence of Kali and this darkness is dissipated by the Srimad Bhagavatam which is the horizon like the sun at the beginning of Kali Yuga to give direction to all those people who have lost the direction for the...

Making progress in human life. The 13th verse, aakhya hi vrishabhadram vaha sadhunam akrita agasam, atma vairupya kartaram parthanam kirti dusanam.

Please tell me of the perpetrator of these mutilations, which blackmailed you and made you feel the reputation of the sons of Pritha, kirti dusanam.' So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, 'The reputation of the reign of Maharaja Ramachandra and that of the kings who followed in the footsteps of Maharaja Ramachandra, like the Pandavas and their descendants are never to be forgotten because in their kingdom, offenseless and honest living beings were never in trouble.'

**Key Quote:** "They are facts, historical facts, cent percent true."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the ideal rule of Ramachandra and Yudhishthira, emphasizing the correlation between Dharma and good governance, and asserting that scriptures like Ramayana and Mahabharata are historical facts, not mythology.

Ramaraja, you have heard of Ramaraja? So when Rama was ruling, everybody was happy. People were getting all their necessities in plenty. When Yudhishthira was ruling also, that was the situation. So there is a correlation between the way a king governs the state or the kingdom and the codes of Dharma given in the scriptures, there is a correlation. Exactly according to the Dharma Shastra, the Samadhi rules, there is peace, prosperity, plenty of supply, and people will be able to live very nicely. And these are described in the authorized scriptures. How people were living during Maharaja Yudhishthira's time is described in the Mahabharata. How people were living during Ramachandra's time is described in the Ramayana. So you should read that. And they are not just stories. They are not fiction stories. They are facts. That also people do not know. They use the term mythology to describe Ramayana, Mahabharata, our ancient scriptures. But mythology means something which is false, myth, just imaginary, which is not true. But that is a wrong description of Mahabharata, Ramayana, the Puranas. Mythology is wrong.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the importance of scriptures compiled by sages and emphasizes that the bull and cow are symbols of offenselessness, and even their stool and urine are beneficial.

They are facts, historical facts, cent percent true. Great sages performed severe tapasya in order to compile these literatures for the perfect... For giving perfect direction to people in general. So they did... They had no business writing fiction stories. They simply documented the facts and figures and the principles perfectly without any trace of any mistake in these scriptures. That is the standard of these scriptures. They say Shastra. The bull and the cow are the symbols of the most offenseless living beings. The bull and the cow completely offenseless. And the value of these animals Prabhupada explains is that even the stool and urine of these animals are utilized to benefit human society. No other animal stool except the cow is useful for human society. Even the human being's stool also is not useful. But the cows, cow dung, gober, gomedhya. So that is very, very valuable.

**Key Quote:** "The ignorance about Dharma Shastra is a very, very serious lacuna in modern society."
**Summary:** The speaker continues discussing the value of cows, the importance of protecting animals for maintaining a king's reputation, and criticizes modern leaders for their ignorance of Dharma Shastra, emphasizing the need for knowledge from liberated souls.

How many ways it can be used. Nowadays, of course, people do not know so much. But if you go to some villages even now, multiple ways they use this cow dung and cow urine. So, if the stool and the urine are also useful for human society, how valuable are these animals for human society? You can only imagine. The descendants of the sons of Pritha, like Maharaj Parikh, are afraid of losing their reputation when the animals are not protected. They don't think they will be able to retain the reputation of giving proper protection to the Praja. But in modern days, the leaders are not even afraid of killing such offenseless animals. So, therefore, Prabhupada says, 'Herein lies the difference between the reign of pious kings and the modern states ruled by irresponsible executive heads without knowledge of the codes of conduct.' The ignorance about Dharma Shastra is a very, very serious lacuna in modern society. So, they can only rule properly if they have proper knowledge. And this knowledge should be based on taking the knowledge from the perfect source, not imperfect theories or speculations given by conditioned souls. No. You take knowledge from liberated souls. So, I'll stop here.

By curbing dishonest miscreants, one automatically benefits the offenseless. These are words spoken by Parikshit Maharaj, and he is addressing the bull dharma in the shape of the bow.

**Key Quote:** "Dishonest miscreants flourish because of cowardly and impotent executive heads of state. This is the present situation."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's purport, discussing the degraded state of leadership in Kali Yuga, where unqualified and sinful leaders fail to protect the innocent and curb miscreants.

So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains: Dishonest miscreants flourish because of cowardly and impotent executive heads of state. This is the present situation. As Kali Yuga progresses, there will be no qualified Kshatriyas, no qualified Brahmanas, except for the devotees, who are anyway most qualified persons in the entire world. Other than devotees, who will also be not so many in number, there will be few devotees, but the majority of the population, as Kali Yuga progresses, will be people who are sinful, people who are ignorant about who they are, about what is this world, about who is God, people who are full of desires for material enjoyment. So then, among such people, some person who can garner some votes or get some popularity will somehow become the executive head of the state, and they will not be sufficiently strong or powerful to curb the miscreants because they themselves will be miscreants mostly. And because they are themselves miscreants, they won't really protect the innocent, the honest, the weaker sections.

**Key Quote:** "When the miscreants are punished in an exemplary manner, automatically all good fortune follows."
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the importance of strong and qualified leadership that can effectively punish miscreants, deter others, and protect peaceful citizens, highlighting the prime duty of the executive head of state.

They won't do that. But Srila Prabhupada says further, when the executive heads are strong enough to curb all sorts of dishonest miscreants in any part of the state, certainly they cannot flourish. So if there is a strong person as the head of the state who is qualified, then he can easily curb all dishonest miscreants. And further, Srila Prabhupada says a very important point: When the miscreants are punished in an exemplary manner, automatically all good fortune follows. The punishment given should be appropriate for the mischief performed by the dishonest miscreant. It should be a suitable punishment which will deter the other miscreants. So that is called punishing in an exemplary manner. It will send a proper signal to all the other miscreants that better stop your nefarious activities, otherwise you are going to be severely punished. As said before, Srila Prabhupada is further explaining, it is the prime duty of the king or the executive head to give protection in all respects to the peaceful, offenseless citizens of the state. It is a prime duty to be in a position of responsibility means to actually carry out one's duties properly, being equipped with the right qualifications, being equipped with the right knowledge, and the right support of the able assistance. So that is required. All these are required.

**Key Quote:** "Sankirtana Yajna is the most recommended process for cleansing the hearts of the people in general."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the role of devotees as peaceful citizens and the importance of preaching Krishna Consciousness through Sankirtana to purify the hearts of the people and create a peaceful society.

The devotees of the Lord are by nature peaceful and offenseless, and therefore it is the prime duty of the state to arrange to convert everyone to become a devotee of the Lord. So how is it possible for a king or an executive head of state to actually rule properly for the citizens? There should be a program to preach Krishna Consciousness, by which the material contamination in the hearts of the people in general will be cleansed. Like Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says about Sankirtana, what is he saying? Chetodarpana marjanam. The first effect of Sankirtana, public Sankirtana, is that the heart of the public, simply if the holy name falls on their ears, whether they hear it willingly or unwillingly, knowingly or unknowingly, anyhow it will work, it will act, it will purify their heart. Of course it's a gradual process, it takes time, but the purification begins as soon as the holy name, the vibration of the holy name enters their ears. So this is the primary program in the present age. Yajnai Sankirtana Prayi Riyajantihi Sumedha Saha. Sankirtana Yajna. Sankirtana Yajna is the most recommended process for cleansing the hearts of the people in general.

**Key Quote:** "In spite of this program, Sankirtana program, some demoniac natured persons will not mend themselves. They will have to be punished by the able administrator king."
**Summary:** The lecture explains how people become contaminated by bad association and the influence of Rajoguna and Tamoguna, leading to lust and greed, and reiterates the need for punishment for those who do not reform despite the Sankirtana program.

Thus automatically there will be peaceful, offenseless citizens. There has to be some program because people are contaminated or polluted in their heart by association with other spirits, other sinful people, bad association. By association with the gunas, which are particularly in Kali Yuga, Rajoguna and Tamoguna is very prominent. So people become polluted in their consciousness with this Rajoguna and Tamoguna. Rajoguna and Tamoguna effect is mostly lust and greed. Very lust and greed will dominate in the hearts of so many people. So they will be unable to control their senses, control their mind, and they will act in so many sinful ways, being forced to actually endeavor to satisfy their lusty desires, satisfy their greed, satisfy their crazy material desires like that. Then the only duty of the king will be to curb the dishonest miscreants. In spite of this program, Sankirtana program, some demoniac natured persons will not mend themselves. They will not correct themselves. They will have to be punished by the able administrator king. That will bring about peace and harmony all over the human society.

**Key Quote:** "An upstart living being who commits offenses by torturing those who are offenseless shall be directly uprooted by me even though he be a denizen of heaven with armor and decorations."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains verse 15, focusing on the idea that even beings from higher planets are subject to justice if they commit offenses, and discusses the relative immortality of heavenly beings.

So Prabhupada has outlined a very clear method for the executive head of state to curb these miscreants. The 15th verse. The meaning of this 15th verse: An upstart living being who commits offenses by torturing those who are offenseless shall be directly uprooted by me even though he be a denizen of heaven with armor and decorations. So Parikshit Maharaj is warning the miscreants, even if they are persons from the upper planets, still they cannot create any nuisance or any mischief on this earth planet as long as Parikshit is ruling. They are very, very powerful and capable and qualified and conscientious. So in the Purport, Shlap Prabhupada says the denizens of the heavenly kingdom are called Amar or deathless due to their possessing a long span of life. Actually they are not deathless in terms of the body they have, material body they have, but they are like deathless because of the long span of life they have, far greater than that of the human beings. For a human being who has only a maximum 100 year duration of life, a span of life spreading over millions of years is certainly considered to be deathless. So it is relative. It is not exactly deathless. It is relative.

**Key Quote:** "This means that the state executive head must be as strong as Maharaj Pariksit so that he may be determined to punish the strongest offenders."
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes that even denizens of heaven are not exempt from punishment if they violate divine law, and the executive head of state must be strong and impartial in administering justice.

Relatively very long life span. For example, Prabhupada gives the example from the Bhagavad Gita. We learn that on the Brahmaloka planet, the duration of one day is calculated to be 4,300,000 times 1,000 solar years, 12 hours of Brahma's time scale. The top most planet in this universe is some 4 billion years. 4 billion years is 12 hours of Brahma. Similarly, in other heavenly planets, one day is calculated to be 6 months on this planet, and the inhabitants get a life of 10 million of their years. Therefore, in all higher planets, since the span of life is far greater than that of the human being, the denizens are called deathless by imagination. See, this is an important point. Although actually no one within the material universe is deathless. Ultimately Brahma also has to die. Everyone has to die. Die means they have to give up the present material body. Now Maharaj Pariksit challenges even such denizens of heaven if they torture the offenseless. He says even if somebody is a resident of a higher planet, I don't care for your position or power. This means that the state executive head must be as strong as Maharaj Pariksit, so that he may be determined to punish the strongest offenders. It should be the principle of a state executive head that the offender of the codes of God is always punished. There is no discrimination when somebody is committing an offence. There is no discrimination as to who that person is. Whatever be his position, if he is an offender, he has to be punished.

**Key Quote:** "It gives us a clue as to how we can protect ourselves against the evil influence of Kali, this age, this time."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of discussion: verses 16 and 17 of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on how Parikshit Maharaj dealt with Kali Yuga and how individuals can protect themselves from its negative influences by leading a pious life.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudhirayet. In this session, we are discussing from the 16th and the 17th verses of the 17th chapter, chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The title of the 17th chapter is Punishment and Reward of Kali. How the Kali Yuga, the Kali Purusha, the personality who is the personification of this age, Kali Yuga, of this period, how he is dealt with by Parikshit Maharaj when Kali Yuga is about to begin. He is trying to enter Parikshit's kingdom when Dwapar Yuga is ending and the Kali Yuga is going to begin, and how he is dealt with, that is very, very instructive for all of us. It gives us a clue why is it important for us. It gives us a clue as to how we can protect ourselves against the evil influence of Kali, this age, this time, this atmosphere, the prevailing external conditions, the bad influence. How can we protect ourselves, provided of course pious people want to lead a life free from sinful activities, want to lead an honest life, a clean life, a pious life. Then how do they protect themselves against the evil influence?

**Key Quote:** "The supreme duty of the ruling king is to give all protection to law-abiding persons and to chastise those who stray from the ordinances of the scriptures in ordinary times when there is no emergency."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of the 16th verse, emphasizing the king's duty to protect those who follow religious principles and punish those who deviate, while also discussing the concept of 'apadharma' or occupational duty in times of emergency, using the example of Vishwamitra.

That is the reason why this is being discussed here. The 16th verse, Ragnyohi paramo dharma ha swadharma sthanu palanam shasato anyan yatha shasram anapadi utpathan iha. Let me read this. Okay. The meaning of this verse is, the supreme duty of the ruling king is to give all protection to law-abiding persons and to chastise those who stray from the ordinances of the scriptures in ordinary times when there is no emergency. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "In the scriptures, there is mention of apadharma or occupational duty at times of extraordinary happenings. It is said that sometimes the great sage Vishwamitra had to live on the flesh of dogs in some extraordinary dangerous position." Flesh-eating at normal circumstances is completely forbidden. Or if somebody, somehow or the other, because they are very much desirous of enjoying eating some flesh, animal food, animal flesh, then if they do so, then they are liable to be punished by the laws of God, the laws of nature, laws of karma. But under extreme circumstances, when there is no food available except for flesh, nothing else is available, then one may eat flesh just to survive.

**Key Quote:** "When plenty of fruits, vegetables, grains, milk is available, then why should people eat flesh?"
**Summary:** The lecture condemns unnecessary animal slaughter and flesh-eating, stating that it is sinful and punishable, especially when other food sources are readily available, emphasizing that one should not kill animals simply to satisfy the tongue.

That is called apadharma, emergency time. So, Srila Prabhupada says, "In cases of emergency, one may be allowed to live on the flesh of animals of all description. But that does not mean that there should be regular slaughterhouses to feed the animal eaters and that this system should be encouraged by the state, this is completely sinful. When plenty of fruits, vegetables, grains, milk is available, then why should people eat flesh? Why should they kill animals for getting the flesh?" So, that is very, very sinful and severely punishable. So, Srila Prabhupada says, "No one should try to live on flesh in ordinary time simply for the sake of the palate." Palate means simply for satisfying the tongue. Oh, I like to eat. No. Just because you like to eat, you cannot kill other animals. As much as you have a desire to live, you want to subsist in this particular, in this particular present body. Similarly, every living being has got the desire to live and should be allowed. Should not be, there should be no unnecessary killing of even an ant, even a small plant, no unnecessary killing. So, it is said here, Srila Prabhupada further, "If anyone does so, it means they simply kill animals for the sake of satisfying their tongue. The king or the executive head should punish him for gross enjoyment."

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The state executive head is to see that such Swadharma is not changed by the follower, whatever it may be, and he should be given all protection."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the concept of 'Swadharma' or prescribed duty according to one's nature, referencing Bhagavad Gita 18.48, and emphasizes that the state should protect individuals in following their prescribed duties, which should not be violated except in emergencies.

There are regular scriptural injunctions for different persons engaged in different occupational duties, and one who follows them is called Swadharmastha or faithful in one's prescribed duties. Everybody has got a prescribed duty given in the scriptures. Hmm. In the Bhagavad Gita, 18.48, it is advised that one should not give up his occupational prescribed duties even if they are not always flawless. Swadharma, what is prescribed for you according to your acquired nature, according to your nature. Hmm. You have to perform a certain type of occupational duty to maintain yourself. Such Swadharma might be violated in case of emergency, but not in normal circumstances should you violate. If one is forced by circumstances, one may violate, but they cannot be violated in ordinary times. The state executive head is to see that such Swadharma is not changed by the follower, whatever it may be, and he should be given all protection. The follower of the Swadharma should be given all protection by the king.

**Key Quote:** "The duty of the king is to see that everyone strictly follows his occupational duty as prescribed in the scriptures."
**Summary:** The lecture explains that violators of Swadharma are subject to punishment according to the scriptures, drawing an analogy to civil and criminal laws to illustrate the different levels of transgression and the corresponding consequences, emphasizing that Shastras are perfect and given by the Supreme Lord.

The violator is subject to punishment in terms of the Shastra. Now what punishment who should get according to the particular violation. Hmm. Just like in ordinary law, there are civil laws and criminal laws. Civil laws is for some minor transgression, transgression of some particular rule or law of the land. Hmm. Just like somebody is driving, they are just exceeding the speed limit. So that's not a very serious violation of the road rules or the law of the road driving, driving laws. So such a person may be just, he may be just warned or he may be just given some small fine. He has to pay. That's all. But somebody is driving rashly and killing another person or bringing about severe accident, severe damages, then such a person is subject to criminal code of conduct. Criminal laws are applicable in such cases. So, there is a difference depending on the kind of violation. The duty of the king is to see that everyone strictly follows his occupational duty as prescribed in the scriptures. Shastras should be the basis, perfect. They are perfect in all respects. They are not made by some human beings with defects. Shastras are given by the Supreme Lord and further elaborated upon by liberated souls, saintly persons who are liberated personalities.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 17th verse, where Dharma responds to Parikshit Maharaj, praising him as a worthy descendant of the Pandavas, whose devotional qualities were so captivating that even Lord Krishna served them.

The 17th verse, dharmavacha, because Pariksit was speaking to dharma, to the personality of religion. So dharma is now responding to Pariksit Maharaj. etad vaha pandavayanam yuktam aartabhayam vachaha yesam gunaganai krishno dhautyadau bhagavan krutah. The meaning of this verse is the personality of religion said, he is replying to Pariksit Maharaj. These words just spoken by you, befit a person of the Pandava dynasty. Captivated by the devotional qualities of the Pandavas, even Lord Krishna, the personality of Godhead, performed duties as a messenger. Something wonderful.

**Key Quote:** "He was not falsely proud for a devotee of the Lord is equally as powerful as the Lord or sometimes more powerful by the Lord's grace."
**Summary:** The lecture explains that Parikshit Maharaj's assurances are not exaggerations but reflect his real power as a devotee of the Lord, emphasizing that devotees can be as powerful as or even more powerful than the Lord by His grace.

Dharma is telling about Pariksit Maharaj. He is glorifying Pariksit Maharaj. So in the Purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The assurances and challenges made by Maharaj Pariksit are never exaggerations of his real power." He is speaking, I will punish anybody who violates. I don't care even if that person who is violating is a denizen of the heaven. I don't care. So these words are befitting his actual position, and they are not simply some exaggerations. The Maharaja said that even the denizens of heaven could not escape his stringent garment if they are violators of religious principles. He is a strict ruler, and he has the power to rule and enforce the law of the scriptures, the rules and regulations and laws of the scriptures, even upon the devatas, even upon superior beings. He was not falsely proud, for a devotee of the Lord is equally as powerful as the Lord or sometimes more powerful by the Lord's grace. And any promise made by a devotee, though it may be ordinarily very difficult to fulfill, is properly executed by the grace of the Lord. You see, that's the position of a devotee. Pariksit Maharaj is a pure devotee of the Lord, so he has got extraordinary power. Nobody else can have it. Not even devatas can have as much power as Pariksit has, because Pariksit is a pure devotee.

**Key Quote:** "Pandavas, by their unalloyed devotional service, made it possible for the Lord to become a chariot driver or sometimes their letter messenger."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on how the Pandavas' pure devotional service allowed Krishna to become their servant, acting as a chariot driver and messenger, highlighting the Lord's desire to serve His unalloyed devotees.

So further, Srila Prabhupada says, "Pandavas, by their unalloyed devotional service, unalloyed devotional service, pure devotional service, and full surrender to the Supreme Lord, made it possible for the Lord to become a chariot driver or sometimes their letter messenger." See, Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, worshipable by everyone, including the devotees, everyone is subservient to Krishna and Krishna is supremely powerful, unlimitedly powerful. But that Krishna, being captivated by the Pandavas' wonderful qualities, devotional qualities, he became their servant. Voluntarily, he became their servant. He became the chariot driver of Arjuna in the battle of Kurukshetra. He became the messenger of Yudhishthira. He carried a message, a peace message on behalf of Yudhishthira to Duryodhana. Toward the war, the battle of Kurukshetra, before the war was actually fought, Yudhishthira wanted to avert this big world war. So Krishna personally carried this message from Yudhishthira to Duryodhana, personally went. So he was a letter messenger of Yudhishthira. Such duties executed by the Lord for his devotee are always very pleasing to the Lord because the Lord wants to render service to his unalloyed devotee whose life has no other engagement than to serve the Lord with full love and devotion. The devotee wants to serve the Lord unconditionally. The Lord wants to serve his devotees also without any hesitation, without any consideration that he is the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "So when Pariksit makes an assurance, it is always backed up by the special protection of the Supreme Lord Himself."
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by reiterating that Parikshit Maharaj, as a pure devotee like his grandfather Arjuna, was always protected by Krishna, even from the womb, and that his assurances are backed by the Lord's special protection, ending with gratitude and the Hare Krishna mantra.

Maharaj Pariksit, the grandson of Arjuna, the celebrated friendly servitor of the Lord, was a pure devotee of the Lord, like his grandfather. Who is his grandfather? Arjuna. Pariksit is the grandson of Arjuna. Arjuna's son was Abhimanyu. Abhimanyu's son was Pariksit. So Pariksit was also a pure devotee like Arjuna. Therefore the Lord was always with him even from the time when he was helplessly lying in the womb of his mother and was attacked by the blazing Brahmastra weapon of Ashwathama. This is the history of Pariksit. We discussed this earlier. He was saved in his mother's womb when he was an infant, not even an infant. He was not even born, not even come out of the mother's womb. He was protected by Krishna because he was a devotee. So when Pariksit makes an assurance, it is always backed up by the special protection of the Supreme Lord Himself. So the personality of religion, Dharma, accepted this fact and thanked the King for his being true to his exalted position. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

of theoretical philosophers. So what does this mean? It's difficult to ascertain the actual cause of our suffering, because so many different theories exist. There are many theoretical philosophers in the world who put forward their own theories of cause and effect, especially about the cause of suffering and its effect on different living beings. See, one thing is very common among all of us. What is the cause of suffering? All living beings, all human beings at least, nobody wants suffering. Everybody wants to enjoy without any suffering. But even if somebody does not want suffering, there is suffering in this world which practically everybody has to go through to different degrees, of course. Not that everyone is suffering. Not that everyone suffers the same extent. But suffering is definitely there in this world. This is the truth about material existences. Material existence means there will be suffering.

**Key Quote:** "Generally, there are six great philosophers."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the six great Vedic philosophers and their respective philosophies: Kanada, Gautama, Patanjali, Kapila, Jaimini, and Vyasa Deva.

So, what is the real cause of suffering and how to get rid of this suffering? That is the whole discussion that is now going to happen. So, Srila Prabhupada says about the statement of Dharma that there are many theoretical philosophers. Prabhupada says, "Generally, there are six great philosophers." Who are the six great philosophers? The first one is Kanada, the author of Vaisheshika philosophy. I will just briefly explain what these philosophies are. First, let me read this out in Prabhupada's purport. The first one is Kanada Rishi. He was a great sage in former times, Vedic times. He is the author of Vaisheshika philosophy. Then, there is the second one, the second sage, Rishi, Gautama Rishi, the author of Logic. Logic means Nyaya Shastra. The third one, the third great philosopher is Patanjali. You have heard this name very much. Patanjali Rishi, the author of mystic yoga. Mystic yoga means ashtanga yoga, hatha yoga. Then the fourth one, the fourth great philosopher is Kapila, the author of sankhya philosophy. This Kapila is nirishwara Kapila. In the Bhagavatam, there is a mention of Kapila who is the son of Devahuti, the incarnation of the Supreme Lord. The Kapila mentioned in this purport here among the six great philosophers is not that incarnation Kapila. This is another later Kapila in recent times, much after the ancient incarnation of the Supreme Lord Kapila. There is another Kapila, same name, and the philosophy is also the same name, sankhya philosophy, but the two are totally different. So, fourth one is nirishwara Kapila, the author of sankhya philosophy. Then the fifth one is Jaimini Rishi, the author of karma mimamsa philosophy. And the last one, the sixth one is Vyasa Deva, our Vyasa, the author of Bhagavatam, the author of Vedanta Sutra, the one who compiled all the Vedas. He has given us what is called as Vedanta philosophy, Vedanta Darshana. So, six philosophers.

**Key Quote:** "without the sanction of the lord no one could inflict trouble upon them"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that even though Kali Purusha is the immediate cause of suffering, ultimately everything happens with the sanction of the Lord, and devotees understand this principle.

Six philosophies, and I will try to briefly mention what each of these philosophies are, though there is lot more explained by Prabhupad elsewhere about these philosophies, but briefly I will just mention. Let me complete this purport. Although the bull or the personality of religion and the cow, the personality of the earth, knew perfectly well that the personality of Kali was the direct cause of their sufferings, still, as devotees of the Lord, they knew well also that without the sanction of the Lord, no one could inflict trouble upon them. So, the analysis of who is the cause of my problem, if I am suffering, then who is the cause? So, there is a direct cause or the immediate cause. Now, in the case of the cow and the bull, Kali Purusha was actually beating the cow, was the immediate cause, but that immediate cause is not the only cause. So, in this world, there are always a series of causes and

**Summary:** Using the analogy of rainfall, the speaker illustrates the chain of cause and effect, emphasizing that even the actions of Kali Purusha are ultimately sanctioned by Paramatma.

effects for any happening. To give an example, if there is rainfall, the cause of the rainfall, immediate cause is the rain bearing cloud. The rain bearing cloud, ultimately, the cloud neighboring cloud is the Sun who evaporates water from the huge water bodies on this earth planet, and the clouds are formed which contain the water in a vapor state, water vapor. Evaporated water is there in the cloud form, and then that cloud which is gathered sufficient water vapor, it will condense, the vapor will become into water, and that water is poured down by the cloud at the appropriate time, like rainy season, to give an example. Now what is the cause of the Sun, the action of the Sun, or who or what is the cause? So like this, we can analyze a series of causes and defects, so here we should understand that the direct cause of the immediate cause is Kalipurusha. But as Prabhupada mentions, nothing in this world takes place if there is no sanction of the Paramatma seated in everyone's heart. So, without Paramatma's sanction, Kali Purusha cannot inflict suffering upon the cow or the bull. So, there is some role of Paramatma also who sanctions the Kali Purusha to inflict suffering upon the cow and the bull.

**Key Quote:** "The present trouble, if we are suffering now, is due to the fructifying of seedling sins."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that suffering is a result of past sinful activities (Papa Bija) that develop into Papa Phala, but pure devotional service can destroy these sinful seeds.

So, therefore, the bull is correctly, Dharma is correctly pointing out that it's not so easy to identify the exact cause of our suffering. And if we try to analyze all the different causes, then it is common. And it is complicated to analyze the various causes because there are different philosophers who tell there are different kinds of causes leading to a particular suffering. So, Srila Prabhupada says from the authoritative scriptures, according to the Padma Purana, which is the authentic scripture explaining these causes and effects, our process... The present trouble, if we are suffering now, is due to the fructifying of seedling sins. There is Papa Bija within our heart, everybody's heart. Everyone who has taken birth in this material world by force of karma has got in their heart what is called as Papa Bija, seedling sins. But even those seedling sins also gradually fade away by execution of pure devotional service. Anybody suffering is due to their own sinful activities performed in the past. And those sinful activities which they performed in the past resulted in Papa Bija being put in their heart. And that Papa Bija will gradually develop into Papa Phala. And that Papa Phala is what we experience as suffering. Different kinds of suffering depending on different kinds of Papa Phala. So, but somebody who performs pure devotional service... All the Papa Bijas are completely destroyed before they can fructify.

**Key Quote:** "Whatever a devotee suffers, he thinks, that by Krishna's mercy, the suffering is minimized."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how devotees tolerate suffering, understanding it as a minimized consequence of their past karma due to Krishna's mercy and intervention.

So, we become free from suffering because we are freed of sinful reactions by performing pure devotional service. Thus, even if the devotees see the mischief mongers, they do not accuse them for the suffering inflicted. They take it for granted that the mischief monger is made to act by some indirect cause. And therefore, they tolerate the sufferings, thinking them to be God-given in small doses. For otherwise, the suffering should have been greater. Whatever a devotee suffers, he thinks that by Krishna's mercy, the suffering is minimized. Token suffering. Otherwise, if I had not taken to devotional service, if Krishna would not have intervened in my life, I would have suffered much, much more due to my past sinful activities. So, a devotee considers, what I am getting as suffering now is very, very minimal. And let me tolerate that by the grace of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Only this is the best discovery. It is the greatest жеegdavu, which I would try to capture with my pen. So, it is further told by Prabhupada, Maharaj Pariksit wanted to get a statement of accusation against the direct mischief monger, but they, the Cow and the Bull, declined to give it on the abovementioned grounds. They said, if we try to analyse, we're not able to analyse exactly who is responsible.

**Key Quote:** "Speculative philosophers, however, do not recognize the sanction of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the understanding of devotees, who recognize the Lord's sanction in all events, with speculative philosophers who are bewildered and unable to see Krishna as the ultimate cause.

Speculative philosophers, however, do not recognize the sanction of the Lord. Devotees, they directly understand and directly say that ultimately the sanction of the Lord is the ultimate cause of all causes, but the theoretical philosophers, the other five other than the Vyasa Deva, the other five philosophers, they do not recognize the role of the Paramatma. They try to find out the cause of suffering in their own way, their own analysis. According to Srila Jiva Goswami, such speculators are themselves bewildered, and thus they cannot know the ultimate cause of all causes, that is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna. They cannot know that the theoretical philosophers are bewildered, so when they try to analyze, their brain doesn't work perfectly. They are not able to see the ultimate cause, Krishna, in all circumstances, in all cases, in all conditions, that they are unable to see.

Kechit Vikalpa Vasana Aahur Aatmanam Aatmanah Daivam Anya Apare Karma Swabhavam Apare Prabhum. The meaning of this verse is: Some of the philosophers who deny all sorts of duality declare that one's own self is responsible for his personal happiness and distress. Others say that superhuman powers are responsible, while yet others say that activity is responsible, and a gross materialist maintains that nature is the ultimate cause. So, dharma, the personality of religion, is replying to Pariksit's question: Who is the cause of your suffering? So, in the previous verse, 18th verse, we discussed that dharma says there are different theories and disciplines in a particular spirit. There are different theories that God has created them in the form of his own existence. Theoretical philosophers who put forward different theories as to the ultimate cause of suffering, and dharma says general people are confused, we do not know which whom to actually accept as correct. So, in the purport, previous verse purport proper, it said generally there are six great philosophers, and I mentioned in the previous session that I shall tell you briefly what are their philosophies, the six great philosophers. Now that is being described by dharma himself, those six philosophers.

**Key Quote:** "Jaimini analyzes people can perform either sinful activity or pious activity if they perform pious activity they are going to get enjoyment or happiness if they perform sinful activity they are going to get happiness and if they do not they are going to get suffering or pain or some distress this is jaimini's analysis"
**Summary:** The speaker delves into the Karma Mimamsa philosophy of Jaimini, explaining that suffering and enjoyment are direct results of one's past actions, both sinful and pious, and that even gods are bound by the laws of karma.

are mentioned by dharma. Four are mentioned here in this verse. The first one is one's own self is responsible for his personal happiness and distress. So, in the purport, Prilapravapad explains, as referred to above, philosophers like Jaimini and his followers establish that fructive activity is the root cause of all distress and happiness, and that even if there is a superior authority, some superhuman powerful god or gods, he or they are also under the influence of fructive activity because they reward result according to one's own action. The first philosopher being mentioned by dharma among the many philosophers, six great philosophers, first one is Jaimini. Jaimini is one sage who has put forward a philosophy, a theory that the cause of suffering is one's own actions, and he calls it Karma Meemamsa philosophy. Karma Meemamsa philosophy. What is this Karma Meemamsa philosophy? It says that if I am suffering, it is my own past specific action which I performed that is the cause of my suffering, and not only suffering, if I am enjoying, then the enjoyment also is my own past pious activity I have performed, and if I am suffering, it is my own past sinful activity. So, Jaimini analyzes people can perform either sinful activity or pious activity. If they perform pious activity, they are going to get enjoyment or happiness. If they perform sinful activity, they are going to get happiness, and if they do not, they are going to get suffering or pain or some distress. This is Jaimini's analysis. He says beyond this there is nothing more. This is Jaimini's analysis. So, his analysis is based on Karma Meemamsa philosophy that he has put forward. He says ultimately even if there is some god or godless god or gods, devatas, even if there are some powerful beings, they are all bound up ultimately by the laws of karma, and according to law of karma, everybody's suffering or enjoyment is according to the law, and that law states you suffer your own past misdeed and you also enjoy your own past pious activities.

**Key Quote:** "even if somebody is a devotee of some supreme god or devotee of some devata or believer of some some higher controller still that controller or controllers or supreme lord has to award the results of one's past activities and those results are awarded in terms of suffering or happiness enjoyment this is karma"
**Summary:** The speaker continues explaining Jaimini's Karma Mimamsa philosophy, emphasizing that even devotion to a supreme god or devatas does not override the law of karma, which dictates that everyone must experience the consequences of their actions.

So, Jaimini's explanation is that even if somebody is a devotee of some supreme god or devotee of some devata or believer of some some higher controller, still that controller or controllers or supreme lord has to award the results of one's past activities, and those results are awarded in terms of suffering or happiness, enjoyment. This is Karma Meemamsa philosophy as put forth by Jaimini Rishi. Now, Jaimini Rishi is not simply stating the way I am I am stating in just a few sentences, no, he has given evidence from the original Vedas. He studied the Vedas on his own and he has put forth the statements of the Vedas and he has proven in his freedom Horizon from which we now know to explain third-line topic whyIRE I just wanted to start and mid I just wanted to put towards each of these things what you saw with java traversed Jave shud Nuncabharata from which i am beginning a new dalai ometan while going back i have been a vassal for the past two centuries something i watched a lot in my old sister's advertisement from which we will also talk about again you have to spot his philosophy philosophical explanation of the cause of suffering that we see around us in this world among different people. So, he says whoever or whatever be the position, authority, or power, or how you see it used by anybody in resembles by the laws of karma, and the laws of karma means each one has to suffer his or her own past misdeeds or pious activities. This is in essence the karma memes of philosophy. And what about the sanction of the Supreme Lord or what about the control of the devatas that Jaimini Rishi says their control is also subject to the law of karma. Their control is subject to law of karma. So, law of karma is above the devatas, above God, above Paramatma, above all living beings, above everything.

**Key Quote:** "So, the Vedic philosophies, five Vedic philosophies other than Vyasadeva's Vedanta Darshana, um Nyaya, Vaisheshika, ah Yoga Sutra of Patanjali, ah Karma Mimamsa and and um and one more Sankhya. So, these five philosophies they have some merit, but they also are defective in some ways."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces Vyasadeva's refutation of Karma Mimamsa and other Vedic philosophies, stating that while they have some merit, they are incomplete compared to Vedanta Darshana, which is based on the parampara system.

So, this Jaimini Rishi holds law of karma as the supreme. This is his conclusion. Now, the refutation of this karma memes of philosophy as erroneous or incomplete, I have not say erroneous, I would say incomplete, is pointed out by Vyasa Deva. Vyasa Deva when presenting Vedanta darshana or Vedanta philosophy, he has refuted the other five philosophers and pointed out that there is some merit in what they are telling because they are basing it on the Vedas. There is something correct in what they are putting forth as the the philosophy of their own respective analysis, but there is also some defect. So, the Vedic philosophies, five Vedic philosophies other than Vyasadeva's Vedanta Darshana, um Nyaya, Vaisheshika, ah Yoga Sutra of Patanjali, ah Karma Mimamsa and and um and one more Sankhya. So, these five philosophies, they have some merit, but they also are defective in some ways. So, that is very clearly pointed out by Vyasadeva based on what? Based on the very Vedas, based on the very Vedas that they all refer to. But, Vyasadeva presents the Vedic understanding based on Parampara system. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says, evam parampara praptam imam rajarsha yo vidhu. The Vedic knowledge is originally coming from the Supreme Lord Krishna. Karma brahmodavam vidhi brahmaksara samudbhavam.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Vedic knowledge originates from Krishna and was imparted to Brahma, then passed down through the parampara system to Vyasa, who documented it in the Vedic literature.

Bhagavad Gita, it is explained very clearly that the scriptures are originating from the Supreme personality of Godhead, Krishna. At the beginning of creation, thene Brahma rudaya adikavaya muhyanti yatsuraya. So, in the Bhagavad Gita, it is explained that the shastras, the scriptures were first imparted, the Vedic knowledge was given to Brahma from within his heart by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna at the beginning of creation. And since then, Brahma became enlightened by the Supreme Lord's mercy, then Brahma imparted that very knowledge to his sons and his Brahma imparted to Narada, Narada imparted the same knowledge to Vyasa. Vyasa is documented in the form of this Vedic literature. Okay, so Vyasa is receiving this knowledge and perfectly explaining everything based on the knowledge he has received along with the explanation.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by explaining that while Karma Mimamsa is correct to some extent, it is incomplete because it doesn't account for Krishna's role in enforcing and nullifying karma, especially for devotees engaged in pure devotional service.

Explanations along the explanations of the various Vedic statements, the original Vedas. So, Vyasadeva based on the original Vedas, he has explained that this Karma Mimamsa philosophy is correct to the extent that the immediate cause of a particular suffering is the sinful reaction within my heart which is fructifying now, therefore I have to suffer now. If I get a disease, then a particular sinful activity I committed in the past is fructifying now, and Kala, the sanction of the Lord in terms of Kala, is enforcing that, inflicting that now upon me in terms of I contracting the disease and suffering some pain or some whatever the infection. So, this is a fact, I am suffering because of my own past mistake, yes, which is, but the sanction of the Lord is the Kala. Kala is under control of Krishna, the Supreme Lord Paramatma is Paramatma, and Paramatma sanctions when who has to suffer which particular reaction of his or her own past misdeed, and Paramatma also nullifies the sinful reaction when one executes pure devotional service because of which a person doesn't have to suffer his or her past reactions. Sinful reactions, there is also there that this Jaimini doesn't understand, he doesn't know, he doesn't understand that because this is confidential knowledge about the life of devotees who are engaged in pure devotional service that Jaimini doesn't know, and it's an exception, it's not the rule. The rule is everybody has to suffer according to their own past misdeeds, according to Kala also, but pure devotees or devotees engaged in pure devotional service don't suffer exactly whatever reactions are there in their heart, their reactions are nullified by their pure devotional service, and who does that? Krishna does it because only Krishna has got that power to nullify sinful reactions, nobody else can, only Krishna can do that.

**Key Quote:** "While yet others say that activity is responsible and the gross materialists maintain that nature is the ultimate cause."
**Summary:** This segment explores different philosophical perspectives on the cause of suffering, including individual responsibility, superhuman powers (destiny), activity (karma), and nature.

So this discussion is about the nature of the ultimate cause. So this is the question between Dharma and Maharaj Pariksit. Maharaj Pariksit directly questioned Dharma as to who is the cause of your suffering. And Dharma replied that it is very difficult to ascertain the particular miscreant who has caused our sufferings, because there are so many different theories. There are so many different theoretical philosophers who put forward different philosophies trying to explain what is the cause of our suffering, ultimately. So here four different kinds of philosophers are mentioned specifically. One class of philosophers say ultimately we ourselves are responsible for our own suffering or happiness, suffering or enjoyment. And some people say superhuman powers, it's not within our control, something beyond us is responsible, we simply have to accept whatever is coming our way, just like fatalists. In English there's a word fatalists. In Karanadhi say hane baraha, whatever is destined is going to happen, destiny, destiny is everything, superhuman powers. Then some, the third category philosophers, say activity is ultimately responsible. If you do good work, you will be responsible, if you do good work you get good results, you're happy, you enjoy life, everything is nice. If you do bad activities, if you do sinful activities, then you have to suffer, you have to undergo distress and you will have a very bad time. So they attribute the ultimate cause of one's own enjoyment of suffering to whatever actions a particular person does. The fourth category of philosophers, they say nature is the ultimate cause. They attribute nature as the ultimate cause of everything.

**Key Quote:** "The Srimad Bhagavatam or kapila, the first kapila, who appeared many millions of years back, he actually is teaching us the devotional Sankhya philosophy, which analyzes everything in existence and establishes the Supreme Personality of God, Krishna, as the ultimate cause of all causes."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the Sankhya philosophy and distinguishes between the theistic Sankhya of the original Kapila (an incarnation of the Supreme Lord) and the atheistic Sankhya of a later Kapila, emphasizing the former's focus on Krishna as the ultimate cause.

So accordingly people try to find a solution to their problems based on which philosophy dot nature Helsinki Professor of Health Sciences liquid quote nature as the ultimate cause of everything. So accordingly people try to find a solution to their problems based on which philosophy they subscribe to. So Srila Prabhupada has already explained in the purport to the 18th words, there are many theoretical philosophers in the world who put forward their own theories as to cause and effect, especially about the cause of suffering in this world. So in the Vedic tradition, there are six great philosophers who have written very elaborate thesis on the ultimate cause of suffering that is there in this world and those six philosophers have been named Granada, Gautama, then Patanjali, Kapila, Jaimini and Vyasa Deva. So now in the previous session I described Jaimini's philosophy of karma Mimamsa philosophy and now I will try to describe this atheistic materialistic Sankhya philosophy. The Sankhya philosophers, the Nirishwaravada Sankhya philosophers, because I mentioned this earlier also, I am repeating, there are two kapilas in history. The recent one is the Nirishwaravadi kapila, Atheist kapila, who does not accept the theistic conclusion of the Srimad Bhagavatam or the theistic conclusion of the Vaishnava tradition. This Atheistic kapila, because the incarnational Supreme Lord Shiva is not a kapila. The Srimad Bhagavatam or kapila, the first kapila, who appeared many millions of years back, he actually is teaching us the devotional Sankhya philosophy, which analyzes everything in existence and establishes the Supreme Personality of God, Krishna, as the ultimate cause of all causes. But this Atheistic kapila, Nirishwaravada, is not a kapila. The Nirishwaravadi kapila, he has got his own materialistic Sankhya philosophy, which says material nature is the ultimate cause of all causes.

**Key Quote:** "According to this atheist Kapila, there is only material nature."
**Summary:** The lecture delves into the atheistic Sankhya philosophy, highlighting its focus on material nature as the ultimate cause and its inability to comprehend the existence of the spirit soul or anything beyond matter.

So this Nirishwara kapila, he says that material nature, he analyzes material nature, and he has analyzed material nature as consisting of 24 elements, which is described by the original Kapila in the Srimad Bhagavatam, the Sankhya philosophy, the devotional Sankhya philosophy, by the incarnation of Supreme Lord Kapila. Kapila, son of Devahuti, the Supreme Lord himself, appeared to explain the Sankhya philosophy. Yes, the material nature consists of 24 elements, but material nature is one of the many energies of the Supreme Personality of God, Krishna. Now this point, that material nature is one of the energies of the Supreme Lord, Kapila, is a very important point. The material nature of the Supreme Lord, Krishna, is not known, not understood, not considered by the atheist Kapila. According to this atheist Kapila, there is only material nature. Just like we take birth in this material world, so atheist Kapila says, we are a product of material nature. That means he does not know anything beyond a personality. He is a person's material body. Of course, this atheist Kapila recognizes there is mind, there is intelligence, there is false ego. But he is unable to go beyond matter, because he is a gross materialist. He does not understand what is spirit soul. He does not even know it exists. And like other atheists, the reason is, if we say Bhagavad Gita describes there is something called spirit beyond matter, he says, oh, that's all simply your imagination. He'll dismiss that as something imaginary or some kind of theoretical philosophy. According to these atheistic philosophers, and according to this atheistic Kapila, what exists is what we can perceive with our five senses and with our mind and intelligence. That's all they accept. These atheistic people.

**Key Quote:** "So, this Atheist Kapila analyzes matter as consisting of 24 elements."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the 24 elements of matter according to the atheistic Sankhya philosophy, referencing Krishna's description in the Bhagavad Gita.

So, this Atheist Kapila analyzes matter as consisting of 24 elements. What are the 24 elements? First of all, this is described in the Bhagavad Gita by Krishna himself in the 13th chapter. In the 7th chapter and 13th chapter, Krishna describes, in the 13th chapter particularly, Mahabhutani ahankara buddhir avyakta mevaca. That Mahabhutani, the five great elements, earth, water, fire, air and sky. These are called the five great elements. And then there are the ten senses. The five knowledge, the five knowledge acquiring senses, Gyanendriya: the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue and the sense of touch. Then the five karmendriyas or the five working senses: the hands, the legs, the voice, the anus and the genitals. So, totally that makes it 15. And then five more senses, the sense objects. For the eyes, there are form. And for the ears, there is sound. For the nose, there is smell, different kinds of fragrances or different kinds of smells. And then for the tongue, there are different kinds of tastes. And for the sense of touch, there are different kinds of feelings of softness, hardness, whatever the kind of sensation of touch. So, these five sense objects called indriya visaya. Totally, five fours are 20. And then four more for making it 24 total elements, which is what matter is constituted of: mind, intelligence, and false ego. Mind is manas, buddhi, intelligence, ahankara, false ego. And finally, there is the total stock of the unmanifested material energy, avyakta. Avyakta is the total stock of the material energy from which these elements are differentiated at the beginning of creation.

**Key Quote:** "But then who is actually causing material energy to come from the unmanifested state?"
**Summary:** This segment critiques the atheistic Sankhya philosophy, questioning its lack of explanation for the origin, changes, and destruction of the material world, and emphasizing its ignorance of spiritual nature.

This is what Krishna explains in the Bhagavad Gita, 13th chapter. But this atheistic Sankhya philosophers headed by atheist Kapila, they say this matter is everything. That's all that is there in existence. So, matter is manifest as these 24 elements, and these 24 elements combine, and so many varieties are produced, and they remain for some time, and afterwards everything is destroyed. So, material energy goes back to its unmanifested state, avyakta. But then who is actually causing material energy to come from the unmanifested state? From the unmanifested state to the manifest state, and remain for some time in the manifest state. In the manifest state, there are changes that are taking place. While this world exists as a material world, as a material universe, there are so many changes that are taking place. There are no explanations for this. They say it's automatic. And then, finally, what about destruction? Who brings about this destruction? How does destruction take place? But all the manifestations, they go back to their elemental state of the unmanifested condition of material energy, even before the five elements are formed. So, who is doing all this? How is it happening? There are no explanations. They say it's all nature. Nature. Who is behind nature? Whose nature? We had asked that question. Whose nature? Where is the nature? Where is the direction coming from? Where is the direction coming from for all these changes to take place in a definite way, in a systematic way? So, that they have no logical explanation. They have no reasonable, intelligent explanation. So, any intelligent person can understand these people are ignorant about the total reality.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of discussion, verse 1.17.19 of Srimad Bhagavatam, and outlines three philosophical viewpoints: karma mimamsa, atheistic Sankhya, and atomic philosophy.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will continue discussing the 19th verse of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is part 3 of the discussion. In the previous two sessions, we discussed the karma mimamsa philosophy, that is, karma is everything. You do good actions, everything is fine. If you do sinful activity, you will suffer. Then the second kind of philosophers, the atheistic Sankhya philosophers, who analyze material nature as the ultimate cause. Material nature consists of matter. Matter consists of 24 elements, and that they say is everything. Now, the third kind of philosophers, the philosophers headed by Kanada. They accept the combination of atoms as the original cause of the creation. Ultimately, they analyze entire material existence consists of material. Atoms, and that atom is the fundamental particle, and the combination of atoms, there are varieties of objects, persons, things, whatever, everything. Everything ultimately can be broken down only into an atom. So kana, kana means atom in Sanskrit. So this philosopher's name, the sage's name also Kanada because he is explaining everything in terms of atoms, so atomic philosophy.

**Key Quote:** "So, the Vedic conception of a material atom is different than the understanding of a material atom as given by today's scientists."
**Summary:** The speaker analyzes the defects in atomic philosophy, contrasting the Vedic concept of an indivisible atom with the modern scientific understanding of atoms consisting of subatomic particles.

It's also called atomic philosophy, the third kind. So let's analyze. What is the defect in this atomic philosophy? That yes, matter at the fundamental level is definitely the atom. Not the atom that is the fundamental. Not the atom that the modern day scientists and physicists call as atom because according to the Bhagavatam, the scriptures, our Vedic scriptures, atom is the indivisible particle, you cannot divide it any further, but these, our present day scientists, they say atom consists of subatomic particles. Like neutron, proton, electron, and so many more, now they have so many more. Photons, so many things they have. So they have not yet come to the atom, which is described in our scriptures, which is indivisible, cannot be divided any further. It is the smallest particle. So, very nicely, in the third canto, in a, this discussion between Vidura and Maitreya Muni, Maitreya Rishi. There is a clear description. Calculation of time from the atom. This is chapter, the eleventh chapter of the third canto. There, the calculation of time is given beginning from atomic time up to universal time. See, the smallest division of time that is given in our Vedic literature, in our scriptures is atomic time. And the largest division of time is the duration of this entire universe. So, atomic time to universal time is nicely explained in the third canto of the Bhagavatam and other places in the Vedic scriptures. So, the Vedic conception of a material atom is different than the understanding of a material atom as given by today's scientists. Of course, the scientists, when they make further advancement, they will one day come to understand what is this atom, which is described in the Vedic scriptures as the indivisible particle, ultimate particle, which is indivisible, cannot be divided.

**Key Quote:** "So, atomic time to universal time is nicely explained in the third canto of the Bhagavatam and other places in the Vedic scriptures."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the Vedic concept of time, from atomic time to universal time, highlighting the relative nature of time based on different planetary systems and referencing the duration of Brahma's day as described in the Bhagavad Gita.

So, they will come to that. If they take some more time, they will take time. Further advancement is required in material science. But, the scriptures are already explaining that ultimate indivisible particle called the material atom. So, that material atom, the time is measured based on the material atom. Time it takes for the sun to traverse that distance of the size of the atom that is called atomic time. It's very, very, very, very, very tiny. So the sun's movement is what is creating the concept or the perception of time, just like how do we know time is progressing? The movement of the sun. It's like we got day and night. So the sun rises and the sun comes overhead and then it sets. It rises in eastern direction and sets in the western direction and then after the sun sets there is darkness, that's the night, till again after about say about 12 hours again the sun rises. So this cyclically day and night constitute time. This is a unit of time called 24 hours account our measurement of the earth and then there is different planets different distance from the sun they have different measurement of time is relative time is related so the the higher planets the duration of their day and night much different their days are longer and than the day we experience on this earth planet and brahma loka brahma's 12 hours or brahma's day is described in the bhagavad gita sahasra yuga pariyantam maharyat brahmano vidhu.

**Key Quote:** "In the spiritual world there are no laws of karma, there are only laws of god which is the law of eternity."
**Summary:** The speaker continues explaining the calculation of time in relation to Brahma's day and night, contrasting the material world governed by karma with the eternal spiritual world beyond creation and destruction.

That sahasra yuga, that yuga is a cycle of four, satya, treta, dvapara, kali. So for us on earth planet as we measure time in terms of our sunrise and sunset when four yugas have completed one cycle that's called one maha yuga. So one thousand maha yugas constitute the duration of time of brahma's planet half a day. Half a day means the sunset to sunrise what we say as day twelve hours our twelve hours when our one thousand maha yugas have completed then brahma's twelve hours are over and similar duration is brahma's night another one thousand maha yugas on the earth planet is brahma's night so like this brahma's day and night is the longest day and night in the whole universe in our material universe but what the materialists do not know because they don't accept knowledge from the perfect source the supreme personality of godhead the parampara system of devotees descending from the supreme lord so they do not know that there is an eternal world beyond this material world of creation maintenance and destruction beyond this they do not know the materialists do not know so that eternal world there is no depth there is no creation or destruction there everything is eternal everything is ever existing so that understanding is lacking in modern science it is lacking in the atheistic philosophers or the people who analyze and study only everything in terms of matter or material atom or material elements or just the laws of karma laws of karma are working within this material world only in the spiritual world there are no laws of karma there are only laws of god which is the law of eternity the ways in which the husband is determined which karmic results simple cultural fertile movement in the Paradise where true love the supreme love of the supreme lord where to give love devotion.

**Key Quote:** "He does not know about spiritual atom which is smaller than the material atom. What is that spiritual atom? The individual spirit soul."
**Summary:** The speaker criticizes Kanada Rishi's atomic philosophy for focusing solely on the material atom and neglecting the spiritual atom (the individual soul) and the Supreme Soul (Krishna), ultimately deeming it a defective philosophy.

They do not know. They do not know anything about eternality. So that analysis of this material atom as a fundamental particle is only explanation of matter. Only explanation. That is what Kanada Rishi is establishing as the ultimate truth or reality is this atom, material atom, indivisible particle. He does not know that what atom he is speaking about as a fundamental particle is a material atom. He does not know about spiritual atom which is smaller than the material atom. What is that spiritual atom? The individual spirit soul. One 10,000 part of the tip of the hair point in size. Keshagra Shatabhagasya. This is described in the Upanishads also. Shrila Prabhupada explains this in the Bhagavad Gita. The Bhagavad Gita Krishna says the tiny spirit soul is the active principle within this body, living body. Because minus that spirit soul, this body is a dead body. What happens at time of death? The spirit soul, the individual soul leaves the body and then the body is the dead body, finished. No consciousness, no action, no sense, sense perception nothing so that spiritual particles spiritual atom that they are completely missing out this all these theoretical philosophers and of course the this theoretical philosopher who is the Canada and his followers they miss out this spiritual atom the spirit soul the spiritual particle that they miss out and of course they are completely ignorant about God Krishna the supreme soul supreme spirit that also they are completely ignorant so this is the defect of Kanada's analysis of what is the ultimate cause of this material existence of the world we are living in he is the ultimate cause of this material existence of the world we are living in he says material atom different combinations different types of objects and even life itself is simply when this body comes into existence there is life and when the atoms which are combined they disintegrate then there is no life after disintegration there is no life that is what is called a destruction or death Neta Siddesh Ganga caught the this a the stick philosopher ath Kunden Scherzer a solid the weight of but they don't know the conclusion of the weightors that krishna is the supreme personality of God at the supreme absolute truth the Ultimate Reality the cause of all causes and he is supremely powerful he has eternal aboard he has sla cousins he is extremely powerful he has eternal aboard and is the supreme far ther eternal existence, sanatana dhama, sanatana rupa, sanatana everything, everything eternal, that they have no understanding.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Pariksit Maharaj's encounter with Kali Purusha and the philosophical reply of the bull, who is actually the personality of religion (Dharma), emphasizing the importance of understanding philosophical truths through historical incidents in the Bhagavata Purana.

Pariksit Maharaj meeting Shukadev Goswami. So when Pariksit was ruling, Kali Yuga just was beginning, Kali Purusha was trying to enter Pariksit's kingdom, and Pariksit encountered this Kali Purusha, and he saw Pariksit saw this Kali Purusha beating cow and bull. Now he was questioning the cow and the bull, "Who is responsible for hurting you, harming you?" So the bull gives a very philosophical reply. That reply actually helps Pariksit understand. This is no ordinary bull, and he says that in his reply he will clarify this bull is actually the personality of religion, Dharma. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The statement of the bull, the personality of religion, was full of philosophy and knowledge, and the king was satisfied since he could understand that the suffering bull was not an ordinary one. It is not an ordinary bull. Unless one is perfectly conversant with the law of the Supreme Lord, one cannot speak such things touching philosophical truths." So Bhagavatam is such a scripture, you can read it in the book of Bhagavad Gita, and you can read it in the book of Bhagavad Gita, it explains the philosophical truths perfectly clearly, very nicely, and they are all connected with different events, incidents, historical incidents. Therefore, the Bhagavata Purana historical incidents, and these incidents are necessary to understand the truth of the Bhagavad Gita connected with the supreme personality of Godhead Krishna and the pure devotees of Krishna. So therefore, Bhagavata in relationship with Bhagavan, the devotee is called Bhagavata, this scripture is called Bhagavata in relationship with Krishna Bhagavata.

The bull has said that it is very difficult to ascertain the particular miscreant who is responsible for our suffering, why? Because there are multiple causes, it's not just one cause. This has been discussed in the Vedanta philosophy in very detailed way, and we went through some of those philosophies in the previous sessions, that some philosophers say the self is responsible, some philosophers say that superhuman powers are responsible, some say nature is the ultimate cause, some say only God is the cause. So all kinds of different philosophies do exist, but Bhagavatam declares the proper understanding of all the causes, and particularly Bhagavatam declares the supreme cause of everything, that is Krishna, sarva karana karanam, the supreme cause. Yet we cannot blame God for our suffering, even though ultimately God is the cause of all causes, the supreme cause of everything, but still we cannot blame. How we will understand from the purport. In the purport Srila Prabhupada says, "A devotee's conclusion is that no one is directly responsible for being a benefactor or mischief-monger without the sanction of the Lord."

**Key Quote:** "Whether the result of the action is beneficial for me or it is not beneficial it is harmful or it is a loss Both are God sent and thus it is his grace, God's grace."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the idea that both benefits and losses are God-sent and are ultimately God's grace, even though devotees may sometimes doubt this in the face of suffering.

You see, any action that has been committed to the Lord, even in this life, that takes place, there is a background for that action, because that action can take place only when the supreme lord, seated as Paramatma in the heart of everyone, has to sanction that act, good or bad, harmful or beneficial. Therefore, Srila Prabhupada says further, he means the devotee does not consider anyone to be directly responsible for such action. So nobody is directly responsible because there are a chain of causes and effects, but in both the cases, he takes it for granted that either benefit or loss is God sent, because in both cases, God is a sanctioner. Krishna is Paramatma in the heart of the performer of the action is sanctioning that action. So therefore, a devotee understands whether the result of the action is beneficial for me or it is not beneficial, it is harmful or it is a loss. Both are God sent, and thus it is His grace, God's grace. In case of benefit, no one will deny that it is God sent, because especially devotees, they always are dependent on the mercy of the Lord, and they are very pleased to receive God's mercy in the shape of so many nice benefits that they derive in any situation. But in case of loss or reverses, one becomes doubtful about how the Lord could be so unkind to His devotee as to put him in great difficulty.

**Key Quote:** "If I am being harmed by another person, I am equally responsible for getting the suffering, as much as the person who is inflicting the suffering also is responsible, has to take the reaction for that sin."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how a devotee should understand suffering caused by others, using the example of Jesus Christ, and emphasizing that the devotee is equally responsible for the suffering due to past karma.

So how to understand, especially how can a devotee understand that if I am suffering due to somebody's mistreatment, ill treatment, just like the bull was directly being beaten by Kalipurusha. So how can Kalipurusha beat a devotee? Because unless God sanctions Kalipurusha's intention or desire to beat, Kalipurusha cannot do any harm independently. So then why would God sanction a devotee being beaten by a miscreant? Prabhupada gives an example. Jesus Christ was seemingly put into such great difficulty being crucified by the ignorant, but he was never angry at the mischief mongers. This is a fact. Pure devotees, acharyas, and great saintly persons, they know that in any difficult circumstances, they never blame the person who is the immediate cause of the problem. That is the way of accepting a thing either favorable or unfavorable. Thus for a devotee, the identifier is equally a sinner like the mischief monger. That means, if I am being harmed by another person, I am equally responsible for getting the suffering, as much as the person who is inflicting the suffering also is responsible, has to take the reaction for that sin, and I deserve to get that. That is the way of accepting a sin. This is the way of getting the great sin. This is how the person who is suffering from that sin can get a sense of loosing the sense of love, and this is the way of getting the great evil. See, the great evil, the right way to get rid of evil is not just to have the wrong action. This is a great way to end it. Life has a heart, the right way, the left way, the right way, and the right way to face the situation.

**Key Quote:** "A devotee tolerates all difficulties or dangers or any harm by thinking that due to my own past sinful activities in the past, my own past sinful activities, I deserve to suffer much more."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotees tolerate difficulties by recognizing them as a small punishment for past sins and maintaining Krishna consciousness under all circumstances to return to Godhead.

So, by God's grace, the devotee tolerates all reverses. There are some words in the Bhagavatam, in a later canto, in the tenth canto, Tatenu Kampam Susamikshamano Bhunjana Evatmakrutam Vipakam. A devotee tolerates all difficulties or dangers or any harm by thinking that due to my own past sinful activities in the past, my own past sinful activities, I deserve to suffer much more. But by Krishna's grace, I am getting a very small token of punishment. So let me just suffer. Let me not forget Krishna, even in the midst of difficulty or danger. And let me never forget Krishna, even if I am going through some happiness or going through some period where I have lot of benefits or lot of good things coming my way. In either case, I don't want to forget Krishna. My destination is to go back to Godhead, and I simply have to be Krishna conscious. That's all under all circumstances.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that devotees depend on Krishna in all situations, maintain Krishna consciousness, and ultimately return to Godhead, regardless of the circumstances of their lives.

Therefore, Maharaj Pariksit could understand that the bull was no other than the personality of religion himself. In other words, a devotee has no suffering at all because so called suffering is God's grace for a devotee who sees God in everything. The cow and bull never die. The cow and bull never placed any complaint before the king for being tortured by the personality of Kali, although everyone lodges such complaints before the state authorities. The extraordinary behavior of the bull made the king conclude that the bull was certainly the personality of religion, for no one else could understand the finer intricacies of the codes of religion. So therefore, the conclusion is that there are mudras. There are multiple causes and a devotee depends upon Krishna under all circumstances and by Krishna's grace, the devotee is able to go through all situations in Krishna consciousness and ultimately go back to Godhead, irrespective of whether there was suffering in the course of living life in this body or there was some enjoyment or there was some peace or there was some chaos. Whatever be the situation, devotees simply are Krishna conscious and they go back to Godhead at the end of life.

#### inconceivable energies of the Lord, devotee's perspective, karma, illusory energy (Maya)
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/xsLpu-f0ZTY?t=51
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The material energy is always provoking doubts about the supreme authority of the Lord."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the inconceivable nature of the Lord's energies, the role of Maya, and how a devotee should not blame others or the Lord for difficulties, understanding the chain of cause and effect and the influence of past karma.

In this session we will be discussing from the 23rd verse of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. अथवा देवामायाया नूनम गतिर अगोचरा चेतसो वचसस्चापी भूतानाम इति निष्चयहा The meaning of this 23rd verse is, "Thus it is concluded that the Lord's energies are inconceivable. No one can estimate them by mental speculation or by word." Now, this is a conclusion that is drawn by Pariksit Maharaj. The Lord's energies are inconceivable. The Lord's energies are working, especially in this material world and even in the spiritual world. But in the spiritual world it is the spiritual energy, internal potency which is working. And in the material world it is the external potency, the material energy which is working. Both of them are controlled, owned, directed by the Supreme Lord only. Krishna only is the owner, controller, director, master of all the energies. So, by mental speculation we cannot figure out how the Lord's energies are working. How the Lord's energies are working in different circumstances. We cannot make calculation, material calculation. That's impossible. So, in the Purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, "A question may be raised as to why a devotee should refrain from identifying an actor, although he knows definitely that the Lord is the ultimate doer of everything. A devotee does not blame anyone for any difficulty or danger." A doer knows the problem he may be facing. Why? Even though he knows that the Lord is the ultimate doer. But that doesn't mean he blames the Lord. Neither he blames the person who is the immediate cause. And therefore he also blames the Lord as the person who is the immediate cause, because there are a chain of causes and defects. And every effect there is a cause, and every cause there is a particular justification why, why that cause is actually being sanctioned by the law. Knowing the ultimate doer, one should not pose himself as ignorant of the actual performer. So, it's not that because anyway, ultimately, every person suffers because of his or her own past bad karma, I or anyone else doesn't have the license to inflict harm on others, that is not a license. It's just like sometimes people say, anyway, the animal is going to die. So, if I kill it for some food, what is wrong there? It's going to die. Animal is not the body. After all, I can only kill the body. I cannot kill the soul. Animal or the living entity is the soul. So, this reasoning or argument is not correct, is invalid. The perpetrator of a sinful activity is definitely responsible for this sinful action, and is going to be punished by God's laws, the laws of karma. Of this, there is no doubt at all. Yet, when the sinful action is sanctioned by the Lord, then there is a higher cause. So, it is said here, to answer this doubt, the reply is that the Lord is also not directly responsible for everything, is done by his deputed maya shakti or material energy. In the material world, maya shakti, material energy is working. In every case, every material action, material energy is working. The material energy is always provoking doubts about the supreme authority of the Lord, because we directly don't see the Lord's hand in every action in this material world. But still, the fact is, the Lord is always in the background, and he only is directing the material energy. The personality of religion knew perfectly well that nothing can take place without the sanction of the Supreme Lord, and still he was put into doubts by the deluding energy. And thus, he refrained from mentioning the supreme cause. This doubtfulness was due to the contamination of both Kali and the material energy. When dharma does not complain against the Kali Purusha, so, does it mean that, oh, Kali Purusha is not directly responsible, so, he is not a culprit. So, Pariksit need not punish him? No, that is incorrect. At the same time, the Lord is sanctioning, only then Kali Purusha can do some harm. So, Lord is responsible? No, the Lord is not responsible. The whole atmosphere of the age of Kali is magnified by the deluding energy, and the proportion of measurement is inexplicable. The material world always, Maya's actions are definitely the direct cause of any suffering that anybody may undergo. But then, our own past sinful actions are also responsible. We are responsible. So, how does this illusory energy work? Is the question that may be raised. So, it is not easy to understand the working of the illusory energy in each and every case.

#### illusory energy (Maya), Markandeya Rishi, prayer, spiritual practice

**Key Quote:** "I wish to see your illusory potency, by whose influence the entire world, together with its ruling demigods, consider reality to be materially variegated."
**Summary:** This segment introduces the story of Markandeya Rishi, who prayed to see the Lord's illusory energy in action, highlighting his detachment from material benefits and his desire to understand Maya's influence.

So, I want to briefly narrate a particular description in the 12th Kant of the Bhagavatam. Tiruvannamalai. There was one Markandeya Rishi. He once prayed to the Supreme Lord, "I want to see your illusory energy in action." Because he is himself a great tapasvi, he is situated above the influence of the illusory energy. But he is seeing the illusory energy working. So many people are under the clutches of maya and they are engaged in either material enjoyment or they sometimes suffer and they are in ignorance and they are perpetually in the cycle of birth and death. They have no clue how to get out because of ignorance. So how is this material energy working? I wanted to see. This is what Markandeya wanted to actually ask the Lord. So once when Markandeya Rishi was sitting in his ashram performing his spiritual practice, the Supreme Lord appeared in his incarnation as Naranarayanarishi, the twin sages. And Markandeya Rishi received Naranarayanarishi very nicely. And after they had been offered all kinds of good reception, according to Vedic culture, then when they were seated, Markandeya Rishi offered nice prayers to them and the Lord, being satisfied, asked him, "You can ask any benediction that you desire." So he said, "I am not interested in any material benefit," knowing very well that they are useless from a spiritual perspective. "But I want to... I wish to see your illusory potency, by whose influence the entire world, together with its ruling demigods, consider reality to be materially variegated." They mistake this material energy itself to be the absolute truth. No. Material energy is not the absolute truth. Krishna is the absolute truth. Krishna is in the background. Material energy is completely controlled, directed, owned by Krishna. Now, Markandeya's prayer to the Supreme Lord was accepted. And Supreme Lord said, "So be it." And they departed for their ashram in Badrikashram. Thinking always of his desire to see the Lord's illusory energy, Markandeya Rishi remained in his ashram, meditating constantly upon the Lord within fire, the sun, the moon, the water, the earth, the air, lightning, his own heart, and worshipping him with paraphernalia conceived in his mind.

**Key Quote:** "Even as Markandeya looked on, the rain pouring down from the clouds filled the ocean more and more and more until the great sea covered up the earth's islands, mountains, continents."
**Summary:** This segment describes the devastating flood created by the Lord's illusory energy, showing Markandeya Rishi's experience of fear, hunger, and disorientation as he wandered through the deluge.

One day, while Markandeya Rishi was performing his evening worship, suddenly a great wind arose. That wind created a terrible sound and brought in its wake fearsome clouds that were accompanied by lightning and roaring thunder. And the clouds poured down torrents of rain. Then on all sides, Markandeya Rishi saw the four great oceans swelling up. And there was gusty wind. And these oceans were filled with sea monsters. And they were very, very fearsome. There were whirlpools. The sage saw all the inhabitants of the universe, including himself, tormented by the harsh winds. The bolts of lightning, the great waves rising beyond the sky, the whole earth became flooded, and he became perplexed and fearful. Remember, Markandeya Rishi had prayed to the Lord, "I want to see your illusory energy in action." And now, actually the Lord is showing him what is my illusory energy like. Even as Markandeya looked on, the rain pouring down from the clouds filled the ocean more and more and more until the great sea covered up the earth's islands, mountains, continents. Completely the earth became submerged. Not only that water flooded the earth, but it also flooded the outer space, heaven, celestial region. Entire expanse of the universe was flooded in all directions. And it appeared like only Markandeya Rishi remained alive in that flood, great deluge, devastating flood. His matted hair scattered. The great sage wandered about alone in the water as if dumb and blind. He didn't know where to go, what to do. He's alive. He's somehow floating. And he doesn't know where to go and what to do. He was also tormented by hunger and thirst. He was attacked by monstrous makaras and timingala fish. Makaras means crocodiles. And very dangerous crocodiles which are huge. You can easily swallow up hundreds of Markandeya Rishis. And timingala fish. These fishes are very, very dangerous. They can devour an entire big blue sea whale. Huge. As big as ocean liners. That is attacked by a timingala. Timingala is very, very dangerous. So he saw timingala fishes. He saw monstrous crocodiles. And he was battered by the wind and waves. He moved aimlessly in the infinite darkness into which he had fallen. Suddenly, he saw millions of years pass like that, wandering in that huge flood. His mind bewildered by the illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Vishnu.

**Summary:** This segment narrates Markandeya Rishi's encounter with the infant Vata Patra Shayi, his experience of being inside the Lord's body, and his eventual return to his ashram, illustrating the power and mystery of the Lord's illusory energy.

Once while wandering in the water, millions of years have passed, this Brahmana Markandeya Rishi discovered a small island. Now on this small island was a young banyan tree. And it was having... It was unaffected by that flood, by the hurricane wind, by the violent storm, everything. This stood with nice fruits and nice blossoms of flowers. Now on a branch of that tree, he saw an infant boy, small boy, lying within a leaf. The child's effulgence was swallowing up the darkness. The infant's dark blue complexion was the color of a flawless emerald. His lotus face shone with a wealth of beauty. His throat bore marks like the lines of a conch shell. This is the Supreme Lord appearing in that form, Vata Patra Shai. He is lying on a banyan leaf, and he was sucking the toe within his mouth. So Markandeya when he saw the child, all his fatigue vanished. And just looking at the child, he felt great joy within his heart. Now who is this infant? He tried to go near the infant. And suddenly the child inhaled everything, and Markandeya found himself within the body of the child. And inside he found the universe was as it was before the dissolution. He was astonished. He saw the heavens. He saw the earth. He saw the stars. He saw the mountains. He saw everything. And he saw before him his own Badra river, his own hermitage. Now as he was kind of thinking, oh now the illusion is over, suddenly the infant exhaled and expelled the sage out of its abdomen. And he was back into the ocean of dissolution. At that moment that child, when he came out, became again visible, invisible, became invisible. And suddenly everything vanished. The whole storm and the oceans which were flooded, everything vanished. And Markandeya Rishi found himself in his ashram, as he was seated. So this was the display of the illusory energy by the Lord. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 24th verse of the 17th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining how Dharma, represented as a bull, stood on four legs (austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness) in Satya Yuga, but gradually lost three legs as the ages progressed.

In this session we will be discussing from the 24th verse of the 17th chapter of the 1st canto of Shri Madbhagavatam Tapashaucham Dayasatyam Iti Pada Kriteyam Kriyate Krutah Adharmam Shais Trayobhagna Smaya Sanga Madais Tava. The meaning of this verse is: In the age of Satya, truthfulness, your four legs were established by the four principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. But it appears that three of your legs are broken due to rampant irreligion in the form of pride, lust for women and intoxication. So Parikshit Maharaj is speaking to the personality of religious principle dharma, the bull in the shape of the bow. That dharma in the beginning of the cycle of four yugas in Satya yuga was established on four legs, four pillars of dharma, what are they? Austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. Tapaha, Shaucham, Daya, Satyam. Tapa means austerity, Shaucham means cleanliness, Daya means mercy, Satyam means truthfulness.

But by the time the ages rotate, time passes by, Satya, Treta, Dwapara, Kali. So from Satya yuga to Treta yuga, one of the leg is broken. Then from Treta yuga to Dwapara yuga, transition, one more leg is broken. And from Dwapara yuga to Kali yuga, yet one more pillar of religion is broken. So in Kali yuga, at the beginning of Kali yuga, Dharma is left with only one principle that is truthfulness. The other three principles...

**Key Quote:** "If we refrain from these four pillars of sinful life, then we are in the material world...Then, we can remain aloof from the influence of maya."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Prabhupada, explaining that the influence of Maya is proportional to our attraction to sinful activities, particularly intoxication, meat-eating, illicit sex, and gambling, and that refraining from these allows us to remain aloof from Maya's influence.

...and mercy are broken. Now, how are they broken? It is described here, they are broken due to rampant irreligion in the form of pride, lust for women and intoxication. So, Prabhupada explains this in the purport very nicely. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, the deluding energy or material nature can act upon the living beings proportionately in terms of the living beings falling prey to the deluding attraction of maya. We are in the material world, the material energy, maya is acting. But maya's action or influence is possible only if we become attracted by maya's allurements to enjoy, engage in sinful activities. Otherwise, if we refrain from sinful activities, particularly in Kali Yuga, four kinds of sinful activities: intoxication, meat eating, illicit sex and gambling. If we refrain from these four pillars of sinful life, then we are in the material world. We are in the material world.

**Key Quote:** "Don't get attracted. Don't get captivated by some, some illusion, illusory energies display of some opportunity for enjoyment in sinful ways. Don't get captivated."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of moths drawn to fire, the speaker explains how Maya captivates conditioned souls with illusions of enjoyment, warning against attraction to sinful activities and emphasizing the need to surrender to the Lord to overcome Maya's power.

Then, we can remain aloof from the influence of maya. So, that will be explained now by Srila Prabhupada in a little more detail. Prabhupada says, there is a standard example given in the scriptures. Moths are captivated by the glaring brightness of light and thus they become prey to the fire. Similarly, the deluding energy, deluding energy means the energy which influences us to become illusioned, is always captivating the conditioned souls to become prey to the fire of delusion. And the various scriptures warn the conditioned souls not to become prey to delusion, but to get rid of it. Don't get attracted. Don't get captivated by some illusion, illusory energies, illusory energies display of some opportunity for enjoyment in sinful ways. Don't get captivated. The Vedas warn us, not to go to the darkness of ignorance, but to the progressive path of light, tamasoma jyotir gama. Tamasoma. Don't remain in darkness or don't go more into darkness. Come out of darkness and go towards light. The Lord himself also warns that the deluding power of material energies is too powerful to overcome. Daivi, Hesha, Gunamayi, Mamamaya, Durakyaya. It's too powerful. Durakyaya. But one who completely surrenders unto the Lord can easily do so, can easily actually overcome. Ma mevaye prapadyante maya metam tarantite.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that surrendering to Krishna is not easy but is made possible by practicing austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness, which are the pillars of religious principles, and that surrender is the key to overcoming the illusory energy.

But to surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is also not very easy. Such surrender is possible by persons of austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness. So on the one side are four things. So on the one side are four pillars of sinful life. The deluding energy, the illusory energy is attracting the conditioned souls come enjoy in sinful ways. Other side are the four pillars of religion, religious principles. Now simply avoiding sinful activities alone does not enable a person to surrender to Krishna. That is required. In addition to avoiding sinful activities one has to practice the principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness. Then it is possible to surrender to Krishna. And by surrendering to Krishna one can overcome the influence of the illusory energy completely.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the ideal state of Satya Yuga, where everyone was a qualified Brahman, unaffected by Maya, and how the decline of Brahmanical culture (austerity, cleanliness, mercy, truthfulness) led to the rise of pride, attachment, and intoxication, pushing society away from salvation.

These four principles of advanced civilization were remarkable features in the age of Satya. The first age in the cycle of four yugas. Satya Yuga. In that age every human being was practically a qualified Brahman of the highest order. And in the social orders of life they were all Paramahamsas or the topmost in the renounced order. All human beings were of the topmost class in the Satya Yuga. By cultural standing the human beings were not at all subjected to deluding energy. They were not affected by Maya in Satya Yuga. All the human beings. Such strong men of character were competent enough to get away from the clutches of Maya. But gradually as the principles of Brahmanical culture. What are the principles of Brahmanical culture? Austerity. Cleanliness. Mercy. Truthfulness. Austerity is Tapa. Shaucham. Tapa is austerity. Shaucham is cleanliness. Daya is mercy. Satya is truthfulness. As these principles became curtailed by proportionate development of pride, attachment for women and intoxication.

The path of salvation or the path of transcendental bliss retreated far far away from human society. With the progression of the age of Kali people are becoming very proud. They are becoming too much attached to women. Women means I will explain this. And intoxication. Here women means objects of enjoyment, especially objects of sex pleasure. This characteristic of Kali Yuga. People are more and more and more after sex pleasure. And they are very easily become attached and attracted, attracted and hence attached to enjoyment with the member of the opposite sex, whether women or men.

**Summary:** The speaker continues describing Kali Yuga, noting that even the poorest are proud of their possessions, women dress attractively to entice men, and people are addicted to intoxication, leading to irreligiosity and corruption that cannot be solved by laws alone.

This is the characteristic of Kali Yuga. By the influence of the age of Kali, Srila Prabhupada explains further. Even a pauper is proud of his penny, as far as pride is concerned. There is no reason to be proud for a person who has very very very little money in his possession. But even the poorest of poor fellow, if he gets some money, little, few rupees let's say nowadays, few rupees, he is very proud. Oh I have so much wealth. I am a very rich person. He thinks like that. He becomes proud. The women are always dressed in an overly attractive fashion to victimize the minds of men. You see, the dressing fashion of the women in Kali Yuga, simply to attract men for sex enjoyment. They dress in a very bad way. And the man is addicted to drinking wine, smoking, drinking tea, chewing tobacco, etc. All varieties of intoxication. Hmm. All these habits or so called advanced under civilization are the root causes of all irreligiosities. And therefore it is not possible to check corruption, bribery and nepotism. Lot of people talk about too much corruption. Too much corruption. How to root out this corruption? So the root cause of corruption is being pointed out here. What is it? All these Irreligiosities. If people are addicted to intoxication, they are addicted to sex pleasures, they are addicted to more and more possessions, greed for possessions, because of which they become overly proud of possessing many things, then it is not possible to avoid corruption. Man cannot check all these evils simply by statutory acts and police vigilance.

**Key Quote:** "It is actually a disease which is within the mind."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the propensity for sinful enjoyment is a disease of the mind, curable by practicing austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness, and criticizes modern economic development for creating scarcity of essential commodities like grains and vegetables.

But he can cure the disease of the mind by the proper medicine. It is actually a disease which is within the mind. This propensity for enjoyment by sinful activities is a disease of the mind. And what is the cure for this? The proper medicine for this disease of the mind. It is the principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness, which have to be followed by people in order to cure the mind of these propensities for sinful enjoyment. Modern civilization and economic development are creating a new situation of poverty and scarcity, with the result of blackmailing the consumers commodities. We can see that so many goods are produced but they are not growing grains. So many factories for manufacturing so many unnecessary things, anartha. But the most essential commodities, specially grains, fruits, vegetables, which is required for even survival of the human beings and the animals, that is not being produced enough.

**Key Quote:** "But it appears that three of your legs are broken due to rampant irreligion in the form of pride, lust for women and intoxication."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (1.17.24) which discusses the decline of dharma in Kali Yuga due to pride, lust, and intoxication.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet Om Namah Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam In this session, we continue to discuss the same words which we discussed in the previous session, the 24th verse of the 17th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is part 2 of discussion of the same words. The verse I will just recite again, the 24th verse. Tapasyaucham Dayasatyam Iti Pada Krite Kritaah Adharma Amshaihi Trayobhagnaha Smayasangamadai Stava The meaning of this verse, the 24th verse. In the age of Satya, in the Satya Yuga or age of truthfulness, your four legs were established by the four principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. But it appears that three of your legs are broken due to rampant irreligion in the form of pride, lust for women and intoxication.

**Key Quote:** "The influence of Maya is proportionate to the extent to which I become captivated by Maya's allurement for enjoying sinfully."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the influence of Maya is directly related to one's desire for sinful enjoyment.

So in the purport which we discussed in the previous session, part 1 of this presentation of the same verse, it is explained that the influence of Maya is proportionate to the extent to which I become captivated by Maya's allurement for enjoying sinfully. Understand this very carefully. Maya is alluring. Come, enjoy sinfully. And if I think, oh let me enjoy because I am seeking happiness. Let me enjoy, even if it is in a sinful way, let me enjoy. Then I become prey to the influence of Maya. So the scriptures are warning, don't be captivated by Maya's allurement. Now somebody may say, why should Krishna arrange Maya to allure us in the first place? That is because we have desire for enjoying in that sinful way. We have developed that desire. Why are we here in the material world? Because of our desire to enjoy materially. Materially means sinfully. So, if we have desire for enjoyment, then only we will become captivated by Maya's allurement.

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna says, I am sex life, which is in accordance with religious principles."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of a teetotaler and a liquor store, the speaker illustrates how desire makes one susceptible to Maya's allurements and explains that Krishna is sex life which is in accordance with religious principles.

To give a very simple example, if, let us say, you are a complete teetotaller, you completely abstain from drinking any liquor. You don't take any liquor. You are strict in never touching even liquor. Now, you are walking in the market, on the street, when there are so many shops. Now, when you pass by a liquor store, either you don't even pay attention, or if you see, oh, liquor store. Okay, I have nothing to do with it. You just go by, pass by. You have nothing to do with liquor store. But somebody who is addicted to drinking liquor, or liquor store, the moment he sees, or gets the smell, or gets some idea of a liquor store, immediately so much attraction to enter the liquor store, to find out what is new, to buy something, or to taste something, or to consider enjoying some drink, etc. So, like that, the same principle that works in this material world is, if I have a desire in my heart, I want to enjoy sex pleasure. If I have a desire. And that too, I am having a desire to enjoy in sinful ways. Because, Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, dharma aviruddha kamosmi bhara tarshama dharma aviruddha bhuteshu kamosmi bhara tarshama Krishna says, I am sex life, which is in accordance with religious principles. Sex life has a place in this material world to bring forth Krishna conscious progeny, to bring forth devotees. So, sex life is required.

**Key Quote:** "Sinful activity means a sinful reaction."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the consequences of sinful activities and emphasizes the importance of Krishna consciousness as a means to overcome illusion and suffering.

But, if that sex life is indulged in simply for the sake of sex enjoyment, and don't want to take any steps for following the religious principles in engaging in sex, without following the religious principles, simply because some people, they want to enjoy sex life sinfully, then maya captures such people, and then maya punishes them. Sinful activity means a sinful reaction. The laws are very, very stringent. Nobody can avoid it. So, there is suffering, there is punishment for sinful activities, and they are allured by maya because they have deep-rooted desire for sinful enjoyment. So, the Vedas are warning us, do not go to darkness of ignorance, tamaseema, jyotir gama, but go to the progressive path of light. Maya is compared to darkness. Maya hoya andhakaar. Krishna suryasama. Krishna or the spiritual path is compared to light. And if we can come out of darkness by coming into light of Krishna consciousness, then we are completely safe. We are saved from the illusion. No more illusion can bewilder us. No more illusion will allure us. No more illusion will be even present.

Illusion will disappear. Just like darkness can disappear as soon as there is light. So, continue to read the purport from where I stopped in the previous session. Prabhupada was describing that in this age of Kali, there is so much of corruption, bribery, nepotism. Now, what is the root cause of all these evils in Kali Yuga? Nobody likes them. But what is the root cause of all these evils? So, Prabhupada says in this purport that these evils are having a root cause. That is, the people in Kali Yuga not following the principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness.

**Key Quote:** "Spiritual practices meant for material gain is actually a cheating religious system."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that spiritual practices performed for material gain are considered cheating religion and that Krishna never sanctions money for material enjoyment.

The modern civilization and economic development in this present age, they are creating so much of imbalance in the life of people. So much of imbalance. Imbalance, that means no balance between material and spiritual activities. No balance. Practically, no spiritual activities. Or even if somebody is practicing some spiritual life, it is simply very, very meager or it is simply for the sake of these material benefits. So, Bhagavatam declares spiritual practices meant for material gain is actually a cheating religious system. Dharma projjita kaitava atra. Bhagavatam rejects all such materially motivated religious systems. That means, going and praying to a devata or Krishna, simply I want money for material enjoyment. This is kaitava dharma. This is cheating religion. Krishna never sanctions as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, money for material enjoyment. Krishna never sanctions. And the devatas, they simply are bound by the laws of nature to award according to certain rules, certain regulations. So, they cannot consider

**Key Quote:** "If the leaders and rich men of the society spend 50% of their accumulated wealth mercifully for the misled mass of people and educate them in God Consciousness, the knowledge of Bhagavatam, certainly the age of Kali will be defeated in its attempt to entrap the conditioned souls."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how wealth and power can be used for religious or irreligious purposes and suggests that leaders and rich individuals should dedicate a significant portion of their wealth to educating people in God consciousness to counteract the negative influence of Kali Yuga.

or they do not consider or they cannot consider the merit of the person who is praying for certain benefit. They cannot consider the devatas. So, if somebody is approaching a devata, according to the Vedic descriptions, for getting some wealth, then they will get the wealth if they follow all the rules and regulations. Now, after getting the wealth, how they utilize the wealth, the devata cannot actually regulate. Devata cannot regulate. So, it is up to the person who has got wealth or who has got power or who has got some knowledge, or who has got some resource. How to utilize that resource? The resource can be utilized in a religious way or an irreligious way. Now, Kali Yuga, the influence of Kali is such that the sinful desires are too many and there are too many opportunities for fulfilling the sinful desires in sinful ways because the people are sinfully inclined to enjoy material. So, Srila Prabhupada says, if the leaders and rich men of the society spend 50% of their accumulated wealth mercifully for the misled mass of people and educate them in God Consciousness, the knowledge of Bhagavatam, certainly the age of Kali will be defeated in its attempt to entrap the conditioned souls.

**Key Quote:** "The preaching of Bhagavatam principles will automatically cleanse away the dirt in the heart of the people and make people austere, clean, both inside and outside, merciful to the suffering and truthful in daily behavior."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of disseminating the knowledge of Bhagavatam to cleanse people's hearts and establish the principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness, ultimately leading to peace in society.

There is a solution. The rich people, the powerful people, should spend 50% of their wealth for educating the common people in Krishna Consciousness. Simply through disseminating this Bhagavatam, knowledge given in the Bhagavatam, the attractive pastimes of Krishna and his pure devotees, making people hear that, making people hear Sankirtana, chant Hare Krishna, nice music, nice japa, and distributing prasadam, then people's mind will become cleansed of the dirt accumulated due to the influence of Kali. And then Maya will be defeated. Kali will be defeated and Maya will be defeated. And also Prabhupada says here, false pride or too high an estimation of one's own values of life, undue attachment to women or association with them, simply for the sake of sex pleasure, and intoxication, addiction to intoxication, will divert human civilization from the path of peace. However much people may clamor for peace in the world, people want peace. But simply if you simply desire peace and have big peace conferences and peace talks and peace propagation of peaceful way of living, that's not going to work as long as people's heart is contaminated by desire for sex enjoyment, sinful activities, you cannot have peace in the society at all. The preaching of Bhagavatam principles will automatically cleanse away the dirt in the heart of the people and make people austere, clean, both inside and outside, merciful to the suffering and truthful in daily behavior. These four principles or pillars of religion are automatically established by preaching the Bhagavatam principles. This is the way of correcting the flaws in the human society. This is what Prabhupada is teaching us in this purport. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Kali Yuga began about 5,000 years ago when Krishna appeared at the end of Dwapar Yuga."
**Summary:** This segment introduces the Kali Yuga, its duration, its beginning with Krishna's departure, and its influence of godlessness, which was initially mitigated by Krishna conscious kings.

This chapter is entitled Punishment and Reward of Kali. Kali represents the Kali Yuga, the present age. Time is passing on this earth planet and is measured in terms of the number of years, a particular age called Yuga. It's a very, very big time period. Like Kali Yuga, the present age, lasts 432,000 years or we can say 4,32,000 years. Kali Yuga began about 5,000 years ago when Krishna appeared at the end of Dwapar Yuga. Kali Yuga and Krishna went back to his personal abode after winding up his pastimes. The day Krishna left this earth planet and went back to his personal kingdom, that is when Kali Yuga began. But the influence of the age of Kali, which is to bring in godlessness, but the influence was actually not felt by the people because of the wonderful administration of Parikshit Maharaj and similar Krishna conscious kings.

**Key Quote:** "In a civilization where God is conspicuously banished and there is no devotee warrior like Arjuna the associates of the age of Kali take advantage of this lawless kingdom and arrange to kill innocent animals like the cow in secluded slaughterhouses."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Parikshit Maharaj's punishment of Kali, highlighting the importance of cow protection and drawing a parallel between the beating of a cow in seclusion and the modern-day slaughter of cows in slaughterhouses due to a godless society.

So the sixth verse. The meaning of this verse is, you rogue. It is Parikshit Maharaj addressing that Kali Purusha, the personality of Kali, who is beating a common bull in a secluded place. Parikshit is addressing that Kali Purusha. The meaning of this verse is, you rogue. Do you dare beat an innocent cow because Lord Krishna and Arjuna, the carrier of Gandiva bow, are out of sight? Since you are beating the innocent in a secluded place, you are considered a culprit and therefore deserve to be killed. So the king is pointing out the action of this Kali Purusha is a criminal act and therefore he deserves to be killed, death sentence or death penalty, because an innocent cow is beaten in a secluded place, so the cow should be given all kinds of protection against any harm, including even just beating the cow. So in the purport Srila Prabhupada says, "In a civilization where God is conspicuously banished and there is no devotee warrior like Arjuna, the associates of the age of Kali take advantage of this lawless kingdom and arrange to kill innocent animals like the cow in secluded..."

**Key Quote:** "Our present civilization is more or less a godless civilization as far as the rulers are concerned."
**Summary:** This segment compares the present civilization to the beginning of Kali Yuga, emphasizing the absence of God in governance, the disregard for Dharma Shastras, and the resulting lawless kingdom where innocent animals are killed in secluded slaughterhouses.

Srila Prabhupada is comparing the present day status of the society is somewhat similar to the situation being described which Parikshita encountered the beginning of Kali Yuga. So our present civilization is more or less a godless civilization as far as the rulers are concerned. Those in power, political power or those in governmental authority, they don't conduct the state in terms of the codes given by God, the codes given in our authorized Vedic scriptures. They don't conduct the state in terms of the codes given by God, the codes given in our authorized Vedic scriptures. In short, they don't conduct the governance in accordance with the Dharma Shastras: The Manu Smriti, Parashara Smriti, or Yajna Valkya Smriti. Perfect codes are given, perfect laws are given. They are not man-made laws. They are given by liberated souls. They are not man-made laws. They are given by liberated souls. They are not man-made laws. They are given by liberated souls. So there is no mistake in them. Neither there is any need to amend those laws from time to time. There is no need of any amendment. They are perfect laws. So these present day rulers in this Kali Yuga especially, God is conspicuously banished from their governance. It's a godless state. And the person's ruling are not exactly like Arjuna or Pariksit Maharaj in terms of conducting the state affairs in order to maintain law and order. They don't conduct themselves properly. Then, as Prabhupada says here, the associates of the age of Kali take advantage of this lawless kingdom and arrange to kill innocent animals like the cow in secluded slaughterhouses.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Such murderers of animals stand to be condemned to death by the order of a pious king like Maharaj Pariksit."
**Summary:** This segment condemns the killing of animals as murder, punishable by death according to a pious king like Parikshit Maharaj, drawing a comparison to the murder of an innocent child in a secluded place.

Nobody knows how the cow suffers in the slaughterhouse. Formerly the killing was done in the butcher shop if at all animals were to be killed for meat. But now, especially in the modernized states where modern technology is employed, the people eat packed meat and they think it is like packed vegetables or packed biscuits or packed grains. Like that they think. No, it is not that. It is very cruel killing of the animals who suffer so much. Such murderers of animals. See the word Prabhupada uses is murder. That means somebody who is supposed to be protected is being killed unlawfully. Is being killed unlawfully. So such murderers of animals stand to be condemned to death by the order of a pious king like Maharaj Pariksit. Pariksit Maharaj will not tolerate such a killing. He doesn't even tolerate a beating of a cow. What to speak of killing an animal like cow. For a pious king the culprit who kills an animal in a secluded place is punishable by the death penalty exactly like a murderer who kills an innocent child in a secluded place. Prabhupada gives a comparison. If a child is killed it is helpless. Supposing it is killed by some rogue. That is the term used by Prabhupada for this Kali Purusha who is beating an innocent cow in a secluded place. So it is exactly like killing a child. Same way if a child is killed, innocent child is killed in a secluded place, then the murderer is punishable by the death sentence. Exactly like that. Even the one who harms a cow should be actually punished by death penalty.

The seventh verse: Tvamva brunala dhavalaha paadai niunah. padacharan vrisharoopena kim kashchid devonah parikhedayan. The meaning is, then he, Maharaj Pariksit, asked the bull, "O who are you? Are you a bull as white as a white lotus? Or are you a demigod? You have lost three of your legs and are moving on one only. Are you some demigod causing us grief in the form of a bull?" So Pariksit Maharaj is next questioning the bull, because the bull was not exactly like an ordinary bull, as white as a white lotus. So very, very beautiful to look at, except that it had lost three legs and it was moving on only one leg. So what was this bull trying to communicate? So he is wondering whether it is simply a bull or is it a devata who has come in the form of a bull to communicate something. "Are you some demigod causing us grief in the form of a bull?" Indicating some misfortune, some bad time is going to come, or is foreboding some danger for such innocent animals.

**Key Quote:** "At least up to the time of Maharaj Pariksit no one could imagine the wretched conditions of the cow and the bull."
**Summary:** This segment highlights the protection given to cows and bulls during Parikshit Maharaj's reign, emphasizing the astonishment at seeing their suffering and connecting it to the duties of a Vaisya as described in the Bhagavad Gita.

So in the purport Srila Prabhupada says, "At least up to the time of Maharaj Pariksit no one could imagine the wretched conditions of the cow and the bull." Maharaj Pariksit's time the cows and bulls were specially protected as much as the citizens, human beings were protected completely by the powerful rulers like the Pandavas, Pariksit Maharaj. They were perfectly giving protection to those deserving protection, the human beings and the cows and the bulls. Maharaj Pariksit therefore was astonished to see such a horrible scene. How dare somebody beat a cow and who has cut off the legs of the bull? Why is the bull standing on one leg? So Pariksit Maharaj inquired whether the bull was not a demigod assuming such a wretched condition to indicate the future of the cow and the bull. Some message is being communicated, that's what Pariksit thought. It's a very, very unusual scene in Pariksit's kingdom where perfect law and order was enforced by the powerful Emperor Pariksit based on the Dharma Shastras. In the Bhagavad Gita Krishna says, krishi go raksha vanijam vaisya karma svabhavajam. A vaisya is supposed to protect cows, engage in agricultural activity and trade and commerce for the upkeep of the society, civilized society. So he is inquiring, Pariksit is inquiring from the bull, "Are you a devata who is trying to give us some indication so that I may take some action, I may correct something?"

See the kings were so very sensitive and they would go around and see what is the condition of the people or the animals even which deserve protection, what is happening in their kingdom, they would go on a tour, sometimes they would go incognito to find out the reality. So like this the explanation is being given in the Bhagavad Gita, the beginning of the age of Kali and the symptoms of Kali Yuga and 12th canto details are given of the symptoms of Kali Yuga and this solution is also given to overcome the defects of Kali Yuga, what is to be done, that is also explained in this chapter and in the Bhagavatam in general. I will stop here, thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Up till now no one on earth has ever shed tears because of royal negligence."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains the 8th verse of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on the king's duty to protect citizens and the unprecedented nature of suffering in Parikshit Maharaj's kingdom.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 8th and 9th verses of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madhavagavatam. The 8th verse is as follows: Najatu Kauravendranam Dordanda Parirambhite Bhutale Anupatanti Asmin Vinate Praninam Shuchaha. The meaning of this verse is: Now, for the first time in a kingdom well protected by the arms of the kings of the Kuru dynasty, I see you grieving with tears in your eyes. Up till now, no one on earth has ever shed tears because of royal negligence. Parikshit Maharaj is clearly saying that the rulers were so perfect that those deserving protection never had to worry about being neglected by the king or by the government. The law enforcement by the powerful rulers, nobody had to fear any such upstart who would harm the cows or the bulls. Only the human beings did that. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The protection of the lives of both the human beings and animals is the first and foremost duty of a government." Why is the government there at all? It is to give protection to the life. Human life is very precious. This what repeatedly we have heard. It is to give self protection to the life human life is very precious.

The scriptures, all the scriptures, they say human life is very, very important, so is the life of the cow and the bull, equally important. Why? Human life, as you have heard, is specially meant for God realization, for making a permanent solution to all problems of material existence by becoming God conscious, very simple. And to help us to become God conscious, there is the Brahmanical culture which has to be, which has to be maintained by the spiritual practice, and then the spiritual practice has to be maintained by the spiritual practice, and then the spiritual practice has to be maintained, it has to be maintained brahmanical culture. And Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is described as namo brahmanya devaya go brahmana hitayaja go brahmana hitayaja. Krishna wants to see that the cows and the brahmanas are especially protected. This is called brahmanical culture because the brahmanas are meant to give direction to the human society to become God-conscious, make spiritual advancement, and get out of this material existence in the human form of life. And for that, the protection for the cow which gives the miracle food, the milk, cow's milk, very, very important for developing the finer brain tissue.

**Key Quote:** "It is simply horrible for a pure-hearted soul to see organized animal killing by the state in this age of Kali"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the government's duty to protect animals, particularly cows and bulls, and laments the organized animal killing prevalent in the age of Kali, especially in Western countries.

Issues to understand spiritual subject matter. So when it is said the lives of both the human beings and animals is first and foremost duty for government, animals particularly refers to cows, cows and bulls, go rupture, that's what is said in the Bhagavad-Gita also. A government must not discriminate in such principles. It's not that only human beings are important and the animals not not important. They don't think it is precious life of an of a cow. They don't think it's very precious. If it is useful you may keep it, if it is not useful you can do whatever you want. So that is very, very wrong. Such a policy by the government, the government is no longer a law to protect the animals. So government must give protection to the cows and bulls as much as the government is meant for giving protection to the human beings. It is simply horrible for a pure-hearted soul to see organized animal killing by the state in this age of Kali. Brahma is talking about pure devotees. Pure devotees, they just can't even imagine that organized animal killing is going on in this age of Kali, supported by the government, supported by the government, especially in the western countries. And there are slaughterhouses where millions of cows are killed and the government is having no laws to protect these animals, innocent animals. People have become heartless and the government also is equally heartless in matter of killing such innocent animals and they suffer so much, they suffer like the human being, like the human being because they have developed.

Consciousness, they developed consciousness. Maharaj Pariksit was lamenting for the tears in the eyes of the bull. See, Pariksit Maharaj is so sensitive because he is Krishna conscious, is a pure devotee. So he feels for the bull expressing its suffering condition through tears in the eyes. If a animal is crying it's because it is suffering, it deserves to be protected, deserves to be to be given some relief from suffering by in a helpless condition is appealing for help. So the caretakers, the protectors, just like the Bhagavad Gita it says Vaishyas, they are meant for cow protection, they should give protection. So Maharaj Pariksit was feeling very, very bad about this suffering that the bull is undergoing and he was astonished to see such an unprecedented thing in his good kingdom.

He heard before this the description was there he had the glorification of the devotees of Krishna, the Pandavas, how nicely they were ruling, everybody was happy, there was prosperity. Earlier chapters described that Krishna particularly arranged the battle of Kurukshetra to to change the rule from Duryodhana's rule to Yudhishthira's rule. Krishna always wants devotees to rule Rajarishi. Krishna instructed the devotees to rule Rajarishi. Krishna instructed the devotees to rule Rajarishi the Bhagavad Gita to the Sun God and later on to Arjuna. Why Sun God? Because he is the ruler of the Sun planet and his descendants are coming in the in the dynasty Suryavamsa dynasty of kings and the there are also another set of rulers coming in the Chandra Vamsa the descendants of the moon dynasty Chandra Vamsa. The Supreme Lord himself appeared in Suryavamsa and Chandra Vamsa. He appeared as Lord Rama in Suryavamsa and he appeared as Krishna in the Chandra Vamsa. So this is the dynasty of God conscious kings. They were Raja, they were kings, they were also saintly kings, Rishi. Rishi means saintly by their conduct, by their behavior, by their character saintly persons.

**Key Quote:** "protection of bulls and cows and all other animals can be possible only when there is a state ruled by an executive head like Maharaj Pariksit"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of cow protection in state administration, highlighting Parikshit Maharaj's example and explaining the concept of Surabhi cows in the spiritual realm.

Men, there is no cause for you to cry, everything will be good for you. In the purport, Prabhupada says protection of bulls and cows and all other animals can be possible only when there is a state ruled by an executive head like Maharaj Pariksit. So the protection for the bulls and cows as very very important aspect of the state administration is understood by a God conscious king. Maharaj Pariksit addresses the cow as mother for he is a cultured twice-born kshatriya king, you Amba, that's the way the cow is addressed, mother. Amba means mother. So why? Because he is a qualified kshatriya, is a qualified kshatriya, he's undergone the cultural birth, the second birth dvija by being initiated spiritually initiated, that is the meaning. Surabhi is the name of the cows which exist in the spiritual planets and are especially reared by Lord Shri Krishna himself in Krishna's personal about Goloka. Goloka means the place where cows are specially reared by Krishna by protected by Krishna. They are called Surabhi cows. As men are made after the form and features of the Supreme Lord Krishna, so also the cows are made after the form and features of the Surabhi cows and the kingdom. So the cows on this earth planet what we see they are made after the form and features of Surabhi cows in Krishna's personal about. In the material world the human society gives all protection to the human being but there is no law to protect the descendants Surabhi.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the importance of cow protection, emphasizing the nutritional value of milk and the need for strict punishment for cow killers, ultimately linking cow protection to societal peace and well-being.

All right, now these descendants Surabhi, the cows can give all protection to men by supplying the miracle food milk. Many times Prabhupada is pointed out miracle food milk. It is complete nutrition for the human being. It is most important for development of finer brain tissues to understand spiritual subject matter. But Maharaj Pariksit and the Pandavas were fully conscious of the importance of the carven bull and they were prepared to punish the cow killer with all chastisement including death. So the cow and bull needs to be there in such a way that anybody even attempts to harm the cow or the bull immediately they will be killed, death penalty. There has been some times agitation for protection of cows but because there are no pious executive heads and suitable laws the cow and the bull are not given proper protection in our present times. The human should society should recognize the importance of the cow and bull and thus give all protection to these important animals following in the footsteps of Maharaj Pariksit. See the Bhagavatham is the ideal suggesting the ideal way of ruling the state ideal way of conducting oneself. So Krishna will be pleased when the cows are protected and the brahmanas are protected and Krishna will bestow real peace on the carver and the bull and the cow upon human society in such a situation otherwise we cannot expect peace there will always be.

**Key Quote:** "Although Murari heard these divine glories of Krishna from the Lord himself, his heart remained steadfastly fixed on his eternal master Lord Ramachandra."
**Summary:** The story of Lord Chaitanya testing Murari Gupta's devotion to Lord Rama and recognizing him as an incarnation of Hanuman.

When Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu one day appeared in ecstasy as the Varaha Murti, Murari Gupta offered him nice prayers. Murari Gupta gave Zuvar posso kepada Sat-Siat Rao one time. Once Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu glorified Murari Gupta for his unflinching devotion and loyalty to Lord Rama Chandra because Murari Gupta was a great devotee of Lord Rama. In Mahaprakasha form, Lord Chaitanya appeared before Murari Gupta as Lord Ramachandra. Just to test Murari's faith, he repeatedly encouraged Murari Gupta to shift his worship from Lord Rama to Lord Krishna, describing the unparalleled sweetness, supremacy, and all-attractive nature of Shri Krishna, who is the origin of all incarnations and the reservoir of all transcendental qualities and pleasure. Although Murari heard these divine glories of Krishna from the Lord himself, his heart remained steadfastly fixed on his eternal master Lord Ramachandra. Murari, being utterly devoted, could not imagine giving up the service of Lord Rama's lotus feet. That night he was deeply troubled, weeping continuously and praying that death might take him before he was forced to abandon his worship of Lord Ramachandra. He spent the entire night awake, overwhelmed by distress. The next morning Murari approached Lord Chaitanya, fell at his feet, and humbly confessed that though he desired to please the Lord, he could not forsake Lord Ramachandra, for he had sold his head and heart to Lord Rama's service. Torn between obedience to Chaitanya's command and loyalty to Lord Ramachandra, Murari begged for death as his only release. Hearing this pure devotion, Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu became overjoyed. Embracing Murari Gupta, Lord Chaitanya praised his unwavering faith, declaring that such steadfast devotion is a true hallmark of a servant. The Lord revealed that his repeated persuasion was merely a test to demonstrate Murari's deep, unbreakable attachment to Lord Ramachandra.

**Key Quote:** "If a wrong person has got some skill, he can misuse it."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why Dronacharya asked Ekalavya for his thumb as Guru Dakshina, relating it to the idea that unqualified individuals may misuse knowledge or skills, similar to the concept of Shudras not being taught the Vedas.

Why did Dronacharya ask Ekalavya to give his thumb as Guru Dakshina? Is it to show the importance of surrendering to Guru or is it because Ekalavya was violating social order? Actually, Ekalavya was not a proper qualified person to have that skill of shooting arrows. If a wrong person has got some skill, he can misuse it. It is just like it is said in the scriptures itself. Shudras are not taught the Vedas. Why? That's because the Shudras don't have the intelligence to properly utilize the Vedic knowledge and use it for everyone's welfare, good. They may misuse it for some bad purposes or wrong purposes. It is just like somebody is a terrorist, he should not have weapons because he will misuse it like that. So, Ekalavya was not actually qualified to have the skill of shooting arrows. So, by asking him to give his thumb as Guru Dakshina, Dronacharya actually cut down his ability to use that skill, because the thumb is very important in actually shooting using a bow and arrow. So, that way he curtailed his usage for the social good, for the good of everyone else.

It is said that by passing through Vaikuntha Dwaara, one can attain Vaikuntha, where can we find the source of the statement? This is said in one of the Puranas. Now, the significance of Vaikuntha Ekadashi, the day on which this festival is celebrated, especially in Vishnu temples, that one can pass through Vaikuntha Dwaara, that is to remind us that our destination should be Vaikuntha after quitting this body. And to make our destination as Vaikuntha is the correct goal of life. Otherwise, people either they do not have a goal of life in the sense that when we quit this body, which we are forced to do at the time of death, then where do I go? That people do not even know that they are spirit, soul and they are eternal. That itself they do not know. So, this is a particular important point that you understand. Attaining Vaikuntha means you understand I am spirit, soul. I don't die at the time of death. I change body. So, if I prepare myself, I can get a spiritual body and in that spiritual body I can attain Vaikuntha Loka. For eternal life full of bliss and knowledge that is awaiting us. If we want to go there, if we understand the importance of practicing Bhakti in order to go there,

**Key Quote:** "Passing through Vaikuntha Dwaara is to remind ourselves that we should prepare our consciousness by purifying it of all material contamination."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the need to purify our consciousness from material contamination to attain Vaikuntha, highlighting that material desires prevent us from entering the spiritual world.

So, merely doing a ritual of passing through Vaikuntha Dwaara is not enough. Passing through Vaikuntha Dwaara is to remind ourselves that we should prepare our consciousness by purifying it of all material contamination. So, the Supreme Lord is very eager to take us back to his personal abode called Vaikuntha. And he wants us to qualify. Qualify in what sense? Due to long association with this material nature, our consciousness has become polluted by material desires, by material reactions, by material contamination. So, to purify this is essential. As long as we have material contamination or material desires, we have to keep taking birth in this material world. Because those desires can be fulfilled only in this material world. Material contamination is not permitted in the spiritual world. Spiritual world, everything is spiritual. The Supreme Lord is completely spiritual. His abode is completely spiritual. The devotees are completely spiritually situated. So, everything is spiritual there. Nothing is material. So, therefore, we have to prepare ourselves. And anyway, that is our original position. As spirit soul, we belong to the spiritual world. We have a relationship with the Supreme Lord in his personal abode. And he is our maintainer. He is our protector. He is our well-wisher. He is our everything in the spiritual world. But then if we remain with this material desires or material comforts or material aspirations, then we cannot leave this world and go away.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how to remember Krishna's form, particularly through deity worship and connecting with Krishna's teachings, to prepare for approaching the spiritual kingdom.

So, please remember, this going through Vaikuntha Dwara is to remind us that prepare yourself before death comes. Become Krishna conscious. And be ready to go to the abode of the Supreme Lord Vaikuntha. Next question. In the introduction to Bhagavad Gita As It Is, Srila Prabhupada says, if one remembers the form of Krishna at a time of death, he can approach the spiritual kingdom. What is this form and how to remember? Okay. The form of Krishna, Krishna is present in several different forms. The easiest way to understand form of Krishna is the form of the deity of Krishna, Krishna Vikraha, Archa Vikraha. You go to any temple of Krishna, there is the Krishna deity. Deity, Vikraha. So, that is one form of Krishna, the particular deity in a particular temple. So, remembering that form, how do you remember that form? When you go to the temple, you completely concentrate your attention on the form of Krishna as the deity and get the impression in your heart. And carry that impression with you even after you die. Even after you leave the temple and go away to your home or office and remember that form and pray and hear the glories of Krishna from the Bhagavatam. Learn the instructions of Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. All this you connect with that remembrance of the form of Krishna. Krishna is my supreme well-wisher. Krishna is my maintainer. Krishna is my beloved Lord. Krishna is the ultimate source of everything. Krishna is full of all unlimited good qualities. Like this, thinking of Krishna, talking about Krishna, remembering Krishna's form within the heart and hearing about Krishna, taking Krishna Prasadam, worshipping the deity of Krishna or picture of the deity of Krishna, all this actually prepares us

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that remembering Krishna at the time of death is possible through the Lord's mercy, which is attained by consistent practice of remembering Him in this material world.

But remembering at the time of death is made possible by the mercy of the Supreme Lord who is situated in our heart.

**Key Quote:** "Maha Vishnu first appears, enters the material energy which is lying in a dormant condition, unmanifest condition."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the process of material creation, starting with Maha Vishnu entering the dormant material energy and leading to the birth of Brahma from Garbhodaka Shaini Vishnu.

In the third canto, when Lord Brahma offers His praise to Vishnu, did He offer the prayers before the material creation or after the creation? Now the material creation it's a long process. It begins with the Supreme Lord incarnating in this material world, in the material energy. The Lord enters as the first Vishnu form from the spiritual world who descends into this material energy. So that is called Karanodaka Shaini Vishnu, also called Maha Vishnu. So Maha Vishnu first appears, enters the material energy which is lying in a dormant condition, unmanifest condition. That means at that time there are no universes. Previous destruction took place and there was only the material energy. So that energy first of all Maha Vishnu enters. Then Maha Vishnu agitates that energy and the energy becomes activated by Maha Vishnu's glance. And then after Maha Vishnu's glance, first of all the agitation produces Mahatatva. And Mahatatva differentiates the elements. And those elements are combined to form varieties of material objects, material planets. And then from there is one expansion of this Maha Vishnu called Padmanabha Vishnu or Garbhodaka Shaini Vishnu. So that Garbhodaka Shaini Vishnu from his navel one lotus flower is born. On that Brahma is created by Vishnu.

**Key Quote:** "Brahma then understands that he is to do the secondary creation. What is secondary creation? The primary creation is the creation of the ingredients for the creation."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Brahma's role in secondary creation, which involves creating bodies for living entities, after Vishnu has already created the elements.

And Brahma after his creation, he doesn't know who he is, he doesn't know where he is, he doesn't know what he is supposed to do. So he began searching out for a source and he begins contemplation. Who am I? Where have I come from? What am I supposed to do? Etc, etc. So then Lord Vishnu actually who is seated in the heart of Brahma, he enlightens Brahma, gives knowledge to Brahma and Brahma then understands that he is to do the secondary creation. What is secondary creation? The primary creation is the creation of the ingredients for the creation. That is all the elements earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence, objects, everything is the elements. That is done by Maha Vishnu through agitation of the material energy. Then Brahma, birth of Brahma is done by Garboda Darsahi Vishnu. Then Brahma is given knowledge and enlightenment by Vishnu. Then Brahma can create the living entities, the bodies, living entities means the bodies, he can give the bodies for the living entities. By bringing forth the different varieties of the species. So that gives the bodies to the living entities or helping them take birth in this material world. So that is the work of creation of Brahma. After Brahma is born and already Vishnu has done the work of creation to the point of generating the elements, then Brahma actually does the further work of creation of generating the living beings with their proper bodies in the different planets that take birth according to their past karma. That is work of Brahma to generate the living entities. So before he can actually generate the living entities, he offers prayers to Vishnu

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Brahma's prayers to Vishnu before creating living entities, expressing sorrow for their inevitable suffering and the cycle of birth and death.

that he may not become entangled. That he feels sorry for the living beings that he has to be responsible for giving them bodies through which they will no doubt get some enjoyment but they will also have to suffer so many miseries. He feels very sorry for them and he also sees their condition is going to be like they are born in when they are born they are ignorant and foolishly they become busy with material enjoyment and they remain in ignorance and after death again and again they keep taking birth but at the time of dissolution of the whole universe they again are helplessly absorbed in the material energy and they remain dormant like that for billions and billions of years and again they come out again they are busy with material enjoyment. So they can remain in this cycle unless they are rescued by a pure devotee or the Lord himself. So therefore the prayers offered by Brahma is after the initial phase of, different phases of the creation are done by the two Vishnus and then Brahma's work has to begin of generating the living beings given the material body that is the work of creation of Brahma and that happened before he has to do that he offers nice prayers to

**Summary:** The speaker addresses the question of how Lord Shiva, being a pure devotee, can be said to not know he was created by Krishna, explaining that Shiva's knowledge is limited when he acts as a devata.

Next question. In Bhagavad Gita 10.8 purport second last it is mentioned the patriarch patriarch Shiva and others let me open that 10.8 yeah are created by me though they do not know that they are created by me because they are deluded kindly explain kindly explain kindly explain how Lord Shiva being a pure devotee cannot know that he was created by the Supreme Lord. Now Krishna is the ultimate source of everyone and everything that is explained in all the scriptures including Bhagavad Gita and the Vedanta Sutra and the Srimad Bhagavatam and everything else. Okay now when Shiva appears at a certain stage of the creation process now Shiva appears either as the son of Brahma or he appears as the generated personality from Garbhodakshayi Vishnu in either case Shiva is not aware that he is part of a process of creation initiated by the Supreme Lord only that he does not know so as a pure devotee Shiva is actually situated in pure devotional service therefore he is always enlightened as a pure devotee but when he plays the role of a devata then his knowledge is limited his powers are limited

his specific duty as the devata is also well defined he has certain limited amount of power which he can exercise as a devata like that so how is it that Lord Shiva being a pure devotee cannot know he is created by the Supreme Lord in his role as a devata he plays the role of a devata because he is a pure devotee to assist the Supreme Lord he is ready to do any seva so one of the services he does is he plays the part of a devata and many different forms of Shiva are there in this material world as devata many forms the Rudra forms there are 11 incarnations or forms of Rudra for different functions different purposes in this material world material world is very complex huge manifestation so the forms of the Rudras are actually forms of Shiva only so that way Shiva is actually playing the part of a devata and as a devata he does not know everything or details about who is Krishna what are the powers of Krishna how Krishna is the source Krishna is the ultimate control he does not know

why are personalities other than Vishnu addressed as Bhagavan in Srimad Bhagavatam Bhagavan the word Bhagavan originally applies only to the Supreme Lord Vishnu and his expansions Krishna Rama Narasimha etc now Bhagavan can also be used for a person who is exceptionally powerful in the material world and therefore Shiva is addressed as Bhagavan sometimes sometimes great devotees are addressed as Bhagavan that is because of their extraordinary qualities extraordinary service they have to render like Narada he is empowered to preach devotional service in the entire universe he travels freely and he tries to preach but most people are not interested in devotional service so he will not always have a opportunity or a favorable situation to preach but he keeps searching for somebody who may be interested in the whole universe he travels and whoever shows interest he preaches to them makes them first class devotees example is Prahlad Maharaj so many examples there in the Bhagavatam so such great personalities as Narada Shiva pure devotee they are also addressed as Bhagavan indicating that they are extraordinarily empowered or very very powerful due to their being confidential servants of the supreme therefore they are also addressed as Bhagavan that means extraordinarily powerful extraordinarily empowered by the supreme

**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of 'conjunction' in the context of Lord Kalki's appearance, using the analogy of twilight to describe the overlap between yugas.

question Lord Kalki will appear at the conjunction of the two yugas what does conjunction mean conjunction means the junction sandhya it's called yuga sandhya just like in the evening after the sun sets still there is some light before it becomes fully dark so before the night begins or before the day ends completely there is one period where the sun is set but it is not fully dark so this short period about 15 minutes or 20 minutes is called sayam sandhya it's called dusk or twilight so that day is coming to an end night is beginning same thing happens in the similar thing happens in the morning when the sun before it rises there is already some light on the horizon eastern horizon so that is the night is ending and the day is beginning but it is not like night is over day has begun no it's not like that there is a overlap period so that overlap period is called conjunction of the day and night or night ending early morning it's night ending and evening it is conjunction of the day and night similarly the dwapar yuga is going to end and kali yuga is going to begin but when dwapar yuga ends there is some symptoms by which we can understand dwapar yuga is coming to a close and kali yuga symptoms start appearing gradually so that certain number of years is called the yuga sandhya or conjunction of the two yugas one is ending other one is beginning that's a conjunction so there is little overlap sometime

next question why were big yajnas like rajasunya yajna performed are the goals of all yajnas the same or different now yajna ultimately means to satisfy vishnu or to please vishnu who is also called the chief beneficiary of the sacrificial offerings so to please vishnu or to satisfy vishnu one has to perform sacrifice now the goal of sacrifice again is ultimate liberation by transferring ourselves to the spiritual kingdom of god in a relationship with him that is the whole program so rajasuya now each of these yajnas have a common goal of pleasing vishnu but there is also another subsidiary goal or benefit or fruit or result so rajasuya yajna is done by an emperor of this world in order to declare his sovereignty his complete ruling over all the small provinces or all the states or all the regions like that and yudhishthira performed rajasuya yajna not because he wanted to enjoy royal opulence or any respect from others but because he wanted to show respect to krishna he wanted to glorify krishna he wanted krishna to be recognized as the most important person in that assembly in which so many devatas were invited so many rishis were invited so many great personalities of krishna were invited so all of them he wanted to hear krishna's glories he wanted to proclaim the unique position of krishna as the greatest supreme personality of god therefore he performed a rajasuya yajna so the common goal for all yajnas is pleasing vishnu by which we develop our bhakti for vishnu vishnu bhakti

next question i wanted to study the scriptures like gita bhagavatam scrutinizing me for eight hours a day under guidance of experienced devotees and also follow sadhana from four to nine am as prescribed are there any such opportunities now devotional service begins with a small beginning like chanting 108 times hara krishna mantra every day takes about 10 minutes in the beginning and after you become practiced you can chant in eight minutes or seven and a half minutes or seven minutes like that so make a small beginning and keep on doing that regularly every day on a daily basis and gradually introduce more and more and more practices one by one under the guidance of the devotees of srila prabhupada it is possible for anybody to learn the basics and actually become a fixed up in devotional service through such practices and eventually as you become more practiced accustomed to do some service and you keep on increasing the service instead of just chanting one round somebody will be told why don't you chant two rounds chant four rounds chant 16 rounds so then you require more time to chant 16 rounders compared to chanting one round so therefore the the devotional services gradually in a steady manner by practicing gradually increased more and more so you associate with devotees and you begin the practice and increase the the time you spend on spiritual life more and more and reduce the material time otherwise all time will go away and you will not be able to properly devote time for doing more and more devotional service

it's like devotees tell so many people chant harry krishna now this chanting harry krishna means receiving the blessings and mercy of krishna through holy name that's what it means but not everybody will accept it not everybody will follow it even they accept sometimes so that is the difference because krishna is equal to everybody krishna is fair to everyone krishna wants everyone to be equal to everyone to become a devotee so therefore we cannot blame krishna or we cannot we should not think that krishna is partial to devotees samoham sarva bhuteshu so krishna is equal to everyone for him there is no distinction between bodies or between one person and another no he doesn't make distinction so if you feel that you are not getting krishna's mercy enough then if you understand that you have to become eligible to receive the mercy

vishnu is engaged in past times with the pastimes which we cannot always appreciate simply by hearing the events it is just like rama was in the forest rama is the supreme lord only even the forest with sita devi and ravana kidnaps now and after that rama is lamenting sita where are you where are you i am missing you i cannot live without you he's crying and he is lamenting why did i lose sita how could i lost sita like that so it looks like he is a ordinary person but we know that from the proper authorities we hear that the supreme lord when he comes and plays the part of a um the supreme lord himself in some incarnation or as a devotee or something like that it is just a pastime for the sake of uh some function or some mission he has got in this material world for that purpose he comes so we cannot always detect that or always find that out on our own it's not possible so all actions of vishnu are transcendental they are not under the more so material nature and whether he gets apparently defeated or he wins there is no difference between uh victory and defeat or success and unsuccessful nothing like the no the duality is there in vishnu so therefore vishnu whatever he does it is good and all auspicious for everyone and he sometimes in the past times he appears to be depressed or dejected or he gets defeated or he is perplexed all these are misleading they are meant for misleading the atheists to think that krishna is ordinary person or rama is ordinary person but when actual fight takes place between rama and ravana then the way effortlessly rama killed ravan killed means delivered and that nobody can understand nobody can understand so the lord is to be understood only through the authentic scriptures through the descriptions of the pure devotees and the statements of the lord in the bhagavad-gita when lord reveals himself what are his activities like what are his characteristics what is his form like everything he reveals in the scriptures hear that that way become enlightened about god

**Summary:** The speaker addresses the question of understanding complex spiritual matters, stating that nothing is complex if properly explained by a self-realized person like Prabhupada, and emphasizing the need to prepare one's consciousness and clear misconceptions.

Even Jagannath Puri very, very big work is going on. I was there in Jagannath Puri about two weeks back and saw so much of work is happening. Lot of work is happening. It's going to be totally different in another one or one and a half years. Lot of work is happening. Next question, is it correct to think that the only way to properly understand complex spiritual matters is by giving up this material body and acquiring the spiritual body? Yes. No, actually, nothing is complex in spiritual subject matter. It is just that it has to be properly explained by a self-realized person, just like Prabhupada explains. Everything he explains very, very simple words and very clearly. Nothing which Prabhupada has written is complex or difficult to understand. That is one thing. Second thing is, we have to actually prepare our consciousness to receive this knowledge without any misconceptions about ourself or misconceptions about Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "The correct way to understand spiritual subject matter is to prepare oneself by purification of the heart. What is this purification? To clear away the misconceptions which we have developed by long association with this material nature."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain how to understand spiritual matters, emphasizing the importance of purifying the heart by clearing away misconceptions through chanting Hare Krishna and understanding Prabhupada's teachings.

If I think I'm the body. If my goal in life is some material sense gratification, many of these things will not make sense to me, even though it is written in a simple way, like Prabhupada and Krishna and Sukhadeva Goswami always explain, you are not the body, you are spirit soul. So somebody who is materialistic will think, what is the spirit soul? I don't agree. I think I am the body. There's nothing beyond the body. Like that, they will not understand. Either they will argue, they will differ in their opinion, or they will think somebody else is in ignorance, or they're having their own concoction. So many wrong ways they can actually interpret something and think it is either think it is very complex, and not bother about understanding what is nicely explained. So, the correct way to understand spiritual subject matter is to prepare oneself by purification of the heart. What is this purification? To clear away the misconceptions which we have developed by long association with this material nature. By long association, we have developed souls. So, purification of the heart. There are so many misconceptions. So, that can all be cleared away, you chant Hare Krishna, you hear the holy name, you understand what Prabhupada is explaining with a sober mind, then it's possible. And gradually you begin to build your foundation, build on a good foundation of understanding. So, that's the correct way. You start with the basic of understanding the basics from the Bhagavad Gita, then you proceed to the Bhagavatam, then to the chaitanya charitamrita. Everything can be understood. And also, Krishna is revealing within the heart for a sincere soul, who has developed the eagerness to know Krishna, to learn about Krishna, to hear about Krishna, develop the taste and attraction for Krishna, hearing about Krishna, Krishna reveals.

Shukadeva Goswami was taught the Bhagavatam by Vyasa Deva. Vyasa Deva composed or compiled the Bhagavatam. Shukadeva Goswami spoke the Bhagavatam to Pariksit Maharaj. Now, in that assembly where Shukadeva Goswami was speaking to Pariksit Maharaj, there were many other saintly persons. So, there was this other saintly person called Suta Goswami. Suta Goswami is the son of one Romaharshana Suta. This Suta Goswami is also called Ugrashrava Suta. He heard the Bhagavatam when Shukadeva Goswami was speaking to Pariksit Maharaj. Suta Goswami was requested by some sages in Naimisharanya, kindly tell us about Krishna. So Suta Goswami said, if you are interested in hearing about Krishna, I shall narrate to you the Srimad Bhagavatam which I heard from Shukadeva Goswami when he was speaking to Pariksit Maharaj. So that Suta Goswami, he's narrating about Krishna. So, that's Suta Goswami. So, this is the reason for repeating the Bhagavatam to the sages of Naimisharanya.

The Srimad Bhagavatam was first spoken by Lord Sankarsana to Sanath Kumara. Sanath Kumara is one of the Four Kumaras. And Sanath Kumara spoke this Bhagavatam what he heard from Sankarsana to one Sankhyayana Muni and this Sankhyayana Muni spoke this Bhagavatam to Parashara.

**Key Quote:** "In the spiritual world, everyone is naturally always blissful, always blissful, the very quality of it, always blissful, always blissful. Being happy is the characteristic of spiritual existence. Whereas the material world, by nature, it is filled with miseries."
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the possibility of sense gratification in the spiritual world, explaining that spiritual senses and bodies exist there, and that the natural state is bliss, contrasting it with the misery-filled material world where happiness is sought through sense gratification.

Is it possible to do sense gratification in the spiritual world? Where does the desire to do sense gratification come from? How is this taken care of in the spiritual world? In the spiritual world, we have our spiritual senses. We have our spiritual body, we have spiritual mind. How can be we doing sense gratification in the spiritual world? How do we be having the mind. Have means the soul has got all these faculties without separate parts, unlike this material body, which is constructed by joining together different parts and interconnecting them in the womb of the mother. So it's a very complex process. But the spiritual spirit soul as a person, the spiritual personality has got all the faculties perfectly working without any separate parts joined together, no separate parts are there. The faculties are all there in the spiritual world. And in the spiritual world, everyone is naturally always blissful, always blissful, the very quality of it, always blissful, always blissful. Being happy is the characteristic of spiritual existence. Whereas the material world, by nature, it is filled with miseries. There is no natural happiness. And one has to seek happiness all the time. And that also is available by some sense contact. Because our nature is to be happy always in the spiritual world, when we come to the material world, we are material world we also want to be always happy, but there is no happiness. So therefore, we seek happiness and only way we can seek happiness is by sense gratification. That means we have to bring the senses in contact with sense objects and that sensation that is produced we think that that is happiness. So that is the defect of material existence.

**Summary:** Lord Krishna appears in his transcendental form, which is beyond our material perception, but he grants us the ability to see him in various forms like Krishna, Rama, Narasimha, and Varaha.

Now, when Krishna Rama appears as the son of his devotees, apparently taking birth like an ordinary human being, it's not at all ordinary. It is not at all material. He doesn't accept a material form. He comes in his original transcendental form, meaning the form in the spiritual world, which is eternal and completely spiritual. But we cannot see him in that form. But then they become visible as Krishna, as Rama, as Narasimha, as Varaha, by giving us the power to see them, because our eyes can only perceive material forms, and that too, not all material forms. Like, if the devatas were to come, and do come to this Earth planet sometimes, we cannot see them with these eyes, because these eyes can't see them. These eyes can only perceive gross form. Devatas have subtle material form, sukshma sharira, just like

How to control senses to focus on spiritual journey in time of crisis? Engaging the senses in devotional service means to engage the senses in devotional service, just like there is an example given in Bhagavad Gita of one Ambarish Maharaj. He was a pure devotee of Krishna, so he engaged all his senses in Krishna's service. As I said, beginning with the tongue, what do you do with the tongue to engage in Krishna's service? We chant Hare Krishna. Ears, we hear the chanting of Hare Krishna. With the tongue we can also taste Krishna Prasadam. With the eyes we can see the beautiful form of Krishna, either the picture of Krishna or the deity of Krishna. With the eyes we can read Bhagavad Gita. And then with the nose we can smell nice fragrant flowers offered to Krishna or incense offered to Krishna. With the sense of touch, you can engage in so many activities with the hands in Krishna's service. You can engage these hands and the sense of touch also. Like that, all the senses, if we engage in Krishna's service, that is the way to control.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is promising that simply by understanding that Lord is not material, yet how he is in the material world."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that Krishna is beyond material energy and understanding His divine birth and activities leads to liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

So this has to be very, very clear to us that Krishna is not of this material energy. Even though He is coming on my tongue, He is not of the material energy. 5000 years back also when Krishna came here, He is not of this material energy. Just because my material eyes could see Him, He is not material. That is the reason in Bhagavad Gita Krishna says, simply by knowing what is the nature of Krishna's janma karma as divine, anybody who knows, means in truth, one understands this, he has no more birth in this material world. So, what we are discussing today, what we are discussing yesterday, exactly same thing. We are trying to understand the janma karma, appearance of the nama on my tongue, and what are the activities of the nama avatara. Once you understand this, there is no more birth and death, old age, disease. Krishna is promising that simply by understanding that Lord is not material, yet how He is in the material world. This is the understanding of the tattva of avatara or incarnation.

See, in Chaitanya Siksha Amrita, Bhaktivinoda Thakur says, "Even before entering the field of nama bhajana," that is, nama bhajana is what we are doing, japa, "one should first know for certain that Krishna's form, Krishna's name, Krishna's service, Krishna's servants are all eternally free." That is, they are beyond the grasp of maya, the illusory energy. Krishna, His transcendental abode and His paraphernalia are totally beyond material imagination. Similarly, His throne, His rooms, His gardens, forests, Govardhan Hill and river Yamuna. In fact, everything about Krishna cannot be touched by maya. It is especially important to remember the transcendental nature of the Lord Krishna when we approach His service, of which chanting His holy name is foremost. This understanding is not based on blind belief but on absolute eternal truth. So, Prabhupada.

When mind is purified, the senses are also purified. Just see. Instead of using the senses for sense gratification, the awakened devotee employs the senses in the transcendental service of the Lord.

**Summary:** This segment presents a conversation with Srila Prabhupada, explaining that matter is Krishna's energy and can be transformed into spirit, emphasizing the importance of seeing Krishna's personal presence in the deity form.

Conversation with Srila Prabhupada, ultimately everything is spiritual because matter is Krishna's energy. If Krishna is the original cause, therefore the matter can be changed into spirit and spirit can be changed to matter. Just as in the same electrical energy, acting as heater and cooler because the original cause is electricity. Similarly, the original cause is Krishna, so Krishna can change matter into spirit and spirit into matter. This is His power. The rascals and fools, when Krishna appears in His own body, Atma Maya, they think it is just like a material body. But they do not know that to Krishna, there is no distinction of material and spiritual. Never think of the deity as made of stone or wood. Every worshipper must remember that Krishna is personally present. He is simply kindly presenting Himself before us in a way so that we can handle Him. That is His mercy. Otherwise, He is unapproachable. There is no difference between matter and spirit for the Lord, although there is a gulf of difference between the two in the case of conditioned living beings. For the Lord, there is nothing but spiritual existence. Similarly, there is nothing except spiritual existence for the pure devotee of the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "Only liberated soul can cross the coverings of the universe."
**Summary:** The lecture focuses on the four Kumaras, their liberation, yogic powers, and their ability to travel to Vaikuntha due to being free from material contamination.

what is happening as the cause for the darkness spreading everywhere in the universe. So Brahma is describing, first of all he described Vaikuntha. And he has already described that the four Kumaras while wandering carefree, because they were liberated souls and they didn't have any definite desire. The description is there. My four sons, Sanakya, Sanatana, Sanantara and Sanat Kumara who are born from my mind are your predecessors. They are born much before all the demigods. As they travel throughout the material and spiritual skies without any definite desire. So then Brahma is describing as they travel all over the universes, they also travel in the spiritual sky. So they happen to enter the spiritual sky. And because they were freed from all material contamination, they could go there. And they also had the yogic siddhi. It requires yogic siddhi to go to specific places. Otherwise they are restricted to the planet. They are supposed to stay there. Now normally yogic siddhi means they can travel within the universe. But exceptionally advanced yogis like the four Kumaras can even cross the coverings of the universe. So elsewhere it is explained that to cross the coverings of the universe, one has to be fully free from all material contamination, fully purified, and should be a liberated soul. Only a liberated soul can cross the coverings of the universe. Even among the yogis, those yogis who are not liberated, they cannot go beyond the coverings of the universe. They cannot go. So from this description it is very clear that the four Kumaras were liberated souls. And they were liberated souls who were also yogis. Because they were yogis, they could travel freely. If one is not a yogi, one cannot travel. So they were liberated souls. Therefore they could cross the coverings of the universe and they could reach the Vaikuntha planet because they were yogis, yogis and liberated souls. So then Brahma gives the elaborate description of Vaikuntha that we have been hearing in the past several verses. We have been hearing about the Vaikuntha.

**Key Quote:** "So without any material desire means there is spiritual desire."
**Summary:** The discussion shifts to the concept of desirelessness, clarifying that it refers to freedom from material desires, not the absence of all desires, and highlighting the presence of spiritual desires in liberated souls.

So, without any definite desire, Prabhupada explains, means no material desires. No material desires. So to become free from material desire is possible only if one is free from all types of material contamination. Even if there is a small tinge of material contamination, there is material desire. So many times people wonder what is this material contamination? It is nothing but material desire. Whenever it is referred to, material contamination in the heart or consciousness. Consciousness is completely spiritual. So how can consciousness be contaminated? It is the desire which becomes contaminated. Naturally, as spirit souls, it is the desire which becomes contaminated. Because we all have consciousness. That consciousness is the symptom of spirit, symptom of spirit soul, consciousness. The characteristic of consciousness is desire. Consciousness means desire. So a living being cannot be without desire. Therefore, many times Prabhupada explains, if it is said, one has to become desireless, it means that one has to become free from material desires. That's the meaning, desireless. Nispruhaha, many places in the Bhagavad Gita, nispruhaha, nispruhasarvakamebhyo, free from all kinds of material desires. So people who don't know about devotional service or bhakti yoga, they think desirelessness means no desire, become a stone, become like a stone, no material desire, no activity. That is not correct. So they try to become desireless. That is not correct. They try to become desireless, try to become inactive. But that is never possible for a living being, never possible. So without any definite desire means without any material desire. So without any material desire means there is spiritual desire. There are spiritual desires. So the kumaras are travelling with a spiritual desire.

#### characteristics of spirit, desire, senses, Mayavadi philosophy, nirguna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "It is the characteristic of the living being to be always having desires."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that desire, consciousness, and activity are inherent characteristics of spirit souls, contrasting this with the Mayavadi philosophy that denies these qualities in the Absolute Truth, and clarifying the meaning of 'nirguna'.

At least one spiritual desire, there could be more. It is the characteristic of the living being to be always having desires, always having. That's a characteristic. That is the natural symptom of living. It is like this table. Can it have any desire? Material object, can it have desire? Material substance. Is there anything like that? No. Is there anything like desire? No. So that is characteristic of spirit, soul, desire, consciousness, activity, senses, perception, thinking, feeling, willing, all these are characteristics of spirit, living person. So if we understand this very carefully, it's not difficult to understand the supreme absolute truth or the supreme spirit is also full of desires. Because desire is the characteristic of spirit. He has senses. He has thinking, feeling, willing. He has senses. He has thinking, feeling, willing. He has senses. He has perception. He has feelings. He has intelligence. He has activities. He has qualities, spiritual qualities. See, the whole understanding is completely different if you properly understand what is the spirit. He is the ultimate, the ultimate emotions. He is the ultimate power. He is the ultimate consciousness. So these Mayavadi philosophers, they study so much the Vedas and after all that the conclusion, because they are stuck up with one philosophy, absolute truth is impersonal, that's why they come to a wrong conclusion. Either living being or absolute truth, no desires at all, no senses, no activity and to justify that, they say see scriptures describe absolute truth as nirguna, nirvikara, nirvishesha. But unless they hear the meaning, the explanation of all these descriptions in the scriptures from a proper source, they will not understand. They take the literal meaning. Nirguna means without qualities. Nirguna means without material qualities.

**Key Quote:** "This material world, 15th chapter of Bhagavad Gita is described by Krishna as an inverted reflection of the spiritual world."
**Summary:** The lecture explains the relationship between the material and spiritual worlds, describing the material world as a perverted reflection of the spiritual world, not merely an inverted one, emphasizing the distorted nature of material qualities.

nirakar, without any material form, so there is transcendental form, there is transcendental qualities, there is transcendental senses, transcendental activities, transcendental abode, transcendental paraphernalia, everything is there. This material world, 15th chapter of Bhagavad Gita is described by Krishna as an inverted reflection of the spiritual world, so in the spiritual world, unless there is variety, how can there be a difference? How can there be variety in the material world? But Krishna also explains in the 15th chapter, it's a perverted reflection. Literally, if you take, urdha-moolam-adashakam, inverted reflection, just like this. Just like if you want to see inverted reflection in the mirror, if you are standing on your feet, in the mirror it will appear like you're standing on your head, shirsasana, what is that? Shirsasana. So it's not exactly inverted reflection. See this also requires an acharya to explain, what is this urdha-moolam-adashakam? It's a perverted reflection. There's a difference between perverted reflection and inverted reflection. Perverted reflection is, it's like, to give an example of perverted reflection, if you look in a convex mirror or a concave mirror, your face, let us say, your face will appear either very big or very small. Correct? Have you seen that? Sometimes you would have seen, some of you would have seen at least. So like that, in this material world, even though it's a reflection of the spiritual world, it is not a proper reflection. It's a perverted reflection.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts material and spiritual qualities, emphasizing the importance of studying scriptures under proper guidance to avoid misinformation and to understand the true nature of spirit.

So everything is topsy-turvy, right? There everything is of the spiritual quality, in the spiritual world. Here everything is of the material quality. So material quality and spiritual quality, very clearly Krishna has distinguished in the second chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, by distinguishing the soul from the body or spirit from matter. Very clearly Krishna has given the distinction. In other places in the scriptures also, many, many, many, many places it is there. The descriptions are there. Matter and spirit, very clearly it is there. So perverted reflection means of the material quality as opposed to spiritual quality in the spiritual world. So Prabhupada explains, since there is variety here, and because the material world is a reflection of the spiritual world, there is variety in the spiritual world. But because this reflection is a perverted reflection, we should not think just like there is material variety here, there is material variety in the spiritual world. No. There is spiritual variety. So the nature of spirit, to properly understand, you have to study the scriptures under proper guidance. Otherwise all kinds of interpretation or misinformation, just like these mayavadis, there are so many wrong understandings.

**Key Quote:** "They were eager to see the Lord in Vaikuntha."
**Summary:** The lecture returns to the Kumaras' eagerness to see the Lord, contrasting their understanding with that of yogis who mistake the Paramatma form for a manifestation of the impersonal Brahman, and highlighting the difference between the soul and the Supersoul.

So it is described that the Kumaras, they had desire, they were eager to see the Lord. They were eager to see the Lord in Vaikuntha. They had already seen the Lord in the heart. In perfection. In perfect Samadhi, a yogi is able to see the form of the Lord in the heart, Paramatma form, Supersoul. But if a yogi is not having proper knowledge about who or what is that form in the heart of the Supersoul, Paramatma, then their conclusion will be, what is that form in the heart? Their conclusion will be, oh, this is the manifestation of the impersonal Brahman, the absolute truth or God. This Paramatma feature is a manifestation of the impersonal Brahman. Similarly, they also conclude that we are not the body. We are spirit soul. We are eternal. We are spiritual by nature. So they conclude that this spiritual nature or spirit soul is also manifestation of impersonal Brahman. Now again, some places in the scriptures, there is description. Absolute truth is Brahman. We are also Brahman. And the qualities of Brahman are given, identical. Nirvikara, nirguna, nirvishesha, nirvikalpa. Whether you apply that to the soul or the Supersoul or the impersonal Brahman, the absolute truth, same qualities. So they equalize the soul with the impersonal Brahman.

with the absolute truth, with God, with Brahman in the spiritual world. So this mistake, devotees never make. Because devotees understand that in this material world, there is an inverted reflection, perverted reflection, the perverted reflection of the spiritual world. So the variety here is material, their variety is spiritual. Here there are living beings, so many millions and billions and trillions of living beings, who have material desires, material form, covering their spirit, covering the spirit, material form, material possessions. In the spiritual world, there also there are millions of living beings. But they are having spiritual form, they are having spiritual desires, they have spiritual activity, they have spiritual senses, their intelligence is spiritual. Their identity is spiritual. Do you understand? You see, how perfect, clear understanding can be there, only when you hear from the perfect source. That's why the perfect source is described in the Bhagavad Gita and all the important scriptures, that you have to hear in the parampara system, from a guru who is coming in parampara, beginning from Krishna. This modern day follows Shankaracharya, we are also in parampara. Which parampara? Shankaracharya parampara. If you ask the question, Shankaracharya parampara, does it begin from Krishna? No.

**Key Quote:** "Unless one hears from the perfect source, which is also described, from a guru in parampara, beginning from Krishna, one will not be able to understand all these descriptions in the scriptures."
**Summary:** The importance of hearing from a perfect source in disciplic succession is reiterated, explaining why some scriptural descriptions are indirect and emphasizing the distinction between Vaikunthaloka and Svargaloka.

So, therefore, unless one hears from the perfect source, which is also described, from a guru in parampara, beginning from Krishna, one will not be able to understand all these descriptions in the scriptures. Yes. So here, in the Bhagavatam, there is a direct and clear description. In some places in the scriptures, the description is not very direct. It is indirect. Now, somebody will say, why indirect description? Why not direct description? Because there are foolish people, who will mistake these descriptions in the Bhagavatam, in the Bhagavata, to be descriptions of something material. So first of all, before anybody touches Bhagavatam, descriptions of the personal features of the Absolute Truth, they should understand the impersonal feature, if there is a possibility that they'll misunderstand the personal descriptions. But we don't have that problem. As devotees who are hearing the descriptions of the personal features from the pure devotee spiritual world, we have no problem, because when Prabhupada describes, he never confuses the description in the Bhagavatam and the description in the Vedas about material world, Vaikunthaloka and Svargaloka. There is no confusion. The two are completely different. So Prabhupada explains that very carefully, the difference between Svarga or any upper planet where there is so much of opulence and the opulence in Vaikuntha. The pleasure of the inhabitants of Vaikunthaloka. A clear distinction is given by Prabhupad.

**Key Quote:** "Absolute truth is impersonal."
**Summary:** The lecture critiques the Mayavada understanding, highlighting their flawed starting point of believing the Absolute Truth is impersonal, and explaining the three features of the Absolute Truth: impersonal, localized, and personal.

So the Mayavada understanding is completely wrong, completely wrong, because they start with a wrong understanding right from the beginning of their study. They always hold on to one axiomatic truth according to them: absolute truth is impersonal. That's the reason for all their philosophy being completely wrong. They can never, never understand as long as they hold on to that point. So such mayavadis, when they come in contact with a pure devotee and are fortunate to be blessed, of course the pure devotees want to bless everyone, but are fortunate to accept the blessings of the pure devotee, then immediately they begin to realize that the absolute truth is impersonal, localized and personal, three features of absolute truth. And that's the localized feature. The absolute truth, a higher understanding of the absolute truth, superior knowledge and the personal feature is the highest understanding, topmost understanding of the absolute truth, complete understanding, perfect understanding. So that is only because of the mercy of pure devotee and we are fortunate souls to have accepted this mercy. Therefore for us it's very clear what is Brahman, what is Paramatma, what

I made you go through the verses 18th chapter beginning with 47th verse or something. I didn't complete that. Till 18.66 you study that. 18.47 to 66. What is that verse? It starts with that verse where it describes by worship of the Lord who is all-pervading and who is the source of all beings one can in performance of one's own duty attain the highest perfection of renunciation. Something like that. By worship of the Lord who is the source of all beings. What is the verse number? 18th chapter 47 or 48 or something like that. What is the verse number? 46.

Bhagavatam right in the beginning and directly Suta Goswami is telling, directly he is telling the three features. So studying these verses of the Bhagavad Gita, 18.46 to 18.66, 21 verses, you have to nicely study. Thoroughly you have to study. Particularly Prabhupada's translation and purport. The word for translation you go through very carefully. Very nicely Prabhupada explains. These three features of the absolute truth are explained in these verses. Again that is very very confidential understanding. Many people read the Bhagavad Gita but they don't know three features of the absolute truth are described in those verses. They don't understand that. See. So here the description is being given that these Kumaras, four Kumaras, they entered Vaikunthapuri. Seven doors are there to enter the personal abode of the, in Vaikunthapuri. There are so many devotees, millions of, billions of devotees. But they were trying to, eager to see the Lord. So they entered his abode. So his abode is guarded by doorman. And his doorman, there is no need to guard because there is no threat. There are no Asuras. There are no ruffians in the spiritual world. Then why this doorman? Why this doorman? That is their seva to the Lord, to guard his door, seva of the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "They thought that this sex impulse is going to bother us."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the names of the doormen and explains why the Kumaras maintain the appearance of five-year-old children: to avoid the disturbance of the sex impulse and facilitate their spiritual practice.

See. Devotees render all kinds of service to the Lord, all kinds of service. So these doorman, they are standing in seven doors, pair of doorman. So that description is also there in other parts of the scriptures, other places in the scriptures, the names of these doorman. The seventh door, Jaya and Vijaya. Those who do Narasimha Homa, you have some mantras, no? Chanda Prachanda Abhyam Namaha. What are the names there? Huh? Bala Prabala Abhyam Namaha. If you know Sanskrit language, the, Prabala Abhyam means Dvitiya, Vachana, two of them, unto them, unto Bala and Prabala, I am offering this, Ganda Pushpa. You see. So there are names of these pairs of doorman. First door, second door, third door, sixth, fourth door, fifth, sixth. None of them stopped these Kumaras. They freely were walking. Now, how do the Kumaras look? That is very important. They look like five-year-old small children. What is the reason? It is explained earlier, I think. Somewhere Prabhupada has explained earlier. I didn't read that explanation here, that they purposely keep themselves in a form, the assembling small children because when they were very serious about self-realization, they realized that this sex impulse that is there in this material world when one grows up and attains adulthood, there is naturally that sex impulse. And one has to actually overcome that sex impulse if one is serious about self-realization or spiritual life. One has to practice Brahmacharya and then follow these Brahmachari principles even after attaining adulthood. Continue to follow the Brahmacharya principles so that one will not become a victim of this sex desire. Now, these Kumaras are very intelligent transcendentalists. They thought that this sex impulse is going to bother us and Brahmacharya principles have to be followed whole life. So, using the yogic siddhi, they maintained the body of five-year-olds. So, when the body is kept like that, there will be no sex impulse at all. Like small children, they will not have any sex impulse, no sex impulse. So, they are freely able to practice spiritual life without any botheration by this

sex impulse. That means, right in the beginning, they had very clear goal of life. Goal of life was self-realization. And that goal, they were fixed even when they were small children. Even when they were small children, they were fixed on that goal. And very quickly they attained the siddhi. They attained the siddhi very quickly. Because, by birth itself, they were not interested in entering family life, having children, wife, all this they were not interested. So, they refused their father, that they will not be entering family life. So, Brahma, immediate reaction was, he became angry. How can you refuse your father? And that too, he is asking them to help him, to assist him in the process of creation. So, Brahma was very angry. He was very angry, but very soon Brahma realized, oh, they are very advanced spiritually. That's why they are refusing. It's not because, I don't like to enter family life. Don't bother me. Not like that. It's not because they don't like to enter or bother some headache, wife, children, all this. No, not with that understanding. They mature in their understanding. What is family life? So, that's why many times Prabhupada also explains, a devotee should understand, if a devotee, somebody is serious about self-realization, or more importantly, Krishna realization, then he should understand that this family life is a concession, for those who want to enjoy sex life, in a restricted way, regulated way. So, if the goal is, Krishna realization, and one has practiced Brahmacharya, then why enter Guru's Tashrama? No need. No need to enter Guru's Tashrama. To fix in the goal, and you have to pursue that, for which we have joined, this movement. Correct? So, why enter Grihastha life? Guru's Tashrama? Family life? Why enter family life?

**Summary:** The speaker explains Brahma's initial anger and subsequent realization that the Kumaras' refusal to enter family life stemmed from their dedication to self-realization, and then shifts to the doorman's perspective and the nature of children.

So, these Kumaras, Brahma realized, they are refusing because, actually momentarily, he became upset. Brahma is very very advanced, himself. Just on the spur of the moment, he became upset. But immediately, he could understand, that they are not refusing because, they don't want botheration, or they don't like to enter family. No. They are refusing because, they have fixed in their goal of self-realization, for which this Naishika Brahmacharya, is very very very, very very conducive. So, then he appreciated that. Very nice. So, now he is describing, they are looking like five-year-olds, but they are the oldest people in the Universe, among the oldest people. And they are liberated, they have done lot of Tapasya, they have studied all the Vedas, they are very very very mature, knowledgeable people. Correct? But, the doorman, the seventh pair of doorman, Jaya and Vijaya, they became upset. Why are these boys, simply roaming around, trying to enter, the Lord's abode? What business they have? Small children, what business they have? They just keep playing, and then, so they stopped. Now, this verse, doesn't describe they stopped. First, the description is, in the 28th verse, what did the, four Kumaras see? They saw two doorman, but that was not, anything new for them, because they had seen already doorman, first gate up to sixth gate, they had seen the doorman. Then, they got the doorman's voice. Why? Prabhupada explains that also. It is a child's nature, to enter any place, without any consideration of permission, or am I allowed to go? No idea of, I should not trespass some places, nothing like that. And children are not duplicitous, that means, they have no particular reason to enter, any particular room, simply they will go. Correct? And it is also told here, by Prabhupada, a child can enter any place, as no one checks him, generally children will not be stopped, when they go around here and there. They generally will not stop.

**Summary:** The lecture describes the Kumaras' reaction to being stopped by the doormen, highlighting their liberation, lack of attraction to material opulence, and eagerness to see the Lord, contrasting this with the doormen's agitated state of mind.

So, if a child is stopped, what happens? They feel very sorry, why are they stopping me? And then sometimes, the child also becomes, angry. And out of anger, or out of, some kind of, feeling sorry, they will start crying, generally children will start crying. But here, the Kumaras, no question of crying, they are mature adults actually, and, their anger, was meant to, punish this doorman, why are you stopping us? And it is also described here, by Prabhupada, that the first six doormen, did not stop. Only the seventh, door, they were stopped. Of course, this 29th verse, doesn't describe they have stopped. In the 30th verse, it is described, 29th verse it says, 28th verse, it says, first of all, the doorman saw, who are these four, small children? So, they raised their eyebrows, as if, what do you want? Like that. And, they were breathing heavily, discontented nostrils. Hmm? Sputha, nirgama bhyam. Like, becoming angry, or becoming upset, or thinking that some unnecessary disturbance, nuisance. They snorted, like this. And, their eyes were anyway reddish. It appeared like, they were, angry. Appeared like that. Their eyes were reddish anyway. With reddish eyes, discontented nostrils, arched eyebrows, they appeared somewhat agitated. Rabhasam dadhano. They appeared agitated. Why are you coming? Simply disturbing, creating nuisance. That kind of, ah, that kind of, disposition they had, towards the Kumaras. And, the next verse will, 30th verse will describe, they stopped. But, the 20, 29th verse, it says, the great sages, had open doors everywhere. They had no idea of ours and mine. They completely liberated. They know, everything belongs to the Supreme Lord. Nothing belongs to anybody. So, with open minds, they tried to enter the seventh door, as they had passed the six doors, which were all made of golden diamonds. Why is it being said, made of golden diamonds, those doors? It's not like the material world. It is completely different. But, the Kumaras are liberated. So, they have no attraction for these gold and extraordinary opulence. They have no such desire or any such special attraction for opulence like that. No. Why? Because, they are very eager to see the Supreme Lord. Very eager to see the Supreme Lord. So, therefore, they were thinking, why these doormen are agitated in the mind? And further, it will be described, they stopped even using the stick. Stop! Where are you going? Like that. So, then we will hear what happened

**Key Quote:** "Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta Purpa."
**Summary:** The speaker reads the translation and purport of S.B. 3.15.30, focusing on the Kumaras' appearance, their age, and the doorkeepers' actions.

Translation: The four boy sages, who had nothing to cover their bodies but the atmosphere, looked only five years old, even though they were the oldest of all living creatures and had realized the truth of the self. But when the porters, who happened to possess a disposition quite unpalatable to the Lord, saw the sages, they blocked their way with their staffs, despising their glories, although the sages did not deserve such treatment at their hands. Purport by Srila Prabhupada: The four sages were the first born sons of Brahma; therefore, all other living entities, including Lord Shiva, are born later and are therefore younger than the four Kumaras. Although they looked like five-year-old boys and traveled naked, the Kumaras were older than all other living creatures and had realized the truth of the self, such that they could not remain negligible and thus became known as the king of all the world. However, the sages were not to be forbidden to enter the kingdom of Vaikuntha, but by chance the doorman objected to their entrance. This is not fitting. The Lord is always anxious to serve sages like the Kumaras, but in spite of knowing this fact, the doorman astonishingly and outrageously prohibited them from entering. Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta Purport.

So this is a word spoken by whom? Brahma. Brahma is speaking to Devatas. So the description continues: what happened when the sages reached the Vaikuntha planet, they were trying to enter the personal abode of the Supreme Lord, that particular palace. In the Vaikuntha, everyone lives in palaces. Just like when Brahma came to visit Dwaraka, he saw that all the Vishnis, they are living in wonderful palaces. Not Brahma. Sudhama. Brahma also came to Dwaraka, but it is described Sudhama saw so many palaces. So since he had to meet Krishna, he was shown Krishna's palace after he passed through so many security guards, guarding persons. You know that. First he had to pass through some gates to enter the Dwarka township itself. And after that he had to pass through so many palaces of the Vrishnis, Yadus. And then he had to be shown the particular palace in which Krishna was residing. In fact, Krishna doesn't reside in one palace. He resides in 16,108 palaces, because he has those many queens. So like that in the Vaikuntha also, all the devotees live in palatial buildings. But the Kumaras were particularly eager to see the Supreme Lord. They were eager to see the Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "So, these two doormen at the seventh door, even though reddish eyes, Kumaras could make out they are agitated, they are agitated, they are not casting a cool glance, they are agitated."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the doorkeepers' agitated state and contrasts it with Krishna's cool glance, referencing the story of Ashwatthama's punishment.

Okay. So when they tried to enter, six gates nobody blocked. The seventh gate, it is already described, with open minds they entered the seventh door out of their own will, just as they had passed through the six other doors, which were open ones, which are made of gold and diamonds. But the two doormen of the seventh door, they first of all raised their eyebrows. Who are you? And they breathe little heavily, discontented nostrils, reddish eyes. They appear deep. His eyes are red, appeared somewhat agitated. These reddish eyes is common for the Lord and the inhabitants of Vaikuntha. But when the Lord glances with his reddish eyes in his transcendental form, it is as cool as a lotus. That glance is as cool as a lotus. This is described in the first canto, the seventh chapter, the son of Drona punished. This is Ashwatthama at the end of the battle of Kurukshetra. He went and beheaded the sleeping sons of Draupadi. So Draupadi was very much heartbroken, naturally. So then Arjuna, he decided to punish this Ashwatthama who had done this unlawful killing. So Arjuna chased. Now Arjuna was accompanied by Krishna, because even the end of the battle, still Krishna was unharmed. He chased the chariot driver of Arjuna. So Krishna was there with Arjuna when Arjuna chased this Ashwatthama. And Arjuna was very angry against this Ashwatthama, because Ashwatthama was a murderer of innocent boys. Hm. Krishna was also looking but with cool eyes. Krishna's eyes are reddish, but he was looking with cool eyes, as cool as a lotus in a beautiful reservoir of water, like that, Krishna's glance is very cool.

**Key Quote:** "Bhagavata pratikula shilau, that which is not pleasing to the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the doorkeepers' unfavorable behavior towards the Kumaras, contrasting it with the concept of 'anukula' (favorable) devotional service.

So, these two doormen at the seventh door, even though reddish eyes, Kumaras could make out they are agitated. And not only they were looking in an agitated way at the Kumaras, but they blocked their way using their staff, as if despising their glories, who are you, simply creating nuisance here, go away, don't enter. In that mood, they stopped, despising their glories. Tejo vihasya bhagavat pratikul shilau, and they are blocking with their staff and despising their glories. Bhagavata was quite unpalatable to the Lord. Bhagavata pratikul shilau, that which is not pleasing to the Lord. Why is this particularly mentioned? Because in Vaikuntha, everyone is serving the Supreme Lord in a favorable way. All are devotees. All are serving Anukula. Rupa Goswami describes Bhakti in Bhakti Rishams Sindhu. What does he say? The definition of pure devotional service, according to Rupa Goswami: Anyabhilashita shunyam, Jnana karmadi anavrta, Anukuliena krishnanu shilanam. Here, it is the opposite. Bhagavata pratikula shilau. Anukula shila, pratikula shila. Pratikula shila is having a nature displeasing to the Lord. Anukula shila. Either Bhagavata Anukula shila or Krishna Anukula shila. That is pleasing to the Lord. A disposition, a behavior, a proper way of interacting in a favorable way to the Lord. That is Bhagavata Anukula. Here it is Bhagavata pratikula shila. A disposition quite unpalatable to the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "They were stopping Vriddhan... Vriddhan means, the oldest of all living creatures."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the Kumaras' advanced age and self-realization, highlighting the doorkeepers' inappropriate treatment of them.

And who are they stopping? They were stopping Vriddhan. Vriddhan means the oldest of all living creatures. Most elderly personalities. The four kumaras. Because Prabhupada says in the purport, the four sages, the four kumaras, they were the first born sons of Brahma. So all others, sons of Brahma, are later, after the four kumaras. So they are the oldest, means eldest, elderly, in the sense of elderly. Vriddhan, but Dasha, Ardha, Vayasaha, they appear like five-year-old boys, half of ten is five. Vayasan, Vayasaha, Dasha, Ardha, Vayasaha, five-year-old, they appear like five-year-olds. And they are, even though appearing like five-year-olds, they are Vidita Atma Tattva, they are realized the truth of the Self. They have realized the truth of the Self, the self-realized souls. So such self-realized, eldest of all sons of Brahma, and they are sages, they are Naishitika Brahmacharis. So such great personalities never deserve such treatment at the hands of the doorkeepers. Atad Arhanam Stau Atad Arhanam, that which is not proper, undeserving. So, the two doorkeepers, they should not have stopped the Kumaras, in fact they should have welcomed them or received them with great respect and honour because they are self-realised souls and it is also said they were eager to see the Supreme Lord, they were eager to see the Supreme Lord.

#### Kumaras, Age, Renunciation, Brahma Loka, Subtle Body, Effulgence

**Key Quote:** "although they looked like five-year-old boys and traveled naked the Kumaras were older than all other living creatures"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the Kumaras' renunciation, their subtle bodies, and the effulgence associated with residents of higher planets like Brahma Loka.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport the justification for the Kumaras entering that Vaikuntha abode of the Supreme Lord. The four sages were the first born sons of Brahma, therefore all other living entities, including Lord Shiva, are born later and therefore younger than the four Kumaras. Younger means in terms of birth in this material world, Kumaras are the oldest, all others are younger. But the Kumaras, they look like five-year-old boys, they maintain that way. As I explained yesterday, they maintain that type of form and they travel naked. The Sanskrit that is used to describe them: Vata Rasha Naan, covered by the atmosphere or air, that means they are not wearing anything, they are naked, small boys, five-year-old boys, nobody will mind, nobody will say why are you not dressed, five-year-old boys. So they are traveling naked because they are completely renounced. Generally these four Kumaras are not visible to everybody because they are residents of Brahma Loka. So residents of Brahma Loka first of all don't have a gross body, they only have a subtle body and not only that, they have a subtle body in the upper planets, their body has growth, their body has got a glow, an effulgence and that effulgence is so dazzling that even if somebody had the ability to see a subtle form, just like all the residents of Swarga, they have subtle form, they don't have gross form, Swarga and above all subtle form, but even then relatively speaking, they have relatively different degree of bodily effulgence. There are different degrees of bodily effulgence. So more advanced spiritually, more the effulgence.

#### Vamanadeva, Effulgence, Krishna, Butter Theft, Mother Yashoda

**Key Quote:** "Krishna when in Gokula, he would go round as a small boy trying to steal butter."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the examples of Vamanadeva and Krishna's butter-stealing pastimes to illustrate how the Supreme Lord sometimes conceals his effulgence.

So there's a description that when Vaman Deva walked into the sacrificial arena of Bali Maharaj, that time Vaman Deva was Supreme Lord. So Supreme Lord's effulgence is the supreme effulgence and that is ultimately Brahma Josa Jyoti, how bright it illuminates the entire spiritual sky and the entire existence. So nobody's effulgence can be brighter than the Supreme Lord's effulgence. But the Supreme Lord when he incarnates, he does not display his effulgence all the time. Most of the time he doesn't display. Krishna when in Gokula, he would go round as a small boy trying to steal butter. So the gopis would try to prevent Krishna from stealing butter by hiding the butter pots. Mother Yashoda would receive complaints, Krishna is stealing butter. So Mother Yashoda first would say, why will my son steal butter? There is plenty of butter in our house. And not only that, plenty of butter, Yashoda thinking that these complaints are becoming too much, she specially was feeding flavored grass to some limited number of cows. Nandamaharaja had 9 lakh cows. So out of that she had selected some cows and those cows she was feeding flavored grass. And that flavored grass means the milk will be having special flavor. That special flavored grass personally she would feed, personally she would milk the cow. And that milk she would boil nicely, make it yogurt. And that yogurt should personally churn and make butter to feed Krishna specially flavored butter, so that Krishna will not go to neighboring houses to steal butter. Because Yashoda has to wonder, why will he go to somebody else's house and eat butter? Maybe their butter is more tasty. So she said, I will feed Krishna. Why? Because Krishna has special flavored butter. So Yashoda used to prepare this kind of butter. So after she started feeding this kind of butter, Krishna very nicely used to eat. Then Yashoda is feeding lovingly this flavored butter. Then complaints are still coming in spite of this. So she will tell the gopis, why don't you hide the pots, keep it in a dark place so that he cannot see.

**Key Quote:** "So then they used to hide it in a dark place. Still Krishna was stealing."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of Krishna's butter-stealing, describing the gopis' attempts to hide the butter and their eventual realization of Krishna's inherent effulgence.

Small boy, you are complaining he is stealing butter. So then they used to hide it in a dark place. Still Krishna was stealing. So next time they came with complaint, they said, actually we are hiding. Yashoda said, I told you to hide. How can he come and take if you are hiding? No, there is, I think he is able to see even if it is in a dark place because you are decorating him with nice jewelry. And those jewelry you have got from precious stones. And the stones naturally give out light. So then Yashoda said, okay, I will remove his special ornament. They said, no, no, no, no, no. Don't remove his ornaments. He looks so beautiful with those wonderful ornaments. Don't remove his ornaments. But then they began to think that why were they telling don't remove the ornaments? Because he looks very beautiful with the ornaments. Secondly, they are telling these two boys, Krishna and Balarama, even if you remove ornaments, he will not come. He will not come. Even if you remove ornaments, no use, because their body, some kind of glow is there in their body. They couldn't understand that Krishna and Balarama have a natural glow because of their Brahman effulgence. They are Brahman, Supreme Brahman. So naturally they have got the effulgence. So sometimes Krishna and Balarama will display little effulgence. That time some of the gopis will see, oh, there is some effulgence coming out of their bodies. So all these are loving pastimes of Krishna and Balarama.

**Key Quote:** "So when Vamande walked into that assembly, he appeared to be dazzling, dazzling, having dazzling effulgence."
**Summary:** The speaker returns to the example of Vamanadeva, describing how his effulgence surpassed that of the assembled sages in Bali Maharaj's sacrificial arena.

Loving pastimes. So Varman Deva similarly. When he appeared as the son of Aditi and Kashyapa, he appeared like their son, but he was not displaying his effulgence. But when he walked into the sacrificial arena of Bali Maharaj, then all the assembled sages, because that sacrificial arena, there were very, very powerful sages who were performing the sacrifice, especially Bali Maharaj had invited very powerful sages to perform the sacrifices after defeating Indra. So these sages were displaying their effulgence, natural effulgence, very, very bright. So when Vamande walked into that assembly, he appeared to be dazzling, having dazzling effulgence, brighter than the effulgence, the effulgence of the most powerful sages assembled there. So everybody thought, who is this Brahmachari with so much Tejas he is walking in? Because the Tejas also depends on how much Tapasya one has performed. More the Tapasya, more the effulgence from their body. So if these two, if this Brahmachari has performed severe austerities, more than what those sages have performed, then their bodily effulgence, this Brahmachari's bodily effulgence will be more. Tejas will be more. So they thought, here is some very, very, very, very powerfully austere Brahmachari. So they all stood up to receive him out of respect for his austerity, Tejas.

**Key Quote:** "So such Paramahamsas, they are offered respect by everyone, including the other Sanyasis who are not Paramahamsas."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the concept of austerity and self-realization, using the example of Shukadeva Goswami and highlighting the position of Paramahamsas like the Kumaras.

Due to austerity, the Tejas. So, these sages, why I mention this is, these sages, they had performed so much austerity. They are completely dedicated for realizing the absolute truth. So what will they do after realizing the absolute truth? No more need to perform any austerity, but they will be absorbed in meditation on the supreme Brahman truth. Just like Shukadeva Goswami. He was Brahman realized, self-realized. So after his birth, he simply walked away, simply walked away from home, not interested in all the rituals and study, studying Vedic literature, going to Gurukul. He has no use for all that. He is liberated. So why will he go and study? Why will he undergo all the samskara? No need. So he walked away from home. What was he doing? Wandering? Aimlessly, apparently aimlessly wandering. Again, he was also nakedly walking around everywhere. He was not dressed. Why not dressed? Not interested. Completely renounced. Otherwise, according to the Ashrama and Varna, they have to dress themselves. That is the very culture. Varna Ashrama Dharma, everybody is dressed according to their position, according to their Varna, Ashrama. So Brahmachari is dressed a particular way. Grahastha is dressed a particular way. Vanaprastha is dressed a particular way. Sanyasi is dressed a particular way. Sanyasi is dressed generally in saffron. Others don't dress in saffron. So the saffron-dressed Sanyasis, they are the topmost among the four Ashramas. And among them, the Paramahamsas, among the Sanyasis also, are the greatest of the Sanyasis even. So such Paramahamsas, they are offered respect by everyone, including the other Sanyasis who are not Paramahamsas. So these four sages are on the level of Paramahamsas: Sanaka Sanatana San Dhanasanat Kumara. And their bodily effulgence is very, very, very, very bright, because they are the most austere, completely absorbed in meditation on Brahman. No other business. They are not interested in dressing themselves, in any formalities, in any activities, material activities, even activities of self-realization. They are already self-realized. So why will they do any activity for attaining self-realization? They don't want to do anything. So they are simply aimlessly going around everywhere.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord is always anxious to serve sages like the Kumaras."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the doorkeepers' actions were a chance occurrence, as the Lord is always eager to serve sages like the Kumaras, who are the greatest of all created beings.

Absorbed in thought of Brahman. So when these sages try to enter, what is said here by Prabhupada? Such saints were not to be forbidden to enter the kingdom of Vaikuntha, but by chance the doorman objected to their entrance. This is not fitting. This is not proper. By chance the doorman objected. See the doorman, they are not ignorant people. They are themselves enlightened. That's how they are devotees in Vaikuntha. They are enlightened. So they can make out, even though these Kumaras look like five-year-old boys, naked, wandering naked, there is no possibility the doorman would have thought, why are these small boys simply coming here? No. They couldn't have thought like that because the Kumaras were self-realized. They were having that effulgence of great personalities. They were the oldest personalities. So there is no possibility that the doorman would have, out of ignorance, mistaken them to be small boys. No. That is not possible. Therefore it is said that by chance the doorman objected to their entrance. It should not have happened. By chance it happened. The Lord is always anxious to serve sages like the Kumaras, because the Supreme Lord is Surudam Sarvabhutanam. He is the topmost well-wisher of every living being. Now the Kumaras, they are the greatest among all the created beings. So how much the Lord will be inclined towards them? Can you just imagine? The Lord is the best well-wisher even of the most fallen condition soul. So how much more will he be a well-wisher of the Kumaras? So Prabhupada says, the Lord is always anxious to serve sages like the Kumaras. I explained in earlier class that the devotees in Vaikuntha always want to serve the Lord to please him. And the Lord is looking for opportunity to serve his devotees and please them. This is what is the reciprocation between the Lord and the devotees in the spiritual world. So rightly Prabhupada is telling here, the Lord is always anxious to serve sages like the Kumaras.

**Key Quote:** "the doorman astonishingly and outrageously prohibited them from entering."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights the astonishment and outrage caused by the doorkeepers' actions, emphasizing that it was an extraordinary incident even in Vaikuntha.

And in spite of knowing this fact, the doorman astonishingly and outrageously prohibited them from entering. Astonishing. It is very astonishing. Why? Everybody will think, why are they stopping? It is said here, in the next two words it is said, as other divinities were looking on, they stopped. Everybody else is looking. Why are they stopping? The six doormen, six pairs of doormen, first six doors, never stopped. They knew, these Kumaras are most eligible to enter. They are very eager to see the Lord. So the sixth doorman never stopped. So why this seventh door, these doormen are stopping? Others are looking. Why are they stopping? So astonishingly and outrageously, others would not have approved. Outrageously means shockingly bad behaviour. It is shocking. It is bad behaviour. Somebody deserving, why are they being stopped? Why are these doormen stopping? It is very wrong. It is not befitting. It is not proper behaviour. So astonishingly and outrageously prohibited them, prohibited them from entering. So this incident is an extraordinary incident, even in Vaikuntha. In Vaikuntha everything is extraordinary. Nothing is ordinary. But still, this sort of extraordinary incident is astonishing. It is not in line with something done to please the Lord. By stopping them, the doormen are not pleasing the Supreme Lord Narayana. No. It is not pleasing the Lord. That is what is described here, Bhagavat Pratikulashilav. They are not expected to behave like this. They are pure devotees. Why are they stopping? Why are they doing something which is not pleasing to the Lord? So others are all astonished and others are considering this as outrageous behaviour, not proper behaviour.

Not proper behaviour, because they know. These doormen, they know what is pleasing to the Lord. They know and they are standing there to serve the Lord, in a way to please the Lord. They are standing there for serving the Lord only. And somebody has come very eager to see the Lord, who deserves to be actually welcomed, such persons, who should be welcomed, who are eager to see the Lord, who have no other selfish motive. Why are they being stopped? Astonishingly and outrageously they are being prohibited. So this is something very, very, very, very unprecedented. So it will be described further how the events unfold, which leads to the pastimes of the Supreme Lord, extraordinary pastimes of the Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "A Yogi can expand himself into at most nine or ten forms. But each form, expanded form by the Yogic power will do the same activity."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Krishna's expansions are different from those of a yogi, highlighting the power of Yoga Maya.

This is the power of yoga maya. Yoga maya arranges in such a way that each one will think Krishna is in this palace. They will not know. Prabhupada describes elsewhere that when Krishna used to come out of his palace, in front of every palace there will be one person waiting to take Krishna to the assembly hall every day morning after he finishes morning duties. So, 16,108 palaces Krishna will come out and become one. 16,108 form will become one. One Krishna will go to the assembly hall. But when he comes back, he will divide himself into 16,108 different forms. Not divide, he multiplies actually, he expands. And then each palace he will go. But this is not seen ordinarily. Only when Narada wanted to see how the Lord is living in Dwaraka, Narada knew that Krishna will be actually performing some extraordinary Leela there. That's time. Leela. So Narada Muni went to see Krishna in Dwaraka. That time Krishna gave darshan to Narada. Every palace he saw Krishna is present simultaneously and in each palace he is doing totally different activity. Why is it mentioned that he is doing something extraordinary? Because a Yogi can expand himself into at most nine or ten forms, but each form, expanded form by the Yogic power will do the same activity. Just like in one form the Yogi is lifting his hand, all nine other forms, expanded forms, the same action. It will not be different. No possibility of different actions in different forms simultaneously, not possible.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna He expands Every form is Independent form Like an independent form It is Krishna only But it is like an independent form Separate person"
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain the nature of Krishna's expansions, emphasizing that each form is independent and capable of separate activities, thoughts, and feelings, and how Krishna reciprocates with each devotee individually.

Just like Prabhupada says, television screen. Television screen will just display whatever that particular channel which you have tuned. Whatever they are broadcasting, that only will come. Earlier we had only one channel, Doordarshan. So any TV you go, same thing will be visible, correct? Because originally nothing is there in the TV. Actually some broadcast is happening from some broadcasting station. Like that, this yogi when he expands, the expanded forms don't have any independent movement capacity, thinking capacity, nothing. Krishna, he expands, every form is independent form, like an independent form. It is Krishna only, but it is like an independent form, separate person, separate form, separate thinking, separate willing, separate feeling, separate senses, separate activities, separate opulence, everything separate. But who can make out this? Who can understand this? Unless Krishna reveals, it is not possible to understand, not possible to see or know or understand. It's not possible. In the spiritual world Krishna reciprocates with you. With each devotee personally, individually. So that is inconceivable, even for the devotees. It is inconceivable. So we cannot understand how, because for a neutral observer it will appear like Krishna is one person and there are so many in Gorakumandavan or in Vaikuntha, Narayana is one person and then there are so many other devotees. Dorman is there and some queen is there and some maid servant is there and somebody else is glorifying the Lord, somebody else is preparing some food for the Lord. So many servants are doing for one Lord in one Vaikuntha planet, entire planet, only one person. But actually that one Lord reciprocates with every devotee individually or personally. That is inconceivable. That the mayavadis cannot understand. Ordinary people cannot understand. Neutral observers cannot see.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the concept of time in the spiritual world and how devotees are constantly engaged in serving the Lord, even though the complexities are inconceivable.

So that's it for this. Not immediately, if you do not understand, you cannot tell that you can understand for yourself. If you never really like whom you like, you do not like, you are right to say so much and we started back this by saying you cannot understand apparently, but not just nearly what one person sees, you do not understand it will be a lot of time of giving a processors that then I do able to see what several of these offended individuals are companion to contribute to mortal knowledge while yet having understand them again and the system is there that we might very much restroom to divine descrição in the. They cannot see. Even the devotees, they are engaged in Lord's service all the time because all the time the Lord is accepting their service. So the concept of time in the spiritual world is very very different. It is described as ever present time in Brahma Samhita. There's a description. Time in the Goloka Vrindavana or even in Vaikuntha is like half a moment does not pass. Always present, present time. This is like now it is let's say 9:16. Every time they will see what's the time? 9:16. If there were to be a clock, there's no clock in Vaikuntha like that. But I'm just telling for a neutral observer it will look like what time is in Vaikuntha? 9:16. Hundred years have passed, what time is in Vaikuntha? 9:16. Hundred years have passed on the earth. So it is ever present time. We can't conceive of this. Yet there is day, there is night, there is so many things. Everything is going on as if there is time which is passing. So it is inconceivable for us. Nobody can understand this. That's why devotees don't break their head and understand all this complexity. They are just satisfied to know that Krishna or Narayana is their object of service and they are very happy rendering it, rendering service, their particular service.

**Key Quote:** "That spiritual advancement is not dependent on position, is not dependent on age, is not dependent on, some material considerations, no."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the story of Ajamila to illustrate that spiritual advancement is not dependent on age or position but on sincere devotional service.

Next question. Shiva is younger than Kumara in terms of birth. Just like Krishna, when he is born as son of Vasudeva, he is so young, no? Compared to Brahma, compared to all the other Devatas. He is the youngest, no? Small, that's how Brahma is coming and seeing, who is this boy? What is he doing? Indra is telling this Vrindavan Nivasis, every year they offer me Yajna. This year they are not offering Yajna because some foolish boy, talkative boy, not foolish boy, talkative boy is telling them, don't offer sacrifice. So they are listening to him? Indra is not able to understand. Who is this boy? So not able to understand. The spiritual advancement, you cannot understand. That spiritual advancement is not dependent on position, is not dependent on age, is not dependent on some material considerations, no. Like Ajamila, he had become so sinful. But he chanted helplessly Narayana's name, calling out his son. He became spiritually advanced. How advanced? That after the Yamarutas released him, I mean Vishnurutas, got him released from the Yamarutas. And Vishnurutas disappeared, Yamarutas went back to Yamloka, to find out from Yamaraja, what happened? Why we are stopped? And then Ajamila, what did he do? He continued with his wife and children? No. Immediately went to Haridwar. I wasted my life. Now I have a second chance. Otherwise I should have been taken to hell for punishment. So now let me very carefully do devotional service. And what is the standard of his service? That within a short time, the same Vishnurutas came to take him back to Godhead, in Vaikuntha aeroplane. So he became spiritually advanced. Sinful man, sinful man suddenly gave up all sinful activities, became very, very, very, very serious about devotional service and performed first class devotional service. Short time became eligible to go back to Godhead. Perfect.

**Key Quote:** "Chant, but call out for the Lord helplessly."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of chanting with helplessness and clarifies that Shiva and the Kumaras are in different categories, both being liberated souls.

Perfected his devotional service. It began with this helplessly chanting Narayana. That's why Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, chant, but call out for the Lord helplessly. Call out for the Lord helplessly. Then very quickly you become advanced. Just like Ajamila. You will also become advanced. Anybody can become advanced. Even the most sinful man can become advanced that way. So you cannot compare age and say, oh because this person is more elderly, so he is more advanced. No. That is not the criterion for advancement. Neither position. You are now talking of Shiva being expansion or incarnation of the Supreme Lord. Shiva is not a Jeeva. Shiva is in a category by himself. He is a special kind of incarnation of the Lord. Gunavatara. Hmm.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Shiva is not a Jeeva. For Jeeva karma applies. He is not Jeeva. So for him there is no karma. Whatever he does."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Shiva's birth is different from that of a Jeeva and that he is always on the liberated platform, not influenced by karma or the Gunas.

So Shiva is in his position. Kumaras are in their own position, as liberated souls. So everybody has got their own position in the liberated state. Of course in the liberated state. Conditioned state their position is based on their karma. But liberated souls, they have their specific individual position in relationship with Krishna in the spiritual world. That is the constitutional position. You understand? So don't compare Kumaras, oldest, but Shiva is younger, but more advanced. There is no comparison like that. See Shiva, just like Krishna appears to take birth as son of Vasudeva and Devaki. Shiva appears to come out of the anger of Brahma, when Brahma became angry, when Kumaras refused to get married and increase the population, to do the work of Prajapati. They didn't want to be Prajapati. They didn't want to do service of Prajapati. So then Brahma became, immediately what did Brahma do? Became angry. How can you disobey me? And out of the anger came Rudra, Shiva. So apparently Shiva is born later than the Kumaras. Shiva is born out of the anger of Brahma. But Shiva is not a personality, appearing out of some karma, not due to karma. He has nothing to do with karma. He is not a Jeeva. For Jeeva karma applies. He is not Jeeva. So for him there is no karma, whatever he does. He is incarnation of the Lord. So his activities are all liberated platform. He is on the liberated platform always. He is never under the Gunas. He is a master of the, personification of Gunas, Durga Devi. He is the husband of Durga Devi. He is the husband or the Lord of Durga Devi. So he is not, he doesn't come under the influence of the Gunas, Shiva. But he is not equal to Vishnu. He is not equal to Vishnu. He is not Vishnu Tattva. He is in a separate category by himself, eternally so.

**Key Quote:** "For the Leela to take place, it is arranged that Balarama doesn't know that Krishna has expanded and Brahma has stolen. Balarama doesn't know. For the sake of the Leela."
**Summary:** The speaker answers a question about why Balarama didn't know about Krishna's expansions during the Brahma-vimohana-lila, explaining that it was arranged by Yogamaya for the sake of the pastimes.

Krishna expanded himself into Gopal's calf, cows, Krishna cooking. So Brahma was not aware about this. Later Brahma came to know that Krishna himself, who expanded into Gopal, Gopal, cow, cows. So here the question is, Krishna and Brahma didn't come to know. They tend to have no idea. So Brahma also came to know when something happened. What happened? When they were cow herding, the older cows came running down to the calves. Even though it's very unusual, they never do so and they started, you know, licking the body of the calf. And cowherd men who were in charge of those cows, they became very angry at the cows. But when they came down, they are suddenly embracing the cowherd boys. So Balarama saw unusual affection between the cowherd boys and the cowherd men and between the cows and the cows. And then he asked Krishna, what is going on? What is happening? So your question is, how is that Balarama doesn't know? This is called Leela. For the Leela to take place, it is arranged that Balarama doesn't know that Krishna has expanded and Brahma has stolen. Balarama doesn't know, for the sake of the Leela. Like Kaliya, Dhaman Leela, when everybody became anxious, where is Krishna? Some ill omens. And then they all went and Balarama went with them. Then they are all trying to do something to save Krishna. He is in the clutches of Kaliya. Balarama is laughing. He knows nothing will happen to Krishna. So he is telling, don't worry, nothing will happen to Krishna. But they are not able to understand or believe that. They are all anxious for saving Krishna. So Balarama knows. So for the sake of the Leela, Yogamaya reveals something, does not reveal something. So it is all arranged by Yogamaya, which is Krishna's own energy, for the sake of his pastimes. Like these doormen. How is it that they did not recognize the Kumaras? Such great persons and they are thinking, five year old boys, why are you coming here? Can't they make out? They are great sages, great Tapasvi, self realized, oldest, senior most, sages, completely renounced. They can't make out. So it is the arrangement of Yogamaya for the pastimes of the Supreme Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse about the Kumaras becoming angry and sets the stage for discussing anger in the context of devotion and liberation.

When the Kumaras, although by far the fittest persons, were thus forbidden entrance by the two chief doorkeepers of Sri Hari, while other divinities looked on, their eyes suddenly turned red because of anger, due to their great eagerness to see their most beloved master Sri Hari, the personality of Godhead. Please repeat this translation. When the Kumaras, although by far the fittest persons, were thus forbidden entrance by the two chief doorkeepers of Sri Hari, while other divinities looked on, their eyes suddenly turned red because of anger, due to their great eagerness to see their most beloved master Sri Hari, the personality of Godhead, performed by Srila Prabhupada.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, the Vedic sociological conception is that a sanyasi should not be restricted. He is allowed to go anywhere and everywhere he wants, and he has not refused any gift he might demand from a householder."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the role and freedom of a sanyasi in Vedic culture, emphasizing their duty to preach and not be restricted.

According to the Vedic system, a sanyasi, a person in the renounced order of life, is dressed in saffron coloured garments. This saffron dress is practically a passport for the mendicant and sanyasi to go anywhere. The sanyasi's duty is to enlighten people in Krishna consciousness. Those in the renounced order of life have no other business but preaching the glories and supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, the Vedic sociological conception is that a sanyasi should not be restricted. He is allowed to go anywhere and everywhere he wants, and he has not refused any gift he might demand from a householder.

**Key Quote:** "As Lord Krishna states in the Bhagavad Gita, he is the best friend of all living entities, suhrdam sarva bhutanam."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights Krishna as the best friend and explains the relationship between desire and anger, introducing the concept of anger as the younger brother of desire.

The four Kumaras came to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana. The word suhrtama, best of all friends, is important. As Lord Krishna states in the Bhagavad Gita, he is the best friend of all living entities, suhrdam sarva bhutanam. No one can be a greater well-wishing friend to any living entity than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is so kindly disposed towards everyone, that in spite of our completely forgetting our relationship with the Supreme Lord, he comes himself, sometimes personally as Lord Krishna appeared on this earth, and sometimes as his devotee, as did Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and sometimes he sends his bona fide devotees to reclaim all the fallen souls. Therefore, he is the greatest well-wisher. He is the best well-wishing friend of everyone, and the Kumaras wanted to see him. The doorkeepers should have known that the four sages had no other business, and therefore to restrict them from entering the palace was not apt. In this verse, it is figuratively stated that the younger brother of desire suddenly appeared in person when the sages were forbidden to see their most beloved personality of Godhead. The younger brother of desire is anger.

#### anger, liberation, Krishna consciousness, sense gratification

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The difference between the anger of an ordinary person and that of a liberated person is that an ordinary person becomes angry because his sense desires are not being fulfilled, whereas a liberated person like the Kumaras becomes angry when restricted in the discharge of duties for serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between anger in the conditioned and liberated states, emphasizing that liberated individuals become angry when service to Krishna is obstructed, not for personal gratification.

If once desire is not fulfilled, the younger brother anger follows. Here we can mark that even great saintly persons like the Kumaras were also angry, but they were not angry for their personal interests. They were angry because they were forbidden to enter the palace to see the personality of Godhead. Therefore, the theory that in the perfectional stage one should not have anger is not supported in this verse. Anger will continue even in the liberated stage. These four mendicant brothers, the Kumaras, were considered liberated persons, but still they were angry because they were restricted in their service to the Lord. The difference between the anger of an ordinary person and that of a liberated person is that an ordinary person becomes angry because his sense desires are not being fulfilled, whereas a liberated person like the Kumaras becomes angry when restricted in the discharge of duties for serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the previous verse, it has been clearly mentioned that the Kumaras were liberated persons. Vidhita Atma Tattva means one who understands the truth of self-realization. One who does not understand the truth of self-realization is called ignorant. But one who understands the self, the super-self, their interrelation and activities in self-realization is called Vidhita Atma Tattva. Although the Kumaras were already liberated persons, they nevertheless became angry. This point is very important. Becoming liberated does not necessitate losing one's sensual activities. Sense activities continue even in the liberated stage. The difference is, however, that sense activities in liberation are accepted only in connection with Krishna Consciousness, whereas sense activities in the conditioned stage are enacted for personal sense gratification.

**Key Quote:** "Here kamanuja, kama-anuja, the younger brother of desire means if desire is unfulfilled, it is generally followed by anger."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the poetic description of anger as the younger brother of desire, explaining that anger arises when desire is unfulfilled.

and therefore they became angry suddenly they became angry and it is described their anger was very much visible that their eyes were open and they could see the anger and their eyes were suddenly turned red. The Vaikuntha Nivasis, their eyes are naturally red. But generally in the material world we don't see somebody with red eyes except when they become angry or they have some problem with the eye. Otherwise we don't see red eyes, somebody with red eyes. So Prabhupada elaborately explains in the purport this point of anger and very poetic description. kamanujena Sudden appearance of the younger brother of desire in the personality of the Kumaras. So this is a description of anger as something which Anuja means also to follow. Lakshmana is Rama Anuja. So both the meanings are valid. Anuja means younger brother. Anuja. Ja means one who takes birth. Anu means afterwards, following. So younger brother takes birth after the older one is born. Correct? So Anuja means younger brother. And Anuja also means one who follows. One who follows. So here kamanuja, kama-anuja, the younger brother of desire means if desire is unfulfilled, it is generally followed by anger. Anger is younger brother of desire. This is a poetic description. It actually means anger follows desire which is unfulfilled.

**Key Quote:** "Anger in the conditioned state, which is a negative quality, which is detrimental for our spiritual progress, which can result in criminal activities being performed, laws being broken, uncontrolled anger."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the negative quality of anger in the conditioned state with the possibility of anger being a spiritual emotion in the liberated state.

Now if you read the Bhagavad Gita, nowhere it is mentioned, at least as far as I know, that anger exists in the liberated state and that is a pure emotion that is not described in the Bhagavad Gita. Is it there somewhere in the Bhagavad Gita? Even on the purports I didn't see. But in the Bhagavatam there is description. Anger in the conditioned state, which is a negative quality, which is detrimental for our spiritual progress, which can result in criminal activities being performed, laws being broken, uncontrolled anger. Sometimes they say murders happen simply because the person who committed that murder was unable to control his anger. So, and among devotees, what happens if anger is uncontrolled? Especially by neophyte devotees. Uncontrolled anger may lead to Vaishnava Prath. Being committed by the neophyte who becomes angry. So, anger in the conditioned state is very, very negative quality. It's very negative quality. But in the liberated state, anger is one of the many spiritual emotions.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Sometimes Radharani becomes angry with Krishna. That anger is out of love for Krishna. It is out of love for Krishna. So, in that anger also there is love."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that anger can be an expression of love in the liberated state, distinguishing between kama (lust) and prema (love for Krishna).

If you carefully study the twelve kinds of loving relationships, love is expressed indirectly in seven ways. In anger there is love. Raudra, rasa. Twelve kinds of rasa. Five are primary rasas. Seven secondary rasas. Sometimes Radharani becomes angry with Krishna. That anger is out of love for Krishna. It is out of love for Krishna. So, in that anger also there is love. But that love is always in the liberated state. There is no question of love in the conditioned state. In the conditioned state, love is reflected as lust. Prema is reflected as, pervertedly reflected as kama. So, in the Chaitanya Charita Amrita, Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami distinguishes between kama and prema. What is the definition of kama he gives and what is the definition of prema? Atma yendriya, preeti vancha. That's called kama. A strong desire to satisfy my own senses is called kama. Is called lust. And a very strong desire to please Krishna's senses. Krishna yendriya, preeti vancha, prema nama dhare. It is called prema. It is called love. So, prema is the strong desire to please Krishna's senses. So, in prema, in trying to please Krishna, in trying to satisfy Krishna, sometimes, when there is an obstacle, then there could be anger, even in the liberated state. And that's exactly what is happening here. The Kumaras are liberated personalities. They are very angry. They are eager to see their beloved, most beloved master. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Hari. And they are being stopped. Though they are the most qualified persons, fittest persons, to approach and have darshan. So, it is described here, this extraordinary incident, in this section of the Bhagavatam, to help us understand, what is this anger in the liberated state. So, elaborately, Prabhupada describes. First of all, Prabhupada says, according to the Vedic system, a sanyasi, a person in renounced order of life,

**Summary:** The speaker returns to the topic of sanyasis, explaining the significance of saffron robes and their primary duty to preach Krishna consciousness.

which is dressed in saffron-colored garments. This is the Vedic culture, that saffron color indicates the person is in the renounced order. Of course, now, Vedic culture is not so much followed. Somebody wants to go to Ayyappa temple, and has taken some kind of vow, to follow some rules. So, then they wear saffron. Sometimes they wear black. Some of them wear red. Some of them wear saffron. Like that. So, but strictly in the Vedic culture, except sanyasis, nobody dresses in saffron-colored garments. It is reserved for sanyasis. Now, that is because, this saffron dress is practically a passport for the mendicant and sanyasi to go anywhere. He is identified as a sanyasi by his saffron dress, which means that he can go anywhere without any restriction. Mendicant. Do you understand what is mendicant? What is the meaning of the word mendicant? It is an English word. Beggar. One who begs. Now, sanyasis, sometimes, they go begging from householders, simply to get an opportunity to enter the householder's house. And why are they trying to enter? In order to enlighten them in Krishna consciousness. That's why Prabhupada says, those in the renounced order of life have no other business but preaching the glories and supremacy to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Vedic culture, the sanyasis are simply meant to travel and preach. Especially to the householders who become busy with their family life and may forget the prime goal of life, self-realization. To awaken such householders, to enlighten them in Krishna consciousness, a sanyasi travels and preaches.

This chapter was entitled, 'The Pandavas Retired Timely.' So the Pandavas retired and they prepared themselves to go back to Godhead.

So the 50th verse: Draupadi Chatad Aagnyaya Patinam Anapekshatam Vasudeve Bhagavati Hekantamatir Apatam. The meaning of this 50th verse is: Draupadi also saw that her husbands, without caring for her, were leaving home. She knew well about Lord Vasudeva and the love of Krishna, the personality of Godhead. Both she and Subhadra became absorbed in thoughts of Krishna and attained the same results as their husbands.

Everyone has to take care of his own plane, and if there is any danger, no other plane can help another in that condition."

Before death comes. It's not that at the time of death I'll start practicing, I'll start preparing. No. At the time of death, if you are not ready to go back to Godhead, we have to accept another body. We have to accept another birth. So therefore it is said here that the example is given of flying an airplane. Now, each one has to fly his or her own plane to go back to Godhead. Of course, this is not literal, but you can literally. It is the process or the method or the way to go back to Godhead should be known to each person before death comes.

At the time of quitting the body, there is no question of taking help of another devotee or spiritual master or anybody like that. No. Prabhupada clarifies, "The help is however offered on the ground before flying in space." Similarly, the spiritual master, the father, the mother, the relatives, the husband, and others can all render help during one's lifetime. While we are living in this present body, we should take help, we should take guidance, we should practice, we should live in the association of people who are seriously practicing.

We take help from the spiritual master. We take help from the father, mother, the relatives, all our superiors. There is a verse in the Bhagavatam that says, "Don't accept the position of becoming a father or a mother or a husband or a teacher or a devata or a king if you cannot deliver your dependents from the cycle of birth and death." So there is a responsibility towards a dependent or a subordinate that the superior has to train, educate, and help the subordinate to actually prepare them for going back to Godhead at the end of life. So therefore they are specifically mentioned here by Srila Prabhupada: The spiritual master, the father, the mother, the relatives, the husband, and others can all render help.

But while crossing the sea, one has to take care of himself and utilize the instructions formally received. While actually going back to Godhead, when quitting the body, after quitting the body, one has to utilize those instructions. One has to have had sufficient practice, and that will be also explained what is that practice, what is that we have to do is clearly explained in the later part of this purport. Continue to read the purport by Srila Prabhupada: Draupadi had five husbands, and no one asked Draupadi to come when they were going back to Godhead. The five husbands, the five Pandavas, Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva, none of them asked Draupadi, "Please come with me, let us together go back to Godhead." No. Why? Because Draupadi had to take care of herself without waiting for her great husbands.

**Key Quote:** "While in this material existence the relationships are between the bodies, it is not between the souls... the soul however has eternal spiritual relationship with Krishna"
**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between temporary material relationships and the eternal spiritual relationship of the soul with Krishna.

So it is very clear, while in this body, while in this material existence, the relationships are between the bodies. It is not between the souls. The material relationships are always between two bodies. So this we have to remember, and when we quit the body, the relations are finished. There is no more relationship. Now the soul, however, has eternal spiritual relationship with Krishna. The individual soul has eternal particular loving relationship with Krishna, and through Krishna, through the relationship with Krishna, the soul is related to other souls also.

**Key Quote:** "Draupadi's relationship with her five husbands was as long as the bodies were there... Draupadi had to take care of herself without waiting for her great husbands"
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the temporary nature of material relationships and highlights Draupadi's self-reliance in her spiritual practice.

So those relationships are spiritual, eternal. They are not temporary. They are not just based on the material body, no. So Draupadi's relationship with her five husbands was as long as the bodies were there. Even in terms of duty of the wife towards the husband or husband towards the wife, it is only as long as the body is there. Once one quits the body, there is no more duty, there is no more relationship, material relationship, I mean material relationship. So therefore Srila Prabhupada said, "Draupadi had to take care of herself without waiting for her great husbands, and because she was already trained, she at once took to concentration upon the lotus feet of Lord Vasudeva Krishna, the personality of God."

#### qualities of Krishna, responsibility, chivalry, Kshatriya dharma
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/_8Hx3BFK-YU?t=45
**Verse References:** BG 18.43
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "A Kshatriya is courageous in battle. He never retreats from a battle."
**Summary:** The lecture discusses Krishna's quality of accepting responsibility, particularly his display of chivalry as a Kshatriya, referencing the qualities of a Kshatriya as described in the Bhagavad Gita.

In this session we will be discussing the same verses which we were discussing in the previous few sessions. Four sessions we have already completed, discussing these set of verses, 25 to 30 of the 16th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. These are the verses describing the 40 transcendental qualities that are to be found in the Supreme Lord, which Mother Earth is describing to Dharma. So among the qualities of Krishna, one of the qualities described is his responsibility, quality of accepting responsibility. So even in his transcendental pastimes, his different role in his transcendental pastimes, he accepts responsibility and carries out his responsibility very, very wonderfully. So Sri Ramaprabha is describing when he is playing the part of a Kshatriya as the son of Maharaj Vasudeva, he displayed that Kshatriya quality of being chivalrous. So Sri Ramaprabha says, a Kshatriya king has to secure a wife by fighting or kidnapping a princess, sometimes. This sort of behavior for a Kshatriya is praiseworthy in the sense that a Kshatriya must show his power of chivalry to his would-be wife, so that the daughter of a Kshatriya is not taken away from him. The daughter of a Kshatriya can see the valor of her would-be husband. A Kshatriya princess, she wants demonstration before she marries another Kshatriya king. She wants to see his power of chivalry, his bravery. Not that he is dressed up and he is having some wealth, but actually in his heart he is not having that courage to fight. Kshatriya means he should have the courage to fight to the extent that if required he is willing to give up his life, but he will not give up the fight. Yuddhecha api apalayanam. This is described in the Bhagavad Gita by Krishna in the 18th chapter, in the 43rd verse, describing the qualities of a Kshatriya. A Kshatriya is courageous in battle. He never retreats from a battle.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So like that he had to secure so many different wives."
**Summary:** The segment narrates instances from the pastimes of Lord Rama and Lord Krishna where they displayed chivalry and courage to secure their wives, highlighting Rama breaking the bow of Lord Shiva and Krishna rescuing Rukmini.

So, in displaying his courage in battle, Krishna, in order to marry some princess, he actually displayed his courage by actually fighting in some cases. So Srila Prabhupada says even the personality of Godhead Sri Rama displayed such a chivalry, a spirit of chivalry during his marriage. He broke the strongest bow called Haradhanus and achieved the hand of Sita Devi, the mother of all opulence. Lord Rama is a supreme lord, but he appeared as the son of a Kshatriya, as Dasharatha's son. And when Vishwamitra took Lord Ramachandra, he was a small boy, a young prince. Vishwamitra took him to protect his sacrificial arena. Dasharatha initially was hesitant, but when Vishwamitra explained to Dasharatha, your son is no ordinary person. He is a supreme lord incarnated as your son. So don't have any doubts whether your son can give protection to my sacrificial arena. Anyway, Dasharatha agreed and finally sent Rama and Lakshmana. So Rama and Lakshmana were young princes, but they fought against 14,000 rakshasa associates of Ravana who were disturbing the sacrificial arena of Vishwamitra Rishi and other saintly persons. So Rama killed all of them and delivered all the 14,000 rakshasa. So that's only possible for the Supreme Personality of Karthik. But he displayed that, that chivalry. And when Sita Swayamvara, Janaka had declared that whichever king wants to marry my daughter, beautiful daughter, the mother of all opulence, Sita Devi, Lakshmiji, then they have to actually break one very, very, very heavy bow, Haradhanu, bow of Lord Shiva. Three hundred men had to carry it to bring it to the place where the competition was to take place. And single-handedly of course Lord Rama lifted it. Not only lifted it as a heavy bow, but he also broke that strongest bow easily, very effortlessly he broke it. So he actually demonstrated his strength as a powerful Kshatriya. Lord Krishna also he had to fight like a chivalrous Kshatriya to secure a wife. Just like Rukmini, it was scheduled, Rukmini was scheduled to marry someone else, Shishupala, against her wish and against her father's wish also, her elder brother decided to marry Rukmini to Shishupala. And Rukmini wanted to marry Krishna because she is a devotee of Krishna. So she sent a secret letter to Krishna, kindly rescue me. Krishna came to rescue and he had to fight against the army of Shishupala, army of Shishupala, and he fought very bravely and kidnapped Rukmini and brought her safely to Dwaraka.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "He is not irresponsible at any time."
**Summary:** This section emphasizes Krishna's full responsibility in all his transcendental pastimes, proving his supremacy through his actions and declarations.

So like that he had to secure so many different wives. A Kshatriya generally marries more than one wife. So Krishna as part of his Leela he married 16,108 princesses. Among them 16,108 princesses were all held captive by one Bhaumasura. So Krishna fought against Bhaumasura and rescued these princesses. So like that he displayed full responsibility in every action of his different transcendental pastimes. He is not irresponsible at any time. And of course he is all perfect. Krishna is the Supreme Lord, is all perfect. But he demonstrates that also. Not simply by way of proclaiming or claiming by words, I am the greatest, or I am the Supreme, or I am the Lord of everything. Krishna declares in Bhagavad Gita I am the Lord of all the planets in the entire creation. So when he declares that he also proves it. When he displayed his universal form he proved it. When he fought against all the demons he proved it. When he accepted the challenge of different Kshatriyas and defeated them he proved his supremacy.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Only fools are ungrateful to their benefactors."
**Summary:** The lecture delves into the quality of knowledge, breaking it down into five subheadings: intelligence, gratefulness, understanding circumstances, perfect knowledge, and self-knowledge, emphasizing the importance of gratitude and the Lord's reciprocation of devotional service.

Then there is one more quality called knowledge. The 14th quality called knowledge. It can be analyzed under five subheadings. So the first one is intelligence. Second one, second subheading of knowledge is gratefulness. Third one is power of understanding the circumstantial environments of place, object and time. And fourth one is perfect knowledge of everything in this world. And the fifth one, the last one, under the five subheadings. The fifth one is knowledge of the self is the most confidential knowledge. We all look like we are some material body, product of matter, and we think that way also. I am this body. But actually we are not a body. We are not material in nature. We are spiritual. We are spirit soul. So this knowledge of the self, the real I, a spirit soul, this knowledge is the most confidential one. It is called Brahmavidya, Atmavidya, Adhyatmavidya. Different names are same. Knowledge of the self. So these five subheadings, Prabhupada explains briefly regarding gratitude. Prabhupada says, Only fools are ungrateful to their benefactors. What does it mean? If I take some benefit from somebody, I should be grateful to that person who is offering me some benefit. That's the least I can do after receiving some benediction. I should at least be grateful to that person. So the Supreme Lord's position is that he does not require any benefit from anyone, because he is completely full in himself. Atma Rama is self-satisfied, because he is the owner of every resource. He is the supreme proprietor of everything and everyone. So what is the need for him? There is no need for him of anything. So there is no question of the Lord being in want. But still when his pure devotees render him service, he feels benefited by their pure devotional service, and therefore he feels grateful to his devotees for their unsophisticated, unconditional service, and tries to reciprocate that service of the devotees by himself

**Key Quote:** "Krishna feels a sense of gratitude for his devotees rendering him service."
**Summary:** The segment continues discussing Krishna's gratitude towards his devotees and his all-knowing nature due to his omnipresence through the Brahma Jyoti.

rendering service to the devotee. Although the devotee does not expect anything in return from the Lord. See how pure devotees serve Krishna out of love for him and they don't want anything in return. Krishna accepts his service and he wants to repay his devotees, and therefore he renders service to him though the devotees don't want any service. Anyway he is the only maintainer of everyone. Still Krishna feels a sense of gratitude for his devotees rendering him service. Now regarding the Lord being all knowing, one of the subheadings of knowledge was that gratefulness and another subheading was perfect knowledge of everything. Perfect knowledge of everything. So regarding that Srila Prabhupada explains here the Vedas say Brahma Brahma Brahma Brahma. That means the Lord is all pervading, present everywhere by the omnipresent rays of his effulgence called Brahma Jyoti. There is a Brahma Jyoti that is effulgence of the Lord that spread everywhere in the entire creation. And because he is present everywhere he is also he knows everything. Simply because he is conscious. He is conscious being. So since he is conscious and he is present everywhere he knows everything. So that is the way it is explained he is all knowing the Srila Prabhupada. So we will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "That is the first incarnation of the Lord before the creation of this entire material cosmic manifestation."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of the Lord's transcendental qualities and explains the concept of Maha Vishnu as the first incarnation before creation, residing in the material energy portion of the spiritual sky.

Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya, Narayanam Namaskritya, Naram Chai Vanarottamam, Devim Saraswatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udhirayet. In this session we continue to discuss from the verses 25 to 30 of the 16th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. These set of verses describe the transcendental qualities, 40 transcendental qualities of the Lord, of which some of them are described in detail in the purport by Srila Prabhupada. So we will conclude. We will conclude with this part 7 of the discussion on these verses. This is the last part, the reminder of the purport that we have not yet discussed. We are going to complete it in this session. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, the last part of the purport, "This material world is a product of the Mahat Tattva, which is a state of the Lord's presence, which is a state of the Lord's dreaming condition in his yoga nidra mystic slumber in the causal ocean." A lot of technical terms in here. Now the Supreme Lord, he incarnates in this material world for the purpose of the material creation, maintenance, destruction, for the sake of... attracting the conditioned souls to go back to Godhead for the sake of giving transcendental knowledge for displaying his transcendental pastimes and so many purposes. So different incarnations of the Lord appear from time to time. But at the beginning of the creation or even before the creation takes place, the Lord, first of all, he incarnates as Maha Vishnu.

**Summary:** This segment elaborates on Maha Vishnu entering the material region, lying down on the causal ocean, and entering Yoga Nidra, which is described as a mystic slumber that initiates the material creation.

That is the first incarnation of the Lord before the creation of this entire material cosmic manifestation. So this Maha Vishnu, he appears in the portion of the spiritual sky which is covered by the material energy. Material energy. The material energy is like a cloud in the brilliantly effulgent spiritual sky. And in that cloud-like region, the Lord enters. Vishnu means one who enters. He enters into that material region covered by the material energy. And he lies down on the causal ocean. And he lies down on the causal ocean. And he lies down on the causal ocean. So right in that causal ocean lies water. ...The causal ocean. And he lies down and he goes to sleep. And his sleeping is not like ours. When we sleep we go into forgetfulness of our wakeful state. But the Lord, he is never forgetful. So his sleeping is caused by our sleep. sleeping is called yoga nidra. Nidra means sleeping. So, Srila Prabhupada describes that yoga nidra as mystic slumber. Slumber means sleeping. So, it's mystical how he goes to sleep. It is his pastime. It's his leela.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "And he dreams and in that dreaming state there is the creation of the material world. It is a product of the mahat tattva."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the material world is created from the Lord's dreaming state, which activates the dormant material energy (Mahat Tattva) and initiates the differentiation into various elements.

So, this material world is created when the Lord lies down on the causal ocean and goes to sleep. And the Lord dreams about the material creation. Now, this dreaming of the Lord is not like our dreaming. It is entirely different. That in the dreaming condition also there is the creation, maintenance and destruction of the material universes. So, the creation begins when the Lord enters this material energy region like a cloud in the spiritual sky. And he lies down on the causal ocean. And he dreams. He goes to sleep. Mystic slumber. Yoga nidra. And he dreams and in that dreaming state there is the creation of the material world. It is a product of the mahat tattva. Mahat tattva is the material energy in a dormant condition when it is activated by the glass. The dance of Maha Vishnu. Then that inactive state of material energy transforms into activated condition. And in that activated condition the creation begins. By the mahat tattva differentiating into the different elements.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Still the whole creation appears to be a factual presentation."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how the Lord combines the elements and even though the material world is produced in the Lord's dreaming condition, it is still a factual presentation, highlighting the Lord's complete control and consciousness.

And later on the elements are combined by the Supreme Lord in his form as... Garbodhaka Shai Vishnu or Vishwatma in his Hiranyagarbha incarnation or expansion. Even though this material world is produced in the state of the Lord's dreaming condition. Still the whole creation appears to be a factual presentation. It is a factual presentation of the Lord. That means the Lord's dreaming conditions are also factual manifestations. Hmm. He... There is no difference... Ah... Between his dreaming condition and his wakeful condition. There is no difference. In our case it is entirely different. When we are in the wakeful state we are forgetful of our dreaming state. And when we are in the dreaming condition we are forgetful about our wakeful state. So that is our position. Whereas the Lord... For him he is ever cognizant. Always conscious. Always aware of everything. In every nook and corner of the entire creation. Spiritual world and material world. Because his consciousness is spread everywhere. So he is fully conscious. So therefore the creation of this world is also a factual manifestation of the Lord's dreaming condition. He can therefore bring everything under his transcendental control. You see, his complete control always exists. In the spiritual world, in the material world, in all conditions, in all states of existence.

#### Lord's Fullness, Mercy to Demons, Salvation

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Thus whenever and wherever he does appear he does so in his fullness."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the Lord always appears in his fullness, never lacking in power or knowledge, and extends his mercy even to demons by granting them salvation when they are killed by him.

He is complete controller of everything and everyone. Thus whenever and wherever he does appear he does so in his fullness. He is not bereft of any of his powers when he appears even as Vishnu lying down on the causal ocean and going to sleep. He is not bereft of any of his power. He is not forgetful. He does not go into ignorance. He is always completely full with perfect knowledge. So he appears in this world or anywhere in any form of incarnation, personal incarnation, in his fullness. He is always with his knowledge, with his beauty, with his energies, with his paraphernalia, with his associates. He is always full. He is never partial. He is never incomplete. So therefore Srila Prabhupada says further, "The Lord being all that is described above maintains the affairs of the creation. He creates, he maintains. And by his so doing he gives salvation even to his enemies who are killed by him." We say the Lord is all merciful. So he is merciful even to the demons who are against the Lord. Because they are also his part and parcel. They are also his children. Though they are disobedient or they are misled or they are desirous of independent enjoyment or they have got enviousness, whatever be their condition, they are ultimately part and parcel of the Supreme Lord only as much as anyone else is. So Krishna never neglects them. So he, when they create some disturbance for the devotees, then Krishna comes to stop that disturbance and Krishna kills the demons. But his killing is good for the demons because the demons get salvation or mukti or moksha, liberation from material bondage. So it's a favor of the Lord upon the demons when the demons are killed by the Lord personally.

**Key Quote:** "Thus, the Supreme Lord is worshipable even by Brahma and Shiva, the greatest of all demigods."
**Summary:** This segment explains that even liberated souls are attracted to Krishna, proving his transcendental nature, and that he is worshiped by the greatest demigods like Brahma and Shiva.

And further, he, the Supreme Lord, is attractive even to the topmost liberated soul. That liberated souls are also attracted to Krishna. They don't have any attraction for anything material. Those are liberated. It's only the conditioned souls who are running after matter and material products. The liberated soul is not interested in any matter or material objects. Even they are attracted by Krishna. When they have no attraction for anything material, still they are attracted to Krishna, which means that Krishna is not at all material personality. He is completely transcendental. Only then can he be attractive to the transcendentalists. Thus, the Supreme Lord is worshipable even by Brahma and Shiva, the greatest of all demigods. That is the position. Shiva virenchi nutam. Bhagavatam's eleventh canto describes this. He is worshiped even by the greatest demigods, Shiva and Brahma. Virenchi means Brahma.

**Key Quote:** "Nobody can actually estimate or count the qualities of the lord, nor can anybody estimate in what quantity he has got those qualities."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by discussing the Lord's creative energy, the countless incarnations, and the plenary expansions in the spiritual world, emphasizing that the Lord's qualities are unfathomable and cannot be estimated.

Now, regarding his creative energy. Even in his incarnation of Purushavatara, he is the lord of the creative energy. This creative energy is working under his direction. And to control the material energy, he is the root cause of innumerable incarnations in all the universes. How many incarnations are there? Countless. We cannot count. To give an example, just the incarnation of Manu. There are five hundred thousand incarnations of Manu in the lifetime of Brahma in one universe. Like this, there are millions of universes. So who can count how many incarnations of the lord appear in the material world? Nobody can count. And as far as the spiritual world is concerned, beyond this material creation, there is no incarnation, but there are plenary expansions of the lord, and they are perfectly carrying out their activities in the spiritual world. So, nobody can actually estimate or count the qualities of the lord, nor can anybody estimate in what quantity he has got those qualities. All of them are unfathomable, inconceivable, cannot be estimated by anyone. So that is the unique position of the supreme lord. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verses from Srimad Bhagavatam and their meaning, focusing on the king's duty to protect all living beings and punish those who cause terror.

In this session we will be discussing two verses, the 10th and the 11th verses, of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Both these verses are given together by Srila Prabhupada, so I shall read both of them, the 10th verse and the 11th verse. Yasya Rashtre Prajasarvaha Trasyante Sadhya Asadubihi Tasya Mattasya Nashyanti Keertir Ayur Bhagogatihi Esha Ragnam Parodharmo Hyartanam Aarti Nigraha Ataenam Vadishyami Bhutadruham Asaptamam The meaning of these two verses is as follows: O chaste one, the king's good name, duration of life and good rebirth vanish when all kinds of living beings are terrified by miscreants in his kingdom. It is certainly the prime duty of the king to subdue first the sufferings of those who suffer. Therefore, I must kill this most wretched man because he is violent against other living beings. So Srila Prabhupada writes elaborate purport for these two verses.

**Key Quote:** "Similarly, it is the duty of the government to kill at once all bad social elements such as thieves, decoits and murderers."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing the king's responsibility to protect all citizens, including animals, and to punish those who disturb the peace.

Purport is as follows: When all kinds of living beings are terrified by miscreants in his kingdom, when there is some disturbance caused by wild animals in a village or town, the police or others take action to kill them. Similarly, it is the duty of the government to kill at once all bad social elements such as thieves, decoits and murderers. The same punishment is also due to animal killers because the animals of the state are also called praja. The word praja that is used, citizen. In English we say citizen, praja. Praja means one who has taken birth in the state. Ja means to take birth. So this praja includes both men and animals, especially the cows and bulls. They are reared by human beings, especially for Brahmanical culture. Any living being who takes birth in the state has the primary right to live under the protection of the king. Any living being who takes birth in the state, be it an animal or a human being. The jungle animals are also subject to the king and they also have a right to live. What to speak of, as Prabhupada says, what to speak of the domestic animals like the cows and bulls, even the jungle animals, they cannot be indiscriminately killed by anyone. So, especially the cows and bulls must be protected by the king. Also, as Prabhupada further explains, any living being, if he terrifies other living beings, is a most wretched subject and the king should at once kill such a disturbing element. To maintain peace, to maintain law and order, the king should impose very strict punishment in order to protect the innocent. As the wild animal is killed when it creates disturbances, similarly, any man who unnecessarily kills or terrifies the jungle animals or other animals must be punished at once.

**Key Quote:** "By the law of the Supreme Lord, all living beings in whatever shape they may be are the sons of the Lord, and no one has any right to kill another animal unless it is so ordered by the codes of natural law."
**Summary:** The lecture discusses the concept of divine law regarding the killing of animals, explaining that while some animals may kill for subsistence, humans have the option to subsist on grains, fruits, and milk.

By the law of the Supreme Lord, all living beings in whatever shape they may be are the sons of the Lord, and no one has any right to kill another animal unless it is so ordered by the codes of natural law. What is wrong in killing an animal by a human being? Prabhupada points out that the tiger can kill a lower animal for his subsistence because that is the food for the tiger ordained by the higher laws. But a man cannot kill an animal for his subsistence. That is the law of God who has created the law that a living being subsists by eating another living being. Jeevo Jeevasya Jeevanam This is explained in the earlier chapter, 13th chapter of the first canto of Bhagavatam, that we cannot eat some matter, dead matter, we cannot eat. We have to eat something for our subsistence, something which is like a living being. Thus the vegetarians are also living by eating other living beings. Therefore the law is that one should live only by eating specific living beings as ordained by the law of God.

**Key Quote:** "The Isopanishad directs that one should live by direction of the Lord and not at one's sweet will."
**Summary:** The speaker references the Isopanishad and reinforces the idea that humans should live according to God's directions, arguing against the justification of eating meat based on personal preference and highlighting the karmic consequences for leaders who allow animal slaughter.

And that is explained in the Isopanishad as follows. The Isopanishad directs that one should live by direction of the Lord and not at one's sweet will. People say, my preference to eat meat. You may prefer to eat vegetables, but my preference to eat meat. This is the argument that is given by some people who are non-vegetarians. But Prabhupada says, a man can subsist on varieties of grains, fruits and milk ordained by God. There is no need of animal food for a human being, save and except in particular cases. Let's say there is no availability of food grains or fruits or vegetables or milk. Then under those extreme circumstances one may eat some animal flesh. Otherwise there is no reason to eat animal flesh. The illusion king or executive head, even though sometimes advertised as a great philosopher and learned scholar, will allow slaughterhouses in the state without knowing that torturing poor animals clears the way to hell to such foolish kings or executive heads.

**Key Quote:** "The executive head must always be alert to the safety of the prajas, both man and animal, and inquire whether a particular living being is harassed at any place by another living being."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of executive heads protecting all citizens, including animals, and following scriptural codes for governance, highlighting the negative consequences for those who act irresponsibly.

See, above the laws enforced by a government or a king, there are laws of God operating in this material world. So, their future is very, very dark, those who are animal killers. The executive head must always be alert to the safety of the prajas, both man and animal, and inquire whether a particular living being is harassed at any place by another living being. The harassing living being must be at once caught and put to death as shown by Maharaj Parichar. The king's duty is to give protection and punish the culprits without showing any sentimental compassion or mercy. No. So Srila Prabhupada says, the people's government or government by the people should not allow killing of innocent animals by the sweet will of foolish government men. These government people don't care if animals are killed indiscriminately. And actually, the government should not allow that. If they want proper law and order, if they want peace in the society, they must know the codes of God as mentioned in the revealed scriptures, Dharma Shastra, Manusmriti, Parashara Smriti, Agnya Varkya Smriti. They should know that. Perfect. Correct directions are given in the revealed scriptures for governance, how to rule the kingdom or the state. Maharaj Parikshit quotes here that according to the codes of God, the irresponsible king or state executive jeopardizes his good name, duration of life, power and strength and ultimately his progressive march towards a better life and salvation after death.

**Key Quote:** "This understanding that every living being is spirit-soul, not the body."
**Summary:** The lecture discusses the importance of understanding that every living being is a spirit-soul and how ignorance of this fact and the laws of karma leads to suffering, emphasizing that nature is controlled by God and punishes sinful actions.

See, this is very important. This understanding that every living being is spirit-soul, not the body. And the soul actually is meant for making progress. The actual living being inside the body, the living entity as we say, the particular person inside the body is meant for progressing towards a better life. And that is the opportunity in this material world. Such foolish men do not even believe in the existence of the next life. They don't even know there is a next life. They are so ignorant. Or if they are informed, they think, oh, we don't believe in that. Now this belief system under the situation where they are ignorant people, certain laws that are working, they do not know. Just like foolish people, they do not know their suffering is caused by their own previous sinful activities. That they do not know. Many foolish people are there, ignorant people are there. And all kinds of non-believers, as we say, atheists, agnostics, upstarts, ignorant people, they suffer, but they do not know why they are suffering, especially when they are afflicted by some disease, or they are afflicted by some pain, some natural calamity. They do not know why they were subject to some disaster, natural disaster. They do not know. But, it is not that sometimes there is some natural calamity and we have to simply face it. No. It is not like that. It is completely controlled. Nature is controlled by God. And nature, under God's direction, gives punishment to people who are sinful, and they suffer in proportion to their past sinful activities, violation of the codes of God.

**Key Quote:** "After all, even the so-called great man in this material world is a conditioned soul."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the pious governance of Maharaj Parikshit with the ignorance of modern politicians who disregard scriptural authority and act based on personal sentiments, leading to suffering and a lack of peace and prosperity.

Srila Prabhupada says, politicians, they are ignorant and one such politician has written, I do not believe in any such ceremonies and to submit to them even as a matter of form would be hypocrisy in an attempt to delude ourselves and others. I have no religious sentiment in the matter. Some politician has said that he doesn't believe in life after death. He doesn't believe in the codes of God as given in the authentic scriptures. Such people are totally ignorant unlike Maharaj Pariksit. So, Maharaj Pariksit was pious according to scriptural codes. He was having a solid basis for governance. Whereas, the modern politician goes by his personal belief and sentiments. He just conducts himself and he enforces law based on his personal sentiments, which is very, very dangerous. Because, I may differ from another person. Some other person may differ from somebody else. Is that the way to actually conduct the government? It is totally irrational. It's meaningless. So, Prabhupada says, after all, even the so-called great man in this material world is a conditioned soul. He is bound by his hands and feet by the ropes of material nature, and still he thinks that he can act whimsically. So the conclusion is, during Pariksit Maharaj's time, people were happy, animals were given proper protection, and there was peace and prosperity in the kingdom.

And it was experienced by everyone. And modern day situation is so bad. People are suffering in so many ways, so many ways, except those who are truly God conscious. All others have to suffer in so many ways. So, the conclusion is that we should be God conscious, and we should follow the God given directions, and then, individually and collectively, we can be happy, peaceful, we can live a peaceful life, and we can expect prosperity. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of Patanjali Rishi and his Yoga Sutra, explaining the Ashtanga Yoga system and its focus on meditation on an imagined form for self-realization.

In this session, we continue to discuss from the 19th verse of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is part 4 of the discussion. In the previous three parts, three sessions, we discussed Karma Mimamsa philosophy of Jaimini, and then the atheistic Sankhya philosophy of the atheist Kapila. In part 2 and part 3, we discussed the Kanada Rishi's atomic philosophy. Now we are going to discuss the 4th philosopher, Patanjali Rishi. You have heard his name. He is one who teaches the Yoga Sutra, Ashtanga Yoga system. So, Srila Prabhupada explains, philosophers following the precepts of Patanjali Rishi practice Raja Yoga, Hatha Yoga, Raja Yoga, Ashtanga Yoga. They imagine a form of the absolute truth within many forms; that is their process of self-realization. They imagine some form inside, and they simply want to concentrate completely on that form, and when they are able to absorb their mind completely in meditation on that imagined form, they think they have reached the perfection of self-realization.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Patanjali's philosophy with Vedanta, emphasizing that the ultimate goal of knowledge is to know Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the source of Vedic knowledge.

But it is explained in the Vedanta philosophy by Vyasa Deva, who is actually giving the understanding as coming in Parampara from the Supreme Lord, who is explaining the perfect understanding of the Vedas of the Upanishads. He is presenting the truth, the absolute truth, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna as the ultimate goal of all processes of knowledge. Krishna says this in the Bhagavad Gita, "From all the Vedas, it is the ultimate goal of all the Vedas is to know Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead." And Krishna only is giving the Vedic knowledge in the beginning of creation, and Krishna only is the ultimate controller of all controllers, the supreme master of all of all the living beings, the topmost well-wisher. Everything is explained clearly in the Bhagavad Gita, but still there are some different philosophers who put forward their own theories.

**Key Quote:** "patanjali rishi he is talking about a process of uh meditation so first yama niyama asana pranayama pratyahara dharana dhyana samadhi"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the eight steps of Ashtanga Yoga according to Patanjali, including Yama, Niyama, and the process of meditation, highlighting the restrictions and the need for sense control.

So let us try to understand the defect in their philosophies. Patanjali Rishi, he is talking about a process of meditation. So first, yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, samadhi. There are eight steps, and these eight steps, beginning with yama and niyama, for actually being able to come to the truth of the truth of the truth to the stage of being able to meditate on that imagined form within the heart or within the mind, the Ashtanga Yoga process or the Patanjali's Raja Yoga process says some yama niyama, don'ts and do's. Don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, and do this, do this, do this, do this. So so many restrictions are there. So Krishna also explains in the Bhagavad Gita, sixth chapter, that one has to actually control the mind, and for control of mind, one has to abstain from all types of sense gratification, external gross sense gratification, withdraw the mind from sense objects. So that is this kind of sixth chapter briefly, that is the sixth chapter briefly by Krishna. But Patanjali Rishi has written a very great detailed explanation for all this process, this process of Raja Yoga or Hatha Yoga that one goes to a secluded place. Krishna is also briefly described in 6th chapter, 11th verse, 12th verse, 13th verse, etc. So ultimately, for being able to sit down for meditation, and it takes a long time to meditate and come to the stage of Samadhi, total absorption in the object of meditation. So it's as far as

process and the steps are concerned, that's all right, but they do not know exactly what is that ultimate reality from whom everything is emanating, who is the ultimate goal of all processes of knowledge, whose ultimate reality eternally existing, that they have no idea. They imagine something as the ultimate reality, either something impersonal, Niraka or Nirvishesha, or Shunyavadi. Shunyavada is void, everything is ultimately zero. They say that this material world things are going on, but ultimately everything will be destroyed, and after destruction what remains, they say nothing. These void philosophers, they say only Shunya, nothing is there. So from that Shunya again there will be creation.

**Summary:** The speaker refutes the idea that the world is an illusion, explaining that it is the interaction of the Lord's energy, guided by His will.

And this creation itself, from Shunya, how can there be something coming out? Because shunya is nothing. So they say that is just imaginary, something is existing, is created. So they say this world is unreal, it's illusion, grand illusion, it doesn't exist. We just imagine that it exists, it really exists. It is something that is coming to exist. They say that there is nothing called behaving and that Shunya which comes. Only it is not then it is Form Life Which is created just consequently it is in this 50 Yong that it exists, we imagine it exists, and actually the changes that are taking place are simply the interactions of the illusory energy, which is a partial truth about what is actually happening, the interaction of the modes. But what they fail to understand is that behind this presentation of the material energy or the illusory energy is the Supreme Lord, and it is his energy which is working according to his direction, maya gyakushena prakriti hi suyatesa chara.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the composition of material nature according to the Bhagavad Gita, including the eight elements and the three modes of material nature.

Charam. Then in the 14th chapter, Krishna describes Satwam rajasthama iti guna prakriti sambhava nibadhyanti mahabhaho dehe dehinam abhyayam. Material nature consists of eight elements: Bhumirapo nalowayu khammano budhirevaca ahankara itiyamme bhinna prakritir ashtadav me bhinna prakriti, they are my separated energy. This is the material energy, and that material energy is first of all manifest as the eight elements. Now, apart from these eight elements, when material nature is activated, there is the energy is manifest, material energy is manifest also as the three gunas, the three modes of material nature. Continuously those modes are working, interacting, and producing changes in the configuration of these eight elements.

**Key Quote:** "But Patanjali doesn't describe clearly this object of meditation as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna, as Vishnu, who is the eternal, transcendental person, that he does not describe."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Patanjali's system with the Vedic understanding of meditating on Vishnu as Paramatma within the heart, emphasizing that Patanjali's system lacks a clear understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

This is the perfect explanation given in the Bhagavad Gita and the Vedanta philosophy. Perfect explanation. But these people study some portion, take some observation, and come to some conclusion of their own according to their own theoretical philosophy that they present. So, Patanjali's, this Raja Yoga system, imaginary form for meditating within the heart. This is, they don't know that actually the Bhagavatam and the authentic Vedic literature describe meditation on Vishnu who is seated on the heart as Paramatma, who is actually an expansion of Kshirodakshayi Vishnu, the maintainer Vishnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Eternal Lord who has a transcendental form. And Lord Kapila, the Incarnate One, the incarnation of the Supreme Lord, describes in the third canto of the Bhagavatam in the Sankhya philosophy meditation on Vishnu within the heart who is Paramatma, Paramatma. He is seated in everyone's heart. Sarvas cha chaham hrithi sannivishto matta smritir jnanam apom nam cha. Bhagavad Gita also it is explained by Krishna. Krishna only, Krishna only means Krishna's expansion of expansion of expansion. He is seated in everyone's heart. But Patanjali doesn't describe clearly this object of meditation as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna, as Vishnu, who is the eternal, transcendental person, that he does not describe.

**Summary:** The speaker connects Patanjali's concept of an imaginary form with the Mayavadi philosophy, which considers the material world to be an illusion, and clarifies that reality lies behind the constant changes.

Imaginary form, something imaginary. So, this imaginary form is also taught by the Mayavadi philosophers. Mayavadi philosophers, they also talk of imaginary form. So, this imaginary form is based on the wrong understanding that this material world itself is illusion, is false. The material world has got an illusory aspect that everything is a presentation of the interactions of the three gunas as reality, but it is not reality. Because it is constantly changing, it is not reality. Reality is what remains or what is behind the change. That is the material energy itself which is working as per the direction of the Supreme Lord Krishna according to his will. So, that is reality. That reality is missed out by all these Mayavadis and the philosophers who follow Patanjali's yoga sutra etc.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the difficulty of attaining truth without the guidance of a self-realized spiritual master in parampara, highlighting the limitations of speculation and logic.

They miss out this reality. So, it is not easy to arrive at the truth. While we are in the grip of illusion, while we have this material body, while we are in ignorance, unless we take help of a self-realized bona fide spiritual master coming in parampara who is himself situated in transcendence and who can properly explain everything and enlighten us beyond matter, know our self as spiritual reality, as spirit soul, and Supreme Lord as a Supreme Spirit and the totality, some total understanding of everything in existence, at least the material existence itself as a part of the manifestation of the Lord's energies. So, all this requires superior guidance. Without that guidance, nobody can speculate or analyze or reason, logic, argument will not work. They have got their limitations. I will stop here.

Punishment we can understand because Kali Purusha was the root cause of all kinds of irreligiosities. But why would Kali Purusha be rewarded by Parikshit Maharaj? That we are going to see in the later verses of this chapter. So the 25th verse.

**Summary:** The lecture details the decline of Dharma through the Yugas, from four legs in Satya Yuga to one in Kali Yuga, emphasizing that true Dharma comes from God and the Parampara system.

Earlier it was described Dharma, which in Satya Yuga was standing on four legs, four pillars: austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness. So in Satya Yuga, four pillars of religion perfectly intact, and then by the time Satya Yuga progressed and came to Treta Yuga, one leg was destroyed, tapasya, austerity.

Now, beginning of Kali Yuga, only that fourth leg, only one leg, the fourth leg, that is truthfulness, is remaining, and somehow still some Dharma is there at the beginning Kali Yuga, but this Kali Purusha, quarrel personified, flourishing by deceit, by unwritten, by lying propensity, lying propaganda, is trying to destroy that leg, that leg of truthfulness of Dharma. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, the principles of religion do not stand on some dogmas or man-made formulas, but they stand on four primary regulative observances, namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness. Earlier we had discussed religion, Dharma means the codes given by God, nobody can manufacture Dharma, real Dharma, it is what is given by God in the beginning of creation and coming down in human society as a result of that, it is not possible to do that, it is impossible to get that.

So there are no man-made religion switchers, real religions, man my religion means that is a cheating religion or somebody is very strong belief in some system of not real religion. So real religion means there are four primary regulative observances, what are they? Austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness. The mass of people, Srila Prabhupada says, must be taught to practice these principles from childhood. Austerity means what are the meaning of these four principles in reality? Austerity means to accept voluntarily things which may be not very comfortable for the body but are conducive for spiritual realization.

**Key Quote:** "Austerity means to accept voluntarily things which may be not very comfortable for the body but are conducive for spiritual realization"
**Summary:** The lecture explains austerity as voluntarily accepting inconvenience for spiritual realization, using fasting as an example and distinguishing it from fasting for other purposes, which is condemned in the Bhagavad Gita.

body for a higher purpose, that is spiritual realization, and an example is given, fasting. Fasting twice or four times a day is not good for the body, it is not good for the body, it is not good for the mind, but at least a month is a sort of austerity which may be voluntarily accepted for spiritual realization only and not for any other purposes, political or otherwise. We know one great freedom fighter in this country used to go on fast to put pressure on the government to yield to some of their demands, that is not good for the body. The real austerity that one should take up fasting is done austerity means only for the sake of spiritual realization. Fasting which are meant for not for self-realization but for some other purposes are condemned in the Bhagavad-Gita in the 17th chapter, fifth and sixth verses. Fasting in the mode of passion, fasting in the mode of ignorance, that is condemned in the Bhagavad-Gita, it is not going to result in any spiritual benefit and materially even if it is in some way beneficial ultimately is the cause of material entanglement. Already we are entangled so we should not do something by which you get more entangled.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of both bodily and mental cleanliness, stating that mental cleanliness is achieved through glorifying the Supreme Lord.

that is not very wise, that's not very intelligent. Similarly, cleanliness is necessary both for the mind and the body. Simply bodily cleanliness may help to some extent, people know about bodily cleanliness, external cleanliness, but more important is cleansing the mind. Bodily cleanses is good but it's not enough, it's not sufficient. Cleanliness of the mind is absolutely essential for a human being and how is it possible to clean the mind? It is affected by glorifying the Supreme Lord, by glorifying the Supreme Lord. No one can cleanse the accumulated mental without glorifying the Supreme Lord. Chanting Hare Krishna primarily cleanses our mind primary. A godless civilization cannot cleanse the mind because it is no idea of God. Modern civilization is a godless civilization. People say, oh we are very nice people, we like to follow some principles without any reference to God or scriptures. They say why do you bring in God, just be good to everyone, don't harm anyone, don't hurt anybody, be nice to everyone, this is not going to work.

**Summary:** The lecture criticizes a godless civilization and uses the example of cow slaughter to illustrate the lack of mercy and the consequences of ignoring God's laws.

for some people cutting the throat of a cow it doesn't matter as long as you're nice to all other fellow human beings because they believe cows don't have soul. Now just because some ignorant person is believing cows don't have soul because of that it doesn't matter if you are nice to all other fellow human beings that somebody can kill that poor animal and it suffered so much like the human being suffer. If I cut your throat how will you feel? Same way the cow also feels and the cow is the most useful animal in the human society, the most useful animal. Even the cow dung and cow urine are useful for human beings and such an animal they go and kill just because it stops giving milk or just because they like to eat cow flesh. So this is very very very very simple and it is punishable very severely by the laws of God, now nobody can escape that.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the lack of peace of mind in Kali Yuga due to the decline of austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness, contrasting it with the peace of Sathya Yuga.

So Srila Prabhupada is telling here, a godless civilization cannot have no life cleansing of the mind because they no idea of God and people whose mind is not clean cannot have any good qualifications however much materially they may be equipped. In this age of Kali people are mostly dissatisfied. So everyone is anxious for peace of mind but how can they get this peace of mind without cleansing the mind? So Srila Prabhupada says this peace of mind was complete in the Sathya Yuga, Sathya age because of the existence of the above mentioned attributes of the human beings. Everyone was austere, everyone was clean internally and externally, everyone was having mercy and everyone was truthful. So in Sathya Yuga total peace of mind complete. Gradually these attributes have diminished in Trita Yuga to three-fourths, in Dwapar Yuga to half and in Kali Yuga to one-fourth which is also gradually diminishing on.

**Summary:** The lecture uses the analogy of airline tickets and online fraud to illustrate the increasing untruthfulness in Kali Yuga and its impact on Dharma.

there in the beginning of Kali Yuga just like in Kali Yuga I'll give a simple example just before the advent of this truth and the look at the technique which I have shown you already in the Meenakshi some truthfulness left you take that piece of paper and go to the airline company in the airport and then they say yes please welcome you are most welcome to board the flight and they treat you very nicely. But now with this untruthfulness increasing what is happening? They have so many fraud people issuing tickets and unless you go through a proper website there are so many fake websites and they have what is called as phishing software where they will siphon off your money from your bank account or they will issue your a form false ticket when you pay money and that ticket the airline won't have issued at all and when you go with that false ticket they will say there is no such booking in our website no such booking see. So untruthfulness, untruthfulness, so much of untruthfulness. So because of that that last leg truthfulness of Dharma is diminishing.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how pride spoils austerity, affection spoils cleanliness, intoxication spoils mercy, and lying propaganda spoils truthfulness.

Then Srila Prabhupada explains as was told in a previous purport in a previous verse by pride either artificial or real the resultant action of austerity is spoiled. Tapasya is not meant for showing off to others that I am a very austere person I am very very devoted to fasting it's not meant for showing off to others they becoming proud it is meant for spiritual advancement. By too much affection for female association cleanliness is point the mind becomes unclean by too much of sex indulgence by too much of sense enjoyment the mind becomes polluted there'll never be peace always anxiety. Then too much addiction to intoxication mercy spoilt people become indifferent to other suffering and they become intoxicated either they get intoxicated by liquor or they get intoxicated by drinking too much of tea or drinking or smoking cigarette different or taking some drugs they become totally heartless that mercy is lost in human society and by too much lying propaganda truthfulness is point.

**Summary:** The lecture concludes by emphasizing the prevalence of lying propaganda and the importance of reviving Bhagavata Dharma to save civilization by following the four principles for spiritual realization.

there is so much of lying propaganda now being being promoted there's like sometimes even I don't say all some rare case of course parents teach their children tell lies example when there's traveling with the child in a railway train they don't buy a ticket for the child even though they're supposed to buy a ticket and they teach the child to tell lies when questioned about which standard are you studying in the ticket checking authority ask the child which standard are you studying it may be studying in and let's say eight standard but will be told you tell you're studying in fourth standard. So like this lying propaganda is increasing now it's increasing in different places different purposes and truthfulness is point. So the revival of bhagavata dharma can save civilization from falling prey to evils of all description. Bhagavata dharma means to follow these principles for principles for spiritual realization. I'll stop here.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verses to be discussed and explains the meaning of verse 26, focusing on how Krishna's presence diminished the burden of the earth and brought auspiciousness.

In this session we will be discussing from verses 26, 27 and 28 of the 17th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 26th verse: The meaning of this 26th verse is, "The burden of the earth was certainly diminished by the personality of Godhead and by others as well. When he was present, as an incarnation, all good was performed because of his auspicious footprints." These are words spoken by Parikshit Maharaj in response to Dharma's reply. Parikshit asked Dharma, "Who or what is the cause of your suffering?" And Dharma did not give a direct reply. He gave a very philosophical reply. So then Parikshit immediately replied, and he recognized this bull is no ordinary bull. It is the personality of religious principles. And he also understood the cow was mother earth in the shape of a cow. So now he's talking about how the burden of the earth, which was due to so many demoniac persons posing as kings at the time of Krishna's advent, just before Krishna's advent, that was definitely reduced by Krishna appearing and killing so many demons. When Krishna was present as an incarnation all good was performed because of his auspicious footprints, merely Krishna setting foot on the surface of the earth, by that there was all auspiciousness for everyone in the entire world.

**Key Quote:** "Unfortunately in the age of Kali the lower class men without training occupied a post of a ruler by strength of popular votes is called the democratic system."
**Summary:** The speaker explains verse 27, describing how Mother Earth laments the future rule by unqualified leaders in Kali Yuga, drawing a parallel to contemporary democratic systems and their shortcomings.

Then in the 27th verse it is said here, the meaning of this 27th verse is, "Now she, that is mother earth, the chaste one, being unfortunately forsaken by the personality of Godhead, laments her future with tears in her eyes, for now she is being ruled and enjoyed by lower class men who pose as rulers." Krishna came and the demons posing as rulers were completely destroyed and Krishna installed the most righteous Yudhishtira Maharaj as the emperor of the world. The Pandavas were ruling, but Kali Purusha is entering, Kali Yuga is beginning, and in Kali Yuga the earth will be ruled by lower class men who pose as Kshatriyas but don't have Kshatriya qualities, and because the people and the animals, innocent people and innocent animals, will be exploited by these rulers, mother earth is having tears in her eyes, she's lamenting. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "The Kshatriya who is qualified to protect the sufferers is meant to rule the state. Untrained lower-class men or men without ambition to protect the sufferers cannot be placed on the seat of an administrator. Unqualified person should not be sitting on the seat of the administrator." Unfortunately in the age of Kali, the lower class men without training occupied a post of a ruler by strength of popular votes is called the democratic system. Votes, who gets a maximum votes, majority works properly as it said in Latin, by majority vote a person comes to power and instead of protecting the sufferers these untrained people, unqualified people create a situation quite intolerable for everyone. Such rulers illegally gratify themselves at the cost of all comforts with citizens. They collect taxes, don't use it for the citizens welfare, entirely they become themselves very rich, they misuse the tax collected in this way and they throw some crumbs for the people in the name of welfare activity, they don't do real welfare for the people and thus the chaste mother earth cries to see the pitiable condition of her sons, both men and animals, innocent men and women are not allowed to live in the country, unqualified untrained lower-class men are ruling in the name of countries and

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that irreligiosity does not mean abandoning religious principles, and that following religious principles leads to good qualities.

different countries, they divided the whole earth and then almost all the rulers are untruthful, they are unqualified, they don't have mercy on, they don't have any credit of austerity, they're not truthful. So such people if they are at the helm of affairs you can only imagine so much of problem, difficulty for the people and the innocent animals. That is the future of the world in the age of Kali when irreligiosity prevails most prominently. Now here irreligiosity should not be taken as a threat. I am saying that this does not mean that they should accept. Don't realize their right step is the right step. It is done not summary, one step by one step by step every benefit system of religion as ever means is the our life and that's selfish ours of someone doing something wrong. We have our food, we have money, we given that anybody who follows it properly they will become decorated with all good qualities automatically.

**Key Quote:** "Prabhupada says why are you not following the commandment of Bible you claim to be a Christian but you don't follow the commandment."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the hypocrisy of not following religious commandments, particularly regarding animal killing, citing examples from Christianity and Buddhism.

Simply following the, just like in Christianity Prabhupada points out, "Thou shall not kill" is the first commandment, if I am not wrong, at least one of the ten commandments. I know I think it is the first commandment that now they are interpreting, "Thou shall not murder," meaning that applies only to not killing humans, so animals they have, they think they have a license to kill even when they claim to be so called Christians. So Prabhupada says, "Why are you not following the commandment of Bible? You claim to be a Christian but you don't follow the commandment." This is true even in other religious systems also, it's not just in Christianity, even in Hinduism so much animal killing is going on in the name of sacrifice. So Lord Buddha came, Lord Buddha is incarnation of Vishnu to stop this animal killing in the name of sacrifice, but today Buddhists themselves they are not anymore following the Ahimsa principle taught by Buddha. They claim to be Buddhists but they eat meat, they are meat eaters. Formerly when Buddha invented and taught Ahimsa all those following Buddhism were pure vegetarians.

**Summary:** The speaker notes the decline in vegetarianism among various religious groups and suggests that teaching Srimad Bhagavatam is the solution to corruption and other problems.

Even now the a portion, a small section of the Buddhists they are pure vegetarians, even Christians you find, even Muslims you find pure vegetarians, those who strictly follow their religious tradition, the teachings of the saints or the Lord, but majority of the so called Christians or Muslims or Buddhists or Hindus even now they are not non-vegetarians, so this means they don't follow the commandments. So in the absence of a suitable king Prabhupada says, "Teaching the Srimad Bhagavatam will clear the hazy atmosphere of corruption, bribery, blackmail etc." The only solution is people have to be educated in Bhagavata Dharma.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains verse 28, emphasizing that while the age of Kali is full of sinful activities, leaders and devotees should not be passive in the face of it.

28th verse: iti dharmam maheem chaiva santvayitva maharatha nishatam adade khadgam kalaye adharma hetave. The meaning of this verse is, "Maharaj Pariksit who could fight one thousand enemies single handedly, maharatha, thus pacified the personality of religion and the earth, then he took up his sharp sword to kill the personality of Kali who is the cause of all irreligion." So Srila Prabhupada explains, "As described above the personality of Kali is he who deliberately commits all kinds of sinful acts which are forbidden in the revealed scriptures. There is no license to kill animals, there is no license to kill animals innocent animals no way, but they are doing that in the name deliberately committing sinful activities even though it is forbidden in the scriptures. This age of Kali will certainly be full of all activities of Kali but this does not mean that the leaders of society the executive heads the learned and intelligent men or above all the devotees of the Lord should sit down tightly and become callous to the reactions of the age of Kali."

**Key Quote:** "The administrators should not simply pass resolutions for anti-corruption steps but they must be ready with sharp swords to kill the persons creating corruption."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of taking precautions against rain to illustrate the need for executive action against the activities of Kali, advocating for strict measures against corruption and intoxication, concluding with a thank you.

Sometimes people say what can we do? We are following, we don't kill animals, we don't harm people, but we cannot do anything about others indulging in animal killing or others harming innocent people, we cannot do anything. So it's not that I cannot control somebody else therefore I don't do anything, that's not correct. So Prabhupada gives a nice example here, "In the rainy season certainly there will be profuse rainfalls but that does not mean that men should not take means to protect themselves from the rains." Very nice example, you cannot stop the rain but you can take precaution for protecting yourself against the rain. Similarly it is the duty of the executive heads of state and others to take all necessary actions against the activities of Kali or the persons influenced by the age of Kali and Maharaj Parikshit is the ideal executive head of state for at once he was ready to kill the personality of Kali with his sharp sword because Kali was harming an innocent cow and an innocent bull so he was ready to kill Kali Purusha. The administrators should not simply pass resolutions for anti-corruption steps but they must be ready with sharp swords to kill the persons creating corruption from the angle of vision of the recognized shastras. See this is the practical action to be taken. The administrators cannot prevent corrupt activities by allowing wine shops. I have an example Prabhupada is giving, they must at once close all shops of intoxicating drugs and wine and force punishment even by death for those who indulge in habits of intoxication of all description as long as people are indulging in intoxication they cannot have any good behavior, good principles, they cannot be truthful, it is not possible. So government has to stop, totally stop. So Maharaj Parikshit the Maharatha is exhibiting the proper method of curbing down Kali Purusha. So I will just say I will stop here thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of SB 1.17.29, focusing on Kali Purusha's surrender to Parikshit Maharaj out of fear.

In this session, we will be discussing two verses, the 29th and the 30th verses of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Shreemad Bhagavatam. The 29th verse: Tam Jighamsum Abhipretya Vihaya Drupalanchanam Tadpada Moolam Shirasa Samagatbhaya Vikvalaha. The meaning of this verse is, when the personality of Kali understood that the king was willing to kill him, he at once abandoned the dress and, under pressure of fear, completely surrendered to him, bowing his head. So, what is Kali Purusha's reaction to Parikshit Maharaj being ready to kill Kali Purusha because Kali Purusha was harming an innocent cow and a bull? So, Kali Purusha understood that he cannot face the king, the emperor Parikshit, and he at once gave up the dress of a king. He is actually not a king, he is dressed as a king for external show, and he completely surrendered to Parikshit Maharaj. That was the only way he could have saved his life, otherwise Parikshit would have killed him.

**Key Quote:** "A Kshatriya never surrenders. He accepts the challenge of a rival Kshatriya and he fights either to die or to win."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the qualities of a true Kshatriya, emphasizing courage, sacrifice, and the willingness to fight rather than surrender, contrasting this with the behavior of imposters.

So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, the personality of Kali is artificial. The royal dress is suitable for a king or a Kshatriya, but when a lower-class man artificially dresses himself as a king, his real identity is disclosed by the challenge of a bona fide Kshatriya like Maharaj Pariksit. So, they don't have the courage, they don't have the mentality to sacrifice their life for a higher cause. That is the meaning of a lower-class person. You see, no qualification, no training, no proper understanding of what is the duty of a ruler, simply wants to enjoy power, enjoy some money, enjoy some facilities, exploit people, you know, send people because they are a little weak, they cannot find their home, they can't retaliate, so exploit them. This is not a Kshatriya. So, when a real Kshatriya encounters such an imposter ruler, immediately the real Kshatriya will kill him if he does not give up his false position. A real Kshatriya never surrenders. This is the term, this is the real quality of a Kshatriya. A Kshatriya never surrenders. He accepts the challenge of a rival Kshatriya, and he fights either to die or to win. All such battles between Kshatriyas, real Kshatriyas, is decisive, just like in the battle of Kurukshetra. Duryodhana challenged the Pandavas, if you want your kingdom, you fight and take it. So, when the battle happened, then Pandavas completely destroyed all the Kauravas. 100 sons of Dhritarashtra were all killed, because that is the way of a Kshatriya.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the lack of true Kshatriyas in Kali Yuga and how this contributed to foreign rule in India, highlighting the importance of Kshatriya spirit and unity.

That is the Kshatriya spirit, because Duryodhana was challenging him. Surrender is unknown to a real Kshatriya. In the age of Kali, there are so many pretenders dressed in posts like administrators or executive heads, but the real identity is disclosed when they are challenged by a real Kshatriya. See, in the Kali Yuga, the difficulty is there are no real Kshatriyas. Even in our own country, India, as long as there were Rajputs, Marathas, the real Kshatriyas, different names in different parts of the country, in Rajasthan they were called Rajputs, in Maharashtra they were called Marathas. But when the real Kshatriya spirit was there, they could face the powerful Mughal army, powerful British rulers, they could fight the Kshatriyas. They could fight the Kshatriyas. They could fight the Kshatriyas. They could fight the ׵ they could face and defeat them. But when the number of such real Kshatriyas reduced against the might of the British army, English army, or even the Mughal army, against their might. Then, lack of unity, means a lack of unity. Even in pumping the muisicle, the Gilda's, the Gote, Thulük малень acidic agar rate came. And the reason it was so, was the lack real Kshatriyas that was the cause of the foreign rule in this country otherwise

Therefore, when the artificially dressed personality of Kali saw that to fight Maharaj Pariksit was beyond his ability, he bowed down his head like a subordinate and gave up his royal dress. Kali Purusha, because he wanted to save his life, he simply surrendered, and this surrender is the reason why Pariksit Maharaj pardoned this Kali Purusha and even rewarded him because he submitted to Pariksit Maharaj. You will hear that the 30th verse, the meaning of this 30th verse is, Maharaj Pariksit was qualified to accept surrender and worthy of being sung in history, did not kill the poor surrendered and fallen Kali, but smiled compassionately, for he was kind to the poor hearted Kali Purusha. Maharaj Pariksit showed compassion.

**Key Quote:** "Even an ordinary Kshatriya does not kill a surrendered person this is Kshatriya code of conduct and Kshatriya's behavior nature even anybody surrenders."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Bhishma's surrender to Krishna in the Mahabharata to illustrate the Kshatriya code of conduct of not killing a surrendered person.

because he is having that quality as a trained Kshatriya. As a trained Kshatriya, he's got that quality of compassion for the poor. In the purport, Shrila Prabhupada explains, even an ordinary Kshatriya does not kill a surrendered person. This is Kshatriya code of conduct and Kshatriya's behavior, nature. Even anybody surrenders, that's the just like Bhishma Deva in the example in Mahabharata, when Bhishma was attacking Arjuna and Arjuna's life was in danger, Krishna was Arjuna's father's chariot driver. Krishna wanted to protect Arjuna at all costs. So, when he saw Arjuna's life is in danger, Krishna broke his promise in order to protect Arjuna. What did Krishna do? Krishna himself took a wheel of a chariot and went to attack Bhishma. If Krishna goes to attack Bhishma, what is hope for Bhishma to survive? But Bhishma, being a devotee of Krishna, he simply surrendered to Krishna, my dear lord, what better way for me to quit this body than by dying at your hands? So, Bhishma was a devotee, so he knew being killed by Krishna is no ordinary killing, it is actually a transcendental act of the lord. One immediately becomes liberated and purified. So, Bhishma knew this, so he surrendered. The moment Bhishma surrendered, Krishna did not attack Bhishma.

**Key Quote:** "So, in this way, any Kshatriya who follows the code of Pana, Kshatriya means he is having the qualification. So, he will never kill a surrendered person."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the Kshatriya code of conduct and explains why Parikshit Maharaj spared Kali Purusha, highlighting the irony of Kali, the embodiment of irreligion, being spared.

who follows the code of Pana, Kshatriya means he is having the qualification. So, he will never kill a surrendered person. And then Prabhupada says, what to speak of Maharaj Pariksit who was by nature compassionate and kind to the poor. Maharaj Pariksit certainly would pardon and show compassion to a surrendered soul, even if that surrendered soul was somebody who was a miscreant. So, Pariksit Maharaj is smiling. Why was he smiling? Because the artificially dressed Kali had disclosed his identity as a lower class man. You see, when he gave up the dress, and Kali Purusha gave up the dress, he revealed to Maharaj Pariksit, yes, I am not a qualified Kshatriya, I am dressed like a Kshatriya, but I don't have the qualification. I don't have the courage to face another rival Kshatriya. I don't have the courage. I simply want to pose to exploit innocent people, to harm innocent people. But actually, I don't have the qualification, I don't have the courage. So, he admitted in front of Pariksit Maharaj. And Pariksit was thinking how ironic it is that although no one was saved from his sharp sword when he desired to kill, the poor lower class Kali was spared by his timely surrender. Kali Purusha surrendered just before Pariksit Maharaj was about to kill him. So, Kali Purusha was spared because that's a code of conduct for a Kshatriya. And it's ironical because Kali is meant for spreading irreligion. Kali is meant for spreading irreligion. Therefore, this entire Bhagavatam is important that Kali was spared by Maharaj.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the influence of Kali Yuga in spreading irreligion and emphasizes that Kali's salvation was due to the will of providence, the higher arrangement of the Supreme Lord.

And therefore, we are facing the influence of Kali Yuga is to spread irreligion, is to make people irreligious by its influence. Maharaj Pariksit's glory and kindness are therefore sung in history. He was an ideal Kshatriya, and he is always glorified as the kind and principled Kshatriya who ruled the world. He was a kind and compassionate emperor, fully worthy of accepting surrender even from his enemy. What to speak of others, even from the enemy, Parikshit Maharaj as an ideal Kshatriya will accept surrender, because he is fully qualified to accept his surrender. He will never exploit if somebody surrenders. Thus, the personality of Kali was saved by the will of providence. This is a term that is used many times in the scriptures, will of providence. Will of providence means it's the higher arrangement of the Supreme Lord who in the background is always there, always active in the material world, acting through the material nature, not directly, but ultimately the will of the Supreme Lord prevails.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the mentality of people in Kali Yuga who prioritize material happiness over religious principles, even denying the existence of hell, and how Krishna gives them a chance through material nature.

Because in the age of Kali, there are people who want to enjoy material happiness through unfair means, through following, breaking religious principles. At any cost they want to enjoy, even at the cost of breaking religious principles. And people openly say, I don't care for hell. You'll be punished. You'll have to go to hell if you commit grievous sinful activities. They say we don't care, or we don't believe there is something called hell. Just because somebody doesn't believe it, does it mean that they are not going to suffer? So, this is the situation in Kali Yuga. So, Krishna gives them a chance. In the material world, through the material nature, Krishna gives such people a chance.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of Srimad Bhagavatam 1.17.31, where King Parikshit pardons Kali Purusha upon surrender but prohibits him from residing in his kingdom due to his association with irreligion.

In this session, we will be discussing from two verses, 31st and 32nd verses of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavata. The 31st verse is as follows: Rajavacha, after the Kali Purusha surrendered to Parikshit Maharaj, when he is about to be killed, he surrendered. And what did Parikshit say? He definitely pardoned Kali Purusha, did not kill him. But what did he say? Na te gudakesha yaso dharanam baddhanjalervai bhayam astikinchit na vartitavyam bhavata katanchana kshetremadiyetvam adarmabandhuhu. This is Parikshit's reply to Kali Purusha, the action of Kali Purusha. The translation of this 31st verse: The king thus said, it's King Parikshit. We have inherited the fame of Arjuna. Therefore, since you have surrendered yourself with folded hands, you need not fear for your life. But you cannot remain in my kingdom, for you are the friend of irreligion. Adarmabandhu.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's explanation that while a surrendered soul may be spared, those who violate fundamental religious principles should not be allowed to reside in a welfare state and negatively influence others.

Hmm. So, Shri La Prabhupada explains, "The personality of Kali, who is the friend of all kinds of irreligiosities, may be excused if he surrenders. But in all circumstances, he cannot be allowed to live as a citizen in any part of a welfare state. Those who are violators of the fundamental principles of religion..." Fundamental principles of religion are not based on whether somebody is Hindu or Christian or Muslim. No. It is independent of that. To practice austerity, cleanliness, truthfulness, and mercy is there in all religious systems, bona fide religious systems. Hmm. So, they have to follow that. If they become irreligious by breaking these principles, then they will not be allowed to live as a proper citizen in the kingdom or in the welfare state, being ruled by a proper administrator. Hmm. So, the principle of excusing or rather sparing the life of a surrendered soul is there. Hmm. But he cannot be allowed to live and influence the innocent people in a wrong way.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna arranged for all these remaining demons to be killed to bring down the burden of the earth."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna orchestrated the battle of Kurukshetra to eliminate remaining demons and alleviate the burden on the earth, using the Pandavas as instruments.

The Pandavas were entrusted representatives of the personality of God and Lord Krishna, who practically brought into being the battle of Kurukshetra. It is Krishna who arranged the battle of Kurukshetra, because before the battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna was engaged in killing so many demons. But in spite of killing, Krishna killing so many demons, Krishna began killing right on the lap of his mother as a small ten day old infant. Poorthana came to kill Krishna, but Krishna delivered her. And after that so many demons came: Pakasura, Denukasura, Aghasura, Trinavarta, so many demons came, Shakatasura, so many demons. Krishna killed, killed, killed. Of course Krishna's killing is delivering them, liberating them, purifying them, but still Krishna had to deal with these demons. And Krishna went on killing, killing, killing. But the number of demons were so many, those who escaped, Krishna brought them all together on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. And through this battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna arranged for all these remaining demons to be killed, to bring down the burden of the earth. So he arranged. And Pandavas, even though Yudhishthira said, "I am not interested in ruling a kingdom and enjoying royal power." No. Even though it was his rightful claim, but he said, "If Duryodhana wants to rule, let him rule. I don't want to unnecessarily fight and I be the cause of so much killing happening in the battle." But Krishna wanted this battle. Why? To clear away the earth of the burden of these demons. So through the battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna arranged the remaining demons to be killed.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Krishna's desire for ideal rulers who follow the principles of Bhagavad Gita and protect citizens from material bondage by promoting God consciousness.

So Krishna did not have any personal interest, not that he wanted to rule or he wanted to enjoy, nothing. So Krishna, what did Krishna want? Through the battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna wanted an ideal king like Maharaj Yudhishthira and his descendants like Maharaj Pariksit to rule the world. Krishna wanted that. Krishna always wants that. It is explained in the Bhagavad Gita by Srila Prabhupada. Krishna first instructed the Bhagavad Gita to this sun god Vivaswan. Why? Because Krishna wants the rulers to rule over the citizens according to the principles of Bhagavad Gita. So the first duty of a ruler is to protect the citizens against material bondage to lust by preaching Krishna consciousness, God consciousness, making them God conscious, and thereby human life becomes successful for everyone. Everyone can live peacefully by following the religious principles, God conscious principles, and everyone is able to make spiritual progress to ultimately attain the perfection of human life simply by following the principles of Bhagavad Gita.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The friends of irreligiosity should be banished from the state, and that will save the state from corruption."
**Summary:** The speaker connects allowing irreligiosity to flourish with corruption in the state, using the analogy of smoking to illustrate how bad influences can victimize innocent people, emphasizing Krishna consciousness as the solution.

Because Pariksit, Yudhishthira, all of them are representatives of Krishna, they cannot allow the friend of irreligiosity to flourish in their kingdom at the cost of the good fame of the Pandavas. Pandavas are well known as ideal rulers, perfect followers of Dharma, pure devotees of Krishna, and they ruled perfectly. So their good fame cannot be spoiled by Pariksit allowing this Kali Purusha who surrendered to live in his kingdom and spread irreligion. So Prabhupada says that is the way of wiping out corruption in the state. The friends of irreligiosity should be banished from the state, and that will save the state from corruption, the bad influence. There are so many innocent people in this world. It's like Prabhupada says, "By birth, does somebody have a cigarette in his mouth by birth? Where did he get this habit of smoking?" By bad influence of other people who are smoking. It's only by bad influence. Similarly, the wrong influence actually victimizes innocent people to fall prey to bad habits, and once they become habituated to some, it is very difficult for them to give up later on, even if they want to, except by Krishna Consciousness, they cannot give up.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces and translates Srimad Bhagavatam 1.17.32, explaining that allowing Kali (irreligion) to thrive leads to the spread of negative qualities like greed and falsehood.

32nd verse: Tvam Vartamanam Naradeva Deheshu Anupravrttoyam Adharma Pugaha Lobho Anrutam Chauriyam Anaryam Jestha Chamaya Kalahascha Dambhaha. The meaning of this 32nd verse is, if the personality of Kali, irreligion, is allowed to act as a man god or an executive head, certainly irreligious principles like greed, falsehood, robbery, incivility, deceit... Okay, Kali Purusha surrendered, so his life was spared, but he cannot be allowed to live. Why? If he lives, all these bad qualities will spread among the people in the kingdom of Pariksit: greed, falsehood, robbery, treachery, misfortune, that I am great without actually having the real qualities.

**Key Quote:** "These four principles are the fundamental principles of God consciousness, no matter which religious system somebody may follow."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness are fundamental to all genuine religious systems and are essential for God consciousness.

Srila Prabhupada says, "The principles of religion, namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness, as we have already discussed, may be followed by the follower of any faith. As regard religious principles, nobody can say Hindus. No. There is no such thing as Bhagavatam is meant for Hindus. These four principles are the fundamental principles of God consciousness, no matter which religious system somebody may follow, which bona fide religious system they may follow. The same principles are given in all scriptures. So Prabhupada says, there is no need to turn from Hindu to Mohammedan to Christian or some other faith and thus become a renegade and not follow the principles of religion." Renegade means a separatist or a rebel. No need. So it is not that people in the name of, "I don't believe or don't accept some particular religious system." No. You cannot live in a civilized society and spread irreligion among the innocent people and thereby corrupt the atmosphere, pure atmosphere of the state. The Bhagavatam religion urges following the principles of religion. Bhagavata Dharma is the dominant of people's belief system.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Srila Prabhupada's preaching of Bhagavata Dharma, emphasizing the importance of chanting the names of God and highlighting the unity of God across different religions.

Like Srila Prabhupada traveled all over the world and preached the Bhagavata Dharma of simply chanting the names of God. Srila Prabhupada said, "If you have objection to chanting name of Krishna, you may chant the name of God as revealed in your bona fide religious system, but chanting the name of God is the principle of Bhagavata Dharma." So you chant. When Prabhupada pointed out that in the Islam religion, they say Allah is the name of God as revealed in their scripture. So he is supreme, and they glorify him in so many ways in the Quran. In the Bible, Father in heaven, the name, the name of the supreme Lord is glorified in the Bible. So God is one, though different names he may be referred to in different bonafide religious systems, but God is one. Supreme means only one person. Nobody is equal to him. Nobody is above him. So that principle he is explaining, sticking to dogmas and formulas without attaining the real principles.

**Key Quote:** "A secular state may be impartial to any type of faith, but the state cannot be indifferent to the principles of religion."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by explaining that while a secular state may be impartial to different faiths, it cannot ignore fundamental religious principles like austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness, as breaking these principles leads to corruption.

A secular state may be impartial to any type of faith, but the state cannot be indifferent to the principles of religion as above mentioned. Secular state means the state will allow people to follow either Christianity or Islam or whatever, but they cannot break the fundamental principles like austerity, cleanliness, mercy, truthfulness. They cannot break that. They are punishable if they break these principles, irrespective of what their belief system is. In the age of Kali, the executive heads of state will be indifferent to such religious principles, and therefore under their patronage, the opponents of religious principles will follow, and so there will be no meaning to propaganda, crying to stop corruption in the state. People want to root out corruption, and they are harassed by this corruption, but the corruption is the natural consequence of people breaking the fundamental religious principles. You see, there is a connection. If people don't practice austerity, somebody may think, "Oh, he doesn't believe in doing tapasya, the form of fasting, so it's okay, let him not follow." No. That will result in the person becoming afflicted by greed, by falsehood, by cheating, so many bad qualities the person will develop. So therefore, to protect people, the enforcement, the law enforcing authority should enforce that everyone should follow, irrespective of their religious affiliation, the four fundamental pillars of dharma: austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Parikshit Maharaj encountering Kali Purusha and explains why Kali was not allowed to remain in the kingdom, emphasizing the importance of truth, religion, and sacrifice in a place like Brahmavarta.

These are words spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Shri Gautama Shetty Parijkshit Maharaj. For your refresh memory, while Parikshit was touring the kingdom, he came across this Kali Purusha trying to beat a bull and a cow. The bull was standing just on one leg, somehow hobbling along, the cow had tears in her eyes and she seemed to be unprotected, and this Kali Purusha was actually a low-class person dressed as a king, but his activity, his action, was harming the cow and the bull. So immediately Parikshit took out a sword to kill this Kali Purusha, but Kali Purusha actually, he completely surrendered to the king when he saw Kali Purusha. There was no way he could escape. So since Kalipurusha surrendered, Pariksit did not want to kill him, but he said you cannot remain in my kingdom because you are the friend of irreligion, atharma bandhu. So, he is addressing in this verse why is a personality like Kalipurusha not allowed to live in the kingdom of Pariksit Maharaj. So, the Kingdom of Pariksit Maharaj is a place where experts perform sacrifices according to truth and religion and morality, filial routine and morality, affinity and morality. So, all these principles for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality. Such a place is called Brahmavarta. It is not only one place, but it is wherever, any place on the surface of this globe, where the Supreme Lord is worshipped according to the principles of the authorized scriptures.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of performing sacrifices according to scriptural directions, highlighting that the methods of sacrifice vary in different ages (yugas).

And that is explained in the purport by Srila Prabhupada. Agneshwara, or the Supreme Personality, is the beneficiary of all kinds of sacrificial ceremonies. This is a statement of the Bhagavad Gita. The Supreme Lord is called Yajneshwara. Yajneshwara. He is the enjoyer, the beneficiary, the object of all sacrifices, which are performed according to the scriptural directions, which are authorized by the standard scriptures, which are not manufactured by some person of this world, no. So, Srila Prabhupada says, such sacrificial ceremonies are performed according to the scriptural directions, are prescribed differently in the scriptures for different ages. Now the shastras are recommending different types of sacrifice for different yugas in this earth planet.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the characteristics of Satya Yuga, where people were spiritually inclined and focused on meditation, and contrasts it with the current age.

Different yugas, the conditions are different, the living conditions are different. In Satya yuga, most people are situated in the mode of goodness. They are all spiritually inclined, they are very much religious minded, they follow the scriptural directions. So for that age the method of sacrifice was? God. Absolutely correct. The performance of meditation on the Supreme Lord within the heart. Vishnu seated in the heart is Paramatma, meditation on Paramatma. And that was feasible in that age in Satyayuga. There was a long duration of life for people and people were very, very sober, peaceful. They were satisfied with all the necessities being met with by the arrangement of the Supreme Lord through the material nature. So even now if you go to the Himalayas, of course it is rare. But there are people who are living in certain secluded places, remote places in the Himalayas where there is plenty of fruits available, nice water for bathing, drinking, everything, pure water. And there are caves for living under the water, and they are there as a place of shelter. And then their mind is completely controlled, so they are able to direct their mind, focus their mind on meditation on this Supreme Lord in the heart as directed by the shastras. So the Bhagavatam says, kriteyadhyayato vishnum. Kriteyadhyayato vishnum. Kriteyadhyayato vishnum.

**Key Quote:** "Kalavata Hari Kirtanath the method is a performance of Sankirtan Yajna"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the recommended methods of sacrifice for Treta Yuga (fire sacrifice), Dwapar Yuga (temple worship), and Kali Yuga (Sankirtan Yajna).

That is the recommendation and in the second age, Treta Yuga, the duration of life reduces and there is some irreligiosity because with time there is a degradation in the consciousness of the people of the human beings. So vice is introduced, irreligion is introduced in Treta Yuga and gradually the religious principles reduce by one-fourth in Treta Yuga. So the method is performance of five-fold fire sacrifice. Treta Ayaam Yajato Makhaihi, people are recommended to perform fire sacrifices as again given in the authorized Vedic scriptures and there are varieties of sacrifices for varieties of people, different purposes. But ultimately all such sacrifices are aimed at satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead only. And in Dwapar Yuga it is temple worship, Dwapare Parijari Ayaam, temple worship of the Lord in different Deity forms, installed Deity forms. So that is the method in Dwapar Yuga and Kali Yuga, Kalavata Hari Kirtanath, the method is a performance of Sankirtan Yajna. So Aarshala Prabhupada says, in other words sacrifice means to accept the supremacy of the Lord and thereby perform acts by which the Lord may be satisfied in all respects, religion means to please the Supreme Lord by the recommended method as given in the scriptures because scriptures

He is the Supreme Personality, he is the Supreme Controller, he is Supreme Maintainer, he is Supreme well wisher, he is Supreme Lord. Every perspective you see he is the Supreme. Now let us noodle it. Nobody is equal to him, nobody is greater than him, so therefore he is meant to be obeyed by all, not that somebody believes that everyone is god or supreme or that somebody else believes there is no god or somebody else believes such and such a person is god. It's not like that. God means one and only one supreme personality and all bona fide religions accept this particular, or all bona fide religions teach and propagate and also have got documented in their scriptures that there is one supreme lord who is the lord of all, everyone without exception, but he is

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts theists and atheists, explaining that theists, regardless of their religious system, aim to satisfy the Supreme Lord, while atheists deny God's existence.

That is the highest perfection of religion, but the atheists do not believe in the existence of God and did not perform any sacrifice for the satisfaction of the Lord. So this is demonic mentality. Divine nature and demonic nature is always there everywhere at all times and the number of demons proportionately may be less or more in different yugas, but there are people of demonic nature and they deny God or they try to compete with God, they are atheists, whereas theists, they are not atheists in the human form and they have no religion and then the atheists will be involved in doing some very useful things, they want to satisfy God and also they want to satisfy the Supreme Lord, they want to perform actions for satisfying the Supreme Lord, no matter which religious system they follow which is a bona fide religious system, they are always divine natured and they want to perform actions for satisfying the Supreme Lord, so that is the basic principle.

#### demigod worship, Vedic scriptures, Supreme Lord

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "So, all these different types of worship are in a nutshell explained here by Srila Prabhupada."
**Summary:** This segment introduces the concept of demigod worship within the Vedic tradition, contrasting it with the worship of the Supreme Lord and explaining the different perspectives on God.

In this session, we will be discussing from the thirty-fourth verse of the seventeenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Yasmin Harir Bhagavan Igyamana Igyatma Murtir Yajatam Shamtanoti Kaman Amoghan Sthira Jangamanam Antar Bahirvayur Ivaisha Atma. The meaning of this verse is, in all sacrificial ceremonies, although sometimes a demigod is worshipped, the Supreme Lord, Personality of Godhead, is worshipped because He is the Supersoul of everyone and exists both inside and outside like the air. Thus, it is He only who awards all welfare to the worshipper. This is a very important verse because a certain secret is revealed about the nature of God. Because people sometimes get confused, especially in the Hindu religion as they call it. The Vedas don't describe anywhere that our religious system is called a Hindu religious system, but it has come into practice to label our system as the Hindu religious system. Basically, the followers of the Vedas, the Vedic scriptures, among them there are some who worship God. They worship God as one Supreme person, like the Vaishnavas. And there are impersonalists who worship God as the Supreme Brahman, impersonal Brahman. They don't exactly describe what is God or who is God. They basically say God is without form, without any qualities, without any attributes, Nirmisesha, Nirvikara, Nirmikalpa, like that. They go on describing in a negative way and ultimately they don't say what is God. And then there are some people who worship a representation of God, which is the Supreme Lord, the Supreme Beholder. And there are some who worship God as a material representation. In the scriptures, they are called devatas, or as Prabhupada says, demigods. Demigods means almost like God but not equal to God. So, demigods are worshipped like Indra, Chandra, Varuna, or Ganesha, or Shiva, or Durga in so many forms. Durga is worshipped in so many forms, Shiva is worshipped in so many forms, the other devatas are worshipped and represented by sometimes even the elements like fire, or even bodies of water, worshipping the river, or worshipping a tree, or worshipping the ocean, worshipping fire, worshipping the sun, worshipping the moon, etc.

**Key Quote:** "Yet the rewards of all such sacrifices are awarded to the worshipper by the Supreme Lord only."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the purpose of worshipping demigods for specific material benefits and mentions the various demigods and forms of the Supreme Lord that are worshipped.

So, all these different types of worship are in a nutshell explained here by Srila Prabhupada. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "It is even sometimes seen that demigods like Indra and Chandra worshipped and offered sacrificial awards." In the scriptures, there is a recommendation that somebody may worship a particular devata for a particular purpose, for a particular material benefit. And the sacrifices offered in the name of such devata, Indraya Swaha or Agnaya Swaha, like that, different demigods. There are so many demigods. Actually, according to our authentic Vedic scriptures, there are 33 crore devatas, though most people do not worship or do not know about 33 crore devatas. But some prominent ones are worshipped. Especially nowadays, you can even see temples dedicated for worship of deities of Shiva, Durga, Ganesha, Kartikeya. And, of course, the Vaishnavas worship Krishna, Rama, Narsimha, Varaha, Vamana. So many different temples for these deities. And even sacrifices, fire sacrifices for pleasing Narsimha, Narsimha Homa, or for pleasing Krishna as Krishna Yagna, or Ramathar Ka Homa, like that. So many different types of worship of different forms of the Supreme Lord: Krishna, Rama, Narsimha, Varaha. Authorized. And then the forms of the demigods.

#### Paramatma, Supreme Lord, demigod worship

**Key Quote:** "Because it is the Supreme Lord who is situated in the heart of everyone, including the Devatas."
**Summary:** This segment explains that the Supreme Lord, as Paramatma, resides in the hearts of all beings, including the demigods, and ultimately awards the results of all sacrifices.

Like Indra, Chandra, Varuna, Vayu. So Srila Prabhupada says, "Yet the rewards of all such sacrifices are awarded to the worshipper by the Supreme Lord only." If somebody follows the Vedic directions and worships either a deity of Ganesha or performs a sacrifice for pleasing Ganesha, Gana Homa, they say, Ganapati Homa, in any case, the ultimate reward is given only by the Supreme Lord Krishna. How is that? Because it is the Supreme Lord who is situated in the heart of everyone, including the Devatas. And he is everywhere present in the heart of everyone. He has entered into everything. Vishnu means one who enters into everything after his creation takes place. The Supreme Lord expands as Paramatma and enters into the heart of all living entities and even enters into every atom. Material atom. Andantarastha paramanu chayantarastham. He enters the created universe. He enters every planet. He enters the heart of every created being. He enters into every material atom, Paramanu. Anda means the universal shell. Vishwatma. So, like that, the Supreme Lord as Paramatma is present in everyone's heart, everywhere, even the Devata's heart. Indra, Chandra, Varuna, Vayu, everyone's heart. The Supreme Lord is present as Paramatma. And it is this Lord who is present in the heart of everyone, who is also present as the maintainer Vishnu, who is also present as Maha Vishnu, the origin of this creation itself, the creator, maintainer and destroyer of all the universes, and present in the spiritual world as Narayana, as Krishna. So, that Supreme Lord is present in everyone's heart, is present everywhere, is in the spiritual world, is in the material world. So, he actually is the only one who can avoid the results of all such bona fide sacrifices. He is the one who maintains everyone. He is the one who accepts the sacrifices if it is offered according to the Vedic directions. So, when somebody offers a sacrifice to Indra, it is through Indra that they are actually offering to the Supreme Lord.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "That whatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kunti is really meant for me alone."
**Summary:** This segment uses verses from the Bhagavad Gita to clarify that all sacrifices are ultimately meant for the Supreme Lord, even when offered to demigods, although often done without true understanding.

Through Indra. So, in the Bhagavad Gita this is clarified. Bhagavad Gita is the final scripture which clarifies all such apparent confusions or contradictions in the directions given in the original Vedas. Bhagavad Gita clarifies this. In Bhagavad Gita it is said, "Whatever a man may sacrifice to other gods"—gods here mean demigods—"O son of Kunti, is really meant for me alone." Me, Krishna is speaking. It is meant for Krishna only, but it is offered without true understanding. Yajante avidhi purvakam. They are not following the proper method of offering the sacrifice, because sacrifice means to ultimately please the Yajneshwara, the Supreme Lord of all sacrifices. That is the Supreme Lord Vishnu. Vishnu. Yajna vai Vishnu. Yajna means Vishnu. So, there is only one Supreme Lord. He is one without a second. Ekameva advitiya. This is the statement of the Vedas. One only. Supreme Lord is one only. There is no other God other than the Supreme Lord himself.

**Key Quote:** "But Krishna is above this material creation, and he is the lord of everyone."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the Supreme Lord's transcendence over the material creation and His position as the Lord of all, including the demigods, clarifying the correct understanding of demigod worship in relation to Krishna.

Thus, the Supreme Lord is eternally transcendental to the material creation. This is a very important point. There is this material creation consisting of different planets, different personalities, and different powers, different heads of the rulers, head of the particular living entities in a particular planet, the chief of the planet, planetary systems. Indra is the king of heaven, and then there is Indraloka. Then there is Chandra, the moon god, the predominant deity of the moon planet. The sun god, Suryadeva, predominant deity of the sun planet. Like that there are so many planets, so many personalities. But Krishna is above this material creation, and he is the lord of everyone. He is seated in everyone's heart. Suryadeva's heart, Chandra Deva's heart, Ganesha's heart, and Shiva's heart, Parvati or Durga Devi's heart. He is seated in the heart of everyone. He is the lord of everyone. He is above everybody. So Prabhupada says the demigods are indirect qualitative representation of supreme lord. So a learned devotee or a learned scholar in the Vedas knows who is who. He knows what is the position of the devatas and what is the position of supreme lord Krishna. So the really learned people they worship only Krishna, but others may worship Indra, Chandra, Varuna, etc. as a representative of Krishna, accepting on behalf of Krishna and passing on to Krishna the supreme lord. So this is the correct understanding about the recommendations for worship of Indra, Chandra, Ganesha, Shiva, etc. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami describes the encounter between Parikshit Maharaj and Kali Purusha, focusing on Kali's fear, surrender, and Parikshit's decree that Kali cannot reside in his kingdom due to its strict adherence to religious principles; this segment repeats the same information multiple times.

So Shukadev Goswami is telling, the personality of Kali thus being ordered by Maharaj Parikshit began to tremble in fear, seeing the king before him like Yamaraj ready to kill him, Kali spoke to the king as follows. So Kali Purusha, as I mentioned in the previous session, he was afraid of Parikshit because Parikshit was ready to kill him. For his nefarious act of unnecessarily harming the cow and the bull, so he surrendered and his life was saved, but what did he do after surrendering, what did he say, because Parikshit said you cannot stay, even though I have spared your life, you cannot stay in my kingdom, where religious principles are strictly followed according to scriptures.

**Key Quote:** "Parikṣit Mahārāja gave permission to Kali to reside in a place where there is gambling, drinking, prostitution and animal slaughter were performed."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam describing the places where Kali, the personification of irreligion, is allowed to reside: gambling, drinking, prostitution, and animal slaughter.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 38th verse of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Sūta uvāca abhyartitas tadātasmai sthānāni kalaye dadau tyūtaṁ pānam sthriya-sūnā yatra adharmas chatur vidhahā. Sūta Goswami said, Mahārāja Parikṣit, thus being petitioned by the personality of Kali, gave him permission to reside in places where gambling, drinking, prostitution, and animal slaughter were performed. This is a very, very, very important verse in the entire Bhagavatam, I would say, because this describes the four places where Kali was given permission to reside by Parikṣit Mahārāja, where life was spared. And who is Kali? Kali is the one who spreads irreligion. He spreads evil influence. He influences people in an evil way to commit sinful activities even though they may not be sinful otherwise. So what are those four places? Parikṣit Mahārāja gave permission to Kali to reside in a place where there is gambling, drinking, prostitution, and animal slaughter were performed. Parikṣit Mahārāja gave permission to Kali to reside in a place where there is gambling, drinking, prostitution, and animal slaughter were performed.

**Key Quote:** "religious principles there are four religious principles on which religion is based dharma is based"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the four places where Kali resides, explaining the meaning of each term and how they lead to irreligion and sinful activities, contrasting them with the four pillars of dharma: austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness.

So what are those four places where there is gambling going on? Deutam. And Pāäter is the place where there is intoxication—consumption of intoxicating drinks or even smoking in integents like tobacco—and prostitution, Sthriya, illicit connection with women, prostitution, illicit sex, and animal slaughter, Suna, animal killing for the sake of eating the animal flesh. So these four places were the places designated by Pariksit Maharaj for Kali Purusha to reside after his life was spent, which means that in Kali Yuga, wherever these four activities are going on is a place where Kali breeds all kinds of irreligiosity, means breaking the principles of Dharma and thereby committing various types of sinful activities and becoming implicated in sinful reactions to some of the activities that are going on in Kali Yuga. So if at all there is any suffering, it is only because of sin, and sin means to break the principles of Dharma, and this Dharma is given by the Supreme Lord, and where is it explained over? Is it described in the authentic scriptures again given by God? And anybody who violates, they are actually punished, and Kali Purusha particularly in this Age, the influence of the prevailing atmosphere is an evil, one of a kind influence, Kali Kalmasa. It is described in the Kali Santra Upanishad especially to overcome the bad influence, the evil influence in Kali Yuga of committing sinful activities or becoming implicated in different types of sinful activities or becoming victim of these four sinful activities: gambling, consuming intoxication, prostitution, and animal slaughter, animal killing. So these four sinful activities particularly are the places designated for Kali, and therefore Prabhupada writes a very elaborate purport. We will try to discuss this purport in this session and one more session because it's a long purport. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says the basic principles of irreligiosity such as pride, prostitution, intoxication, and falsehood counteract the four principles of religion, namely austerity, cleanliness

mercy, and truthfulness. See, already it was explained, dharma stands on four pillars, religious principles. There are four religious principles on which religion is based, dharma is based. Now, this is nothing to do with which religious system somebody may subscribe to. That means, ah, the religious principles are four fundamental principles of four, it is meant for all humanity all over the world irrespective of their belief system, irrespective of their tradition, irrespective of their caste, or irrespective of their inclinations to work, irrespective of their karma, four fundamentalities principle: austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness. Austerity is destroyed by pride, cleanliness is destroyed by prostitution, mercy is destroyed by intoxication, and truthfulness destroyed by falsehood, cheating, lying, propaganda. So the personality of Kali was given permission to live in four places particularly mentioned by the king, namely the place of gambling, the place of prostitution, the place of drinking, and the place of animal slaughter.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "gambling destroys truthfulness because it is cheating it is falsity is falsehood then prostitution destroys cleanliness so illicit sex is the cause of Varna Sankara population"
**Summary:** The speaker delves deeper into the consequences of gambling and prostitution, explaining how gambling is a form of cheating and how prostitution leads to Varna Sankara population, which results in the breaking of religious principles and criminal-mindedness.

So you can understand gambling means cheating. Krishna explains this in the Bhagavad Gita: deutam chalayatam asmi, among all processes of cheating, gambling stands supreme because gambling is nothing but cheating. See, people get indulge in gambling with the idea that without much effort, by some small investment of a real real small fraction of money, I can own a huge amount of money which is enough for my living the entire life. It's exactly what is the basic principle of gambling. This like there are many different ways people indulge in gambling. Let's say they buy a lottery ticket, they may pay five rupees, but the first prize for the lottery ticket will be, I don't know how much nowadays, but earlier I have known that people would say I can win 1 crore rupees or I can win 80 lakhs just spend 5 rupees and then if you win the lottery the first prize you get 1 crore rupees. So where is 5 rupees and where is 1 crore rupees? So this basically cheating is basically cheating. So this gambling destroys truthfulness because it is cheating, it is falsity, it is falsehood. Then prostitution destroys cleanliness. So illicit sex is the cause of Varna Sankara population, Varna Sankara population, and such Varna Sankara population results in all kinds of breaking of religious principles, breaking of religious principles, and they are criminal minded. It pollutes the mind. This Varna Sankara population, the mind is polluted, they are criminal minded even without any external blood influence, by birth itself they are criminal minded because they are conceived in lust.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "animal slaughter killing animals destroys the quality of mercy only hard-hearted people cruel people people who are merciless they indulge in animal killing simply for the sake of satisfying their tongue by eating animal flesh."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how intoxication destroys austerity and how animal slaughter destroys the quality of mercy, emphasizing that meat-eaters are necessarily cruel and hard-hearted.

And this is a big science. It is explained in the Bhagavatam elsewhere how to conceive good children and when is it that two people, man and woman, combining sexually produce a criminal mentality, a child with criminal mentality. So prostitution is the cause for that illicit sex for description as a cause of destroying cleanliness, and the place of drinking is intoxication where intoxication enlarging it actually destroys austerity. Somebody becomes inebriated, somebody becomes delirious, then there is no possibility of them executing austerity of tapasya. So tapasya is destroyed by intoxication, and animal slaughter, killing animals, destroys the quality of mercy. Only hard-hearted people, cruel people, people who are merciless, they indulge in animal killing simply for the sake of satisfying their tongue by eating animal flesh. So they are heartless, they're cruel, and their quality, inherent quality of compassion in a human being, is destroyed by animal killing. So meat eaters, animal flesh eaters, are necessarily very, very, very, very, very cruel people. They are cruel people. Sometimes I've heard the argument that even though somebody is a meat-eater, they are very nice, kind. Where is their kindness if the very eating, which is a very basic necessity for survival itself, is based on the principle of cruelty towards animals, where is kindness? Oh, we are kind to human beings and we don't care for animals. How can you be kind to one section of the created beings of God, creation of God, and be totally indifferent or cruel or merciless towards another section of the creation? Everybody has a right to live, so you have no right to kill anyone, let alone animals, you have right to kill no one. So that is the basic principle of living according to religious principles. So when the very fundamental distinct act of eating such a concept and so on the eating food is based on killing, so they can never be pardoned, they can never be considered as kind people, they can never be considered as nice people, never, never, never. So all meat eaters

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (1.17.38) about Maharaj Pariksit allowing Kali to reside in places of gambling, drinking, prostitution, and animal slaughter.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udhirayam. In this session, we will be discussing from the 38th verse of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is a fresh session which is continuing from the previous session. Previous session we discussed part 1 of this 38th verse, now we will discuss part 2 and in the next session we will discuss part 3 because there is a very big purport here written by Srila Prabhupada. So I will just read this verse once again, 38th verse of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, Suta Vacha Abhyarthitas Tadatasmai Sthanani Kalaye Dadau Deutam Panam Striya Suna Yatra Adharma Chatur Vidhah. The meaning of this verse is, Suta Goswami said, Maharaj Pariksit, thus being petitioned by the personality of Kali, gave him permission to reside in places where gambling, drinking, prostitution and animal slaughter were performed. So Maharaj Pariksit gave Kali Purusha four places, Deutam Panam Striya Suna, Deutam means gambling, Panam means drinking, Pras and Striya means prostitution and Suna means animal slaughter.

**Key Quote:** "Drinking against the principles of scriptures, association with women outside marriage, killing animals against the injunction of scriptures are all adharma or all irreligious."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the basic principles of irreligiosity and how they counteract the principles of religion, referencing Srila Prabhupada's purport and Srila Jiva Goswami's commentary, focusing on drinking, illicit relations, and animal slaughter.

So we discussed in the previous session that the basic principles of irreligiosity, they counteract the four principles of religion. And we discussed how counteraction happens in the previous session. Now, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport further, the personality of Kali was given permission to live in four places particularly mentioned by the king. Namely, the place of gambling, the place of prostitution, the place of drinking, and the place of animal slaughter. Four specific places were given for Kali Purusha by Maharaj Pariksit. So, now something about what is Dharma and what is Adharma as regards these four activities are specifically explained by Srila Prabhupada, with reference to Srila Jeeva Goswami's commentary on this verse in his writings. Srila Jeeva Goswami is one of the six Goswamis, the direct disciples of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the next part of the purport, Srila Jeeva Goswami directs the drunken people and the unmarried woman with the five principles of the scriptures that drinking against the principles of scriptures, such as the Sautramaaniyagna, association with woman outside of marriage, killing animals against the injunctions of scriptures, are irreligious. Irreligious means Adharma. Three things are specifically mentioned. Drinking against the principles of scriptures, association with women outside marriage, killing animals against the injunction of scriptures are all adharma or all irreligious.

**Key Quote:** "The Vedic injunction for the pravartas the ordinary people those engaged in material enjoyment is to gradually regulate their activities towards the path of liberation"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the different scriptural injunctions for 'pravrittas' (those engaged in material enjoyment) and 'nivrttas' (those liberated from material bondage), emphasizing that the aim of the Vedas is to free everyone from material bondage and help them progress back to Godhead.

Now we have to carefully understand what does it mean that these acts are irreligious only if they are against the scriptures and what do scriptures allow in terms of drinking, illicit connection with women and or rather association with women and killing animals. What do scriptures allow? scriptures say so Prabhupada first of all clarifies in the Vedas two different types of injunctions are there for the pravrittas and for the nivrittas so dharma or scriptural injunctions are there differently explained for two different categories of persons who are the pravrittas pravrittas are those who are engaged in material enjoyment and nivrittas are those who are liberated for from material bondage so pravrittas who are regular ordinary people they are somehow in ignorance and they are engaged in material enjoyment so what is the scriptural injunctions of practicing Dharma for the normal people ordinary people the pravartas those engaged in material enjoyment and what are those scriptural injunctions specifically meant for nivrittas or those liberated from material bondage there are different injunctions so Srila Prabhupada further says the Vedic injunction for the pravartas the ordinary people those engaged in material enjoyment is to gradually regulate their activities towards the path of liberation so the injunctions in this scriptural injunctions are the same as the pravartas scriptures are meant to regulate the activities of the ordinary common people so that these common people progress towards liberation not that they follow the scriptures and they remain in bondage no the aim of the Vedas whether it is for the pravartas or nivrittas is ultimately to free them from material bondage and to help them progress after becoming liberated to go back to Godhead we should not forget this merely attaining liberation from material bondage is not enough there is a further progress to be made after liberation to go back to Godhead where we all belong

**Key Quote:** "For those who are in the lowest stage of ignorance and who indulge in wine women and flesh there are scriptural rules how to regulate their activities"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on how scriptures provide regulations for those in the lowest stage of ignorance (tamasic people) who indulge in wine, women, and flesh, such as drinking after Sautramani Yagna, associating with women only through marriage, and eating animal flesh after sacrifice.

therefore Srila Prabhupada further says for those who are in the lowest stage of ignorance and who indulge in wine women and flesh there are scriptural rules how to regulate their activities in this connection how to regulate their drinking how to regulate their association with women how to regulate them in the matter of eating flesh so for drinking liquor for the pravrittas there is a injunction that they may drink liquor after performing Sautramani Yagna the pravrittas may associate with women only through marriage and the pravrittas may eat animal flesh and drink liquor after performing Sautramani Yagna after offering a goat in sacrifice so we should always remember that these recommendations in the Vedas for the pravrittas is meant for pravrittas only and not for everyone you it's not meant for everyone so these pravrittas for whom such allowance is given are those in the lowest stage of ignorance they are tamasic people they are situated in tamoguna so it is not meant for those who are not in tamoguna it's not meant for those in rajoguna or sattvaguna no so when the people who are thumbsick they indulge in drinking liquor or eating flesh animal flesh or they indulge in associating with women they may do so according to the injunctions of the scriptures by following the sacrifice meant for offering a goat to Kali or by offering some liquor to again Kali in Sautramani yajna or they may associate with women after getting married to them according to the Vedic injunctions so for such thumbsick people under Vedic regulation which is meant for thumbsick people pravrittas there is no consideration of sin I'm sorry there's no consideration of being punished by being sent to hell if they kill a goat and offer it in sacrifice to Kali or they offer wine in a Sautramani yajna and then partake of the remnants of such offering or they indulge in sex with a woman after being duly married to that woman

**Key Quote:** "One man's food may be poisoned for others similarly what is recommended for those in the mode of ignorance may be poisoned for those in the mode of goodness"
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing that scriptural allowances for certain classes of people (tamasic) should not be considered universally applicable, and such activities are adharma for sattvic and rajasic people, stressing the importance of careful discrimination and understanding the context of scriptural injunctions.

so do not pray to Lord Shiva for anything else but only to improve one's health in hell so these injunctions in the scriptures are only for thumbsick people it is not meant for every one so Shruthi Prabhupada says one man's food may be poisoned for others similarly what is recommended for those in the mode of ignorance may be poisoned for those in the mode of goodness Srila Jiva Goswami Prabhupada says that recommendations in the scriptures for certain class of men are never to be considered adharma or irreligious for them but in general for people who are not in the tamasic stage all such activities are never to be encouraged and they are factually adharma for sattvic people and rajasic people the recommendations like soutramani yajna etc are actually not to be followed for them all sorts of recommendations like that are not to be followed for them all sorts of meat-eating and all sorts of drinking liquor are prohibited so therefore one has to be very careful that simply because the shastras allow for a certain class of people some animal sacrifice or offering of wine in some yagna and then partaking the remnants doesn't mean everyone can do it no so this clarification Srila Prabhupada is giving in the purport to this particular verse the 38th verse which says that Kali Purusha was given four places and one has to be careful and the later verses and purports will clarify this more I

**Key Quote:** "Following in the footsteps of Maharaj Pariksit it is the duty of all executive heads of states to see that the principles of religion namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness are established in the state and that the principles of irreligion namely pride, illicit female association of prostitution, intoxication and falsity are checked by all means."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of discussion, verse 38 of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, and explains Prabhupada's perspective on the duties of the state in upholding religious principles and curbing irreligious activities, particularly in the age of Kali.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we continue to discuss from the 38th verse of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This session will be part 3 of the discussion on the 38th verse. Previous two sessions, we discussed different aspects of these four sinful activities: Deutam Panam Striya Suna, gambling, drinking liquor, illicit connection with women, and animal slaughter, animal killing for the sake of eating the animal flesh. These four sinful activities we discussed in the previous two sessions. Prabhupada now is in the last part of this purport; he is describing what is the duty of the executioner. The duty of the executioner is to protect the executive heads of state to actually counteract this evil influence of Kali so that there is religiosity, which is Dharma, is protected in the state. So Prabhupada says, following in the footsteps of Maharaj Pariksit, it is the duty of all executive heads of states to see that the principles of religion, namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness, tapasyaucham, dayasatyam, are established in the state and that the principles of irreligion, namely pride, illicit female association of prostitution, intoxication and falsity, are checked by all means.

**Key Quote:** "These are universal factual principles of Dharma which is applicable for the entire human society, entire human society irrespective of what somebody's belief system may be or some traditional affiliation to some community or caste or whatever."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the four pillars of Dharma (austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness) as universal principles, and discusses how Maharaj Pariksit dealt with Kali Purusha by allocating specific places for sinful activities to prevent their influence on religious citizens.

So the four principles of religion, Dharma, to uphold Dharma, Dharma stands on four pillars. That means there has to be austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. Then only there is Dharma. Dharma is not based on some sentimental following of some so called religious principles. No. There is no such thing which each person may think according to me this is Dharma, according to somebody else something else is Dharma, no. These are universal factual principles of Dharma which is applicable for the entire human society, entire human society irrespective of what somebody's belief system may be or some traditional affiliation to some community or caste or whatever. Okay. Or religion, so called religion maybe irrespective of that. So Akshaya La Prabhupada says to make the best use of a bad bargain, the personality of Kali may be transferred to places of gambling, drinking, prostitution and slaughterhouses if there are any places like that. So Kali Purusha has entered the kingdom of Pariksit. But Pariksit doesn't want to enter the kingdom of Pariksit. But Pariksit doesn't want Kali Purusha to influence the citizens of his kingdom who are strictly following the religious principles. He didn't want Kali to influence him to become irreligious.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses how to deal with individuals addicted to sinful habits, emphasizing regulation through scripture and discouraging government endorsement of such activities, advocating for the eradication of gambling, drinking, prostitution, and falsity.

So he gave Kali Purusha four places. Now Kali Purusha actually to be indicated that Kali Purusha has entered the kingdom of Pariksit. That in the next words that he saw in Pariksit Maharaj's kingdom because he was ruling very strictly. There were no places where these activities were going on. The people were protected against the influence of his sinful acts. So Śrīla Prabhupāda says if there are some people who are addicted to such habits, for them what is the way out of you know these sinful activities. So Prabhupāda says those who are addicted to these irreligious habits may be regulated by the injunctions of the scripture. As I mentioned in the previous session, part two, same words discussion of part 2 the previous session that in the Shastras there is a concession given for Tamsic people that they may be regulated in drinking liquor or eating meat or indulging in sex with women by Shastric injunctions, so injunctions of the scriptures meant for Tamsic people, but in no circumstances should such people who are addicted to these habits be encouraged by the government or the state or the king, never should there be any freedom given to indulge in unrestrictedly, so proper says in other words the state should never encourage any of these activities, they should categorically stop all sorts of gambling, drinking, prostitution

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the second recommendation: compulsory marriage at specific ages to prevent illicit relationships, advocating for marriage in cases of intimate connection and the abolishment of divorce laws.

scriptures then the second recommendation here is that there must be compulsory marriage of young boys and girls attaining 24 years of age and 16 years of age respectively that means boys when they reach 24 years of age they should compulsorily get married and girls when they reach 16 years of age they should get compulsory married why is this recommendation of compulsory marriage because it's very natural for young boys and girls to mix with each other but they should not mix without being properly married that is the danger of mixing free mixing so Prabhupada says there is no harm in co-education in the schools and colleges provided the boys and girls are duly married and in case there is any intimate connection between a male and female and male and female student they should be married properly without illicit relation that means mixing between a boy and a girl is only allowed if they are married otherwise it should not be allowed so that mixing without being married is called illicit connection it is actually sinful mixing without being married only a married couple boy and girl or man and woman can actually mix with each other otherwise no and Prabhupada also says the the divorce act is encouraging prostitution and this should be abolished formerly in the Vedic culture there was nothing like divorce in the entire Vedic scripture there is no mention of divorce so there should be no government encouragement or government license for divorce so that is the divorce act has to be abolished.

**Summary:** The speaker presents the third recommendation: citizens should donate up to 50% of their income to create a spiritual atmosphere, and the state should encourage preaching the principles of Bhagavatam through five methods.

So that is the divorce act has to be abolished. That is what Prabhupada's recommendation is to avoid illicit connection with women. The third recommendation Srila Prabhupada gives is the citizens of the state must give in charity up to 50% of their income for the purpose of creating a spiritual atmosphere in the state or in human society both individually and collectively. You see that people's earning money they earn should be utilized properly so that there is a good atmosphere in the spiritual atmosphere is created in the state or the human society. Why because unless there is a proper atmosphere. It is difficult to encourage people to practice some basic principles what are recommended in the in the Bhagavatam also they should preach the principles of Bhagavatam the state should encourage preaching the principles of Bhagavatam by five different methods principles of Bhagavatam can be preached by the first one karma yoga or doing everything for the satisfaction of the Lord please explain the third chapter of Bhagavad Gita karma yoga means whatever work one does wonder does it as sacrifice to Vishnu sacrifice to the supreme law that's called yajna so karma yoga means performing all work as sacrifice second one is regular hearing of the Srimad Bhagavatam from authorized persons or realized souls Bhagavad Shravan third one is chanting of the glories of the Lord congregation Lee at home or at places of worship Sankirtan yajna specifically Kirtan yajna means the one who is doing all the work for the satisfaction of the Lord kirtana hari kirtana chanting of the glories of the Lord congregation Lee all gathered together people gathered together at home or in places of worship and they perform this kirtana hari kirtana and fourth recommendation is rendering all kinds of service to the bhagavata's engaged in preaching Srimad Bhagavatam those who preach Srimad Bhagavatam exclusively dedicating their lives for such preaching such bhagavata's should be should be actually given all kinds of service serve the bhagavata's bhagavata's seva and the fifth recommendation is residing in a place where the atmosphere is saturated with God consciousness these five recommendations for preaching the

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Kali asked for more places to reside because King Pariksit's rule was so pure that the four sinful activities (gambling, intoxication, illicit sex, and animal slaughter) were not present.

In this session we are discussing from the 39th verse of the 17th chapter of the 1st canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. The meaning of this 39th verse is The personality of Kali asked for something more and because of his begging King Pariksit gave him permission to live where there is goal. Because wherever there is goal there is also falsity, intoxication, lust, envy and enmity. So, if you remember the previous verse Kali was given four places by Maharaj Pariksit where gambling goes on, where drinking liquor is indulged in, where there is illicit connection with women, prostitution and where there is animal slaughter.

Now Kali Purusha asked something more because at the time Pariksit was ruling Kali Purusha could not find in Pariksit's kingdom any place where these four activities were going on. So he asked for some place, some other place other than the place where these four activities are sinful activities are indulgent and because the kali purusha had surrendered to parikshit and he was begging for one more place some other place the king gave him permission to live where there is gold where this gold means where people have accumulated gold for purposes other than devotional service other than for serving krishna other than krishna conscious purpose if they have got gold accumulated in their home or in their state anywhere then that place also parikshit gave kali purusha a place to reside why why was kali purusha a place to reside

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Parikshit thus gave Kali permission to go. He gave Kali permission to live in a place where there is gold, because wherever there is gold, there are all the above mentioned four things and over and above them there is enmity also."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Kali Purusha's nature as a friend of irreligion (Adharma) and how Parikshit Maharaj allowed him to reside where gold is accumulated, as it fosters falsity, intoxication, lust, envy, and enmity.

Kali Purusha is described as Adharmabandhu, friend of Adharma, irreligion. So, wherever Kali Purusha resides, he will spread Adharma. And Parikshit Mahana did not want his citizens to get corrupted, to get influenced by Adharma, Adharma influence of Kali. So, therefore, Kali asked the king, you have practically cheated me. You didn't give me any place. So, then Parikshit Maharaj, because Kali had surrendered, he gave him a fifth place. That place where gold is accumulated for non-devotional purposes. So, Prabhupada says in the purport further, Maharaj Parikshit thus gave Kali permission to go. He gave Kali permission to live in a place where there is gold, because wherever there is gold, there are all the above mentioned four things and over and above them there is enmity also. What are the four defects of accumulating gold for any purpose other than devotional service? There will be falsity, Andhritam, Madham, intoxication, Kamam, lust.

**Key Quote:** "Gold standard currency is based on falsehood because the currency is not on a par with the reserve gold."
**Summary:** The speaker transitions to a discussion of government policy, arguing that a gold standard currency is inherently based on falsity because the value of currency notes issued is not equivalent to the gold reserves held by the government.

encourages five things, falsity, intoxication, prostitution, envy and enmity. Even a gold standard exchange in currency is bad. Now Prabhupada is talking about the government policy. Gold standard currency is based on falsehood because the currency is not on a par with the reserve gold. Now, that is the system most countries have including India that they have currency notes issued by the government. Now, what is the value of that currency note, the piece of paper? Now, they say, the government says that this paper has got a value because it is valuable because it is based on the reserve gold that is kept stored in the government safe deposit vaults. But, the reality is the government issues currency notes not exactly based on the value of the gold stored in their vaults. They issue much more currency notes than the gold there. So, Prabhupada says the basic principle is falsity.

**Key Quote:** "The basic principle is falsity because currency notes are issued in value beyond that of the actual reserve gold."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of currency notes exceeding the value of reserve gold to illustrate how gold encourages falsity, and how this artificial inflation of currency leads to the prostitution of the state economy.

How gold encourages falsity is a good example here, right here. The basic principle is falsity because currency notes are issued in value beyond that of the actual reserve gold. For example, if let us say the government has gold worth 100 crores. The government has gold worth let us say 100 million rupees just to give you an example. If the total currency notes in circulation, printed currency notes is more than 100 million rupees, then that is a falsity and that is what exactly is happening. So, Prabhupada says currency notes are issued in value beyond that of the actual reserve gold. So, there is falsity right here by the government itself. See, the government should themselves not be practicing falsity and they should regulate the citizens to avoid falsity. Now, here government itself is not practicing falsity. Government itself is practicing falsity when they issue currency notes beyond the value of the reserve gold. So, what happens if they issue such currency? This artificial inflation of currency that means they are giving issuing more notes than what they should be issuing. This is called artificial inflation. By the authorities encourages prostitution of the state economy. The state economy is completely spoiled. It is ruined. The state economy is ruined.

**Key Quote:** "The price of commodities becomes artificially inflated because of bad money or artificial currency notes."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how the economy is ruined by artificial inflation, where the supply of currency notes exceeds the value of available goods, leading to increased prices and scarcity.

What happens? How is the economy ruined? Prabhupada says the price of commodities becomes artificially inflated because of bad money or artificial currency notes. See, people have more currency notes in their hand than the actual reserve gold. And the value of the goods that are available. These currency notes are just a medium of exchange. So, if I have currency notes worth let us say 10,000 rupees. If these 10,000 rupees can purchase some goods worth what they say is worth 10,000, but if the equation is not commensurate with actual total value of the goods then there is inflation, artificial inflation in the price of the commodities. The price of the commodities will go up because the supply of the goods will not correspond with the supply of the currency notes. There will be more currency notes in supply and the goods will be less. So, what happens? People's buying power will exhaust all the goods and people will have money but there will be no goods. So, the price of the commodities will naturally go up when there is scarcity. Bad money drives away good money. So, this is what is called as bad money.

**Key Quote:** "Instead of paper currency, actual gold coin should be used for exchange."
**Summary:** The speaker suggests using gold coins as currency instead of paper notes to prevent the misuse of gold and eliminate falsity in the economy, also suggesting regulation of gold ornaments for women by quantity.

The currency notes issued in excess of the value of the stored gold. So, Prabhupada says instead of paper currency, actual gold coin should be used for exchange. Whatever the government has got the reserve gold, they should make gold coins and that should be the currency. That should be the medium of exchange and this will stop the prostitution of gold. Gold will not be misused anymore. Gold ornaments for women may be allowed by control not by quality but by quantity. What about women using gold ornaments? That was always there in the Vedic culture. So, now how can government avoid people accumulating too much gold in the form of gold ornaments for women? So, government has to regulate by quantity the gold that people possess. Otherwise, if they possess too much of gold, that will simply lead to lust, envy, enmity, etc. So, by restricting the quantity of gold people can have, this will discourage lust, envy and enmity. When there is actual gold currency in the form of coins, the influence of gold in producing falsity will automatically cease. It will automatically stop. Nobody can cheat. If there are gold coins for currency, then nobody can cheat. Neither the government nor the people can cheat.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the practicality of Prabhupada's recommendations, noting that Vedic culture used gold coins, which prevented artificial inflation, a problem prevalent in countries with paper currency.

Now, simply because they are issuing paper currency not in equality with the value of reserve gold. So, therefore, there is artificial inflation. So, Prabhupada's recommendations are very practical and that is why you find in the Vedic culture they had only gold coins. They did not have currency notes in those times because of which there was no artificial inflation at all. Now, you can see in every country where they have currency notes, they have so much of inflation. So much of inflation. The value of the currency notes which is promised by the government is not in on par with the value of the commodities or the goods that people require to purchase with the money that they have. And that is why there is so much of inflation, inflation, inflation.

For non-devotional purposes. So, in the purport Srila Prabhupada says, "Thus the age of Kali began with gold standardization and therefore falsity, intoxication, animal slaughter and prostitution are rampant all over the world and the saner section is eager to drive out corruption." You see, because in Kali Yuga there is so much of wealth accumulated for sense gratification. Therefore, there is in Kali Yuga so much of falsity, intoxication, animal slaughter and prostitution.

**Key Quote:** "Prostitution is any sexual contact with women outside of the religious principles."
**Summary:** The speaker defines and explains each of the four sinful activities: gambling, intoxication, animal slaughter, and prostitution, emphasizing that sex should only be for producing good progeny according to religious principles, otherwise it leads to a corrupted population.

Falsity is basically different forms of cheating by gambling. So, this is what we are talking about, by gambling. Intoxication, all descriptions of intoxicants, tobacco, whether they are consuming tobacco as gutka or they are smoking tobacco or they are distilling tobacco, whatever ways they want to indulge in intoxication. Animal slaughter. Killing of animals for flesh, meat eating. So many millions and billions of animals are killed. So much animal slaughter is going on. And prostitution. Prostitution is any sexual contact with women outside of the religious principles. Religious principles allow sex only for the sake of producing good progeny. Dharma aviriddha bhuteshu kamo smi bharatar shabha. In the Bhagavad Gita it is very clear. Sex life is meant for producing Krishna conscious children, good population. Otherwise, if the religious principles are not followed, then the result of illicit sex is Varna Sankara population. The population generated by illicit connection with women becomes corrupted, becomes criminal minded.

So, we can see how the number of people who are not following the religious principles is increasing as Kali Yuga progresses and there is so much of indulgence in intoxication, meat eating, gambling, illicit sex, so much. And there are sober people who want to drive away corruption, but Prabhupada says the counteracting process for these four sinful activities is already suggested by Prabhupada in the purport to 38th verse and the 39th verse. So 38th verse Prabhupada suggested two compulsory days of fasting observing the Kali Shivrata and then a compulsory marriage for those who want to associate with a member of the opposite sex, then citizens of state must give in charity up to 50 percent of their income for the propagation of Bhagavata Dharma and the five ways in which Bhagavata Dharma should be propagated in the state. All these recommendations are meant for actually counteracting

**Summary:** The speaker introduces verse 41, emphasizing that those who desire progressive well-being, especially leaders like kings, religionists, public leaders, brahmanas, and sannyasis, should avoid the four irreligious principles: gambling, illicit sex, intoxication, and meat-eating.

the evil influence of Kali in this Kali Yuga and Prabhupada says everyone can take advantage of these suggestions. Then in the 41st verse: athei taani na seveta, bubhusuhu purushakva chit pierisupati grassha vashi 깁 ebeIm vishe shato dhamash exporta, saitala kuru prasadhi agni ko pashalaye dosa ajari , Bmake하면 sathyanakas keikamishwaram vamsikamah nitopatmanai vipuhya 365OSADVOMU kamup branches, abdev vai kasi makir abdevfakas hijjyari uasali pingamat jag jahan karmok oli baisamikana guru who. The meaning of this 41st verse is: therefore whoever desires progressive well-being especially kings, religionists, public leaders, brahmanas and sannyasis should never come in contact with the above mentioned four irreligious principles. So Bhagavatam recommends specially four or five categories of persons. Kings means the rulers, the executive heads of the government, religionists those who preach religious principles, priests and propagators of religion. Public leaders, all descriptions of public leaders, brahmanas and sannyasis in the Vedic culture the brahmanas are proper explains that in the purport I will read the purport we will understand who are being mentioned as brahmanas and sannyasis. These categories of persons in the society should never come in contact with the four religious principles: gambling, illicit sex, intoxication and meat eating. They should never come in touch with these four.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, clarifying the roles of brahmanas and sannyasis in the varnashrama system, highlighting that brahmanas are spiritual teachers for other castes, and sannyasis are spiritual masters for all.

They should be completely free from these four sinful habits. So in the purport Srila Prabhupada says the brahmanas are the religious preceptors for all other castes. In the varnashrama system there are four social divisions: brahmana, kshatriya, vaishya, shudra. So of these four divisions the division of brahmanas, they are the spiritualists, the spiritual teachers for the kshatriyas, vaishyas and shudras. And the sannyasis are spiritual masters for all castes and orders of society. Sannyasis are among the brahmanas those who are in the renounced order, those who are renunciants. They are completely detached from all material connections. So sannyasis are the spiritual masters even of the brahmanas. So sannyasis are spiritual masters for everyone. So brahmanas and sannyasis are clarified who are meant by brahmanas and sannyasis. So also are the king and the public leaders who are responsible for the material welfare of all people.

**Key Quote:** "So also are the king and the public leaders who are responsible for the material welfare of all people."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the responsibilities of kings and public leaders for the material welfare of the people, emphasizing the importance of truthfulness for brahmanas and avoiding illicit connections with women for sannyasis.

The king, the king means the executive head of state. Of course now there is no monarchy in most countries but in place of the king there is the president or the prime minister or the governor whatever be the designation, the executive head of state in the government. So they should be responsible for the material welfare of the people. Okay. So, particularly Prabhupada says not only material welfare, it is said here by Prabhupada the progressive religionists and those who are responsible human beings or those who want to do not want to spoil their valuable human lives should refrain from all principles of irreligiosity especially elicit connection with women. Among the four sinful activities elicit connection with women is particularly to be refrained by the sannyasis. And, a Brahmana especially he should be truthful. So, if a Brahmana is not truthful, all his claims as a brahmana at once becomes null and void so brahmana should be truthful under all circumstances never should a brahmana tell lies and a sanyasi should particularly avoid illicit connection with women the sanyasi is illicit having illicit connection with women immediately all his claims for as a sanyasi at once becomes false.

**Summary:** The speaker further emphasizes the importance of avoiding illicit connections with women for sannyasis and truthfulness for brahmanas, and how drinking and smoking disqualify public leaders from effectively serving the people.

So these are injunctions in the vedic literature particularly of course it doesn't mean others can have illicit connection with women no but particularly the sanyasi should never have any forget about illicit sex sanyasi should have no connection with any women at all of any kind and brahmana should not tell lies under any circumstances should never tell lies similarly if the king and the public leader unnecessarily proud or habituated to drinking and smoking certainly they become disqualified to discharge public welfare activities see the public leader in order to influence the people whom they are governing in a positive way they should themselves have a good character that good character means they should not be habituated to drinking or smoking.

**Key Quote:** "Truthfulness is the basic principle of all religions"
**Summary:** The speaker highlights truthfulness as a basic principle of all religions and emphasizes that leaders, both spiritual and material, must be tested by their character and qualifications before being accepted.

If they have such habits then they are disqualified to be in the position of public leader. Now proper says truthfulness is the basic principle of all religions any religious system somebody may follow somebody may claim I'm christian somebody else may claim I'm muslim somebody else may claim I'm hindu whatever be your release affiliation truthfulness is the basic principle everybody has to practice that practice truthfulness. So prabhupada says the four leaders of the human society namely the sannyasis the brahmanas the king and the public leader must be tested crucially by their character and qualification character character is very important what are their qualities by which they are holding that position in society as a brahmana as a king or public leader or as a sannyasi so before one can be accepted as a spiritual or material master of society he must be tested by the above mentioned criteria of character.

So material masters are the public leaders and the spiritual master is one who is guiding in spiritual affairs the society the members of the society so both of them should be actually qualified before they occupy the position of a spiritual leader or a material leader such public leaders may be less qualified in terms of academic qualifications but it is necessary primarily that they be free from the contamination of four disqualifications namely gambling drinking prostitution and will slaughter that means in the society people in general should avoid these four sinful activities gambling drinking prostitution animal slaughter and particularly the profession of wit으s and the spiritual leaders the material leaders and the spiritual leaders should totally avoid these four activities sinful activities then only there will be no corruption in the state and people will be able to live peacefully happily and nicely in such a state but if these four activities are indulged in indulged in by the leaders, then this state is completely corrupt state.

So Kali was given four places in the beginning and since there were no such places wherein Pariksit's kingdom where those four pillars of sinful life Deutham Panam Sriyasuna none of those activities were going on against scriptural injunctions in Pariksit's kingdom. So Kali Purusha asked for a fifth place and Kali Purusha asked for a fifth place and he was given that place where gold is accumulated and kept for sense gratification because wherever there is gold there are these four kinds of activities gold kept for sense gratification these four sinful activities and in addition there will be enmity also.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the verse's relevance to modern times, emphasizing that Parikshit Maharaj cheated Kali by designating specific places and that gold can be used for good or bad.

by encouraging activities. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport what does this mean for present day people we who are living in this Kali Yuga after about five thousand years have passed. What does it mean for us? So Prabhupada says in the purport by designating particular places for the personality of Kali Maharaj Parikshit practically cheated Kali. In the presence of Kali Dharma in the shape of the bull and the earth in the shape of a cow he could actually estimate the general condition of his kingdom and therefore he could take at once proper steps to re-establish the legs of the bull namely austerity, cleanliness and mercy. And for the general benefit of the people of the world he saw that the gold stock might be employed for stabilization. This is a very very important point. He took the steps to re-establish the proper steps to re-establish the legs of the Dharma namely austerity, cleanliness and mercy and he also employed the gold stock that was kept, with all being used for Krishnan service for devotional service he used it for would have been beautiful oro blessing . So this is a very important question. sacral bestowal in the first time. That moment another step in his life the first 不斷保 dij唰анич impostor.

Gold is certainly a generator of falsity, intoxication, prostitution, enmity and violence. But, under the guidance of a proper king or public leader or a Brahmin or Sanyasi, the same gold can be properly utilized to reestablish the lost legs of the bull, the personality of religion. By itself, wealth or gold is not bad. The improper or proper utilization, that matters. How you use that gold is important. If you use it properly, you can use it to maintain or restore the lost legs of Dharma. Or, people may misuse it and further degradation sets in and the Dharma

Maharaj Parikshit, therefore, like his grandfather Arjuna, collected all illicit gold kept for the propensities of Kali and employed it for the purpose of and employed it in the Sankirtan Yajna as per the instruction of the Srimad Bhagavatam. Bhagavatam says, in Kali Yuga, other types of Yajna are not practical. In the Bhagavad Gita and all the scriptures it is said, work should be done as Yajna so that people don't become entangled in this material world. So, there are varieties of Yajna that one may perform, but in Kali Yuga, the most practical and feasible type of Yajna is Sankirtan Yajna. So therefore, Parikshit Maharaj, like his grandfather, Arjuna, he employed all the illicit gold kept for propensities of Kali. Illicit gold means gold that has been accumulated for sense enjoyment that he utilized in Sankirtan Yajna.

**Key Quote:** "Namely, 50% for the service of the Lord. Lord means the Supreme Lord Krishna. 25% for the family members. And 25% for personal necessities."
**Summary:** The speaker shares Prabhupada's recommendation for dividing excess wealth: 50% for Krishna's service, 25% for family, and 25% for personal needs.

And that is a recommendation of the Bhagavatam. As we have suggested before, Prabhupada gave instructions in a previous purport that I read in detail, the 38th verse purport. It is very big. We covered it in three sessions, three parts. And there, one of the recommendations Prabhupada had given that once accumulated wealth may be divided into three parts for distribution. Namely, 50% for the service of the Lord. Lord means the Supreme Lord Krishna. 25% for the family members. And 25% for personal necessities. So, dividing one's wealth. This for whom? Particularly for people who have lot of excess wealth than what is bare minimum required for keeping body and soul together. There are those who live by the principle that, I will only take as much wealth as is necessary for the minimum, bare minimum necessities for maintaining this body while in the material world because my main business will be simply to engage in Krishna consciousness. For such people, there is no need of any such business division to be made because they don't have that for dividing like this but for those who are having excess wealth than what is minimum necessary there is a a way of dividing the wealth into three parts what is that 50% for service of Krishna 25% for the family members

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of using wealth for Sankirtan Yajna as the greatest act of mercy, enabling people to achieve their human mission and return to Godhead.

and 25% for personal necessities now Prabhupada says why 50% for the service of the Lord spending 50% of the service of the Lord or for propagation of spiritual knowledge in society by way of the Sankirtan Yagna is the maximum display of human mercy this is actually a necessity for the human beings in the human society why because people of the world meaning the human being population of human beings are generally in darkness regarding spiritual knowledge especially in regard to the devotional service of the Lord and therefore to propagate the systematic transcendental knowledge of devotional service is the greatest mercy that one can show in this world there's a need especially in Kali Yuga people are in ignorance darkness of ignorance so they do not know when they do not know how to utilize their excess wealth then what is bare minimum required then default will be use it for sense gratification people become sinful and dharma is destroyed then everything is spoiled the human mission is completely lost whereas if 50% of the excess wealth is spent for propagating Sankirtan Yajna then it is the best use of the available excess wealth and also it is the maximum display of mercy on the human society so nobody will go astray from the path of Dharma everybody will utilize this human form of life for its real purpose and everybody will be able to go back to Godhead get out of this material existence so that no more there is any repetition of birth and death I'll stop

**Key Quote:** "The prolonged sacrificial ceremonies undertaken by the sages of Naimisharanya were begun shortly after the demise of Maharaj Pariksit."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the context of the verses, discussing the sacrifice at Naimisharanya, the role of Suta Goswami, and the timing of the events in relation to Maharaj Pariksit's reign.

So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The prolonged sacrificial ceremonies undertaken by the sages of Naimisharanya were begun shortly after the demise of Maharaj Pariksit." You see, there is a very important point: the discussion that is going on, which is being narrated here between Suta Goswami and the sages of Naimisharanya, that they began a thousand year sacrifice towards the end of Dwapar Yuga and beginning of Kali Yuga, that period of time. So, when did it happen? "The prolonged ceremonies undertaken by the sages of Naimisharanya were begun shortly after the demise of Maharaj Pariksit," after the demise of Maharaj Pariksit. So, the question will arise, why is Suta Goswami speaking in the present tense in this verse? He is telling, "Maharaj Pariksit is now ruling the world with great success." Why is he talking in the present tense? So, that will be explained by Srila Prabhupada. "The sacrifice was to continue for one thousand years. And it is understood that in the beginning, some of the contemporaries of Baladev, the elder brother of Lord Krishna, also visited the sacrificial place." There is a description in the Bhagavatam elsewhere that this thousand year sacrifice was begun by the father of Suta Goswami. And this Suta Goswami referred to in the beginning of this Bhagavatam, who is answering the questions by the Sayyiduna Misharanya, is called Ugrashrava Suta. But this thousand year sacrifice was begun by the Sayyiduna Misharanya under the guidance of Ugrashrava Suta's father, whose name was Romaharshana Suta.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Romaharshana Suta's disrespect towards Lord Balaram and the subsequent punishment.

So, Romaharshana Suta was actually, he was reciting the Puranas, because he was the disciple of Vyasa Deva, who was expert in the Puranic literature, the fifth Veda, Puranic literature. So, he was reciting the Puranas when Lord Balaram visited the place, and Romaharshana Suta did not show proper respect to Balaram. And therefore, Balaram actually wanted to teach a lesson to this Romaharshana Suta. And therefore, Balaram actually... Balaram actually took a blade of grass and he just touched it to the throat of Romaharshana Suta. Immediately, Romaharshana Suta, he died on the spot. That means, he was punished for his act of not showing respect to Lord Balaram, who is a supreme personality, if you call it.

**Key Quote:** "And Balaram actually purified him Balaram delivered him of his sinful tendency of his sinful behavior and then Roma Arjuna Sutta's son Ugrasava Sutta was actually instructed by Balaram to take over the father's position in order to continue the sacrifice"
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Balaram purified Romaharshana Suta and instructed his son, Ugrashrava Suta, to continue the sacrifice, then addresses the question of why the present tense is used in the verse.

So this was certainly to be corrected, and Balaram actually purified him. Balaram delivered him of his sinful tendency, of his sinful behavior, and then Roma Arjuna Sutta's son, Ugrasava Sutta, was actually instructed by Balaram to take over the father's position in order to continue the sacrifice and continue to recite the Puranas to the assembled sages of Naimisharanya. So, why is the present tense used? Prabhupada explains here, "According to some authorities, the present tense is also used to indicate the nearest margin of time from the past." What does this mean? In that sense, the present tense is applied to the reign of Maharaj Pariksit here for a continuous fact. Also, present tense can be used. That means the sacrifice was begun when Maharaj Pariksit was ruling, but the sacrifice continued beyond Pariksit's life.

time it continued. So, the sacrifices are continuing. It began when Pariksit was ruling, or even before Pariksit began to rule, and it continues. So, therefore, the present tense has been used. Also, another reason why present tense is used is the principles of Maharaj P surpassed the темперatr can still be continued and human society can still be improved if there is determination by the authorities. We can still purge out from the state all activities of immorality introduced by the personality of Kali if we are determined to take action like Maharaj Pariksit. So, Pariksit's example is being explained. He allotted some place for Kali, but in fact, Kali could not find such places in the world at all because Maharaj Pariksit was strictly vigilant to see that there were no places for gambling, drinking, prostitution, and animal slaughter.

**Summary:** The speaker criticizes modern administrators for their ineffective attempts to combat corruption, highlighting their contradictory policies that promote sinful activities.

Modern administrators want to banish corruption from the state, but fools are the ones who want to banish corruption from the state, but fools as they are, they do not know how to do it. They want to issue licenses for gambling houses, wine and other intoxicating drug houses, brothels, hotel, prostitution, and cinema houses and falsity in every dealing even in their own, and they want at the same time to drive out corruption from the state. So, why present-day so much of all this corruption and increase in sinful activities? That is because the modern administrators, they do not know how to eradicate corruption. Simply for some economic consideration, they see that if love, friendship, and friendship are there, then it is the right thing to do. But to make such an argument for the sake of people's trust, they don't consider it right or wrong. They consider it right for the sake of the public. Because they think that if you are going to do something, then you are going to be treated rudely and they don't consider you a money-maker. If you are going actually bringing in Kali Purusha, the evil influence of Kali into the human society and

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that corruption cannot be eradicated through legislation alone, but requires a society based on the principles of Dharma: austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness.

there is large scale increase of sinful activities. People become completely corrupted. So, Prabhupada says you cannot drive out corruption simply by some vigilance department or some anti-corruption ministry etc. By legislation you cannot drive out alone. Legislation alone is not going to work. You cannot issue licenses for intoxicants, being sold widely at the same time try to drive out corruption. No. So, Prabhupada says this is like they want the kingdom of God without God consciousness. God consciousness means no sinful activities against the principles of Dharma. No sinful activity should be allowed. How can it be done? It is not possible. It is not possible. It is not possible. It is not possible. How can it be possible to adjust to contradictory matters? If we want to drive out corruption from the state, we must first of all organize society to accept the principles of religion namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. And to make the conditions favorable for these four pillars of Dharma, we must close all places of gambling, drinking, prostitution and falsity.

These are some of the practical lessons from the pages of Srimad Bhagavatam. So, the 45th verse is a short verse. I will just read that.

Maharaj Pariksit, the son of Abhimanyu, is so experienced that by dint of his expert administration and patronage, it has been possible for you to perform a sacrifice such as this. So, Suta Goswami is telling, Pariksit's administration is perfect, was perfect. Now, it's in the past tense because the Bhagavatam recitation began after Pariksit's, this second time Bhagavatam recitation began after Pariksit's, this second time began after Pariksit's, this second time the first time it was recited when Pariksit was cursed that we explained in the next chapter in more detail so the Suta Goswami ro sorry uh Ugrashrava Suta heard this Bhagavatam from Shukadeva Goswami when Pariksit heard and now he's reciting this Bhagavatam the way he heard it in the past and therefore Ugrashrava Suta speaking is that this sacrifice thousand year sacrifice was begun when Pariksit Maharaj is ruling and it has been possible to perform this sacrifice because of the wonderful administration of Maharaj Pariksit so I'll stop here thank you

**Summary:** The lecture begins with an introduction to the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on the questions asked by the sages of Naimisharanya about Parikshit Maharaj and Sukadeva Goswami and their connection to Krishna.

In this session we will be discussing from two verses, the first and second verse of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. We are beginning a new chapter in this session. The 18th chapter is entitled Maharaj Pariksit Cursed by a Brahmana Boy. If you remember, this first canto began by the sage Naimisharanya asking six questions. To begin with, this was a print of this discussion from the Ugrashrava Suta, Suta Goswami, and Suta Goswami answered these questions and he saw the Sages are very eager to hear about Krishna. So when he saw the eagerness to hear about Krishna, then he said I am going to recite the Srimad Bhagavatam as I heard it from Sukadeva Goswami, when Sukadeva Goswami is speaking Bhagavatam seven days continuously to Parikshit Maharaj, when Parikshit Maharaj is about to quit his body, cursed by a brahmana body. So before Suta Goswami could begin reciting the Bhagavatam that he heard from Shukadeva Goswami, the sage Brahmishananya had so many more questions: please tell us before you begin reciting Bhagavatam, please tell us about Parikshit Maharaj, please tell us about Shukadeva Goswami, please tell us how did Parikshit Maharaj meet Shukadeva Goswami, how did they meet and we have heard that Parikshit Maharaj's birth activities and even his death is very very glorious, please describe in detail these topics which pertain to Krishna. Krishna means Krishna and his pure devotees. So since Shukadeva Goswami is a pure devotee of Krishna, Parikshit Maharaj is a pure devotee of Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the first verse of the 18th chapter, highlighting Parikshit Maharaj's wonderful administration and his ability to protect his citizens from the influence of Kali, emphasizing his surrender to Krishna.

The first verse of the 18th chapter, Shukadeva Goswami said, "Due to the mercy of the personality of God, Shri Krishna, who acts wonderfully, Maharaj Parikshit, though struck by the weapon of the son of Drona in his mother's womb, could not be so." In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The sages of Naimisharanya became struck with wonder after hearing about the wonderful administration of Maharaj Parikshit, especially in reference to his punishing the personality of Kali and making him completely unable to do any harm within the kingdom." See, Parikshit Maharaj gave shelter to Kali, but who is Kali? He is the friend of irreligion, adharma bandhu. He's got nefarious purpose. So Parikshit Maharaj gave him shelter, at the same time he incapacitated Kali Purusha to do any harm within his kingdom. Parikshit protected his citizens against influence of Kali by taking proper steps. So they were amazed what a great and wonderful personality is Parikshit Maharaj. Suta Goswami is equally anxious to describe Maharaj Parikshit's wonderful birth and death and this verse is stated by Suta Goswami to increase the interest of the sage Naimisharanya that his birth was wonderful, now hear about his death, even that is very very

**Summary:** The speaker explains the second verse, focusing on Parikshit Maharaj's fearlessness due to his surrender to Krishna, contrasting it with the miseries of material existence (birth, death, old age, and disease).

very wonderful. Second verse: brahma kopa utthitaad yastu, brahma kopa utthitaad yastu, brahma kopa utthitaad yastu takshakath phduina prihlavathu nasamuhamoha urubhayat bhagavati arpitashayaha. The meaning of the second verse: furthermore, Maharaj Parikshit was always consciously surrendered to the personality of Godhead and therefore he was neither afraid nor overwhelmed by fear due to a snake bird which was to bite him because he was afraid of him and of the fury of a brahmana boy. Before describing the details of Pariksit being cursed by a brahmana boy for an untimely death due to the curse being bitten by a snake bird, Suta Goswami is telling the sage Nami Sharanya that Pariksit Maharaj was not afraid of death itself, what to speak of fear of death due to a curse being bitten by a snake bird, he had no fear at all. Why? Because he is always surrendered to the personality of Godhead Krishna. So in the purport Srila Prabhupada explains this point. A self-surrendered devotee of the Lord is called Narayana, Narayana, Parayana. One is completely surrendered to the Supreme Lord Narayana and is very much attached to the Lord. Such a person is never afraid of any place or person, not even of death. Only a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord is fearless in this material existence. Otherwise in the material existence there are always these four right components, one is a pure devotee of the Lord and one is a pure devotee of the Lord. So Nami Sharanya is telling us that the pure devotee of the Lord is fearlessness in this material existence. Otherwise in the material existence there are always these four fundamental problems which simply are giving so much of miseries to the living

entities. Janma, Mrtyu, Jara, Vyadi, Dukha, Dosha, Anudarshanam, Krishna warns about this in the 13th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. Material existence means these four fundamental Dukha, Dosha. Dukha means misery and Dosha means defect. So, nobody can avoid these four things. Once they take birth in this material world, they have to face death at a later time. And in between birth and death, there are the miseries of disease and old age. But a person who is completely surrendered to the Supreme Lord, like Maharaj Pariksit, is never afraid of any misery or any person or any situation, not at all. He is fearless. For him, that means for such a surrendered soul, nothing is as important as the Supreme Lord. Thus, he gives equal importance to heaven and hell. Why? How is it possible? That a surrendered devotee of the Supreme Lord, how does he give equal importance to heaven and hell? There is so much difference in the conditions of living in heaven and hell. The reason is, he knows well that both heaven and hell are creations of the Lord. Who is the creator of this material existence? The different planetary systems, the different arrangements, the different facilities. It is Supreme Lord himself. He is the original creator. There are secondary creators, but the original creator is the Supreme Lord. And similarly, life and death are different conditions of existence created by the Lord in this material world.

**Summary:** The importance of remembering Narayana in all circumstances is emphasized, along with the explanation of how Parikshit Maharaj, as a pure devotee, was not afraid of death or the curse because he considered it sent by Narayana.

It is an arrangement of the Supreme Lord that those living entities who are rebellious to devotional service, who are rebellious and who don't want to live with the Supreme Lord in the spiritual kingdom of God, they are placed in material existence and they are placed in situation of life and death, heaven and hell, etc. But in all conditions and in all circumstances in this material world, remembrance of Narayana is essential if at all somebody wants to be fearless, somebody wants protection, somebody wants to avoid suffering from these conditions. What is most essential and what works really ultimately is the remembrance of Narayana. Constant remembrance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana. The Narayana Parayana practices this constantly. A pure devotee like Maharaj Pariksit, he practices remembering Narayana constantly. Maharaj Pariksit was such a pure devotee. He was wrongfully cursed by an inexperienced son of a brahmana. He was wrongfully cursed by an inexperienced son of a brahmana. This son of the brahmana was under the influence of Kali. Therefore, he wrongly cursed Parikshit Maharaj. And details will be described in the later part of this chapter by Suta Goswami. But here Prabhupada is just explaining how Parikshit was not afraid of death or the curse or the bite of this snake bird by which he was supposed to die. He was not afraid of that.

**Summary:** The speaker recounts the story of how Krishna saved Parikshit Maharaj from the Brahmastra in his mother's womb, highlighting Parikshit's understanding that even his death by snake bite would be by the will of the Lord, and how a devotee sees everything as a blessing.

So, Maharaj Parikshit took this curse to be sent by Narayana. How is it possible for Parikshit to consider like this? He knew that Narayana, Lord Krishna had saved him when he was burned in the womb of his mother. How did Parikshit take birth? When he was in the womb of his mother. At the end of the battle of Kurukshetra, this Dronacharya's son Ashwatthama was fighting on the side of the Kauravas and the Kauravas had lost the battle. So, he wanted to somehow take revenge against the Kauravas losing the battle. So, he tried to kill them. He tried to kill the five Pandavas and by mistake he killed the five sons of the five Pandavas, Upapandavas and by beheading them when they were asleep, fast asleep. And this was not at all appreciated by Duryodhana, his master. Duryodhana condemned this heinous act by Ashwatthama. And then Ashwatthama was actually punished by Arjuna, though his life was spared. And then he still was not, was not still giving up the opportunity to do some harm, some destruction for the Pandavas. So, what did he do? He used a Brahmastra to kill the only surviving descendant of the Pandavas who was Maharaj Parikshit, in the womb of his mother, the grandson of Arjuna, in the womb of his mother, Abhimanyu's wife, Arjuna's daughter-in-law. So, he tried to kill Parikshit in the womb of his mother. But Parikshit was saved by Krishna when this danger was there. So, Parikshit knew that he was saved by the Supreme Lord Narayana or Lord Krishna when he was in the womb of his mother. And similarly, if he were to be killed by a snake bite, it would also take place by the will of the Lord. So, the devotee never goes against the will of the Lord. Anything sent by God is a blessing for the devotee.

So, devotee is completely surrendered to the Lord. His life is in the hands of the Lord. Nobody else can do anything without the Lord's sanction in the material world. Therefore, Maharaj Parikshit was neither afraid nor bewildered by such things as a curse or bite of a snake bird or death itself. That is the sign of a pure devotee of the Lord.

And in this way, he is actually indifferent to all material situations and circumstances. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 11th verse of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining that hearing about Krishna's activities is like nectar for mortal beings, offering a path to immortality.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 11th verse of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This chapter is entitled Maharaj Pariksit Cursed by a Brahmana Boy. In the beginning of this chapter, there are descriptions of events leading to that particular incident. The 11th verse is as follows: Suta Jeevasamah Saumya Shashwative NFiSth Travisa Vishedam Yashah Astvam Shamsasie Krishnasya Martheanam Amrutham He Nahab. Meaning of this verse: The good sages said, Oh, grave Suther has Swami, may you live many years and have eternal fame, for you are speaking very nicely about the activities of Lord Krishna, the personality of Godhead. This is just like nectar for mortal beings like us. Martyanam Amrutam Hinaha.

**Key Quote:** "It will guarantee eternal life for whoever hears them."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the meaning of 'Martya' (place of death) and 'Amrutam' (nectar), emphasizing that hearing narrations about Krishna guarantees eternal life.

Everyone in this earth planet is called Martya. Martya means this place is a place of death. Mrutyu, from Mrutyu the word Martya comes. That does not mean that people living on other planets don't die. But here particularly, the death can be perceived or can be perceived as a place of death. It can be understood as one of the fundamental problems that plague our material existence. And for somebody who is certainly going to die, the nectar, Amrutam, Amrutam means just the opposite of death, that which helps one counteract death, that which gives eternal life, Amrutam. So, this narration about Krishna is just like Amrutam. It's like drinking nectar. It will guarantee eternal life for whoever hears them.

**Summary:** The speaker describes how the sages of Naimisharanya praised Suta Goswami for speaking about Krishna, enabling them to conquer death through hearing the nectarian narration.

So, therefore, the description here is given. The sages of Naimisharanya, who assembled for a long sacrifice, they are hearing Srimad Bhagavatam from Suta Goswami. So, Suta Goswami is speaking so nicely that they are perceiving this narration about Krishna as very, very pleasing to the ears. And it also guarantees eternal life. So, therefore, they are addressing Suta Goswami and telling, may you live many years and have eternal fame. Eternal fame because Suta Goswami's action, or Suta Goswami's act, is very, very glorious. Simply by speaking about Krishna, Suta Goswami is giving an opportunity for all those assembled sages to hear this nectarian narration and thereby conquer death, which is otherwise impossible. So, Aushriya Prabhupada explains in the purport.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna has two kinds of energies that are working in this world, the material energy and the spiritual energy."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada and Bhagavad Gita, explaining the difference between Krishna's transcendental activities performed under spiritual energy and the conditioned souls' actions under material energy, which causes bondage.

Aushriya Prabhupada explains in the purport, Why do we hear about the transcendental qualities and activities of the personality of Godhead? We may always remember what has been spoken by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad Gita, Fourth Chapter, Ninth Verse of the Bhagavad Gita. What does the Lord say? His acts, even when He acts in human society, are all transcendental, for they are all accentuated by the spiritual energy of the Lord, which is distinguished from its material energy. Krishna has two kinds of energies that are working in this world, the material energy and the spiritual energy. So the spiritual energy is the energy by which Krishna and his pure devotees, they act under that spiritual energy. And we in the material world, the conditioned souls, we are acting under the material energy. Material energy is the cause of bondage. Contaminated by the three gunas, the three modes of material nature, whereas spiritual energy is pure, it is completely spiritual and it is free from any influence of the gunas.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna's actions karma called as karma in this verse and janma Krishna's birth are completely transcendental this means that Krishna does not act or take his birth like an ordinary living being under the custody of material energy"
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain that Krishna's birth and activities are transcendental, unlike ordinary beings who are under the control of material energy and possess changeable, material bodies.

So there is a very, very big difference between spiritual energy and material energy. Krishna's actions are always transcendental because they are always performed under the spiritual energy. So Srila Prabhupada further says, as stated in the Bhagavad Gita, such acts are called divyam. The verse is janma karma chame divyam, transcendent, all are transcendental. Krishna's actions, karma, called as karma in this verse, and janma, Krishna's birth, are completely transcendental. This means that Krishna does not act or take his birth like an ordinary living being under the custody of material energy. We all take birth under the material energy, so we get a material body, we have a material mind, we have material ego. All these are covering our real self, that is the spirit soul, and we are covered by these material coverings. When Krishna appears or Krishna takes birth in the material world, like he did five thousand years back, he does not take birth like an ordinary living being, nor is his body material or changeable like that of ordinary living beings. Our body is always material. When we take birth in this world, we take a material body, we accept the material body. Krishna's body is not material. Now, material body has got a characteristic that it is constantly changing. Body is changing from childhood to old age, and the body changes even at the time of death. So we are subject to this changeable body.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Such a person is not reborn after leaving the present material body."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that understanding Krishna's transcendental nature leads to liberation from rebirth and admittance into the spiritual realm, where one can engage in loving devotional service.

Now, if somebody understands this fact that Krishna's body is completely transcendental and even Krishna's activities are completely spiritual, then such a person, when he understands this particular fact about Krishna either from the Lord or from authorized sources, directly one may hear from Krishna or one may hear from a representative of Krishna coming in parampara who is a pure devotee, then what happens? Such a person is not reborn after leaving the present material body. Punar janma naiti, Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita. Such an enlightened soul is admitted into the spiritual realm of the Lord and engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. So the destination after death is dependent on what kind of activities we perform while we are in this body in the present life. If we hear about Krishna and we become enlightened about his transcendental nature, then we are eligible to go to the personal abode of the supreme Lord after quitting this body at the time of death, and there we can engage in loving devotional service to Krishna. So that's the perfection of life, that is the highest perfection, and that is possible simply by hearing Krishna katha from the right source.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Simply by dedicating oneself to hearing about Krishna from the proper from a true representative of Shukudev Goswami, or a true representative of Krishna himself, then we definitely make progress."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of hearing about Krishna from authentic scriptures like Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam, and from true representatives, to make progress on the path back to Godhead.

So Srila Prabhupada says, therefore, the more we hear about the transcendental activities of the Lord as they are stated in the Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam... See, where do you find such descriptions of the transcendental activities of the Lord? You can find it accurately described in the authentic original scriptures. So in the Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam, two most important scriptures, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu teaches us there are so many varieties of Vedic literature, innumerable, but among all of them, two particular literatures are singled out by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. He says, you just focus and concentrate and study or hear or discuss subject matter presented in two books: Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam. So we should hear about the transcendental activities of Krishna from the Bhagavad Gita and from the Srimad Bhagavatam. What happens for somebody who hears that? The more we hear, the more we can know about his transcendental nature. To understand the transcendental nature of Krishna is a little difficult if we consider the fact that we are used to hearing about the material activities of people in this world, but to hear about Krishna, Krishna's transcendental activities, means we are making definite progress on the path back to Godhead. So this is a fact that simply by dedicating oneself to hearing about Krishna from the proper, from a true representative of Shukadev Goswami, or a true representative of Krishna himself, then we definitely make progress. And by making such progress, we actually go back to Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "You chant Hare Krishna, and you hear Bhagavatam every day."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by recommending chanting Hare Krishna and hearing Bhagavatam regularly, as suggested by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, to attain eternal life and reach Krishna's personal abode.

So, the recommendation by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is particularly available, that he says, you chant Hare Krishna, and you hear Bhagavatam every day. The Bhagavatam itself recommends, Nityam Bhagavata Sevaya, always render service to Bhagavatas, two kinds of Bhagavatas, the book Bhagavatam, and the devotee Bhagavatam, the pure devotees particularly. So, we should actually hear Bhagavatam regularly, or read Bhagavatam regularly, and that will guarantee us eternal life after quitting this body, because we simply become eligible to go to Krishna's personal abode if our consciousness is properly situated at the time of death, and such preparation of consciousness is possible by simply chanting Hare Krishna, hearing Bhagavatam daily, etc. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam 1.18.12, explaining that the sages of Naimisharanya are glorifying Suta Goswami for distributing the nectar of the lotus feet of Govinda.

Om Ajnana Timiraandhasya Gyananjanishalakaya Chakshurunmilitam Jena Dasmai Shri Gurave Namaha Nama Om Vishnupadaya Krishna Preshtaya Bhutale Shri Mate Bhaktivedanta Swamin Nithinamine Namaste Saraswate Deve Gauravani Pracharine Nirvishesha Shunyavadi Pashchatya Deshatarine Jaya Shri Krishna Chaitanya Prabhu Nithyananda Shri Advaita Gadadhara Shiva Sadhigaura Bhakta Vrinda Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet In this session, we will be discussing from the 12th verse of the 18th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Karmani Asmin Anashvase Dhooma Dhoomratmanam Bhavan Apayayati Govinda Pada Padmasavam Madhu The meaning of this verse is, "We have just begun the performance of this fruited, seductive activity, a sacrificial fire, without certainty of its result due to the many imperfections in our action. Our bodies have become black from the smoke, but we are factually pleased by the nectar of the lotus feet of the personative Godhead Govinda, which you are distributing."

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Fruitive activity means doing an activity the result of which we are doing an activity which is some type of material benefit or material enjoyment."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts fruitive activities, which aim for material benefits, with activities that lead to spiritual progress, emphasizing that fruitive sacrifices in this age are prone to imperfections and may not yield spiritual results.

So these are words spoken by the sages of Naimisharanya to the people of Godhead. They are glorifying Suta Goswami. You are distributing nectar of the lotus feet of Govinda, the Supreme Lord, and that is very pleasing to us. But as far as our own fruitive activity is concerned, what is the meaning of fruitive activity? Fruitive activity means doing an activity, the result of which... we are doing an activity, and the result of which we are doing an activity which is some type of material benefit or material enjoyment. That specifically, it's a technical term Prabhupada uses, fruitive activity. So this sacrificial fire they had lit up and they had begun a thousand year sacrifice, there was no certainty of its result because such a sacrifice is prone to be imperfect, especially in this age of Kali. So Srila Prabhupada will explain in the purport what are the imperfections of such a sacrifice being performed in this age of Kali. And the result of such a sacrifice is that one will get some material benefit or material pleasure, but one does not make any spiritual progress simply by performing such fruitive activities for millions and billions of lifetimes, nothing spiritual ever happens. So there's a distinct difference between such a sacrifice and such a sacrifice.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that sacrifices performed in Kali Yuga are often flawed due to the scarcity of qualified Brahmanas and that any discrepancy can spoil the entire sacrifice, making the results uncertain.

this material activities and devotional service. So Prabhupada explains in the purport, "The sacrificial fire kindled by the sages of Naimisha Aranya was certainly full of smoke and doubts because of so many flaws." Flaws means defects. The first flaw is that there is an acute scarcity of expert brahmanas able to carry out such performances successfully in this age of Kali. Kali Yuga, there is an acute scarcity, that means very, very, very difficult to find qualified brahmanas who can properly perform such fruitive activity, who can properly perform on the behalf of the yajaman. Just like you don't know how to perform such a sacrifice, then you can get a qualified Brahmana to do it on your behalf or guide you to perform it, but there is an acute scarcity of such brahmanas in this age of Kali. Kali Yuga, there is an acute scarcity of such brahmanas in this age of Kali Yuga, there is an acute scarcity of such brahmanas in this age of... not at all easy to find a qualified brahmana who can properly perform such sacrifices. Srila Prabhupada further explains, "Any discrepancy in such sacrifices spoils the whole show." Somewhere there is some discrepancy, some defect, some mistake, some shortcoming, then the whole sacrifice is spoilt and the result is uncertain, no guarantee of result. Even if somebody performs this sacrifice very meticulously, correctly, there is no guarantee of result. And Prabhupada compares it to agricultural enterprises, this is like agricultural enterprises, hmm.

**Key Quote:** "Performance of any kind of sacrifice in this age of Kali is also uncertain."
**Summary:** The speaker draws an analogy between agricultural enterprises dependent on rain and sacrifices in Kali Yuga, highlighting the uncertainty of results due to factors beyond human control, particularly the lack of qualified Brahmanas.

hmm hmm what is this comparison that is being done here? What is the relevance? Prabhupada says, "The good result of tilling the paddy field depends on providential rain." They till the paddy field and try to sow this paddy seeds to get rice, but the uncertainty is that there may be no rain. In spite of the farmer of farmers preparing that ground, there may be no rain, hmm. So rain is not under our control, rain is controlled by higher arrangement, hmm. So just like we don't have control over rain, so therefore our agriculture enterprise may be successful or not? May be successful or may be unsuccessful. If there is no rain it is unsuccessful, and rain is just one of the factors, there are many other factors also, but this uncertainty is certainly there, hmm. Similarly, performance of any kind of sacrifice in this age of Kali is also uncertain.

**Key Quote:** "In Kali Yuga it is particularly recommended that one should perform only one type of Yajna. What is that? The Sankirtan Yajna."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that in Kali Yuga, the recommended sacrifice is Sankirtan Yajna, the congregational chanting of the holy name, due to the scarcity of qualified Brahmanas and the ineffectiveness of fruitive sacrifices.

Why? The primary reason is there is no qualified Brahmin, hmm. Unscrupulous, greedy Brahmin, there is no qualified Brahmin, hence the brahmanas of the age of Kali induce the innocent public to such uncertain sacrificial shows without disclosing the scriptural injunction that in the age of Kali there is no fruitful sacrificial performance, but the sacrifice of the congregational chanting of the holy name of the Lord. What does this mean? There are greedy Brahmin who want to make money from people. They don't tell the truth that you should not do any fruitive activities, you should not do any Karmakanda sacrifices. That they don't say. But the fact is, even if they don't say that, if somebody engages a Brahmana who is not perfect in performing such sacrifices, then there is zero spiritual benefit. That is one thing. And even material benefit is uncertain. Not too sure whether you will get material success or not. So therefore, the explanation by Prabhupada that in Kali Yuga it is particularly recommended that one should perform only one type of Yajna. What is that? The Sankirtan Yajna. And this Sankirtan Yajna primarily is

**Summary:** The speaker compares the experience of devotional service to the satisfaction of eating when hungry, emphasizing that the results of hearing Krishna Katha are directly and practically perceived, leading to spiritual realization through Sankirtan Yajna.

Now Srila Prabhupada says, "One can feel this practically as one can feel the result of eating food." This example is given, 11th canto of the Bhagavatam. How do you experience the effect of or the result of performing devotional service? It is exactly like Bhagavatam says, "When you're very hungry, if you eat a nice nutritious, well-prepared, very tasty, nice food, then as you go on eating with every morsel..." morsel means this much, keep on eating, you experience three things. You experience mitigation of hunger, your hunger will subside, you experience you are getting more and more strength, and you also experience the pleasure of eating, you relish the taste of that food. So three things happen simultaneously. You nobody need tell you that you are actually, your hunger is getting mitigated, it is your personal experience, practically we experience that every day. So like that even bhakti is as directly experienced as simple things as eating. So anyone who hears Krishna Katha from the right source, they immediately are able to perceive this result of hearing Krishna Katha. And Srila Prabhupada says, "Spiritual realization acts in that way." That's the way of spiritualization in this age of Kali, Sankirtan Yagnam. And the results are practically perceived by anyone who sincerely engages

But when they were hearing from Suta Goswami, they became very happy that Suta Goswami is speaking so nicely, we are feeling the difference in hearing some mundane ordinary stuff and hearing this Krishna Katha. So definitely the sages of Naimisharanya were fortunate to meet Suta Goswami and hear from Suta Goswami, the Srimad Bhagavatam.

This is a very famous verse in the Bhagavatam. It's quoted many times later on in the Bhagavatam itself and even quoted by Srila Prabhupada on many different instances. So the meaning of this verse is: the value of a moment's association with the devotee of the Lord cannot even be compared to the attainment of heavenly planets, or liberation from matter. And what to speak of worldly benedictions in the form of material prosperity, which are for those who are meant for death.

#### value of time, association with devotees, fruitive activities, liberation

**Key Quote:** "You cannot compare the immense benefit you get by moments association with a pure devotee you cannot compare that with the benefit of performing so many fructive activities to elevate oneself to heavenly planets or so many more fructive activities to actually get different kinds of material riches material benefits or even some kind of fructive activity for getting liberation from material bondage"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the verse, explaining that even a fraction of a second spent in the association of a pure devotee is more valuable than any material gain or impersonal liberation.

This is a very important verse, and it is helping us understand that we don't understand the future. What is the value of associating with a pure devotee, even for a very, very short time? Here, the Sanskrit word is lava. Lavena means lava is a measurement of a duration of time which is a fraction of a second. It's actually a moment, a very, very, very, very small bit of time. Even that, if somebody is able to properly associate with a sadhu, a pure devotee, for even a short time, that is very, very, very, very, very, very, very valuable. And how valuable? This verse is being spoken by the sages from the mission, and they are telling you, you cannot compare the immense benefit you get by a moment's association with a pure devotee. You cannot compare that with the benefit of performing so many fruitive activities to elevate oneself to heavenly planets, or so many more fruitive activities to actually get different kinds of material riches, material benefits, or even some kind of fruitive activity for getting liberation from material bondage, impersonal liberation. None of these are actually worthwhile for a person who's about to die, who is subject to death in this material world.

**Key Quote:** "One cannot compare the association of a pure devotee to anything material...the result of either of these is material happiness and the result of association with pure devotee is transcendental pleasure"
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada's purport, contrasting material happiness derived from fruitive activities and impersonal liberation with the transcendental pleasure gained from associating with pure devotees.

None of these are really beneficial. Why? Because Prabhupada explains in the purport. The purport of Prabhupada says, when there are some similar points, it is possible to compare one thing to another. You'll see the difference between the two. One cannot compare the association of a pure devotee to anything material. Men who are addicted to material happiness aspire to reach the heavenly planets like the moon, Venus, and Indra Loka. And those who are advanced in material philosophical speculations aspire after liberation from all material bondage. Broadly speaking, those who are non-devotees, their attempts at any other form of divine ultimate in the immo أفeki living man, everybody is in his own way of life, taking labor, all kind of pious activities which help one to go to the heavenly plans to take birth in heavenly pleasures. And the second group of activities are those by which one can get liberation from all material bondage. Here, liberation specifically refers to impersonal liberation, merging into Brahman. So both of these are actually, both these kinds of results are considered material benefits, material result, and this cannot be compared to association with a pure devotee because the result of either of these is material happiness.

**Key Quote:** "The pure devotees of the Lord do not aspire after the happiness obtained in heavenly kingdom nor do they aspire after the liberation from material bondage pure devotees don't want this"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that pure devotees do not desire material enjoyment or impersonal liberation, as they find the pleasures of heavenly planets to be illusory and mundane.

And the result of association with a pure devotee is transcendental pleasure. So Srila Prabhupada says, when one becomes frustrated with all kinds of material advancement, one desires the opposite type of liberation, which is called a punar bhava, or no rebirth. One category of people are trying to enjoy, enjoy, enjoy, enjoying this material world, but the result of association with a pure devotee is transcendental pleasure. So Srila Prabhupada says one category of people are trying to enjoy, enjoy, enjoy in this material world, but when they realize actually we cannot enjoy in this material world, really real pleasure is not there, we have happiness not, then they try opposite. What is that? They try to avoid taking birth again. And how do they avoid taking birth again? By merging into the existence of the Supreme Lord, called the merging into Brahma Jyoti. But the pure devotees of the Lord do not aspire after the happiness obtained in heavenly kingdom, nor do they aspire after the liberation from material bondage. Pure devotees don't want this. Why? For the pure devotees of the Lord, the material pleasures obtainable in the heavenly parents are like phantasma Gorya. What is phantasma Gorya? It is something like some imaginary pleasure, some utopian ideal, like too much of promise, oh it's very nice, but actually experience that you find what, there is no real, not so much of happiness that I was

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that pure devotees are already liberated through devotional service, even while living in the material world, and are engaged in a transcendental existence.

I was thinking I will get. It is the same mundane pleasure available anywhere else in any other material situation, near the material facility, the same type of flickering momentary happiness. So heavenly pleasures are also the same quality. And the devotees, they are already, by devotional service, pure devotional service, they're already liberated from all material conceptions of pleasure and distress. They are liberated even while living in the material world. The pure devotees, they're already liberated, so why will they seek liberation? Why they want liberation? They're already liberated.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Devotional service is eternal...All these positions are finished with the body. When death comes, finished, over."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the eternal nature of devotional service with the temporary nature of material achievements, such as kingship or residence in heavenly planets, which end with the death of the body.

That means the pure devotees of the Lord are engaged in a transcendental existence, namely in the loving service of the Supreme Lord, both in the material world and in the spiritual world. This is a secret that many people do not know. A pure devotee's activities appear like ordinary activities of a materialistic person, but actually, a pure devotee's actions are all completely spiritual. And a pure devotee is only engaged in loving devotional service to Krishna, even while he is in the material world. So Prabhupada compares this pure devotee's activity with an example. As a garment servant is always the same, either in the office or at home, or at any place, so a devotee has nothing to do with that. He has nothing to do with anything material, for he is exclusively engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. Since he has nothing to do with anything material, what pleasure can he derive from material benedictions like kingship or other overlordships, which are finished quickly with the end of the body? Why will a pure devotee aspire for becoming a king, becoming an emperor, becoming a resident of heavenly planets, becoming even the king of heaven? Because all these positions are finished with the body. When death comes, finished, over.

**Key Quote:** "All material pleasures have a beginning and end. Spiritual happiness, no beginning, no end."
**Summary:** The speaker reinforces the concept of the eternality of pure devotional service and the continuous, unbroken happiness experienced by those engaged in it, contrasting it with the temporary nature of material pleasures.

The positions are all temporal. Devotional service is eternal. This is a very, very important point. Pure devotional service, of course devotional service here means pure devotional service, it is eternal. That means there is no end. There is no stoppage. It has no end because it is spiritual. Anything spiritual has no end. Everything material has got an end. This Krishna describes in Bhagavad Gita: Adi antavanta kaunteya na teshu ramate buddhaha. All material pleasures have a beginning and end. Spiritual happiness, no beginning, no end. No beginning especially for those who are always engaged in transcendental loving service with the Lord. They are always happy, and their happiness continues without any break. They are always jolly.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "For eternal life, they are useless."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Suta Goswami speaking to the sages of Naimisharanya to illustrate that fruitive activities and Vedic study are useless for attaining eternal life compared to hearing and reciting the Bhagavatam.

They are always happy. Therefore, since the assets of a pure devotee are completely different from material assets, there is no comparison between the two. Suta Goswami was a pure devotee of the Lord. Suta Goswami is sitting and speaking Srimad Bhagavatam, the sage of Naimisharanaya. He was a pure devotee of the Lord, and therefore his association with the rishis in Naimisharanaya, the sage of Naimisharanaya is unique. So many. And the sages of Naimisharanaya are very highly qualified brahmanas. They know so much about different kinds of fruitive activities, different kinds of sacrifices, different kinds of study of the spiritual literature, Vedic literature. But none of them are useful for eternal life. They are useless. For eternal life, they are useless. Whereas, Suta Goswami, he is not going to narrate or describe any of those type of descriptions, how to do some material fruitive activity, how to attain impersonal liberation, none of those things.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Simply get association of a pure devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the negative effects of material entanglement and sense gratification with the positive benefits of Bhagavata Sangam, or association with the Lord's name, form, qualities, activities, and pure devotees.

He simply is reciting the Bhagavatam. In the material world, association with gross materialists is veritably condemned. So the materialist is called Yoshitsangi, or one who is very much attached to material entanglement. Materialists are like that. They are always after material pleasures, and they become entangled. What is this material entanglement? Women and other paraphernalia, they are always looking for sense gratification. So they want sense objects. Here, women means the object of enjoyment in terms of the opposite gender. For a man it is a woman, for a woman it is a man. Sex pleasure. And connected with sex pleasure, there are so many other pleasures: pleasure of eating, pleasure of sleeping, pleasure of enjoying different kinds of sense objects, all those kind of things. Such attachment is conditioned because it drives away the benedictions of life and prosperity. One becomes entangled means one is subject to a repetition of birth and death, because in one body, none of these types of enjoyments can all be experienced. So opposite of this Yoshitsanga is Bhagavata Sangam. Sorry, Bhagavata Sangam. One who is always in the association of Lord's, Supreme Lord's name, form, qualities, activities, pure devotees, etc. Such association is always desirable. Bhagavata Sangam. It is worshipable, it is praiseworthy, and one may accept it as the highest goal of life.

Simply get association of a pure devotee. And that's what exactly Prabhupada is doing by giving us this Bhagavatam, by speaking. And all those speeches are recorded and they are available now. Prabhupada's singing Kirtan, Prabhupada's speaking Bhagavatam, Prabhupada's explanations of the devotional literatures, everything is available simply here, Prabhupada speaking.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's topics are so relishable that you go on hearing and you never become saturated."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam 1.18.14, emphasizing the inexhaustible nature of Krishna's topics and the unending satisfaction derived from hearing about Him.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 14th verse of the 18th chapter, the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Konama Tripyet Rasavit Kathayam Mahattamayikanta Parayanasya Nantam Gunanam Agunasya Jagmahu Yogeshwaraye Bhavapadma Mukhyaha. The meaning of this verse is, the Personality of God, the Personality of God and Lord Krishna, Govinda, is the exclusive shelter for all great living beings, and his transcendental attributes cannot even be measured by such masters of mystic powers as Lord Shiva and Lord Brahma. Can anyone who is expert in relishing nectar or rasa ever be fully satiated by hearing topics about him? This is spoken by the sages of Naimisha Araniyata Sutakoswami. Shri Krishna's disciples always tell us that Krishna's topics are so relishable that you go on hearing and you never become saturated. That means you never feel enough. I can't take anymore, I can't relish anymore.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts material experiences, which lead to saturation, with the unending satisfaction derived from chanting the Hare Krishna mantra and hearing about Krishna.

No! It never happens. We have material experience. Anything which is very nice to eat or drink or anything which is light to the soul, meaning extremely goodigmatism, is nice to hear. Some material music, if it is very pleasing to hear the first time, then you may want to hear a second time. You hear a second time, then you may say, 'Oh, it's nice, I want to hear a third time.' How many times can you keep on hearing the same thing again and again and again? You cannot hear too many times. At a certain point, it becomes boring. You cannot hear any, it becomes saturated. The Hare Krishna mantra, on the other hand, devotees have been chanting for 10 years, 20 years, some devotees for 30 years. I've been chanting for 32 years. There are devotees who have been chanting for 50 years, 40 years. They never get saturated or satiated, they never get bored. So what is it about the Hare Krishna mantra that we go on singing, we go on hearing, we go on chanting, and we don't get bored or we don't get saturated? There is something about it which is different from all material songs, material...

Krishna's qualities are unlimited, wonderful qualities, all of them are wonderful qualities. Krishna has no tinge of any bad quality, only good qualities, and those qualities are innumerable. So if somebody tries to count how many good qualities Krishna has, even the masters of mystic powers like Shiva and Brahma, the topmost among the devatas, the topmost among all the personalities created in this world, Brahma and Shiva, they also cannot measure how many wonderful qualities Krishna has got. So Krishna is so full with so many...

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Lord Shiva drinking the ocean of poison to illustrate his immense mystic power, as an example of the powers that even great demigods possess.

wonderful qualities that he attracts everybody. This has been discussed when you discuss the atmanama verse in an earlier chapter. So Prabhupada explains in the purport, Lord Shiva and Lord Bhrama are two chiefs of the demigods. They are full of mystic powers. Among all the created beings who have mystic powers in this universe, the topmost personalities that possess maximum mystic powers are Shiva and Brahma. For example, the example is given by Prabhupada, Lord Shiva drank an ocean of poison, of which one drop was sufficient to kill an ordinary living being. Once the Devatas and the Asuras, they engaged in churning the milk ocean to generate nectar, but before the nectar was generated, some impurities were cleansed away, and those impurities took the form of poison which came out of the churning in the beginning of the churning. So that poison is a deadly poison, and it was unbearable for both the Devatas and the Asuras. So what to do with this poison now? So they requested Lord Shiva, 'Do something.' Shiva said, 'I don't know what to do with this poison now.' So they requested Lord Shiva, 'Do something.' Shiva said, 'Don't worry,' he just took the whole quantity of poison and just condensed it into one sip in his hand, and he just drank it off. Drank means he, he took it inside his mouth and held it in his throat. So therefore he got the name Neelakanta after he drank that poison, and he is holding that poison in his throat. He got the name Neelakanta, and his throat became bluish. So that is because he is holding that poison there in his throat, and it's a deadly poison, halahala, it's a deadly poison. So that is the mystic power of Shiva. Nobody can imitate Shiva, nobody can do that, holding the deadly poison in the throat without being...

Brahma, he is the secondary creator of this entire cosmic manifestation, that is the Maha Shiva station of this whole universe, but Brahma, he gives specifically the bodies for the living entities at the beginning of creation. So Brahma created all the powerful devatas, including Lord Shiva. So that is Brahma's mystic power, he can create big, big, big, big devatas, the most powerful devatas he can create. So they are Ishwaras, they are Lords of the universe, Brahma and Shiva particularly, two among the created beings. Two, of course, above them is Vishnu. Vishnu is not a created being, therefore among created beings, the topmost two personalities are Vishnu and Brahma. Brahma and Shiva, but they are not the supreme powerful, it is very important. Brahma and Shiva are not the supreme powerful. The supreme powerful is Govinda or Lord Krishna. He is the transcendence, and his transcendental attributes cannot be measured even by such powerful Ishwaras as Shiva and Brahma. Therefore, Lord Krishna is the exclusive shelter of the greatest...

Lord Krishna, Brahma is counted amongst the living beings, but is the greatest of all of us. Brahma is counted amongst the living beings, but he is the greatest of all of us. Why? He's the, is the greatest among all created living beings in this universe. Why? Is he attached to transcendental Krishna Gatha? Because Krishna is the reservoir of all pleasures. Enjoyment in this world, nobody can give as much enjoyment as discussing or hearing or remembering or talking about the pastimes of Krishna, which give so much transcendental happiness. Everyone wants to release some kind of taste in everything, but one who is engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord can derive unlimited pleasure from such engagement. There are different kinds of activities people perform for getting some happiness, but the quantity of happiness available in any material activity is very, very less, and the quantity of happiness available in spiritual activities is unlimited. Why? Because the Lord is unlimited, his name, his attributes, his pastimes, his obligations, and his... are all very limited, and there are many more to be told in our life for being in this universe. So let us look at this when you entourage his variegatedness are all unlimited. Now, those who learn how to relish any of these Lord's holy name, or Lord's spiritual activities, or the Lord's spiritual qualities, if they learn to relish, then whoever relishes actually can relish unlimitedly.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by highlighting the eagerness of both Suta Goswami to speak and the sages of Naimisaranya to hear about Krishna, creating a perfect environment for spiritual discourse.

this Suta Goswami, knowing this fact, he desired to continue the topics of Lord Krishna before the series name is Aranya, and the sages of name is Aranya also, they wholeheartedly agreed for this proposal. If you remember, in the end of the third chapter, the first canto, Suta Goswami completed answering six questions the sage Vamisharanya asked in the beginning of this Bhagavatam, and after finishing, he did not say, 'Now whatever you asked, I've answered, that's it, over, finished.' No, he completed answering, and he himself said, Suta Goswami said, 'Seeing your eagerness to hear about Krishna, I am now going to narrate to you the Srimad Bhagavatam which I heard from Shukadeva Goswami when Shukadeva Goswami is speaking to Parikshitmar.' So Suta Goswami is ready to recite, but what about the sages? Do they want to hear? Yes, they are telling, 'Kindly speak more, more and more and more, we are never saturated by hearing, there is no boredom, there is no satiation, so kindly go on speaking.' So both are like, Suta Goswami is eager to speak, and the sages are eager to hear. So this is the perfect ideal combination. I'll stop here, thank you very much.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The speaker should be a pure devotee of Krishna. The hearers should be eager to hear about Krishna only."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of a qualified speaker (a pure devotee of Krishna) and a qualified audience (eager to hear about Krishna) for a truly beneficial Krishna-katha discourse.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 15th verse of the 18th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. तन्नो भवान्वै भगवत प्रधानो, महत्तमै कान्त परायनस्य, हरेर उदारं चरितं विशुद्धं, शुष्रू शताम् नो वितनो तु विद्वन। The meaning of this verse is, O Suta Goswami, you are a learned and pure devotee of the Lord, because the personality of Godhead is your chief object of service. Therefore, please describe to us the pastimes of the Lord, which are above all material conception, for we are anxious to receive such messages. The Sages of Manipur Taimisharanya are speaking to Suta Goswami. Suta Goswami has narrated how Pariksit Maharaj received the age of Kali, he punished and rewarded both, and now the events leading to Pariksit Maharaj meeting Sukadeva Goswami will be described, but before that, the discussion is centred around the topics for discussion. What kind of topics? Not merely some history, but specifically topics connected with the supreme personality of Godhead, Krishna. So, Krishna-katha is the important topic for discussion point here. So, Shri La Prabhupada says in the purport, the speaker on the transcendental activities of the Lord should have only one object of worship and service, Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So, it's very important from whom we hear. If at all we engage in hearing about Krishna Katha, then from whom do we hear? Who is the speaker? It's very important. So, here Shri La Prabhupada is telling the speaker on the transcendental activities of the Lord, what kind of person should he be? He should be a person who has only one object of worship and service. That only object is Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That means, such a person should be a pure devotee of Krishna. That is the intended meaning here. And the audience for such topics should be anxious to hear about him. Him refers to Krishna. The speaker and the hearers. The speaker should be a pure devotee of Krishna. The hearers should be eager to hear about Krishna only. So, only when such a combination is possible, namely, a qualified speaker and a qualified audience, it is then and there very much congenial to continue discourses on the transcendence. Subject matter of Krishna is not exactly relishable if the speaker is not a pure devotee and the audience is not exactly eager to hear about Krishna Katha.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts pure devotees with professional speakers who have material intentions and a materially absorbed audience, highlighting that such discourses do not serve the true purpose of hearing Bhagavatam.

Both the speaker and the hearers should be qualified, that is being said here. Now there is, there are other kinds of speakers other than a pure devotee speaker. What are they called? They are called professional speakers. So Srila Prabhupada writes about these professional speakers because this is elaborately explained in Chaitanya Charitamrita. So what does Prabhupada say here? Professional speakers and a materially absorbed audience cannot derive real benefit from such discourses. So who are these professional speakers? Professional speakers have got a material intention, material benefit in their mind because of which they engage in speaking. So for them it is a means of earning money. Speaking on Bhagavatam is yet another means of earning money. There are so many ways people earn money in this world, but speaking Bhagavatam also has become in recent times a way of earning money. So such a speaker is called a professional speaker. And the audience, if they are materially engrossed, then their purpose of hearing Bhagavatam is not at all the purpose for which one should actually hear Bhagavatam. Just like the sage Naimisharanya, their purpose of hearing Bhagavatam is exclusively hearing about Krishna. They are very eager to hear about Krishna. This is noted by Suta Goswami right in the beginning of the Bhagavatam itself in the first canto. Suta Goswami said, I am noticing that all of you are very eager to hear about Krishna.

#### Suta Goswami, Sage Naimisharanya, Shukadeva Goswami, Pariksit Maharaj, Bhagavata Saptaha, Daily hearing

**Key Quote:** "They don't consider the fact that Bhagavatam says daily you must hear Bhagavatam. If you are serious about spiritual benefit. If you are serious about spiritual advancement by hearing Bhagavatam. You must hear Bhagavatam every day."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Suta Goswami spoke because the sages were eager to hear about Krishna, and that Shukadeva Goswami spoke for one week only because Pariksit Maharaj had limited time, emphasizing that daily hearing of Bhagavatam is essential for spiritual advancement, contrasting this with the show of Bhagavata Saptaha by professional speakers.

Therefore, let me recite to you the Srimad Bhagavatam which I heard from Sukadeva Goswami. How did Suta Goswami decide to speak on Bhagavatam? It is because the audience, the hearers, the sage Naimisharanya, they were very eager to hear about Krishna. So Suta Goswami said, he is very pleased to get an opportunity to speak in front of such an audience. So the materially absorbed audience, they are not exactly eager to hear about Krishna. So if either the speaker or the hearers or the audience, they are not eager to hear about Krishna, or they are not purely devotees or they are not persons on a pure devotional path, then there cannot be real spiritual benefit from such a discourse. Professional speakers make a show of Bhagavat Saptaha for the sake of family maintenance. This is exactly what is meant by professional speakers. They are trying to imitate Shukadeva Goswami. Shukadeva Goswami spoke Bhagavatam for one week, Saptaha, one week, because Pariksit Maharaj had only one week's time before quitting his body. There is a very, very specific reason why Shukadeva Goswami spoke for only one week, because Pariksit Maharaj who was asking questions, inquiring from Shukadeva Goswami, he had only one week. That will be explained in this chapter as we go further. Therefore, Shukadeva Goswami spoke only for one week. It is not that Shukadeva Goswami, without a reason, he simply decided let me speak one week. No. So, the professional speakers whose main intention is money, they make a show of Bhagavata Saptaha. They try to imitate Shukadeva Goswami. They don't consider the fact that Bhagavatam says daily you must hear Bhagavatam. If you are serious about spiritual benefit. If you are serious about spiritual advancement by hearing Bhagavatam, you must hear Bhagavatam every day. It's called Seva. It's called Seva. It's a service. It's a devotional service to hear Bhagavatam. And Nityam means every day, constantly, always. At least for us who have got so many other engagements, we should at least hear every day for a little time. Not just one week. No. That was only for Pariksit Maharaj, because he had only one week's time.

**Key Quote:** "Even the Bhagavatam discourses could be contaminated by the gunas."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how the audience is often interested in material benefits (Dharma, Artha, Kama, Moksha) and how the intent of earning money or gaining material benefit can pollute the pure Bhagavatam discourse, contaminating it with the three gunas.

So, these professional speakers make a show of Bhagavata Saptaha for the sake of family maintenance. The real intention is money. And the materially disposed audience hears such discourses of Bhagavata Saptaha for some material benefit. The audience also, many times, they are really interested in material benefit by hearing Bhagavatam. And what is that material benefit? Religiosity, wealth, gratification of the senses or liberation. Dharma, Artha, Kama, Moksha. This is their aim, to attain one or more of these four things. Such a Bhagavatam discourse, or such Bhagavatam discourses, are not purified from the contamination of the material qualities. Always remember, everything in this material world is contaminated by the three gunas. So, even the Bhagavatam discourses could be contaminated by the gunas. Bhagavatam by itself is pure, but it can get contaminated by such intent of earning money or getting material benefit. It gets polluted.

#### Purity, Transcendental pleasure, Material motive, Transformation, Qualified speaker and hearers

**Key Quote:** "Neither the sages are interested in any material gain. Nor Suta Goswami is interested in any material benefit. So, therefore the speaker and audience are both pure."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the pure discourses between the saints of Naimisharanya and Suta Goswami with modern Bhagavata Saptahas, emphasizing that without purity and a lack of material motive, there can be no real spiritual transformation.

So, here Prabhupada is warning us, but the discourses between the saints of Naimisharanya and Sri Suta Goswami are on the transcendental level, above all material contamination. They are pure. There is no motive for material gain. This is the important point. Neither the sages are interested in any material gain, nor Suta Goswami is interested in any material benefit. So, therefore the speaker and audience are both pure. In such discourses, transcendental pleasure, unlimited transcendental pleasure is relished both by the audience and by the speaker. And therefore they can continue the topics for many thousands of years. Why is Prabhupada saying this? Because if you remember, the beginning of the Bhagavatam it is said, the sages of Naimisharanya assembled in that holy place, performed one thousand year sacrifice. So, for one thousand years, what sacrifice are they doing? They are performing the sacrifice of hearing and chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord. So only if there is no material motive, motive for material gain, and there is no money intention, intention of earning money by the speaker, then only the transcendent, unlimited transcendental pleasure can be realized by, or relished by both the audience and the speaker. And then it can continue. There is no time limitation. Now Bhagavata Saptas are held for only seven days, and after finishing the show, both the audience and the speaker become engaged in material activities as usual. They go back to their usual material activities. There is no change of heart. There is no transformation. So, it is explained here, both the, nowadays, both the speaker and the hearers are not exactly pure or qualified. So, there can't be that spiritual transformation in such a condition. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam 1.18.16, explaining that the sages of Naimisharanya are requesting Suta Goswami to speak about the topics that led Maharaj Parikshit to attain the lotus feet of the Lord, emphasizing the importance of pure intention.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 16th verse of the 18th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, Savaimahabhagavata Parikshit Yena apavarga aakhyam adabhra buddhihi Jnanena vayasaki shabditena Bhaje khagendra dhwaja padamoolam. The meaning of this verse is: O Suta Goswami, please describe those topics of the Lord by which Maharaj Parikshit, whose intelligence was fixed on liberation, attained the lotus feet of the Lord who is the shelter of Garuda, the king of birds. Those topics were vibrated by the son of Vyasa, Srila Sukadeva. So the sages of Naimisharanya are specifically requesting Suta Goswami to now speak about those topics which were discussed by Parikshit Maharaj and Sukadeva Goswami with the intention of attaining shelter at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord Krishna. That should be the only intent.

**Key Quote:** "The devotee of the Lord worships the transcendental form of the Lord... Whereas the impersonalist meditates upon the glaring effulgence of the bodily rays of the Lord known as the Brahmajyoti."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the difference between impersonalists and devotees, highlighting that devotees worship the transcendental form of the Lord, while impersonalists meditate on the Brahmajyoti, the Lord's bodily effulgence, and emphasizes that Parikshit Maharaj's goal was the lotus feet of the Lord, not impersonal Brahman.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "There is some controversy amongst the students on the path of liberation." Such transcendental students are known as impersonalists and devotees of the Lord. Two categories of transcendentalists are generally there among those who desire a transcendental benefit. Two kinds of transcendentalists, the impersonalists and the devotees. The devotee of the Lord worships the transcendental form of the Lord. Devotees always worship the transcendental form of the Lord. They don't engage in any idol worship. They don't worship any material form. They don't worship any imaginary form. They don't worship idols. Idol means imaginary form. Whereas the impersonalist meditates upon the glaring effulgence of the bodily rays of the Lord known as the Brahmajyoti. Always the impersonalist, their goal is the impersonal Brahmajyoti, which is the effulgence of the Supreme Lord Krishna, His bodily effulgence. So their object of meditation is the impersonal effulgence, Brahmajyoti. Here in this verse, it is said that Maharaj Pariksit attained the lotus feet of the Lord by the instructions in knowledge delivered by the son of Vyasadeva, Srila Sukhdev Goswami. So Maharaj Pariksit's goal was the lotus feet of the Lord, not some impersonal Brahman effulgence, not some Brahmajyoti, not some spiritual sky. No. His aim was very clear.

**Key Quote:** "Sukhdev Goswami in the beginning was an impersonalist... But later on, he was attracted by the transcendental pastimes of the Lord and thus became a devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Sukadeva Goswami was initially an impersonalist but later became a devotee after being attracted to the Lord's pastimes, emphasizing the importance of hearing about the Lord and the transformative power of devotional service, referencing the Atmarama verse.

Sukhdev Goswami was also an impersonalist in the beginning, as he himself admitted in the Bhagavatam, Second canto, first chapter, ninth verse. But later on, he was attracted by the transcendental pastimes of the Lord and thus became a devotee. This is a very, very important point. Sukhdev Goswami in the beginning was an impersonalist. That means he had realization of the impersonal aspect of the absolute truth, Brahman realized. He was a Brahman realized person, and he was a liberated soul by birth. That's a fact. But he did not know about the personality of Godhead. He did not know about the Bhagavan feature. He only knew the Brahman feature. And he himself has admitted in the beginning of the Bhagavatam that he was an impersonalist. Later on, he was attracted by the transcendental pastimes of the Lord and thus became a devotee. There is a verse called the Atmarama verse. That verse describes all varieties of Atmaramas. They are attracted by the Supreme Lord Krishna and they become devotees, and they do render pure devotional service to Krishna, irrespective of what their background might have been. So similarly, Sukhdev Goswami, even though he was a liberated soul, even though he was absorbed in thought of Brahman, still, he got attracted to the transcendental pastimes of the Lord when he heard them from his father Vyasadeva. So he heard the pastimes

**Key Quote:** "Such devotees with perfect knowledge are called Mahabhagavatas or first class devotees... There are three classes of devotees and they are called Prakrita, Madhyama and Mahabhagavata."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the three classes of devotees: Prakrita (third class), Madhyama (second class), and Mahabhagavata (first class), explaining their characteristics and how they perceive and interact with the Lord, devotees, neophytes, and non-devotees.

So, Srila Prabhupada says further, "Such devotees with perfect knowledge are called Mahabhagavatas or first class devotees." Like Sukhdev Goswami, Pariksit Maharaj, they are all Mahabhagavatas, first class devotees. So Srila Prabhupada further says, there are three classes of devotees and they are called Prakrita, Madhyama and Mahabhagavata. Three classes of devotees. The Prakrita or third class devotees are temple worshippers without specific knowledge of the Lord and the Lord's devotees. The lowest level of devotees is called third class devotees, Prakrita Bhakta. And what is their characteristic? They worship the Lord in the temple but they do not have specific knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They do not have specific knowledge of the Supreme Lord's pure devotees. Then, the second class devotee or Madhyama knows well the Lord, the Lord's devotees, the neophytes, and the non-devotees also. So four distinct categories of personalities are distinguished by those in the intermediate stage, Madhyama Adhikari or second class devotee. The four stages are four stages in which different personalities are situated. The topmost is the Lord himself, the Supreme Personality, then the Lord's devotees, established devotees, and the neophytes, those who are just beginning devotional service. And finally, the non-devotees. They are neither interested nor they engage in any devotional service. So such non-devotees are the fourth class of people in this world in the view of the Madhyama Adhikari, the second class devotee. And the second class devotee accordingly deals

**Key Quote:** "But the Mahabhagavata or the first class devotee sees everything in relation with the Lord and the Lord present in everyone's relation."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the unique vision of a Mahabhagavata, who sees everything connected to the Lord and the Lord present in every relationship, leading them to not distinguish between devotees and non-devotees, as they perceive everyone serving the Lord in their own way.

But the Mahabhagavata or the first class devotee sees everything in relation with the Lord and the Lord present in everyone's relation. This is a special qualification of a Mahabhagavata devotee. What is that? A Mahabhagavata devotee always sees everything in relation with the Lord. Everything actually is connected with the Lord. Nothing is independent of the Lord. So Mahabhagavata is able to see that. And not only everything is connected with the Lord, but the Lord is present in everyone's relation. There is no relationship in which Lord is absent. So Lord is connected with everybody. Everything is connected with the Lord. Both ways. The Mahabhagavata therefore does not make any distinction particularly between a devotee and non-devotee. This is a very peculiar qualification of a Mahabhagavata. He does not make a distinction between devotees and non-devotees. Why? Because his vision is everyone is engaged in their service to the supreme personality of God. That's the way a Mahabhagavata sees everyone engaged. So Mahabhagavata does not make a distinction between a devotee and a non-devotee.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Pariksit was such a Mahabhagavata devotee because he was initiated by a Mahabhagavata devotee, Shukadeva Swami."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Pariksit Maharaj became a Mahabhagavata due to being initiated by Sukadeva Goswami, and emphasizes that while impersonalists can become devotees, devotees never become impersonalists, highlighting the superiority of devotional service.

A Madhyama Adhikari, intermediate devotee, he makes distinction between devotees and non-devotees. Maharaj Pariksit was such a Mahabhagavata devotee because he was initiated by a Mahabhagavata devotee, Shukadeva Swami. So how did Pariksit Maharaj become a Mahabhagavata? Because he was initiated by Shukadeva Swami. So he also became a Mahabhagavata. So Pariksit's qualifications are being described here. What category of person is Pariksit? He was equally kind even to the personality of Kali, and what to speak of others. Such a kind-hearted soul, Pariksit Maharaj. He was kind to Kali Purusha because Kali Purusha surrendered, and what to speak of others who are not as fallen as Kali Purusha. So a Mahabhagavata devotee, he is equally kind to everybody. That is one of his qualifications or characteristics. So Srila Prabhupada says further, there are many instances in the transcendental histories of the world of an impersonalist who has later become a devotee. Many instances. Shukadeva Goswami, the Kumaras. But a devotee has never become an impersonalist. Somebody who has taken to devotional service and perfected his devotional service

**Key Quote:** "Even the verse says Those who are attached to is avyakta impersonal aspect of the absolute truth. For them there is so much of difficulty on the path of impersonal realization that they have to undergo."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes the Bhagavad Gita to illustrate that those attached to the impersonal aspect of the Absolute Truth face more suffering, reinforcing the idea that impersonal realization is an intermediate stage and that devotional service is the ultimate goal.

he becomes situated on the transcendental platform, eternally he remains on the transcendental platform. So Prabhupada says this very fact proves that on the transcendental steps, the step occupied by a devotee is higher than the step occupied by an impersonalist. That means that impersonal realization is an intermediate position of a progressive transcendentalist. It is also stated in the Bhagavad Gita in the twelfth chapter of Bhagavad Gita in the fifth verse purport that person stuck on the impersonal step undergo more sufferings than achievement of reality. Even the verse says, "Those who are attached to is avyakta impersonal aspect of the absolute truth, for them there is so much of difficulty on the path of impersonal realization that they have to undergo." And in the end, they don't get the realization. They don't get that realization which they are entitled to. Therefore knowledge imparted by Sukhadeva Goswami unto Maharaj Pariksit

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that the knowledge imparted by Sukadeva Goswami through the Srimad Bhagavatam helped Pariksit Maharaj attain the transcendental service of the Lord, which is the perfect stage of liberation, and ends with a thank you and Hare Krishna.

This is the kind of knowledge that was imparted by Sukhadeva Goswami. He spoke the Srimad Bhagavatam. And this stage of perfection is called apavarga or the perfect stage of liberation. So in this stage of liberation, there is actual freedom from material bonding because of which they are factually liberated. So simple knowledge of liberation is material knowledge, whereas when somebody attains the transcendental service of the Lord, that is called the perfect stage of liberation. So Sukhadeva Goswami, he gave perfect knowledge to Pariksit Maharaj, and the result was that Pariksit Maharaj attained the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session we will be discussing from the 17th and 18th verses of the 18th chapter of the 1st canto of Shri Madbhagavata. To begin with, I will recite the 17th verse. Tanna parampuñña asamrutartham ākhyānam atyadbhuta yoganiṣṭham ākhyāhi ananta ācharitopa pannam pārīkṣitam bhāgavata ābirāmam. The meaning of this verse is: Thus, please narrate to us the narrations of the unlimited, for they are purifying and supreme. They were spoken to Maharaj Pariksit and they are very dear to the pure devotees being full of Bhakti Yoga. So, the sages of Naimisharanya are requesting Suta Goswami to speak about those topics discussed between Pariksit Maharaj and Sukadeva Goswami. And what is the nature of those topics? They are purifying and supreme. They are very dear to pure devotees, these topics, because they are full of Bhakti Yoga. They are pure devotees. These topics are full of Bhakti Yoga. So, Prabhupada explains in the purport, what are spoken to Maharaj Pariksit and what is very dear to the pure devotees is Srimad Bhagavatam. Srimad Bhagavatam is mainly full of the narrations of the activities of the supreme unlimited and therefore, it is the science of Bhakti Yoga or the devotional service of the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Srimad Bhagavatam contains transcendental knowledge, renunciation, and real religion, but most importantly, devotional service. He then introduces the eighteenth verse, highlighting Suta Goswami's statement about being born in a mixed caste and the power of association with advanced souls to cleanse oneself of disqualifications.

Thus, it is para or supreme. Because, although it is enriched with all kinds of knowledge and religion, it is specifically enriched with the devotional service of the Lord. That is a special characteristic of Bhagavatam. It contains transcendental knowledge. It contains topics of renunciation. It contains what is real religion. But most importantly, it contains devotional service of the supreme Lord, Bhakti Yoga. It is enriched with Bhakti Yoga. The eighteenth verse. Sūtavvāca ahovayam janma-bhṛto adhyahāsma vṛddhānu-vṛtyāpi viloma-jātāha dauṣkulyam ādhyam vidhunoti-shīgram mahattamānām abhidhāna-yogaḥ. The meaning is, Sri Sathya Goswami said, he is responding to whatever the sage Suna Mishra has said now, O God, although we are born in a mixed caste, we are still promoted in birthright simply by serving and following the great who are advanced in knowledge. Even by conversing with such great souls, one can without delay cleanse oneself of all disqualifications resulting

**Key Quote:** "Higher association means all disqualifications are washed away."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Suta Goswami's background and how association with higher devotees like Sukadeva Goswami purified him. He then connects this principle to Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who elevated many low-born individuals to the status of devotional service and acaryas through transcendental association.

from lower births. So, Suta Goswami is revealing some secret here, a very, very important secret. What is he telling? That he was born in a mixed caste, viloma-jātāha, born in a mixed caste. So, Srila Prabhupāda explains what is that born in a mixed caste. In the purport, Srila Prabhupāda says, Suta Goswami did not take his birth in a brāhmaṇa family. He was born in a family of mixed caste or an uncultured low family. So, Suta means somebody who is born in an uncultured low family is called a Suta. But because of higher association, like Sri Śukadeva Goswami and the great sages of Naimishāraṇya, certainly the disqualification of inferior birth was washed off. There is a power of association. Higher association means all disqualifications are washed away. And it actually happened to Suta Goswami. So, Srila Prabhupāda explains the principle that Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu followed this principle in pursuance of the Vedic youth sages. And by his transcendental association, he elevated many low-born or those disqualified by birth or action to the status of devotional service and established them in the position of ācāryas or authorities.

#### Caitanya Mahaprabhu, spiritual master, qualification

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "If he is conversant with the science of Kṛṣṇa, then he can be accepted as ācārya or guru, or a spiritual master."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Caitanya Mahaprabhu strictly followed the principle that anyone conversant with the science of Krishna can be accepted as an acarya or guru, regardless of their birth or social status.

Caitanya Mahāprabhu strictly followed this principle of the Bhagavatam. Just like Suta Goswami became qualified, and he became cleansed of all disqualifications simply by associating with pure devotees. Same thing, Caitanya Mahāprabhu himself gave association and he elevated those who were disqualified by birth or action to the status of devotional service. And when they become situated on this platform of pure devotional service, they become authorities. They attain the position of ācāryas, those who can teach others by their own example. They are perfect in knowledge and realization. So, Caitanya Mahāprabhu clearly stated, any man, whatever he may be, whether a brāhmaṇa or a śūdra, by birth, or a householder or a mendicant in the order of society, if he is conversant with the science of Kṛṣṇa, he can be accepted as an ācārya or guru, a spiritual master. The exact verse is, kibha vipra kibha nyāsi śūdra kenanāya yehi kṛṣṇa tattvaveta sei guru hoya. This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's statement. This means, irrespective of the position, either in the varṇa or the āśrama, varṇa positions, the highest is brāhmaṇa, the lowest is śūdra. So, Caitanya Mahāprabhu says it doesn't matter what the varṇa position is of a person. Neither the āśrama position, whether one is householder or mendicant in the order of society, that means whether one is grāṣṭa or sannyāsi, it doesn't matter. If he is conversant with the science of Kṛṣṇa, yehi kṛṣṇa tattvaveta, kṛṣṇa tattva, in truth he knows what is Kṛṣṇa, then he can be accepted as ācārya or guru, or a spiritual master.

#### Suta Goswami, knowledge of Krishna, authority

**Key Quote:** "Suta Goswami learned the science of Kṛṣṇa from great rishis and authorities like Śukadeva and Vyāsadeva. And he was so qualified, that even the sages of Naimisharanya eagerly wanted to hear from him the science of Kṛṣṇa in the form of Srimad Bhagavatam."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights Suta Goswami's qualification as a speaker of Srimad Bhagavatam, despite his low birth, due to his learning from Sukadeva Goswami and Vyasadeva. Even high-class brahmanas were eager to hear from him because of his realized knowledge of Krishna.

So, Caitanya Mahāprabhu followed this very rigidly. This principle, he followed this principle. Now, it is described here, Suta Goswami learned the science of Kṛṣṇa from great rishis and authorities like Śukadeva and Vyāsadeva. And he was so qualified, that even the sages of Naimisharanya eagerly wanted to hear from him the science of Kṛṣṇa in the form of Srimad Bhagavatam. So, Suta Goswami, by birth he was a low-born, but he learned the science of Kṛṣṇa from Śukadeva Goswami, from Vyāsadeva, and in this way he became qualified. And how much qualified did he become? That even the sages of Naimisharanya, who were high-class brāhmaṇas, atappumbir dvijaśreṣṭhā, Suta Goswami himself addresses the sages of Naimisharanya, you are dvijaśreṣṭhā, you are high-class brāhmaṇas. Even such high-class brāhmaṇas, they are eager to hear from Suta Goswami about Kṛṣṇa, because Suta Goswami knows and has realized the science of Kṛṣṇa. That's why he is in that exalted position of being the ācārya, to impart knowledge about Kṛṣṇa. So, Prabhupāda says, Suta Goswami had the double association of great souls by hearing and preaching. He heard them when they made inquiries, and he answered their questions by which he was preaching to them also.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "By learning one acquires some qualification, and by preaching one acquires a higher qualification."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that both learning and preaching the science of Krishna consciousness are essential for acquiring qualifications, with preaching leading to a higher level of qualification. He emphasizes that Suta Goswami's example proves that there was no bar to learning or preaching transcendental science due to inferior birth.

Transcendental science, or the science of Kṛṣṇa, has to be learned from the authorities, from somebody who is following these principles taught by Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. So, learning is not enough. One has to preach the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and then one becomes still more qualified. By learning one acquires some qualification, and by preaching one acquires a higher qualification. So, Suta Goswami had both the advantages, and thus undoubtedly he was completely freed from all disqualifications, low birth and mental agonies. So, Suta Goswami cannot be considered as low born. Those disadvantages are all cleansed away. This verse definitely proves that Śrīla Śukadeva Goswami did not refuse to teach Suta Goswami about the transcendental science, nor did the sages of Naimishāna refuse to hear lessons from Suta Goswami, because of his inferior birth. See, both are there. Suta Goswami though low born, Śukadeva Goswami spoke Bhāgavatam, and Suta Goswami heard, and became enlightened, qualified. And the sages of Naimishāna, even though they are high class brāhmaṇas, they did not refuse to hear from Suta Goswami, because their only consideration was this: Suta Goswami actually has heard about Kṛṣṇa and knows Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, let us hear from Him. That was their only consideration. So, Prabhupāda says one important point. This means that thousands of years ago, there is no bar to learning or preaching the transcendental science because of inferior birth.

#### caste system, qualification, association

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Birth is not important, but the qualification of the person after taking birth, whatever be the family, if they acquire the qualifications by proper hearing, then they are washed off all the contamination of the lower birth."
**Summary:** The speaker refutes the idea that lower castes were historically denied transcendental knowledge, stating that the rigidity of the caste system is a relatively recent phenomenon. He concludes that qualification, acquired through proper hearing and association with pure devotees, is more important than birth, and that such association cleanses one of all contamination.

Many times these ignorant people, they accuse that in the past, so-called śūdras were denied the knowledge of the Vedas. They were denied transcendental knowledge. No, that's never true. That's never true. As Prabhupāda says, there was never any bar for learning or preaching the transcendental science because of low birth. The rigidity of the so-called caste system in Hindu society became prominent within only one hundred years or so, when the number of dvija bandhus or disqualified men in the families of higher caste increased. Prabhupāda is clearly pointing out in the last hundred years or so, that is, if you count from now, when Prabhupāda is writing the purport, he says last hundred years this has become so, vitiated caste system, Hindu caste system. But that was not the case before. So, how did this happen in the last hundred years or hundred and fifty years? Because the number of disqualified people taking birth in higher caste increased. And then, such disqualified people, they don't have qualification, they claim, I am a brāhmaṇa by birth. But without qualification, what is the use of such birth? It is useless. It is no good. So, therefore, Prabhupāda explains that birth is not important, but the qualification of the person after taking birth, whatever be the family, if they acquire the qualifications by proper hearing, then they are washed off all the contamination of the lower birth. So, this is the conclusion that more important than birth is the association through which one actually becomes elevated, association of pure devotees, association of great ācāryas, one becomes elevated, cleansed of all contamination. And one becomes qualified to speak such transcendental subject matter to others who may not be conversant with it. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "It completely purifies all contamination and elevates them directly to the transcendental platform to become pure devotees."
**Summary:** Suta Goswami describes the potency of chanting the holy name of the Lord, emphasizing its ability to purify and elevate individuals to a transcendental platform.

In this session we are discussing from the 19th verse of the 18th chapter of the 1st canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. Kutap Unar Grunato Namatasya Mahatam Aikanta Parayanasya Yo Ananta Shaktir Bhagavanananto Mahat Gunatvadhyam Anantam Ahuhu. The meaning of this verse is: And what to speak of those who are under the direction of the great devotees chanting the holy name of the unlimited who has unlimited potency. The personality of Godhead, unlimited in potency and transcendental by attributes, is called the Ananta or unlimited. So here Suta Goswami is describing the potency of chanting the holy name of the unlimited Lord. What is that potency? It completely purifies all contamination and elevates them.

**Key Quote:** "Srimad Bhagavatam asserts that one who chants the holy name of the Lord and the direction of a pure devotee can at once get free from the disadvantages due to a lower caste birth."
**Summary:** Prabhupada addresses arguments against lower-caste individuals becoming Brahmanas, asserting that chanting the holy name under the guidance of a pure devotee can overcome disadvantages due to birth.

So in the purport, Prabhupada says, the Dvija Bandhu, or the less intelligent uncultured men born of higher caste, put forward many arguments against the lower caste men becoming Brahmanas in this life. They argue that birth in a family of Shudras or less than Shudras is made possible by one's previous sinful acts and that one therefore has to complete the terms of disadvantages due to lower birth. What does it mean? If somebody is taking birth in a Shudra family, that is because of their past sinful activities or past life, karma. So there is a basis for somebody to take birth in a Shudra family and somebody else to take birth in a Brahmana family. Yes, agreed. There is a definite basis for such birth to happen. It is not accidental, it is not blind, no. The argument by those born in Brahmin families, they say that if somebody is taken such a birth, they have to complete the life in that body that they have acquired. And only in the next birth, if they take birth in a Brahmana family, then they may be accepted as a Brahmana. Not before that, but here something else is told. So Prabhupada says to answer these false logicians, Srimad Bhagavatam asserts that one who chants the holy name of the Lord and the direction of a pure devotee can at once get free from the disadvantages due to a lower caste birth. Even though some, we may admit that somebody born in a low class family due to their past misdeeds or past karma, still, when they chant the holy name of the Supreme Lord under the direction of a pure devotee, they become free from all such material contamination due to the low birth.

**Key Quote:** "A pure devotee of the Lord does not commit any offense while chanting the holy name of the Lord."
**Summary:** The lecture discusses the characteristics of a pure devotee, emphasizing offenseless chanting and highlighting offenses against the holy name.

A pure devotee of the Lord does not commit any offense while chanting the holy name of the Lord. It is a characteristic of a pure devotee. It is a characteristic of a pure devotee. His chanting is pure. It means no offenses. What is the meaning of offense? Offense is like blaspheming devotees who have dedicated their life for preaching Krishna consciousness. That is an offense against the holy name. Or criticizing or minimizing the value of Vedic literature. This is also an offense against the holy name. Like that. There are different offenses to be considered while chanting Hare Krishna. And if somebody while chanting does not commit any offense, such a person is actually a pure devotee of the Lord. So, Prabhupada says there are ten different offenses in the chanting of the holy name of the Lord. This is an elaborate subject, but separately we can discuss what are the ten offenses and how to avoid them. There are ten different offenses mentioned in the Padma Purana. To chant the holy name under the direction of a pure devotee is offenseless chanting.

**Summary:** The importance of chanting under the direction of a pure devotee is emphasized, stating that it leads to immediate purification from sinful reactions.

When anyone tries to chant the Hare Krishna mantra under the direction of a pure devotee, simply by following the instructions of a pure devotee and chanting under his direction, once chanting becomes pure, once chanting becomes offenseless, offenseless chanting of the holy name of the Lord is transcendental. And therefore, such chanting can at once purify one, at once purify a person from the effects of all kinds of previous sins. The sins get washed away. The residual sinful reactions are washed away, no matter how much it may be. That's the special thing about chanting under the direction of a pure devotee. That's very special. So therefore, we request everyone, you please receive the holy name from Prabhupada and you chant according to his instructions and directions. Okay. Then immediately you become purified of all sinful reactions.

**Key Quote:** "Offenseless chanting means the person who is chanting in that way has fully understood the transcendental nature of the holy name."
**Summary:** The lecture stresses the need to give up sin and endeavor to chant under proper guidance, explaining that offenseless chanting indicates understanding the transcendental nature of the holy name and surrendering to the Lord.

But one should not again commit sins after being cleansed by simply chanting Hare Krishna according to Prabhupada's directions. It is not mechanical. It's not automatic. One has to endeavor to give up sin. To give up the sinful activities and then chant the Hare Krishna mantra under proper guidance and direction, then one can derive the highest benefit. The offenseless chanting indicates that one is purified. It indicates that one has fully understood the transcendental nature of the holy name and has thus surrendered unto the Lord. How does all this work? That's what Prabhupada is explaining here. Offenseless chanting means the person who is chanting in that way has fully understood the transcendental nature of the holy name. The holy name when uttered by any person simply by vibrating the tongue, Hare Krishna, the holy name is uttered. Hare Krishna. Then it's no ordinary sound vibration. It is actually transcendental sound. But a devotee who chants offenselessly, he understands the spiritual nature of the holy name. And what does he do consequently? He surrenders completely to the supreme law.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that birth and past sinful activities do not matter if one takes to Krishna consciousness, follows a pure devotee's directions, and chants Hare Krishna, emphasizing the power of the holy name.

If somebody chants the Hare Krishna mantra under superior guidance, so therefore we have to clearly understand birth doesn't matter, past life of sinful activities does not matter. If a person stops sinning and takes to Krishna consciousness and follows the directions of the pure devotee and chants Hare Krishna, then guaranteed such persons will become pure devotees. Now here the glories of the holy name. The holy name of the Lord is as powerful as the Lord. It looks like a very simple sound, Hare Krishna, two, two syllables. Anybody can vibrate the tongue and say Hare Krishna. But that sound, when somebody produces the sound Hare Krishna, that sound is actually very, very powerful, pure, transcendental sound. It's definitely potent like that. So Prabhupada says the Lord is all powerful personality of Godhead and he has innumerable names which are all non-different from him and are equally powerful also. Because the Lord is absolute. There is no difference between his personal names.

according to his activities also. So, this way he has so many names, unlimited names, because activities are unlimited, qualities are unlimited. So, such names are identical with the Lord, and they are also very, very powerful, as powerful as he is. So therefore, Prabhupada says, in the last word of the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord asserts that one who surrenders fully to the Lord, he will not be able to do anything. Therefore, Prabhupada says, in the last word of the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord asserts that one who surrenders fully unto him is protected from all sins by the grace of the Lord. So, Krishna assures, I will free you from all sinful reactions. You simply surrender to me alone. Since, now Prabhupada explains this, how does it work? Since his name, means the Lord's name, and he himself, the Lord himself, are identical, the holy name of the Lord can protect the devotee from all effects of sins.

The Lord here appears to be in a very high and righteous position, because the Lord is involved directly. In the case of somebody who takes to the devotional service, directly, the Lord is involved. Therefore, the devotee, even if he is a neophyte, a beginner, still, the Lord takes charge of those on the pure devotional path, and never puts in fact, devotional path and what is the pure devotional path simply surrender to a pure devotee spiritual master and follow the instructions that's all that is required and one becomes free from all disadvantages due to low birth the heart is cleansed completely of all sinful reactions of course one should stop sinning not that one continues to sin and says I will chant Hare Krishna and become cleansed of all sinful reactions no it doesn't work like that so it is said here the Lord's unlimited power is extended on and on by the unlimited expansion of the devotees and incarnations and thus every devotee of the Lord and incarnations also can be equally surcharged the potency of the Lord Lord only expands and that expansion of the Lord is equally potent the Lord powerful as the Lord but still in addition to that one should actually understand that devotees who are who are empowered by the Lord they are as powerful as the Lord in the matter of cleansing those who come in contact with them and receive the holy name from them not only the Lord but his pure devotees who are empowered by him also can act

So the 20th verse: Etavatalam Nanu Suchitena Gunair Asamya Natishamaya Nishaya Nasya Hitvetaraan Prarthayato Vibhuter Yasyangri Renum Jushate Nabhip Soho. The meaning of this verse is: It is now ascertained that he, the personality of Godhead, is unlimited and there is none equal to him. Consequently, no one can speak of him adequately. Great demigods cannot obtain the favor of the goddess of fortune even by prayers, but this very goddess renders service unto the Lord although he is unwilling to have such service. So this verse is a very important verse spoken by Suta Goswami.

What is the position of the personality of Godhead? Sri Krishna. In the previous verse, there was a description about the personality of Godhead who is unlimited in potency and transcendental by all the attributes. He is called Ananta, the unlimited personality, supreme personality. So that unlimited, now he is justifying. Suta Goswami is justifying because nobody is equal to him and nobody else can be unlimited. Only one personality in the entire cosmic manifestation, that is the supreme personality of Godhead, Krishna alone is unlimited and no one can speak of him adequately. Any amount of description cannot exhaust the different transcendental qualities of the Supreme Lord. So he has unlimited qualities. He has unlimited forms. He has unlimited opulences. Everything about him is unlimited.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that while demigods seek the favor of Lakshmi Devi, she serves Krishna, who is complete and doesn't need her service, but accepts it to bless His devotees.

And one specific point here in this verse is that when compared to the goddess of fortune, Lakshmi Devi, and what is the position of the goddess of fortune, Lakshmi Devi? Great demigods, they seek her favors, but they are unable to obtain it even by offering so many prayers, but that goddess of fortune, Lakshmi Devi, she herself renders service to the unlimited Supreme Lord, Anantha, the personality of Godhead, Krishna. But Krishna's position is not that he is in need of Lakshmi Devi's service. He is full and himself is complete and he is not in need of Lakshmi Devi's service. Even then, it is his kindness that even though he doesn't require the service, it is for benefiting the servitor that the Lord agrees to accept that service. So he accepts the service of Lakshmi Devi, he accepts the service of his innumerable devotees, pure devotees, simply for blessing them, for giving them his blessings, for showing his mercy upon them, and one should not wrongly think it is some kind of necessity that Krishna has to be served and he is dependent on the service of his devotees, no, never.

**Key Quote:** "Shruti is the original Vedas which have been received in oral translation."
**Summary:** The speaker begins to explain the difference between Shruti and Smriti literature, defining Shruti as the original Vedas received through oral tradition.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains this point by clearly referencing the Shruti literature. Now what is the difference between Shruti literature and Smriti literature? Two kinds of Vedic literatures: Shruti and Smriti. Shruti is the original Vedas which have been received in oral translation of the Shruti literature which have been received in oral translation of the Shruti literature which have been received in oral translation of the Shruti literature which have been received in oral translation of the Shruti literature two kinds of Vedic literature one or the other Shruti is Arjuna'sľhooハ Shoppa within Brahma's heart. So at that time, there was nobody other than the Supreme Lord and Brahma. Brahma is the first created being. So then from Brahma it is coming down in parampara from Brahma to his sons and disciples, from them to their disciples and successors. That is the oral tradition. It's called Shruti. It is received by hearing. It is received by hearing from the predecessor. So it is coming down in human society and since the beginning of creation, that's called Shruti literature, the original Vedas. What we say, the original Vedas. You would have heard of these terms: Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, Atharva Veda. So these four Vedas are basically the original Vedic knowledge and these Vedas have many subdivisions also, many varieties of details are there of this original Vedas: Samhitas, Brahmanas, Aranyakas, Upanishads, like that. It there is it's very vast body of knowledge. Then there are other kind of Vedic literature called Shruti.

**Summary:** The speaker defines Smriti literature as compilations of Vedic messages by saintly persons, making the knowledge more accessible, and gives examples like Puranas and Itihasas.

literature. What is Shruti literature? Shruti literature is the compilation of the same vedic message by the saintly persons, by the great devotees, by witches sages or by dead火根 for explaining the Vedic message to a particular audience, to explain in an easily understandable way because the Vedic message in the original Vedas is very difficult to understand for most people, for common people. So it has been simplified and presented in different ways to disseminate the same knowledge, the same message without any change, without any interpretation, the original message as it is explained in simple way. So what is this Smriti literature? The examples of Smriti literature are all other literature other than the Vedas like the Puranas, the Itihasas, the Sutras, the Upaveda's, the Vedangas and the various commentaries, the various explanations given by realized Acharyas etc. So Bhagavatam is in the category of Smriti literature, that is one of the Puranas, but it is not a creation of some person which is independent of the Vedic message. It is exactly the same message of the vedas, the original Vedas which is there in the Bhagavatam, but the way it is written and it is not something which gets stolen in some way, there is no reason for that. The speciality of Bhagavatam is it is directly and easily understandable. The Vedas sometimes speak in a very very indirect way whereas the Puranas are directly describing the Vedic message.

**Summary:** The speaker quotes Shruti literature to emphasize that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Parameshwara Parabrahman, has nothing to do, meaning He is independent and self-sufficient.

So Srila Prabhupada in the opening of the purport itself he says the personality of Godhead or the Parameshwara Parabrahman according to the Shrutis has nothing to do. So in the Shrutis it is said natasya karyam karanam cha vidyate natat samascha abhyadikas cha dhrushyate parashya shaktir vividhaiva shuyate svabhaviki jnanam karyam karanam cha vidyate natasya karyam karanam karanam cha vidyate natasya karyam karanam cha vidyate natasya karyam karanam cha vidyate natasya karyam karanam cha vidyate natasya karyam karanam cha vidyate natasya karyam karanam. So this is one of the verses in the Upanishads. Now it's not easy to understand this, but what it means is that the Supreme absolute truth, the Supreme personality of Godhead known as Parameshwara Parabrahman to distinguish him from other controllers, subordinate controllers, lower level controllers, controllers, Ishwaras. So he is Parameshwara. Nobody else can be called Parameshwara. Only Krishna, the Supreme Personality got it. It's called Parameshwara and Parabrahman because Brahman means the sometimes refers to the living entities. But Krishna is Parabrahman. Atma refers to the living entities sometimes, but Paramatma refers only to the Supreme Personality of God in this way. The Supreme Lord is distinguished from everyone else in so many ways. So that Supreme Personality of God and according to the Shruti literature that Prabhupada is quoting here, it is described the Shruti literature is nothing to do.

**Summary:** The speaker reinforces the idea that Krishna has no equal or superior and is full in Himself, unlike beings in the material world who are always in need, concluding the lecture.

Same thing is told in the Bhagavad Gita also: Name Parthasthi Kartabhyam Trishulokeshu Kinchana. See Bhagavad Gita also the same Message. Bhagavad Gita is also part of Mahabharata, which is Smriti literature, Itihasa. But even that Bhagavad Gita, what is spoken by Krishna and documented or recorded by Vyasa Deva also contains the same Esoteric message that the absolute supreme absolute truth, the Supreme Personality of God has nothing to do. What does it mean he has nothing to do? So that is explained by Prabhupada further. He has no equal. That means everybody else has got duties. Everybody else has got Something to do. By their very constitution Prabhupada further says nor does anyone excel him. Nobody can excel him. He is no equal. He has no superior. Everybody is subordinate to him. But His position is unique in that he has unlimited potencies and Is every action is carried out systematically in his natural perfect ways: parashya-shaktir-vividhayi-vashuyate-svabhavikī natural jñāna-balak-kriyāca automatically, systematically, very nicely carried out by his different energies. Thus the supreme personality of God is full in himself and he has nothing to accept from anyone else including the great demigods like Brahma. So nobody need to offer him service for the sake of Krishna being in need of something, no. In this world we accept service from others because we are in need. Everybody is in need. Nobody is complete by themselves, nobody is complete, but the supreme lord is full in himself and he is completely full so he is not in need, we are in need. So that difference always eternally exists. So I will stop here, thank you very much.

#### Krishna's Supremacy, Impersonal vs. Personal Absolute Truth

**Key Quote:** "The absolute truth is impersonal localized and personal and the person is the ultimate source of even the localized feature and the impersonal feature."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the source of both the impersonal and localized aspects of the Absolute Truth, clarifying misconceptions from the Vedas.

In this session we will discuss from the 21st verse of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Athapiyatpada Nakhaava Srishtam Jagadvirincho Pahruta Arganambhaha Sesham Punati Anyatamau Mukundarth Konamaloke Bhagavadpadarthaha. The meaning of this verse is, who can be worthy of the name of the Supreme Lord but the personality of God as Sri Krishna? Brahmaji collected the water emanating from the nails of his feet in order to award it to Lord Shiva as a worshipful welcome. This very water, the Ganges, is purifying the whole universe including Lord Shiva. This is yet another word spoken by Suta Goswami to assert that Krishna is the supreme personality recorded because in the Shruti literature, in the original Vedas, there is so much description of the supreme absolute truth in impersonal feature, especially the Upanishads, that people think according to the Shrutis the absolute truth is impersonal only, but that is completely wrong. The absolute truth is impersonal, localized, and personal, and the person is the ultimate source of even the localized feature and the impersonal feature.

#### Brahma's Role, Ganga's Origin, Krishna's Lotus Feet

**Key Quote:** "Brahma what is he doing he is collecting the water emanating from the nails of Krishna's lotus feet and why is he doing that in all of our need to Lord Shiva as a worshipful welcome"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Brahma's role in creation and his worship of Krishna, focusing on the origin of the Ganges River from the nails of Krishna's lotus feet and its significance.

This is clearly described in many places in the Shruti and the Smriti. So therefore, who among the many, many, many, many personalities in this entire creation, in the cosmic manifestation, can be called as a supreme Lord? It is only Krishna, Shri Krishna, the personality of God is Shri Krishna only in the Shruti… can be called as the Supreme Lord. Nobody else can be called like that. Why so? That is being substantiated by Suta Goswami by saying one specific feature which illustrates this point very, very clearly. Now consider Brahma, he is the topmost personality in this entire created universe. He is the first created being and he does the secondary creation after the initial work of creating the different elements and making all arrangements for creation and creation and creation and creation and creation and creation and creation and creation, the living entities to take birth in this material world. The Supreme Lord has entrusted the secondary creation to Brahma. So Brahma is so powerful, he creates all the other creatures in the entire universe in millions of planets, each planet having millions of living beings. All of them are given their body at the beginning of creation by Brahma. Of course, Brahma is assisted by his many assistants, but nevertheless it begins with Brahma among the created beings. So but above Brahma is the Supreme Lord himself and Brahma has been given the power by the Supreme Lord that Brahma, what is he doing? He is collecting the water emanating from the nails of Krishna's lotus feet and why is he doing that? In all of our need to Lord Shiva as a worshipful welcome. There is a description in the fifth canto, bother in other places in the scriptures that the origin of the river Ganga flows through all the planets in the whole universe, one river that flows in all the planets. From the topmost Brahmaloka up to Pathada. Every planet, this river flows. What is this river actually consisting of? It consists of the water that emanated from the nails of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord Krishna.

#### Ganga's Purifying Power, Vamana Deva, Lord Shiva's Purification

**Key Quote:** "Shiva considers that that water of the river Ganges is purifying him."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the origin of the Ganga from the causal ocean when Vamana Deva pierced the universe, its purifying power, and how even Lord Shiva considers it purifying.

In his incarnations, Vamana Deva, the Supreme Lord Krishna, he extended his foot to pierce the covering of the universe and because each universe is like a shell floating in the Garbhodaka ocean, I am sorry, floating in the Karanodaka ocean, causal ocean. So that water of the causal ocean, which is completely spiritual water, that leaked from the hole that was formed in this universal covering. And while that water came through the hole, how was that hole made? When Vamana Deva extended his foot to pierce the coverings of the universe. And the water came, it washed the feet of the Supreme Lord. And that water is very respectfully received by Brahma. It's very precious. Why? Because it was spiritual, but it contains the dust of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. And that is very, very, very, very precious for all of us. That has got all the potencies of the Supreme Lord. So Brahma received it and he awarded it to Lord Shiva. Shiva received this water of the Ganga river on this earth planet. And that's another description given in the fifth canto of the Bhagavatam. What was the need for Shiva to receive that water and how Shiva received it? That's a detailed account given in the fifth canto. Some other time I may... explain that. But Shiva considers that that water of the river Ganges is purifying him. Shiva is a pure personality, but even he considers the sacred water of the Ganga river as to be very, very potent and powerfully purifying. He says it purifies even me. What to speak of others? So therefore it is said this water of the Ganga is purifying the whole universe including Lord Shiva.

#### Ganga's Purifying Power, Sinful Reactions, One God

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Simply by taking a bath in the Ganga, their sinful reactions are completely nullified, are destroyed."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the purifying power of the Ganga and then addresses the common misconception of many gods in Vedic literature, clarifying that there is only one Supreme God.

So that is the actual position of the Supreme Lord in comparison with such great personalities as Brahma, Shiva and Mother Ganga herself. Ganga flows through the whole universe, all the planets, because wherever any living being has got any sinful reactions, simply by taking a bath in the Ganga, their sinful reactions are completely nullified, are destroyed. So who can have that potency? How did Mother Ganga, the river Ganga get that potency? Because Ganga is emanating from the nails of the lotus feet of Krishna. Therefore Ganga has become very, very powerful and got the purifying effect. Ganga can purify any sinner completely, simply if he takes bath once in the river Ganga. So how powerful the water of the river Ganga is, you can understand by this description. So in the purport Shila Prabhupada says, the conception of many gods in the Vedic literature by the ignorant is completely wrong. People think, no? In the Vedic tradition or in the Hindu religion, they say there are many gods. Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu, Ganesha, Kartikeya, Durga and Lakshmi and this thing. So many, 33 crore devatas are there. 33 crore devatas are there. So they think that actually God is not one, but God is one. God is not one, but God is many in all these forms of the devatas. Actually, the scriptures clearly describe the Lord is one without a second. Ekameva Advitiya. Means he is only one, Supreme God. And Advitiya, there is no one who is a second god equal to him or like him. Nobody is there. Nobody is there.

#### Krishna's Expansions, Mystic Powers, Krishna's Supremacy

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is always the supreme, always the greatest, always the most powerful."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Krishna, though one, expands into many forms and possesses unlimited mystic powers, emphasizing his supremacy over all other beings and devatas.

Now, even though the Lord is one without a second, he is only one personality, one person. Still, because he is an unlimited person, he expands himself in many ways. What is the meaning of expanding? He is present, let us say, as Krishna. He is also present as Balarama. He is also present as Ramachandra. He is also present as Vamanadeva. He is also present as Varaha. He is also present as Narasimha. He is also present as Narayana. He is also present as Sankarsana. Now, all these forms of personality is one person. He is one person. Now, this is difficult to understand for limited beings like us. What is our experience? One person means one form. That's all. That's our experience. We don't know of any one person, one soul, multiple bodies or multiple forms. We don't know. Actually, in the Vedic literature it is described those who acquire this mystic power, yogic power, yoga siddhi. One of the siddhis is, one of the powers they acquire is when they practice Ashtanga Yoga and advance, then they can expand themselves in nine forms. A yogi who has got yogic power by properly practicing the Ashtanga Yoga system can acquire different kinds of powers. Eight major siddhis, eight minor siddhis and four auxiliary siddhis. Totally 20 siddhis. But Krishna also has mystic powers. He has unlimited mystic powers. See the difference? And Krishna's mystic powers are such that Krishna also expands. Yogi can also expand. But yogi can expand maximum nine forms. And Krishna expands into unlimited, he expands into unlimited forms. So, Krishna is always the supreme, always the greatest, always the most powerful. And everyone else has got a very, very, very, very tiny fraction of the qualities of Krishna, of the powers of Krishna, of the beauty of Krishna, of the wealth of Krishna, of the... every aspect of Krishna. Everyone else has got a very, very tiny portion of it. And that tiny portion of whatever they possess is awarded by Krishna. So, never consider Krishna to be like another devata, like another god. No. Krishna is the only, one and only supreme lord. He is unlimited. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The lecture begins with invocations and then introduces and translates Srimad Bhagavatam 1.18.22, focusing on the concept of self-control and renunciation through attachment to Krishna.

Om Agyanati Miran Dhasya Gyananj Nishalakaya Chakshurun Militam Yena Tasmai Shri Gurave Namaha Nama Om Vishnu Padaya Krishna Preshtaya Bhutale Shri Mate Bhakti Vedanta Swamin Nithinamine Namaste Saraswate Deve Gauravani Pracharine Nirvishesha Shunyavadi Pashchatyade Shatharine Jaya Shri Krishna Chaitanya Prabhu Nityananda Shri Advaita Ganadhara Shri Vasadi Gauravakta Vrinda Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udeerayet.

The 22nd verse is as follows: Yatra Anuraktaha Sahasaiva Dheera Vyapohya Deha Dishu Sangam Udham Vrajantitat Paramahamsyam Antyam Yasmin Ahimsa Upashamaha Swadharmaha. The meaning of this verse is self-control. Self-control means the person who is attached to the Supreme Lord, Sri Krishna, can all of a sudden give up the world of material attachment, including the gross body and subtle mind, and go away to attain the highest perfection of the renounced order of life, by which non-violence and renunciation are consequential. Ahimsa.

**Key Quote:** "Even if somebody has got a lot of yogic power, even if somebody has done a lot of tapasya, even if somebody has got a lot of knowledge... if they don't have attachment for Krishna, it is not possible to nullify all material attachments."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the unique position of Krishna and how attachment to Him is essential for true renunciation and detachment from material existence, surpassing the effects of yogic power, austerity, or knowledge alone.

And Upashama. So, further, the glorification of Krishna, Krishna's unique position and unique qualities of Krishna, that if we see some wonderful qualities in great renunciants, like Maharaj Parikshit, for example, this verse has got a reference to Maharaj Parikshit and such great personalities. Those who are self-controlled and they have reached the perfection of renunciation, they are called Paramahamsas. They will be explained by Prabhupada in the purport. I am just mentioning it with respect to the translation itself. So such Paramahamsas, they are able to completely give up all of a sudden their gross body and subtle mind, and go away to achieve the perfection of existence. And how is it possible for them to give up such attachments, material attachments, which are very deep-rooted and very complex, and very difficult to give up? It is because of their attachment to Krishna. So even if somebody has got a lot of yogic power, even if somebody has done a lot of tapasya, even if somebody has got a lot of knowledge, has got so many other good qualities, if they don't have attachment for Krishna, it is not possible to nullify all material attachments, to go away from this material existence to Krishna, to attain lotus feet of Krishna.

#### self-control, sense enjoyment, minimum requirements

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Self-controlled means not indulging in sense enjoyment more than is necessary. The minimum requirements of the senses are to be fulfilled. Bare minimum."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Prabhupada's definition of self-control as minimizing sense enjoyment to only fulfill the bare minimum requirements of the body, even for transcendentalists, distinguishing it from complete cessation of sense activity.

Not possible. So Prabhupada explains this in the purport, in a very nice way. He says, only the self-controlled can gradually be attached to the Supreme Personality. So even among different categories of transcendentalists, if any transcendentalist, a spiritual aspirant, is not self-controlled, then he cannot get attachment, cannot develop attachment for Krishna. Now what does self-controlled mean? Prabhupada says, self-controlled means not indulging in sense enjoyment more than is necessary. The minimum requirements of the senses are to be fulfilled. Bare minimum. And such people are called self-controlled. Self-controlled does not mean I completely give up all the necessities of the body or the senses. No. Then there is no possibility of existing even. Existence itself becomes impossible. So, as long as the material body is there, the minimum requirements of the body has to be provided, even by a transcendentalist, even by a spiritualist. So, such personalities who have perfected their life by practicing, giving the requirements of the senses, providing the requirement of the senses to the minimum extent possible, in a matter of eating or sleeping or defending, they provide the body with the minimum requirements. And such people, they never indulge in sense enjoyment more than minimum required.

**Key Quote:** "Dry philosophical speculation is a subtle sense enjoyment of the mind."
**Summary:** This segment warns against unrestricted sense enjoyment and introduces the concept of 'dry philosophical speculation' as a subtle form of sense enjoyment that can hinder spiritual progress.

So, those who are not self-controlled, Prabhupada says, are given over to sense enjoyment without restriction. Unrestricted sense enjoyment. Or as much as they feel like enjoying, they enjoy. But that is not the way of progressing in spiritual life to attain perfection. And Prabhupada makes a very important point here. Dry philosophical speculation is a subtle sense enjoyment of the mind. So, some people gross senses they have controlled. They are only providing the minimum required. But as far as philosophical speculation, what is philosophical speculation? Speculation means keep on guessing, keep on imagining, keep on calculating, keep on deducing. So, that sort of speculation, which is in order to understand what is the absolute truth, in order to know God, or in order to theorize what is the cause of this material existence, or what is the ultimate goal of life, or who is God, such philosophical speculation is also a subtle sense enjoyment of the mind.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Sense enjoyment, whether gross or subtle, leads one to the path of darkness. That means one remains in ignorance."
**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between gross and subtle sense enjoyments, explaining how both lead to material bondage and ignorance, perpetuating the cycle of birth and death and preventing liberation.

There are two kinds of enjoyments any person can have in this world. One type of enjoyment is the gross enjoyment of the external senses: the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, and the sense of touch. Then there is one more sense within. It's called the mind. Now satisfying the mind, demands of the mind. Just like somebody likes to read a nice story, fiction, novel. Now what kind of pleasure does it give the person? It's a subtle pleasure of the mind, or the pleasure of the mind. Pleasure of the intelligence. When somebody uses their intelligence for solving some problem in physics or mathematics, that gives them great joy. And what is that kind of joy or pleasure? It's a pleasure, internal pleasure, subtle pleasure. So this sort of subtle sense enjoyment is also a cause for material bondage. So Prabhupada says, sense enjoyment, whether gross or subtle, leads one to the path of darkness. That means one remains in ignorance. Who am I? What is this world? What is the goal of life? They remain in ignorance. And as a result of remaining ignorance, they keep taking repeated birth and death, birth and death, birth and death, birth and death, and consequently they suffer in material existence, the fundamental miseries, janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhī-duḥkha-dośānudarshana. Those who are self-controlled can make progress on the path of liberation

**Key Quote:** "The Vedas therefore enjoin that one should not go on the path of darkness, but should make a progress and march towards the path of light or liberation."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of self-control for liberation and contrasts the 'path of darkness' (material existence) with the 'path of light' (liberation), cautioning against artificially suppressing the senses as a means of achieving self-control.

from the conditional life of material existence. So, to make progress beyond this material world, to get out of material existence, is possible for those who practice self-control. The Vedas therefore enjoin that one should not go on the path of darkness, but should make a progress and march towards the path of light or liberation. Tamaso ma jyotir gama. Tamas means the darkness of this material existence. And jyoti means the light, path of light or liberation, out of this material world, out of material existence. Don't remain in darkness, progress towards the light. Self-control is actually a journey achieved not by artificially stopping the senses from material enjoyment. Some people, some philosophers, some transcendentalists, they say if you want to control the senses, stop all sense activity. That means if you are seeing with the eyes, stop seeing. If you are hearing with the ears, stop hearing. Like that. Negate all sense activities.

**Key Quote:** "The real method of self-control is, to become attached to the Supreme Lord by engaging one's pure senses in his transcendental service."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that true self-control is achieved through bhakti yoga, by purifying the senses and engaging them in the transcendental service of the Lord, rather than forcibly suppressing them.

Now, this is not the way of self-control. It may seem like with great amount of austerity, if somebody stops the sense activities, they may expect that they will become completely self-controlled. But the real method of self-control is to become attached to the Supreme Lord by engaging one's pure senses in his transcendental service. sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena-nirmalam hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeṣa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate. Bhakti means serving the master of the senses, the Supreme Lord, through one's purified senses by becoming free from all material designations. Our senses become designated due to different material activities. But to free oneself from material designations and thereby purify the senses, and engage the purified senses in transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord Krishna, that is actually the way of becoming self-controlled. Senses have to be given proper engagement, not simply forcibly stop them. Don't do that. Don't forcibly stop the senses. So Prabhupād says, when the senses become purified, and that is the process of bhakti, sādhanā bhakti, senses become purified. When you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, ceto darpana mārjanam, your senses, your mind becomes purified. Mārjanam, become cleansed of material dirt, material contamination that goes away as you keep on chanting, as you keep on performing bhakti, activities of devotional service. So these purified senses are always engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. The only engagement for the purified senses is serving Kṛṣṇa, doing devotional service to Kṛṣṇa. This perfectional stage of sense enjoyment

**Summary:** The lecture concludes by reiterating that those practicing bhakti yoga can easily detach from material attachments, even at the time of death, and return to Godhead.

is called bhakti yoga. So those who are attached to bhakti yoga, they can easily give up all material attachments, any time, all of a sudden if they are called. Like what happens? It seems like suddenly death comes. So it's never sudden, but we don't know exactly when we are going to die. We know we are going to die, but we don't know when. So whenever that happens, it is like all of a sudden death comes. But a devotee who has practiced devotional service and is factually situated in practice of bhakti, such a devotee can suddenly give up all material attachments and progress and go back to Godhead. That is what is explained here. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 23rd verse of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining that devotees describe the Lord to the extent of their realization, acknowledging the Lord's unlimited nature.

In this session, we are discussing three verses: the 23rd, 24th, and 25th verses of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. So, first we will discuss the 23rd verse. The meaning of this verse is that, O Rishis, now Suta Goswami is addressing the sages who are as powerfully pure as the sun. He is glorifying the assembled sages, that you are all very, very powerfully pure as the sun. To you I am speaking. So, I shall try to describe to you the transcendental pastimes of Vishnu as far as my knowledge is concerned. And he gives an example: as the birds fly in the sky as far as their capacity allows, so do the learned beings, so do the learned devotees describe the Lord as far as their realization allows. Now, this has got a connection with one of the previous verses where it was described the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna has got unlimited qualities, has got unlimited attributes. Therefore, it's called Ananta. So, nobody can completely describe the Lord. Nobody can fully describe the Lord. So, the Lord is the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "Garuda can fly from one planet to another planet."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of birds flying to different heights to illustrate the varying capacities of devotees to understand and describe the Lord, highlighting Garuda's exceptional ability to traverse the universe.

So, does it mean because we can't describe the Lord fully, so we don't describe him at all? No. Learned devotees always describe the Lord as much as their realization allows. As much as they know, they describe. Just like the birds, they fly in the sky. Not all birds can fly as high as another bird. So, some birds can fly at low heights. Some birds can fly even higher. And Garuda, what is the capacity of Garuda to fly? Garuda can fly from one planet to another planet. And there are other birds also that can fly. But Garuda can fly piercing the coverings of the universe, can go outside this material universe, into the spiritual sky. And even in the spiritual sky, Garuda can fly through the spiritual sky and go to the spiritual planet of Vaikuntha Loka because Garuda is the carrier of the Supreme Lord Vishnu. And Vishnu travels. He travels within this universe from one planet to another planet. The descriptions are there in the Bhagavatam. Sometimes he travels from the material world to the spiritual world, sometimes he travels in the spiritual world to the material world, like that. So Garuda, because he's the carrier of the Lord and the Lord needs to go wherever, so Garuda is able

to fly the maximum, you can fly everywhere. So, like that, the example is given: just like birds can actually fly as high as their capacity permits them, similarly, the learned devotees also describe the Lord as much as their realization allows. So then, the next two verses are actually giving us the prelude to the Bhagavatam. What happens by which Shukadeva, sorry, Pariksit Maharaj met Shukadeva? So, what happened? So, he is bringing a description here. 24th and 25th verses together, they are given: ekadha dhanurudhyamya vicharan vrgyamvane vrgaan anugata shantaha shuditas trishito vrsham janashayam achakshanah praviveshatam ashramam dadarshamunim asinam shantam milita no chanam. Beautiful verses. The meaning of these two verses is: once upon a time, Maharaj Pariksit, while engaged in hunting in the forest with bow and arrows, became extremely fatigued, hungry, and thirsty while following the stags. While searching for a reservoir of water, he entered the hermitage of the well-known Shamika Rishi and saw the sage

**Summary:** The speaker explains Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing that the events leading to Pariksit Maharaj's meeting with Shukadeva Goswami were divinely arranged to facilitate his return to Godhead.

sitting silently with closed eyes. So, Prabhupada says in the purport that the circumstances under which Srimad Bhagavatam was spoken for the benefit of all concerned is now being explained, beginning with the words, "once upon a time." This happened sometime in history. Therefore, Suta Goswami, he also is talking of the past because he heard the Bhagavatam from Shukadeva Goswami, when Shukadeva Goswami spoke to Pariksit Maharaj. So, that's what Goswami said: once upon a time in the past, what happened? Maharaj Pariksit was engaged in hunting in the forest. Hunting was permitted for Kshatriyas to keep up their skills for fighting, for protecting the weaker sections, for challenging the enemies, for controlling the miscreants, etc. So, while he went hunting, he became extremely fatigued, hungry, and thirsty while hunting. And he started searching for water, a reservoir of water, and he couldn't find it. And while doing so, because he was very thirsty and fatigued and hungry, he entered the hermitage of the well-known Shamika Rishi, a great saint. I will be described later on who is the Shamika Rishi in more detail. For now, he entered the hermitage of the well-known Shamika Rishi and saw the sage sitting with closed eyes. Shamika Rishi was sitting in meditation. His eyes were closed. And in such a situation, Pariksit Maharaj entered that ashram of the Shamika Rishi. Now in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says something very, very significant. He says how this is the prelude. Prabhupada says, the Supreme Lord is so kind to his pure devotees that in proper time he calls such devotees up to him and thus creates an auspicious circumstance for the devotee.

**Key Quote:** "When the Lord feels that his pure devotee who has gone to the material world from his abode has to come back if he wants the devotee to come back earlier than a normal time frame then he creates some awkward situation so that the devotee will leave everything and go to the Lord"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of devotees returning to Godhead and how the Lord sometimes creates difficult situations to encourage renunciation and detachment from worldly affairs.

Devotees come to the material world for the purpose of the Lord. The pure devotees who belong to the spiritual world, they come to this material world. But after they finish the purpose for which they have come to this world, they generally are going back to Godhead because that's where they belong. So, they come from Krishna's personal abode and they go back. Just like the Lord comes from his personal abode and he goes back, same way pure devotees also, the associates of the Lord also do the same thing. So, when the Lord feels that his pure devotee who has gone to the material world from his abode has to come back, if he wants the devotee to come back earlier than a normal time frame, then he creates some awkward situation so that the devotee will leave everything and go to the Lord. So, a similar thing happened to Pariksit Maharaj. So, because the Lord wanted Pariksit to come back to him, therefore the Lord arranged that Pariksit Maharaj become extremely fatigued, hungry, and thirsty. So, Prabhupada says was a pure devotee and there is no reason for him to become extremely fatigued, hungry, and thirsty. Why? Because a devotee of the Lord never becomes perturbed by such bodily demands. A devotee is fully self-controlled as his personal bodily demands are concerned, he is completely controlled. So, there is no need for him to feel extremely inconvenienced by thirst, hunger, and fatigue. But by the desire of the Lord, even such a devotee, pure devotee like Pariksit Maharaj can become apparently fatigued and thirsty just to create a situation favorable for its renunciation of worldly activities. Crispy is ruling as the Emperor of the world and we have heard about his

encountering the personality of Kali and how he dealt with Kali in a very just manner. He punished and rewarded Kali, but he was ruling perfectly. But when Krishna wants his devotee back, he wants a devotee first of all to renounce all worldly connections. So, you know, to create a favorable situation for renouncing of Pariksit Maharaj, what did Krishna do? Krishna made him feel extreme inconvenience due to thirst, fatigue, and hunger. So, Srila Prabhupada says one has to give up all attachment for worldly relations before one is able to go back to Godhead. So, this is one of the qualifications. Anybody wants to go back to Godhead has to give up all the attachments for worldly relationships. And when a devotee is too much absorbed in worldly affairs, the Lord creates a situation to cause indifference to devotees. Pariksit Maharaj, he was busy doing his duty of ruling the world and in the course of doing his duty, he was engaged in so many different material activities in the kingdom. But the Lord wants him to give up all those material attachments. So, what the Lord do? He created a situation. The Supreme Lord never forgets his pure devotee even though that pure devotee may be engaged in so-called worldly affairs. Sometimes he creates an awkward situation and the devotee becomes obliged to renounce all worldly

affairs. It happened to Pariksit. Now, the devotee can understand by the signal of the Lord that it is the Lord's intervention in the life of the devotee, but others, the common people, they take it to be unfavorable, frustrating. They don't understand the hand of the Lord is there in the life of Pariksit, that he became very thirsty and fatigued. They don't think that the Lord has created a situation or they don't understand the point. Maharaj Pariksit was to become the medium for the revelation of Shreemad Bhagavatam by Lord Sri Krishna. As the example is given, Pariksit's grandfather Arjuna was a medium for Bhagavad Gita to be spoken by Krishna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. So, Pariksit's grandfather is Arjuna. Arjuna actually was a devotee of Krishna and contemporary of Krishna also. But for Krishna to speak Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna, Krishna created some situation. That Prabhupada explains. Had Arjuna not been taken up with an illusion of family affection by the will of the Lord, the Bhagavad Gita would not have been spoken by the Lord himself for the good of all concerned. Actually, Arjuna was not in need of Bhagavad Gita. Nor is he a Bhagavad Gita. He is a pure devotee. But Krishna created a situation where Arjuna became afflicted by lamentation. And in that state of lamentation, he inquired from Krishna and Krishna spoke the Bhagavad Gita.

**Key Quote:** "Had Pariksit Maharaj not been fatigued, hungry and thirsty, then Bhagavatam would not have been spoken by Shukadev Goswami."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that Pariksit Maharaj's fatigue and thirst were instrumental in creating the circumstances for Shukadeva Goswami to speak the Bhagavatam, thus benefiting all.

Through Arjuna, Krishna wanted to enlighten the whole world. Similarly, had Pariksit Maharaj not been fatigued, hungry, and thirsty, then Bhagavatam would not have been spoken by Shukadev Goswami. So therefore, in order that Shukadev Goswami speak Bhagavatam for our benefit through Pariksit Maharaj, Pariksit Maharaj apparently became extremely hungry, thirsty, and fatigued. And it led to some more events because of which he gave up his kingdom and sat and heard the Bhagavad Gita. So that is the prelude for the Bhagavatam in these two verses. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of the lecture, explaining that it is based on the 26th verse of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, and draws a parallel between the conversation between Arjuna and Krishna leading to the Bhagavad Gita and the inquiries of Pariksit Maharaj and the answers of Shukadeva Goswami constituting the Srimad Bhagavatam.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Deviim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 26th verse of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This chapter is actually a prelude for the Srimad Bhagavatam itself to be spoken by Shukadeva Goswami. Prelude means an introduction. How certain events led to the meeting of Pariksit Maharaj and Shukadeva Goswami, and Pariksit inquired from Shukadeva Goswami, and Shukadeva Goswami replied to Pariksit's questions, spoke the introduction. The entire Srimad Bhagavatam. That's a wonderful position of the Bhagavatam, the Srimad Bhagavatam. Just like the conversation between Arjuna and Krishna led to the Srimad Bhagavad Gita, the scripture called Bhagavad Gita. Similarly, inquiries by Pariksit Maharaj and the answers by Shukadeva Goswami constitute the entire Srimad Bhagavatam.

**Key Quote:** "But what was the real state of consciousness that is very precisely described in this verse?"
**Summary:** The speaker reads the translation of the 26th verse, emphasizing its technical description of the state of consciousness of Samika Rishi during meditation.

The 26th verse. The meaning of this verse is the muni's sense organs, breath, mind, and intelligence were all restrained from material action. They were all restrained from physical activity, and he was situated in a trance apart from the three, wakefulness, dream, and unconsciousness, having achieved a transcendental position qualitatively equal with the supreme absolute. So, this is a very, very technical description of the state of consciousness. In the passage of the books, there is an analysis of Samika Rishi. He was externally, he appeared to be just sitting and doing some meditation. That's all. The way King Pariksit saw him in his ashram, in Samika Muni's ashram, he saw Samika Rishi sitting in meditation. But what was the real state of consciousness that is very precisely described in this verse?

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the meaning of the verse, explaining how the senses, breath, mind, and intelligence are restrained from material activities in spiritual practice.

So, just before I go to the purport, let me just re-read the translation with sufficient pause for each of the different portions of this wonderful translation. The muni's sense organs, indriya, prathiruddha indriya. Prathiruddha means it was restrained. From what? Restrained from what? From material engagement, from material contact, from material activities. It is just like our eyes or ears. Generally, what are they engaged in? In seeing material objects. In hearing different kinds of material sounds. So, they are engaged materially. That's a normal condition of any person in this world. But, those who are interested in spiritual life, in spiritual experience, they want to stop this material engagement and completely engage. Engage spiritually. So, the spiritual engagement is possible provided, first of all, we practice controlling, restraining these senses and gradually elevate these senses to the spiritual position, spiritual platform. So, first of all, the muni's sense organs. First of all, the muni's sense organs are restrained. Prathiruddha indriya. Then, prana, his breath. Then, manaha, the mind. Buddhi, the intelligence. So, the sense organs we know. Eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and sense of touch. And breathing. We know the breathing. We breathe in and breathe out. That actually activates our prana, the vital air that is circulating in this body and keeping this body alive and in a working condition. The breath. And then the mind. And intelligence. Manasa and Buddhi.

**Key Quote:** "He was situated in a state apart from the three states of consciousness."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of trance and introduces the three states of consciousness: wakefulness, dream, and unconsciousness, focusing on the wakeful state.

All these four were restrained from material activities, and he was situated in a trance. What is this trance? Param. Praptam. He was situated in a trance. Param Praptam. No, that's not Param Praptam. Situated in a trance is sthanatrayat. He was situated in a state apart from the three states of consciousness. Now, in the scriptures it is explained, as spirit soul, we are conscious beings. We have got consciousness or awareness. Just like now I am aware of all my surroundings through my eyes, through my ears I hear some sounds which are produced outside. I see objects with these eyes. I am conscious. I am in a room. I am speaking to an audience who are hearing me. Explain the Bhagavatam words, etc. So this is the state of consciousness called wakeful state.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "These five senses are the gateway for our interaction with the outside world."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the dream state, explaining how the external interaction is stopped and the five senses are shut off.

Then there is the dream state. Swapna avastha. When we go to sleep at night, then you are aware, every night we experience this, but we become unaware of our external surroundings. Our external surroundings we become unaware. We don't know what is happening outside. So that is the state when we go to sleep and we are fast asleep. So then in that sleeping state, there are two different states of consciousness. One is called a dream state and other is called an unconscious state. Dream state is called in Sanskrit, swapna avastha. Swapna means dream. So in English it is translated by Prabhupada, swapna avastha is translated as dream state. So wakeful state, dream state and a third state, which is the other state in the sleeping condition, unconscious state. Sometimes it is called also as a deep sleep state. That means there is no awareness of a dream, but there is no awareness externally also. This dream state is where we enter a subtle world. That means the spirit soul inside this body is experiencing a certain state of awareness. State of awareness. So wakeful state is the state where basically the mind is interacting through the five senses with everything outside. And the dream state is where the external interaction is stopped because we go to sleep. Normally it is with closed eyes. And then not only we have closed our eyes, but we have also lost our touch or awareness of the external world. And basically the five senses. These five senses are the gateway for our interaction with the outside world. Is it not? So that is cut off when you go to sleep. And then in the sleeping something more happens. Not just merely closing the eyes or shutting the ears or shutting the breathing. No. Shutting the sense of smelling. Not breathing. Sense of smelling. Breathing goes on even when you are asleep. The sense of smelling is shut off kind of. So these five senses are shut off when we sleep.

**Key Quote:** "That dream world is a subtle world."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to describe the dream state as a subtle world experienced through the mind, and introduces the unconscious state.

When we are in the dreaming state, we are aware or conscious of a dream world. We enter a dream world. That dream world is a subtle world. Subtle world means there are no gross objects. There are no objects for the five senses. It is just the mind which is active and is through the mind. Through the mind we perceive a subtle world. And in that subtle world so many things happen. Just like after waking up from sleep, sometimes we remember while I was sleeping I experienced a dream or I witnessed a dream. I had a dream. Most people can relate with this. Of course you should remember, you should understand that always we don't remember the dream that we experience when we wake up. We don't always remember. Sometimes we remember. But it's a fact that every night when we go to sleep then we get into a dream state and we also experience a we are unconscious with some time. Sometimes we are dreaming and sometimes we are unconscious. Both are there. For everyone.

**Key Quote:** "But subtle experience is there, that is there in the dream state"
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of not remembering all incidents in the wakeful state to explain why we don't always remember our dreams, emphasizing the subtle experience in the dream state.

But we don't always remember the dream. Sometimes we remember. Just like to give you an example if I ask you ten days back in your wakeful state can you tell me at this time exactly what happened? Now it is 7.40 pm so exactly ten days back 7.40 pm what were you doing? Immediately you will not be able to recall. Even if you try to recall by going back ten days what was the day of the week? I should have been doing this. I must have been in this place. You try to build up the facts and then you try to still recollect anything significant happened you may try to extrapolate or build it up but you can't exactly remember that this particular thing happened unless it was something very very very significant something very unusual something very very different from the normal happening in our day to day life. So like that all dreams we don't remember. Similarly all just like all incidents in the wakeful state we don't remember. Similarly all dreams we don't remember. So dreaming is definitely there every time we go to sleep but all dreams we don't remember. Extraordinary dreams supposing one particular night you had a very bad dream or a very good dream good and bad in relative terms of course dream is a dream that's all grossly nothing is happening neither anything in your external world is getting disturbed but subtle experience is there that is there in the dream state.

So that is dream state and unconscious state. Unconscious state is the state in which you are not aware of the dream world and you are not aware of the external gross world also you are unconscious of both these worlds that is called the unconscious state. So we will discuss this in one more session the next session also the same verse we will continue discussing and understand this a little more in a detailed way. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Apart from these three, there is a fourth state consciousness... a state of trance also called samadhi also called the transcendental state of awareness"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the concept of four states of consciousness: wakeful, dreaming, unconscious, and transcendental, focusing on the fourth state of trance or samadhi.

In this session, we continue to discuss from the 26th verse of the 18th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. This is part two of the discussion on the 26th verse. The previous session also we discussed the same verse. We continue discussing. I was explaining in the previous session the three states of consciousness. The three states of consciousness, out of the four totally, we can be, as a living being, spirit soul, we can have four states of consciousness. Consciousness means awareness. So I can be conscious in the wakeful state, like the present state all of us are now. You are awake and you are conscious of everything external. And you have to some extent some internal awareness also, just like your breathing. You are conscious in this state. You have an inner moment of the air inside your canal, et cetera. So, that is wakeful state, normal state when you are awake. And then up the sleeping state, there are two different states of consciousness in the sleeping state: the dreaming and the unconscious state. This I explained in the previous session. And apart from these three, there is a fourth state of consciousness, the dream state of consciousness, which is above the three states, that is what is described here.

**Key Quote:** "In the wakeful state, the dreaming state and the unconscious state... you are not aware about yourself as a spirit soul, you are not aware of any other spiritual reality."
**Summary:** The lecture elaborates on the limitations of the first three states of consciousness, emphasizing the lack of spiritual awareness and how yoga can help one attain the fourth state.

A state of trance, also called samadhi, also called the transcendental state of awareness. You are not just aware of the gross world, you are not just aware of the subtle world inside, or you are not just unconscious of the two, but you are conscious of yourself as the spirit soul and anything further beyond the awareness of yourself as spirit, something more, the spiritual dimension of reality, which is otherwise totally kind of unknown. In the wakeful state, the dreaming state, and the unconscious state, that's called Jagrata Avastha, Swapna Avastha, and Sushupti Avastha, you are not aware about yourself as a spirit soul, you are not aware of any other spiritual reality. What are the other spiritual realities apart from yourself? Every person, every living being is a spirit soul. But when you see the person, you just see the body. At the most, you may recognize the person's state of mind. He is happy, he is sad, or he appears to be lost in some thought, etc., etc., like that. So, or if the person is sleeping, you know he is sleeping. So, he doesn't respond to what is happening in the outside world. So, the person is either in dreaming state or unconscious state. But you are not... You are not aware of something called as a spiritual state of consciousness or awareness, that you do not know. We know only from the scriptures. So, by practice of yoga, one can actually restrain the sense organs, the breathing, the mind, and the intelligence.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that spiritual awareness is unique to humans and discusses how the Supreme Lord is always in a transcendental state, while conditioned souls are trapped in lower states of consciousness due to material contact.

And situate oneself in the fourth state of consciousness, the highest state of consciousness. And this is possible only for human beings. And it is the state where you are spiritually aware. You are spiritually aware. So, the Muni, Shamika Rishi, was in his spiritual state of consciousness. And in that state, what happens? He had achieved a transcendental position qualitatively equal with the Supreme Absolute. The Lord, the Supreme Lord Krishna, Supreme Absolute Truth, is always in the transcendental state of awareness or consciousness, always, eternally. He is always in that state. We, when we are in the material world, when we are in material contact, when we are materially conditioned, when we got this material body and we got material desires and we are interacting with material sense objects, material... Yeah. material objects, then we are in the three lower states of consciousness. That's only for us, conditioned souls, living entities in this material world. It's not for living entities in the spiritual world. It is not for the Supreme Lord, because that is inconsequential spiritually, spiritually it is not important. What are the happenings in this material world, in terms of material interactions,

**Summary:** Using the analogy of a dream, the speaker illustrates how material experiences do not affect spiritual reality and that the material condition is spiritually inactive.

that's not of any consequence spiritually. It's just like when you are dreaming, you are experiencing the dream in your sleep, but externally is anything happening, what you are seeing in the dream? No. Nothing is happening. Hmm. The dream, you may either be happy or you may be sad. You may win some money or you may lose something else. But when you wake up, you say, oh, it is just a dream. So there is no loss, there is no gain. As far as your wakeful state is concerned, in the dream, whatever happens, there is neither any loss nor any gain. So that... Similarly. Similarly, from the spiritual perspective, whatever happens in the material condition is actually not affecting the spiritual reality or the spiritual position. So we can say this material condition, whether somebody is awake or sleeping, the material condition itself is like spiritually inactive. Hmm. Spiritually ignorant, spiritually unaware, spiritually not conscious, not spiritually conscious. You can say materially conscious only. Hmm. So the Muni had achieved a transcendental position in the same level as the Supreme Lord. Hmm.

#### yogic trance, jnana, ashtanga yoga, bhakti yoga

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The transcendental position is attained by three processes... The process of Jnana... the process of yoga... the most approved process of bhakti yoga"
**Summary:** The lecture introduces three processes for achieving the transcendental state: Jnana (theoretical knowledge), Ashtanga Yoga (physiological and psychological manipulation), and Bhakti Yoga (devotional service).

Now, in the Sthapotshrita, Prabhupada explains, it appears that the Muni in whose hermitage the king entered was in yogic trance. It's called yogic trance. Through practice of yoga, he had achieved this trance. Hmm. The transcendental position is attained by three processes. There are three recognized processes for achieving this transcendental state of consciousness. What are the three processes? The process of Jnana. The first process is called Jnana, called the process of jnana or theoretical knowledge of transcendence by study of the Vedic literature, by discussions, by deep study of the Vedic literature describing this particular state of transcendental state of existence. Or the second process is a process of yoga. Yoga here refers to ashtanga yoga, specifically refers to ashtanga yoga or factual realization of trance by manipulation of the physiological and psychological functions of the body. Physiological condition as a function of the body is called ashtanga yoga. Or the function is all the external sense organs, the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, etc. All those manipulate means restrain them from material activity and psychological function of the body is thinking, feeling, willing in terms of the use of the mind and the intelligence. So restrain the mind and intelligence from all kinds of material thoughts, material feelings, and material willing, the urge to do something material, restrain that the mind and the intelligence. And by doing so, one is able to actually rise above the three states of consciousness to the fourth state of trance, to the avastha. That's called turiya, means actually literally means the fourth state. The fourth state is the transcendental state of consciousness. And the third process for achieving this trance is the most approved process of bhakti yoga. And what is bhakti yoga? Bhakti yoga means engagement of senses in the devotional service of the Lord, which he came or she cases even a book, the Richard now Prabhupada explains that further.

**Key Quote:** "This verse says the working senses are superior to dull matter working senses and the mind is higher than the senses mind is above the senses and the intelligence is still higher than the mind and the soul is higher than the intelligence."
**Summary:** Referencing the Bhagavad Gita, the speaker explains the hierarchy of perception from dull matter to the soul and how the influence of material qualities causes forgetfulness of our true spiritual identity.

Now Prabhupada explains that further. In the Bhagavad Gita also we have information of the gradual development of perception matter to a living entity the Bhagavad Gita verses indriyani paranyahu indriyebhyaparamanah manasastu paraabuddhi yo buddhe paratastu saha this towards the end of the third chapter this verse in the Bhagavad Gita describes this 42nd verse of the third chapter. So. This verse says the working senses are superior to dull matter working senses and the mind is higher than the senses mind is above the senses and the intelligence is still higher than the mind and the soul is higher than the intelligence. There is a hierarchy. There is a hierarchy. The soul below the soul is the intelligence below the intelligence is the mind below the mind is the senses and below the senses is dull matter. So Prabhupada explains that our material mind and body developed from the living entity the soul and being influenced by the three qualities of matter we forget our real identity three qualities of matter that sattva guna, rajo guna, tamo guna. The influence of the material body. The influence of the material energy on the consciousness we forget we are spirit soul we are not aware we forget ourselves we forget Krishna we forget all spiritual reality.

**Key Quote:** "The jnana process theoretically speculates about the reality of the soul... but bhakti yoga factually engages the spirit soul in activities"
**Summary:** The lecture contrasts the speculative nature of the Jnana process with the practical engagement of the senses in devotional service (Bhakti Yoga), using chanting Hare Krishna as an example.

The jnana process theoretically speculates about the reality of the soul. Jnana process, they keep on trying to eliminate all material varieties, all material things, or material experiences, or material awareness. They try to negate that it's not spirit, it's not spiritual, this is not spiritual, that's not spiritual, etc. And then what is if spirit soul is not this, not that, not this, not that, what it is? They speculate, they try to eliminate all the negatives and thereby try to postulate or theorize. Therefore it is a theory. It is a theory. It is a theory. They are theoretically arriving at the reality of the soul, but bhakti yoga factually engages the spirit soul in activities. Bhakti yoga is not speculation, it is actual engagement of the senses in the devotional service of Krishna, just like chanting Hare Krishna, you actually vibrate your tongue and produce the sound Hare Krishna Hare Krishna and you hear the sound Krishna through your ears and you do so by by engaging a sense of touch in counting on japa beads so engaging the senses the sense of speaking the sense of hearing and the sense of touch three senses you engage in a definite activity called chanting japa and that is a spiritual activity so engaging the spirit soul in activities spiritual activities that is a bhakti yoga process.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses how to transcend matter by becoming aware of the limitations of the senses, using examples like mirages and the perceived size of the sun, ultimately leading to realization of the soul.

The perception of matter is transient is still subtler states of the senses. Just like normally when we see something we just aware of that object we are seeing we're not conscious that my eyes I am seeing the object and through my sense of understanding or knowing I am perceiving that object to be something so we are not aware of that when we become aware of the whole process of seeing just like if somebody is looking at a distance in a desert when they are walking they see at a distance there is a body of water that may not be a body of water because when they approach that there is no body of water it appears like at a distance of some 50 feet there is a body of water but when they cross 50 feet while walking there is no body of water it looked like there was a body of water that's called a mirage it's a optical vision optical illusion so that optical illusion when they become aware of that then they become aware of the defectiveness or the limitation of this sense of seeing like the Sun when it is rising you look in the horizon if you need to see the Sun it will appear a disc this big that's all that's all it will appear this big a disc but is the Sun that big no it's an optical illusion so this way you transcend the matter to perceive the senses the senses you transcend to subtle mind and mind to the intelligence and intelligence to ultimately realize the soul so this is the process and the Muni was sitting in that particular state of trance so I'll stop here thank you very much Hare

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the description of the sage and the king's request for water, highlighting the unexpected nature of the event.

He entered inside and saw the sage is sitting in meditation. And the way King Pariksit saw the muni is being described here further, that the sage, that is Shamika Rishi, who was sitting in meditation, was covered by skin of a stanchion. These rishis, they don't wear regular clothes because they are in the forest. So, the sage was sitting in meditation, so they cover themselves with some skin of an animal or a bark of a tree, something easily available, and that need not be changed, that need not be washed, just because they sit for meditation for a very long time. So, they have no time to maintain all those things, and long compressed hair was scattered all over him. There's no time to trim the hair or shave, etc., so the compressed hair is everywhere over his body. And this King Parikshit, he was very, very thirsty, so thirsty that his palate or his tongue was completely dry, and he entered and he asked for water because he was very, very thirsty. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "The king being thirsty asked the sage for water," something very natural and very simple, "that such a great devotee and King asked for water from a sage absorbed in trance was certainly providential," something unexpected, something not expected from a

Obviously, you don't expect the Rishi will be, when he's sitting in meditation and deeply absorbed in meditation, you don't expect him to be conscious that some guest has come or somebody has come asking for water, you wouldn't expect that. So, and in spite of that, because the king was very, very, very thirsty, he's desperately looking for water, so he just asked, just asked. So, it is something which is extraordinary because Prabhupada says here, "otherwise there was no chance of such a unique happening." It is very, very unique. This is an incident arranged by the Supreme Lord for Bhagavatam to be spoken by Shukadev Goswami on enquiry of Parikshit Maharaj. All these descriptions are events leading to that extraordinary meeting of Parikshit and Shukadev Goswami, leading to the Srimad Bhagavatam being spoken.

This is describing King Parikshit. What was his reaction? He thought, "I have come to his Muni's ashram, and the Muni is not angry. He is not responding. He is indifferent to my having come here. He is not offering a seat or place to sit down, no welcome, and no water and no sweet talk." So, he considered that "I have been neglected. Very basic etiquette is not being followed.

**Key Quote:** "The law of reception in the courts of the Vedic principles state that even if an enemy is received at home he must be received with all respects."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the Vedic principles of hospitality, emphasizing that even enemies should be treated with respect, and provides the example of Jarasandha's reception of Krishna, Arjuna, and Bhima.

and he became angry. So, Prabhupada explains in the purport, so the background for this verse being this, this description by Suta Goswami. The law of reception in the courts of the Vedic principles state that even if an enemy is received at home, he must be received with all respects. This is the Vedic culture. Whoever it is, when they come to your house, enemy or friend, a stranger or a known person, you have to receive that person with all respect. This is very important. After you get to the be all respects, the visitor should not be given a chance to understand that he has come into the house of an enemy if he happens to be an enemy. And proper gives an example here, when Lord Krishna, accompanied by Arjuna and Bhima, approached Jarasandha in Magadha, the respectable enemies were given a royal reception by King Jarasandha. Enemy means enemy camp. Jarasandha belongs to the camp of the Asuras headed by Kamsa, and Krishna, Arjuna, Bhima, the Pandavas, they belong to the camp of devotees and Supreme Lord, obviously. So, when Krishna, Arjuna, and Bhima approached Jarasandha, they were in disguise. So, even though they were in disguise, when Jarasandha tried to inquire, "Who are you?" because he could not recognize their external features, they disguised themselves. So, then when they reveal their identity, still Jarasandha understood, "These are my enemies," but still he received them with a royal reception. This is very cultural. And it is also told in the Mahabharata, the guest enemy, namely Bhima, was to fight with Jarasandha, that the purpose for which Krishna, Bhima, and Arjuna had gone, and yet they were given a grand reception. So, at night they used to sit down together as friends and guests, and in the daytime they used to fight, risking life and death. That was a law of reception in their fighting and

**Summary:** The speaker continues to elaborate on Vedic etiquette, explaining that even the poorest person can offer basic hospitality, and highlights King Parikshit's astonishment at being denied even basic courtesies.

one of them will be defeated and killed. Still, that is only due to the daytime the fight is going on, Bhima versus Jarasandha. At night the fight is not concluded at the end of day one, day two, day three, four, for so many days. So, when the fight has not been decided, they at the night they will be like Bhima, Arjuna, and Krishna are guests of Jarasandha. So, they'll be nicely given a place to stay, they'll be given a nice food, nice talk, everything very nice. Now, further Prabhupada says, the Vedic etiquette, the reception law enjoins that a poor man was nothing to offer his guest, very poor, should be good enough to offer a straw mat for sitting, a glass of water for drinking, and some sweet words. So, Prabhupada says, therefore, to receive a guest, either a friend or foe, somebody is an enemy, not an enemy, is a friendly person, there is no expense. It is only a question of good manners. Very culture is the poorest of poor man, when he receives somebody at home, he still offers a good reception simply by offering a straw mat. Straw mat means some straws which are available anywhere, they just woven together and made into a sitting mat. So, straw mat, some water to drink, water is available everywhere, you know, poor man is plenty of water. Earlier there is to live always by a water source, either a river or a nice pond or lake or a nice well, and plenty of water always there is water. So, water even a poorest of poor man can offer, a straw mat he can offer to the guest, he can offer sweet words, "Welcome to my humble abode, please come sit down, accept some water, what can I do for you?" So, sweet words can be offered without any expense. So, it is question of good manners. Now, Prabhupada explains, when Maharaj Pariksit entered the door of Shamika Rishi, he did not expect a royal reception by the Rishi because he knew that saints and Rishis are not material rich persons, they are living in an ashram, they are not material rich persons, they are living in an ashram, they are living in an ashram, they are not material rich persons, they are living in an ashram, some hut, and where can they offer royal reception? Even the king, because King deserves a royal reception, but how can they offer a royal reception? So, Pariksit did not expect a royal reception, but he never expected that a seed of straw, a glass of water, and some sweet words would be denied to him. He was not an ordinary guest, nor was he an enemy of the Rishi, and therefore the cold reception with the Rishi was not an ordinary guest, nor was he an enemy of the Rishi, and therefore the cold reception with the Rishi was not an ordinary guest, nor was he an enemy of the Rishi, and astonished the King greatly. Why am I astonished the King greatly? Why am I being denied even some basic reception? I being denied even some basic reception? I just want some water, that's all, and even just want some water, that's all, and even that water is being denied by this Rishi.

**Key Quote:** "It must be accepted that this situation was ordained by the supreme will of Lord Krishna...the merciful Lord sometimes creates such awkward position for his pure devotees in order to drag the pure devotee towards himself."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the situation was ordained by the Lord to detach Parikshit from material attachments and draw him closer, and that devotees should accept frustrations as blessings.

That's what thinking of Pariksit Maharaj is. So, going by the etiquette that is expected, the king was right to get angry with the Rishi when he needed a glass of water very badly. So, Papa says in the elecmosis, to become angry in such a grave situation was not unnatural for the king, but this special circumstance here, what is that? Because the King himself was not less than a great saint, he was saintly king, rajarshi. Pariksit was not ordinary king, his becoming angry and taking action were astonishing. Very the muni is sitting in trance, he is engaged in spiritual activities, he is cut off from external sense perception, he is absorbed within completely, and you expect that such a meditating sage, he's going to offer you some reception, he's going to give some water, he's conscious that you have come to his ashram? No. So, why is King Pariksit becoming angry? That is a question that should be raised. So, proper says it must be accepted that this situation was ordained by the supreme will of Lord Krishna. The king was a great devotee of the Lord, and the saint, that is Samika Rishi, was also as good as the king in saintly conduct, but by the will of the Lord, the circumstances are so created that they became ways to the kings becoming unattached to family connection and governmental activities and thus becoming a surrendered soul unto the lotus feet of Lord Krishna. The events led to that, and that we described in the next few verses. The merciful Lord sometimes creates such awkward position for his pure devotees in order to drag the pure devotee towards himself from the mire of material existence. Mire means that entangling situations in this material world. The Lord wants to pull out every one of us, but the pure devotees is particularly conscious, "Come out quickly out of this material existence and come back to me." Outwardly, the situations appear to be frustrating to the devotees, but the devotees of the Lord are always under the protection of the Lord, and in any condition, frustration of success, the Lord is a supreme guide for the devotees. Devotees understand if there is some frustrating situation, they know it is the arrangement of the Lord. Lord has got a higher plan, otherwise the devotees are never put in frustrating situation in inconvenience, they execute the devotional service peacefully, but sometimes in spite of their endeavor to execute devotional service, they put in a situation where is difficulty even for doing devotional service, and that is the Lord has got a higher plan. Devotees therefore accept all conditions of frustration as blessings from the Lord, and that's what happened in the case of Parikshit Maharaj. I'll stop here.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the unprecedented nature of a devotee king like Parikshit becoming angry and envious towards a sage, highlighting the rarity of such an event.

The meaning of this 29th verse: O Brahmanas, this is Suta Goswami addressing the sages of Naimisharanya while describing the incidents leading to Parikshit Maharaj becoming angry at the Shamika Rishi. So the king's anger and envy directed toward the Brahmana sage were unprecedented, being that circumstances had made him hungry and thirsty. Unprecedented means such a thing has never happened in the past. A devotee king approaching a Brahmana sage who is absorbed in meditation, expecting that I will get some reception, I will get some water, I will get some relief from my thirst, when he was extremely thirsty and hungry, not getting anything, he became frustrated, he became angry, so this is unprecedented. The Parpochala Prabhupada says, for a king like Maharaj Parikshit to become angry and enraged, envious especially at a sage and Brahmana, was undoubtedly unprecedented. Never has such a thing happened in the past. It is very, very, very rare.

**Key Quote:** "The king knew well that Brahmanas, sages, children, women and old men are always beyond the jurisdiction of punishment."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the Vedic cultural context where the king protects citizens, especially Brahmanas, sages, children, women, and old men, who are given special care and are generally exempt from punishment.

It is, as they say, rarest of rare situations, extraordinary situation. The king knew well that Brahmanas, sages, children, women, and old men are always beyond the jurisdiction of punishment. This is again the Vedic culture that a king protects his citizens very nicely, and among the citizens he gives special care and protection to five categories of the citizens. Who are they? First is Brahmanas. And that Brahmanas includes the cows also. Brahmanical culture, Govabrahmanahitayacha. Krishna is described as Govabrahmanahitayacha. He is always very much concerned about the well being of Brahmanas and cows. Brahmanahiya means those who are devotees. Second is Sages. Sages are saintly persons, those who are dedicated for spiritual life, Sanyasis or Rishis or Trans-Elders of any kind, Yogis, etc. So they are also given special protection by the king. They are dedicated completely for spiritual life. A Brahmana is dedicated for the giving the service in the society to the other classes of people, the Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras. They always depend on the Brahmanas for getting spiritual guidance, for any spiritual duties, for any rituals to be performed, for any spiritual knowledge, etc.

**Key Quote:** "The third category of protection special protection for citizens is the children."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to elaborate on the king's responsibility to protect vulnerable groups like children, women (especially widows and orphans), and the elderly, even overlooking minor mistakes they might make.

The third category of protection, special protection for citizens, is the children. The children are small so they have to be given extra protection, and women. Women are naturally the weaker section of the society, the men are stronger, so women require special protection. Generally they are protected by their husbands or father or grown up sons, but in case somebody is all alone then the king must be protected, then the king must give special protection for such women who don't have a husband or they are a widow or they are somehow an orphan or they are they are not able to get any protection from any of the elders then the king has to give special protection for such women and old men, very aged and they don't have a guardian, they don't have grown up son or they don't have a guardian who can protect them, so king has to give special protection for such categories of people and not only he gives protection but he also understands if they make a mistake it is pardonable because they are in a special category so they are to be given a concession that they make some small mistake you just don't apply the law for such categories of personalities.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the concept that a king is generally not considered a wrongdoer, even if he makes mistakes, and emphasizes that the situation with Parikshit Maharaj was orchestrated by the Lord.

Similarly, the king, even though he commits a great mistake, is never to be considered a wrong doer. So on one side is Shamika Rishi who is a saintly person, he should never be punished even if he has made a mistake, he has not done a mistake, even if he has done a mistake he is not punishable by the king. Other side is the king, the king can do no wrong, the king can do no wrong. See, even Shamika Rishi should not have become, not Shamika Rishi, in this case the Shamika Rishi's son should not have become angry at the king because king being the protector and the well wisher of all the citizens, if he makes a minor mistake that should be excused by everyone else. So king is never considered a wrong doer. In this case Maharaj Pariksit became angry and envious at the sage due to his thirst and hunger by the will of the lord. So here the will of the lord, the lord is arranging the situation.

**Key Quote:** "The only justification for Maharaj Pariksit's behaviour is that he was it was ordained by the lord."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that Parikshit's unusual behavior was arranged by the Lord, and that the king's actions, though seemingly wrong, were part of a divine plan.

Extraordinary situation for Bhagavatam we spoke. So the king was right to punish his subject for coldly receiving him or neglecting him, but because the culprit was a sage and a brahmana it was unprecedented. Normal person if he does not receive the king properly in order to teach that person a lesson that you should receive people properly he may give him some punishment, but not in the case of this brahmana who is sitting in sage, sitting in meditation. As the lord is never envious of anyone so also the lord's devotee is never envious of anyone. So Maharaj Pariksit is a devotee, he can't be envious at the sage, not out of envy he became angry. The only justification for Maharaj Pariksit's behaviour is that he was, it was ordained by the lord. The lord arranged this Pariksit's unusual behaviour and the brahmana's son Karsing that we will hear later what happened after this.

**Key Quote:** "Although the king was never accustomed to such silly actions, why should he take so seriously the sage not receiving him under the circumstances?"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Parikshit's action of placing the dead snake was a 'tit for tat' response to feeling insulted, but emphasizes that this behavior was unprecedented for a devotee king dealing with a sage and was ultimately orchestrated by the Lord.

So Prabhupada says that in the purport, the king thus treated the sage tit for tat. You didn't receive me properly so I also want to teach you a lesson that you are neglecting basic etiquette. So he took one dead snake and put it on the shoulder of the sage and said what is this, he is garlanding the snake at the sage. It is a way of, I was insulted so I also insult you that tit for tat. Although the king was never accustomed to such silly actions, why should he take so seriously the sage not receiving him under the circumstances, I have not been given water and I am very thirsty, do not think like that, but a will of the lord. The king while going away found a dead snake in front of him, again the dead snake, it is not that it is so common to find dead snakes everywhere, no. So one dead snake was there, happened to be there nearby and while going away he thought the sage who had coldly received him might be coldly rewarded by being offered a garland of a dead snake, basically I was insulted so I also insult him, take one dead snake which just happened to be lying there and put it on his shoulder and just go away. In the ordinary course of dealing this was not very unnatural, that means it is expected only if somebody is not received they become angry and they react, but in the case of Maharaj Pariksha dealing with a brahmana sage this was certainly unprecedented, never such a thing would have happened in the interaction between a devotee king and a sage who is a brahmana who is situated in trance, who is very very advanced yogi who is absorbed in meditation, cut off from external awareness, it is not expected such a thing would happen, so it so happened by the will of the lord.

**Key Quote:** "So he said let me prepare for quitting this body by becoming Krishna conscious so therefore he surrendered himself as a disciple to Shukadeva Goswami and thus he was able to understand the actual position of the personality of God."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining how Maharaj Pariksit prepared for death by surrendering to Shukadeva Goswami and becoming Krishna conscious to understand the position of the Lord.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 3rd verse of the 18th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Utsarijya Sarvata Sangam Vijnata Ajita Samsthitihi Vaya Saker Jahu Shishyo Gangayam Swam Kalevaram. The meaning of this verse is, furthermore, after leaving all his associates, the king surrendered himself as a disciple to the son of Vyasa, Shukadeva Goswami, and thus he was able to understand the actual position of the personality of Godhead. So, R. S. Goswami is narrating the events leading to Maharaj Pariksit being cursed by a Braamana boy. So, before describing the actual incident, it is being described here that Pariksit Maharaj, in his life, is charming in a lot of ways. The world, this situation, this incident means that he is... Maharaj, he heard the curse and he decided to prepare for quitting the body, for death by the bite of the snake bird, even though he could have contracted the curse, because he realized that he has to prepare for death whenever death might come. Death cannot be totally avoided when the material body is there. The body cannot be kept forever, this material body. So, death means we'll quit this material body and spirit soul. So, that Parikshit Maharaj knew very well. So, he said, let me prepare for quitting this body by becoming Krishna conscious. So, therefore, he surrendered himself as a disciple to Shukadeva Goswami, and thus he was able to understand the actual position of the personality of

**Key Quote:** "The personality of God Shri Krishna is known as Ajita or unconquerable and he so in every respect this word Ajita is a name of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the significance of the name 'Ajita' for Krishna, emphasizing that the Lord is unconquerable and cannot be understood through mere accumulation of knowledge.

God. So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, the word Ajita is significant here. The personality of God, Shri Krishna, is known as Ajita, or unconquerable, and he... So, in every respect, this word Ajita is a name of the Supreme Lord. Elsewhere in the Bhagavatam, it is described that the Supreme Lord appeared as Ajita when the churning of the milk ocean was going on, it was about to begin, and in order to favor the Devatas who wanted to produce nectar by churning the milk ocean, he assumed the form of a tortoise, Kurma Rupa or Kurma Avatara, the tortoise incarnation. It was Lord Narayana who appeared first as Ajita. He became the Kurma Avatara, and he supported the Mandara mountain on his back, because the Mandara mountain was used as a churning rod by the Devatas and the Asooras to churn the milk ocean and produce nectar. So, that same name is used here to describe the Supreme Lord. Why? Why is he called Ajita? He is unconquerable in every respect. No one can know his actual position. Why is he called Achitha? No one can know his actual position ever. Why is Ajita used? Because Parikshit Maharaj could understand the actual position of the Lord, whose position cannot be understood by people in general, ordinarily. So, the Supreme Lord is unconquerable. He is unconquerable by knowledge also. So, that means if somebody tries to undergo cultivation of knowledge, accumulating knowledge, getting knowledge more and more and more and more of the absolute truth or about God, simply by acquiring knowledge, any amount of knowledge about God, you cannot understand the actual position of God, not possible.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that understanding the Lord's abode, Goloka Vrindavana, and His paraphernalia requires the grace of a spiritual master and humble surrender, not just scholarship or speculation.

Now, Srila Prabhupada further explains, we have heard about his dharma, the Supreme Lord's eternal abode, Goloka Vrindavana. But there are many scholars who interpret this abode in different ways. What is this abode of the Lord, Goloka Vrindavana? Different scholars say, explain it differently. But by the grace of a spiritual master like Shukadev Goswami, unto whom the king gave himself up as a most humble disciple, one is able to understand the actual position of the Lord, his eternal abode, Goloka Vrindavana, and his transcendental paraphernalia in that dharma or abode. These things are very, very confidential knowledge. Such highly confidential knowledge cannot be realized simply by scholarship, simply by speculation, using one's intelligence, you cannot realize this knowledge. It is possible only by the way Parikshit Maharaj surrendered unto the Acharya, Shukadev Goswami. And by the grace of Shukadev Goswami, with the mercy of Shukadev Goswami, being a surrendered disciple, he was able to realize all this knowledge. Knowing the transcendental position of the Lord and the transcendental method by which one can approach the transcendental dharma,

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the understanding of Goloka Vrindavana with the impersonal view of the Mayavadis and the materialistic perspective, highlighting their ignorance of spiritual reality.

the king was confident about his ultimate destination. So this Goloka Vrindavana is not some impersonal situation as the Mayavadis think. The Mayavadis, their philosophy is, God is formless, and if there is any description of kingdom of God, that is also formless. And everything about the Absolute Truth is ultimately without any variegatedness, without any name, without any personality, without any place, without any situation, nothing. So, it is basically some concoction of these Mayavadi philosophers or scholars, what is, what is the kingdom of God, or who is God, or what is the meaning in descriptions of God's form, paraphernalia, his abode, his associates, his qualities, what is the meaning in those descriptions, the Mayavadis don't have any understanding. And the materialists, they simply mock at all spiritual literature as simply some imaginary stories, imaginary stories or some irrelevant literature. Because for them, this material world and material enjoyment, material enjoyment is all in all. They are totally in the darkness of ignorance

**Summary:** The speaker explains that realizing one's eternal nature and destination in Krishna Loka facilitates detachment from material possessions and relationships, as exemplified by Parikshit Maharaj.

as regards spiritual reality. And by the influence of illusion, the materialists accept this material existence as eternal. So, both the materialists and the transcendentalists who are non-devotees, they do not realize what is the personality of Godhead. They do not realize the spiritual variegatedness in the spiritual realm. They do not know what is the abode of the Lord. They do not know that. But Parikshit Maharaj, when he understood the personality of Godhead, he was able to understand the transcendental position of the Lord and the method by which one can approach that transcendental dharma. And the king was confident about his ultimate destination. That means he fixed his destination as I will go back to Krishna Loka, Krishna Dhamma. And by knowing this, he could leave aside everything material, even his own body without any difficulty of attachment. If you know that you don't belong to this world, you know that you have to quit this body sometime, you know that you as spirit-soul are eternal, then what do you do about all this material paraphernalia, the material body, the material possessions, material relationship, what do you do with all that? So, Parikshit Maharaj clearly knew that he has to leave everything at the time of death. So before death comes, he cut off all attachments

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that detachment from material attachments is possible by understanding the superior energy of the Lord and realizing spiritual variety, which requires the grace of a bona fide spiritual master, not just theoretical knowledge.

to all these various things. That will be described in the second canto, how Parikshit Maharaj, Parikshit Maharaj cut off all attachments. Shukadeva Goswami, the description of the meeting of Parikshit Maharaj and Shukadeva Goswami, in that description, there will be details about how Parikshit Maharaj quit his kingdom, gave up all attachments and came to hear from Shukadeva Goswami in the Krishna Katha, in the form of Bhagavad. In the Bhagavad Gita, it is stated, param drishtva nivartate, one can give up all connection with material attachment when one is able to see the param or the superior quality of things. Prabhupada is explaining how Parikshit was able to give up. From Bhagavad Gita, we understand the quality of the Lord's energy that is superior to the material quality of energy and by the grace of a bona fide spiritual master like Shukadeva Goswami, it is quite possible to know everything of the superior energy of the Lord by which the Lord manifests his eternal name, eternal quality, eternal pastimes, eternal paraphernalia and variegatedness. Unless one thoroughly understands this superior or eternal energy of the Lord, it is not possible to leave the material energy. However, one may theoretically speculate on the true nature of the Absolute Truth. See, there are transcendentalists who are not devotees, but they know ultimately Absolute Truth is spiritual. They know that, but they do not know the nature of the Absolute Truth in terms of the spiritual variegatedness. So, because they do not know of the spiritual variegatedness, they are unable to give up this material variety, the material attachments, they are unable to give up. So, Bhagavad Gita says, param drishtva nivartate, one can give up material attachments or material paraphernalia, material connections, material relationships, if one really knows and one realizes what is spiritual variety, what is spiritual abode, what is spiritual name, what is spiritual form, until one realizes that there is no possibility of giving up any of the material varieties. Simply by theoretical knowledge

you cannot. By the grace of Lord Krishna, Maharaj Pariksit was able to receive the mercy of such a personality as Shukadeva Goswami and thus he was able to know the actual position of the unconquerable Lord. It is very difficult to find the Lord through Vedic literatures, but it is very easy to know the Supreme Lord by the mercy of a liberated devotee like Shukadeva Goswami. There is only way and there is no other way. And Pariksit was fortunate to meet Shukadeva Goswami and learn from him and realize the Supreme Lord by the mercy of Shukadeva Goswami. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

The special thing about Bhagavatam is that it gives the details of the incarnation of the activities of the Supreme Lord Krishna, the incarnation of Lord Krishna and particularly those activities which are very very very confidential. The Rasaleela incident is very confidential. So Shreya Prabhupada says this specific pastime of the Lord, this Rasaleela has a special significance. What is significance? Because anyone who properly learns about this particular pastime of the Lord will certainly be dissuaded from mundane sex desire. See if you hear properly about this Leela from the right source then your mundane sex desire is completely destroyed and such a hearer will be placed on the path of sublime devotional service to God.

See the history of Pariksit is when he was in the womb of his mother, one Brahmastra was released by Ashwathama to kill that child in the womb. But Pariksit endured that experience. Endured that extreme heat of the Brahmastra. And if he could endure so much of extreme condition, a little thirst while hunting, why he couldn't endure? That's the argument. The King's distressed condition was certainly unprecedented. The devotees like Maharaj Pariksit are powerful enough to forbear self-distress by the will of the Lord. And they are never disturbed.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of verse 32, highlighting the power of the brahmana boy Sringi and how the influence of Kali led to a decline in Vedic culture and the rise of hatred among different social orders.

So the 32nd verse: Tasyaputro Atitejasvi Viharan Balako Arbhakaihi Rajnagam Praapitam Tatam Shrutvata Tredam Abhravit. The meaning of these 32nd verses: This sage had a son who was very powerful, being a Brahmana's son. While he was playing with inexperienced boys, he heard of his father's distress just occasioned by the king. Then and there, the boys started to play with him. Indeed, In the Purport, Shrila Prabhupada says, "Due to Maharaj Pariksit's good government, even a boy of tender age who was playing with other inexperienced boys could become as powerful as a qualified Brahmana. This boy was known as Sringi, and he achieved good training in Brahmacharya by his father. He could be as powerful as a brahmana even at that age. But because the age of Kali was seeking an opportunity to spoil the culture to heritage of the four orders of life, the inexperienced boy gave a chance for the age of Kali to enter into the field of Vedic culture. Hatred of the lower orders of life began from this brahmana boy under the influence of Kali, and thus cultural life began to dwindle day after day."

**Key Quote:** "We should remember how Kali was trying to enter the kingdom of Pariksit."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on how the degradation of brahmanas allows Kali to influence society and recounts the story of how Maharaj Pariksit initially prevented Kali from entering his kingdom but eventually had to give him shelter in specific places.

So this is the explanation given here, how the age of Kali things deteriorate to earth. To a great extent, that the brahmanas who are supposed to be the head of the society, they become degraded and they look down upon the other sections of society. Just like this boy, he wrongly thinks that he is the head of the society. He thought that the king had overstepped his position and he cursed the king. That's going to be explained later in the next few verses. He shouldn't have cursed the king, but he did so. And it happened under the influence of Kali. He was still seeking a chance to enter into the field of Vedic culture, as Shrila Prabhupada says here. The first victim of brahmanical injustice was Maharaj Pariksit. And thus, the protection given by the king against the onslaught of Kali was slackened. We should remember how Kali was trying to enter the kingdom of Pariksit. And Pariksit prevented that by, first of all, threatening to kill Kali because Kali Purusha was harming the coven bull. And when Kali Purusha surrendered, Pariksit Maharaj had to give shelter as a king. So he said, you cannot stay in my kingdom because you are a friend of a religion. And then Kali Purusha was... Kali Purusha was given, still, when he begged for some place, he was given four places, places where meat-eating, intoxication, gambling and illicit sex are going on. And Kali Purusha could not find any such place in Pariksit's kingdom. So good was Pariksit's rule. And then Kali Purusha was given a fifth place when he couldn't find any place. He was given the place where gold was found, and gold is accumulated without being used for spiritual purposes. And that way Kali Purusha was given some place. But even then, Pariksit protected the citizens by engaging their stored-up wealth, stored-up gold in Sankirtan Yagna.

**Key Quote:** "If we want to protect ourselves against the evil influence of Kali, we should employ 50% of our wealth in propagating Sankirtana."
**Summary:** The speaker suggests using wealth for Sankirtan to protect against Kali's influence, then transitions to discussing verse 33 and Shringi's anger at Maharaj Pariksit's actions.

If we want to protect ourselves against the evil influence of Kali, we should employ 50% of our wealth in propagating Sankirtana. So this way Kali cannot influence the people of this age. So here, the description is that Maharaj Pariksit was the victim of Brahmanical injustice. Wrongly, he was cursed. And that's how the onslaught of Kali was slacked through this injustice. The 33rd words, Aho Adharma Palaanam. Peevnam Balibhujamiva. Swamin Yagam Yad Dasanam. Dvarapanam Shunamiva. The meaning of this 33rd verse is, The Brahmana's son Shungi said, "Oh, just look at the sins of the rulers who, like crows and watchdogs at the door, perpetrate sins against their mothers, contrary to the principles governing servants."

#### social order, varnashrama, brahmanas as head, scientific caste system, guna and karma
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/XMxOjTKKrGM?t=472
**Verse References:** BG 4.13
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Brahmanas are considered to be the head and brains of the social body."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the social order (varnashrama), comparing it to the parts of the body, with brahmanas as the head and kshatriyas as the arms, and emphasizes that the system is based on quality (guna) and work (karma), referencing the Bhagavad Gita.

Contrary to the principles governing servants. So Shungi, this Brahmana's son, when he heard that his father was insulted by the king, who put a dead snake around his father's neck, so he became very, very angry. And what is he saying? Look at these rulers. What is their position? They are like crows and watchdogs at the door of the Brahmanas. And instead of behaving properly as a servant of the Brahmanas, they are perpetrating sins against their masters. So in the Purport, Shrila Prabhupada says, "The Brahmanas are considered to be the head and brains of the social body, and the kshatriyas are considered to be the arms of the social body. The arms are required to protect the body from all harm, but the arms must act according to the directions of the head and brain." See, the comparison is made, the orders, the spiritual orders, or the social orders: Brahmana, kshatriya, vaishya, shudra. They are compared to the four parts of our own body. It's like we have got the head and brain, we got the arms, we have got the belly and we got the legs. So brahmanas are compared to the head and brains of the social body, most important. And kshatriyas are considered to be the arms. So the arms are required to protect the body from all harm, but the arms must act according to the directions of the head and brain. That's how this body is organized. Same way society should be organized like that. That is a natural arrangement made by the supreme order, for it is confirmed in the Bhagavad Gita that four social orders or castes, namely the brahmanas, the kshatriyas, the vaisyas and shudras, are set up according to quality and work done by them. This is the statement of the Bhagavad Gita, the fourth chapter. Krishna explains this. So according to guna and karma it has to be set up. Naturally the son of a brahmana has a good chance to become a brahmana by the direction of his qualified father as the son of a brahmana. The son of a brahmana or a medical practitioner has a very good chance to become a qualified medical practitioner. So the caste system is quite scientific. The son must take advantage of the father's qualification and thus become a brahmana or a medical practitioner and not otherwise. Without being qualified one cannot become a brahmana or a medical practitioner

#### qualification vs. birthright, decline of brahmanas, influence of Kali, loss of respect

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "People are claiming to be brahmanas without being trained, without being qualified. And that is where the whole system has become topsy-turvy."
**Summary:** The speaker criticizes the modern trend of claiming brahminical status based solely on birthright without proper training or qualifications, leading to a decline in respect for brahmanas and a disruption of the social order due to the influence of Kali.

and that is the verdict of all scriptures and social orders. You see, it is true that the son of a brahmana has a good opportunity to learn from his father and become a qualified brahmana. But without the qualification he cannot claim, "I am a brahmana." What is happening nowadays? People are claiming to be brahmanas without being trained, without being qualified. And that is where the whole system has become topsy-turvy. So Prabhupada points out here, "Herein Shrunge, a qualified son of a great brahmana, attained the required brahmanical power both by birth and by training, but he was lacking in culture because he was an inexperienced boy." Even though he was powerful, he was not sufficiently experienced how to utilize the power that he had acquired. By the influence of Kali, the son of a brahmana became puffed up with brahmanical power and thus wrongly compared Maharaj Pariksit to crows and watchdogs. This comparison is completely inappropriate just because this boy, inexperienced boy, was very proud of his brahmanical power. The king is certainly the watchdog of the state in the sense that he keeps vigilant eyes over the border of the state for its protection and defense. But to address him as a watchdog is a sign of a less cultured boy. He is supposed to protect, he is supposed to govern the country or the state or the province, but he cannot be treated like a low-class servant the way Sringi is thinking that the king has become an upstart. Thus the downfall of the brahmanical powers began as they gave importance to birthright without culture. If a brahmana is uncultured then he may wrongly claim to be a brahmana simply by birthright. "I am born in a brahmana family therefore I should be treated as a brahmana." But what about your culture? What about your education? What about your training? What about your qualification? What about your experience? All these are important factors. The downfall of the brahmana caste began in the age of Kali. According to scriptures, 5000 years back Kali Yuga began and that is when unqualified people started claiming this because of birthright that we are brahmanas, we should be respected as brahmanas by all the others. Whereas the others are observing these brahmanas are not qualified and they are wrongly claiming to be brahmanas. So they started losing respect and that is when everything became topsy-turvy. Since brahmanas are the heads of the social order all other orders of society also began to deteriorate.

**Key Quote:** "The brahmana should give directions to the other orders of society which are triyas, vashyas and shudras. But brahmanas themselves are not qualified."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by discussing how the deterioration of brahmanas leads to the decline of the entire social order, emphasizing the importance of qualified brahmanas providing guidance, and mentions the upcoming discussion of Shringi's father's reaction before ending the lecture.

The brahmana should give directions to the other orders of society which are kshatriyas, vaishyas and shudras. But brahmanas themselves are not qualified. How can they give directions, proper directions to the other orders? So the other orders also start deteriorating. This beginning of brahmanical deterioration was highly deplored by the father Shringi as we will find. So what is Shringi's father's reaction that we will see in the next few verses. I will stop here. Thank you. Hare Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the Rishi's son, Shringi, his anger upon hearing of the insult to his father, and his preparation to curse the king.

The son of this Rishi was playing with his playmates. He was a young boy, but he was very nicely trained up as a Brahmana. So when the son of this Rishi, Shringi, heard that his father was insulted by the king, the boy Shringi became very angry against this insult by the king of his father, insult of his father. And he decided to curse him, curse the king. So it is described here, his eyes red hot with anger, rosha anger, tamra aksha, like copper. When copper is hot, it is already reddish, but it becomes even more reddish. So red hot, red hot eyes, he was displaying his anger. He touched the water of the river Kaushika while speaking to his playmates. That means he used the power, the Brahmanical power of cursing by using one mantra. And before chanting that mantra, he purified himself. And he discharged the following thunderbolt of words.

**Key Quote:** "the circumstances under which Maharaj Parikshit was cursed were simply childish as it appears from this verse."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada's commentary, highlighting the childishness and impropriety of Shringi's actions and the great harm caused by cursing the king.

Shila Prabhupada says, the circumstances under which Maharaj Parikshit was cursed were simply childish, as it appears from this verse. Small boy. He is not mature. He is not aware of proper etiquette. He doesn't know culture. So Shila Prabhupada says, the circumstances under which Maharaj Parikshit was cursed were childish. Shringi was showing his impudency amongst his playmates who were innocent. Those playmates, they could not make out what was the seriousness involved in either the king's action or the action, the counteraction by this boy, the playmates were small boys. They were just innocent boys. They couldn't judge or gauge or understand anything. So Shila Prabhupada says, any sane man would have prevented him from doing such a great harm to all human society. So this cursing of the king who is the protector of the entire human society because he is the emperor of the world, and cursing him to be killed for a very, very minor mistake is actually improper on the part of this brahmana boy, small boy. By killing a king like Maharaj Parikshit just to make a show of his brahmanical power, the inexperienced son of a brahmana committed a great mistake. This will later on be explained. But here Prabhupada is just mentioning this: Shringi made a very, very, very big mistake. It's called a blunder. He made a blunder. And he was inexperienced son of a brahmana. He did not know what is the proper way to actually react.

**Key Quote:** "Thus the beginning of the misuse of brahmanical power began."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada on the misuse of brahmanical power, explaining how Shringi's curse marked the beginning of the decline of brahmanas in the Kali Yuga.

This is the justification of this boy in cursing Maharaj Parikshit. The Rajarshi, the great emperor, the protector of all the citizens, the ideal king. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains: Thus the beginning of the misuse of brahmanical power began. Brahmanas are very powerful by training, by culture, by education, by their acquired power due to their austerity, due to their controlling their senses, due to their purity, but such power is never to be misused. It has to be carefully used, properly used. So Prabhupada says the beginning of the misuse of brahmanical power began with this Shringi cursing Maharaj Parikshit, and then what happened gradually the brahmanas in the age of Kali became devoid of both brahmanical powers and culture. So the brahmanas of present day, they don't have the power like this Shringi had or the other brahmanas had in the past. Nowadays, brahmanas don't have that kind of power. Neither they have the brahmanical culture; they don't have brahmanical culture either. So the downfall of the brahmanas began with this misuse of brahmanical power by Shringi.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how Shringi's curse made him the 'wretched' one, leading to the loss of brahmanical power in his lineage.

The brahmana boy considered Maharaj Parikshit to be Kulaangara, Kulaangara, the wretched of the dynasty. Parikshit is the best of the dynasty of the kings, of the Bharata Vamsha, the best of the kings, and wrongly this brahmana boy Shringi is misunderstanding, total misunderstanding, that Parikshit is wretched of the dynasty. For a small mistake, he is wrongly accusing Parikshit to be the wretched of the dynasty. That means the most fallen, most degraded. But factually, the brahmana boy himself was so; by cursing Parikshit, this brahmana boy became the most wretched descendant of the glorious brahmana brahmana lineage. He himself became a wretched descendant. But he is wrongly accusing Parikshit to be the wretched descendant of the glorious Bharata dynasty or Kuru dynasty. Why is it said here by Srila Prabhupada the brahmana boy himself became the wretched of this lineage? Because only from him did the brahmana caste become powerless. Moment the misuse is there, they lose their power. Then the other descendants of such a brahmana who has lost his brahmanical power will also be powerless.

**Key Quote:** "Similarly in this Kali Yuga the brahmanas are powerless because Sringi misuse that is where the misuse began and that misuse continued for some time till most of the brahmanas became powerless."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a snake with broken fangs to illustrate the powerlessness of brahmanas in Kali Yuga due to the misuse of their power, concluding the lecture.

So the seminal descendants, that is by virtue of taking birth in a particular family, the present day descendants in that brahmanical families have no power, brahmanical power. They don't have brahmanical power. So they have become powerless. And the example is given of becoming powerless like the snake whose poison teeth are broken. If there is a very poisonous snake, it is very dangerous as long as it has got its poison teeth. But if a snake has a very poisonous snake has its poison teeth completely removed, it is possible to remove the poison teeth. Then that snake is not at all having any power. So Srila Prabhupada says the snake is fearful as long as his poison teeth are there. Otherwise, he is fearful only to children. He can make a show that I will be able to bite you, but if he actually bites, nothing happens because his poison teeth are removed. Similarly, in this Kali Yuga, the brahmanas are powerless because Sringi misuse, that is where the misuse began, and that misuse continued for some time till most of the brahmanas became powerless. I will stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.

In this session, we will be discussing four verses, 38, 39, 40, and 41, of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Sriman Bhagavatam. The 38th verse. The meaning of this verse is: Thereafter, when the boy returned to the hermitage, he saw a snake on his father's shoulder, and out of his grief, he cried very loudly. This boy has not even seen what has happened. He just heard from his playmates, and immediately his reaction was, "How deadly! How dare the king insult my father! What does he think of himself? Watch my power! Now I am going to teach him a lesson!" And he became extremely angry, immediately cursed the king to die in seven days. So this was completely impudent on his part to have cursed the king like that. So he saw the snake on his father's shoulder after having cursed the king already, and he began to cry very loudly, realizing what a great mistake he had done. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The boy was not happy because he committed a great mistake, and he wanted to be relieved of the burden on his heart by crying." A small boy has made a very, very big mistake. He is realizing his mistake, but it's too late. So after entering the hermitage and seeing his father in that condition, he cried loudly so that he might be relieved, but it was too late. The father regretted the whole incident.

39th verse: Sava Angiraso Brahman Shrutva Suta Vilapanam Unmilya Shanakair Netre Drishtva Chamse Mruthoragam. The meaning of this 39th verse: O Brahmanas! Now who is addressing this? O Brahmanas! It is Suta Goswami who is addressing the sages of Naimisharanya while describing this incident. The rishi who was born in the family of Angira Muni. This rishi refers to Shamika Rishi, whose ashram Pariksit had entered, searching for water, and whose son was Sringi. So this rishi, that is Shamika Rishi, was born in the family of Angira Muni, a very glorious dynasty or lineage of Brahmanas. Hearing his son crying, gradually opened his eyes and saw the dead snake around his neck. This rishi was sitting in trance in meditation when Pariksit entered the ashram. So he could not properly, he could not receive the king. He could not offer him any hospitality. He was not conscious of his external surroundings. He was deep in trance. So when he heard the sound of his son crying, loudly crying, he gradually opened his eyes, that is coming out of trance, and he saw the dead snake around his neck. Now what is his reaction?

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Shamika Rishi did not take the snake incident seriously and attributes Sringi's curse to the influence of Kali, leading to the downfall of Brahmanical power and societal degradation.

The fortieth verse: Visrjya tamcha papracha vatsakasmadhi rodhisi kenavate apakritam ityuktasa nyavedayat. The meaning of this fortieth verse: He threw the dead snake aside, Visrjya, and asked his son why he was crying, whether anyone had done him any harm. On hearing this, the son explained to him what had happened. So the rishi is hearing from his son, what happened, why are you crying? So the boy explained what all happened. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, the father did not take the dead snake on his neck very seriously. He just threw away the snake and did not take it very seriously. Who has done this? Why has he done this? Why this dead snake around my neck? He never thought anything very seriously wrong had happened by that snake, that snake being placed on his neck. He simply threw it away. Actually, there was nothing seriously wrong in Maharaj Pariksit's act, but the foolish son took it very seriously, and being influenced by Kali, he cursed the king, and thus ended a chapter of happy history. With the cursing of Maharaj Pariksit, the Brahmanical power is lost because of misuse. And then with the downfall of the Brahmanas, gradually all the other sections of the society will fall down, and thus the whole society becomes degraded, the human society. And it is definitely the influence of Kali. This is the beginning of Kali Yuga. So the influence of Kali. Kali means irreligion personified.

**Key Quote:** "always the punishment for a mistake should be in proportion to the degree of the mistake that is committed."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of proportionate punishment, highlighting that the curse on King Pariksit was a severe punishment for a minor offense.

Adharma bandhu. So Kali is meant for spreading irreligion among the people of this Kali Yuga. The forty-first words: nishamya shaptam atad arham narendram sa brahmano na atmajam abhyanandat aho bata amho mahad adhyate krutham alpi yasi droha urur dhamo dhritah. The meaning of this forty-first verse: The father heard from his son that the king had been cursed, although he should never have been condemned, for he was the best amongst all human beings. When Shamika Rishi heard from his son that the king was cursed, he understood that just for a very minor mistake, the king was condemned to death. This is one important point to note, that always the punishment for a mistake should be in proportion to the degree of the mistake that is committed. That means a severe punishment for very big blunders and small punishment for minor mistakes. There has to be some consideration like this always that is there in punishing somebody. The Rishi did not congratulate his son, but on the contrary began to repent, saying, "Alas, what a great sinful act was performed by my son. He was awarded heavy punishment for an insignificant offense." He refers to the king. The king was awarded heavy punishment for an insignificant offense. Death sentence or death punishment, punishment by being condemned to die by snake bite, is a very, very, very, very heavy punishment. And that too, who is being punished like that? The emperor of the world, who is the Rajarishi, who is the protector of all the citizens, who was able to keep away such a king, such a righteous, glorious, wonderful, full of wonderful qualities, such a king is being condemned to death. It's a heavy punishment.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, the king is the best of all human beings. He is the representative of God, and he is never to be condemned for any of his actions. So king means he is meant to rule over the citizens unless he himself is the best of all human beings. He cannot really rule over the citizens. So he himself is qualified, exceptionally qualified. And not only that, in the Vedic culture, he is the representative of God, because God is the real controller of everyone. The supreme lord, Krishna, he is the supreme controller. He is the supreme controller, but he has his representatives, and particularly in human society, he has the king as his representative. So such a personality is never to be condemned for any of his actions. In other words, the king can do no wrong. This is the Vedic injunction. The king is never to be condemned. The king is never to be considered as acting wrongly, if he is acting as the representative of God and he is ruling according to the

**Key Quote:** "even if there is something wrong with the king, he is never to be condemned."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to discuss the role of the king, explaining that even if a king makes a mistake, he should not be condemned, and reiterates that the punishment should be proportionate to the offense.

Now here is an example given by Srila Prabhupada. The king may order hanging of a culprit's son of a Brahmana, but he does not become sinful for killing a Brahmana. Shastras say Brahmana should never be killed, but the king, in exceptional cases, when the son of a Brahmana misbehaves or deserves to be punished by capital punishment, then the king can give that punishment to somebody who is deserving such a punishment. And in that case, the king does not incur the sin for killing a Brahmana. Further, Srila Prabhupada says, even if there is something wrong with the king, he is never to be condemned. So what to speak of a good and pious king like Maharaj Pariksit? So the king is trained to become a Rajarshi, and a Rajarshi or a great saint, he is never to be condemned the way Shringi treated this great Maharaj Pariksit. So the instruction of the Vedas is, the king is called Narendra or Naradeva, and he is the best amongst the human beings. So he should not be condemned like this. For a minor mistake, he may be given some very minor punishment, but never such a grave punishment or a severe punishment for a minor mistake. That is completely wrong.

**Summary:** The speaker connects verse 4 to the previous verse, emphasizing dedication to transcendental topics and constant remembrance of the Lord's lotus feet as key characteristics of devotees who avoid misconceptions.

So, this verse has got a reference to the previous verse because the verse says, "This was so because..." What was so? That Parikshit Maharaj surrendered himself unto Shri Lashukadeva Goswami and therefore he was able to understand the actual position of the personality of Godhead. So, the fourth verse that today we are discussing now has got relevance to this point made in the third verse, that he was able to understand the actual position of the personality of Godhead because the nature of a person who has dedicated his life to the transcendental topics of the personality of Godhead, and such people also are constantly engaged in remembering the lotus feet of the Lord. Two characteristics: First one is their lives are dedicated to the transcendental topics of the personality of Godhead. They live their life based on the scriptures which glorify the Supreme Lord and His pure devotees. And they also constantly think of the lotus feet of the Lord, Supreme Lord. Such devotees, they do not have the risk of having misconceptions at the end of their lives.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, highlighting that remembering Krishna at the end of life leads to attaining the Lord's transcendental abode and eternal blissful life.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains what is this risk that somebody may have. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, the highest perfection of life is attained by remembering the transcendental nature of the Lord at the last moment of one's life. We are spiritual beings. The Supreme Lord is completely a spiritual personality. We belong to the Supreme Lord's personal abode. So, in this human form of life, we are meant to cultivate Krishna Consciousness to be able to remember the Supreme Lord at the end of our life. Ante Narayanas Pratihi. Antakale Chamameva Svaranmuktva Kalevaram. Both the Bhagavatam and the Bhagavad Gita describe this. At the end of life, to successfully terminate this life, one has to remember Krishna at the last moment. And that is the highest perfection because simply by remembering Krishna alone at the end of one's life, one is able to attain immediately the transcendental abode of the Supreme Lord, never to take birth again in this miserable material world. And having gone there, what do they do? They live eternal life full of bliss and knowledge in the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, being engaged in His loving devotional service very naturally.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of learning about the Lord's transcendental nature from a liberated soul in disciplic succession to ensure remembrance at the time of death.

So Srila Prabhupada further explains, this perfection of life is made possible by one who has learned the actual transcendental nature of the Lord from the Vedic hymns sung by a liberated soul like Shukadev Goswami or someone in that line of disciplic succession. So how do you actually ensure that you'll be able to remember the Supreme Lord at the end of your life? So for that, you have to learn what is this transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord Krishna by hearing from a liberated soul like Shukadev Goswami or someone in the parampara from Shukadev Goswami who is also a liberated soul. Now, if somebody simply hears this type of Krishna Katha, Bhagavad Katha from some mental speculator, Srila Prabhupada says there's no use. You have to hear from an actual self-realized soul and the hearing process is also directed that one has to properly understand the transcendental nature of Krishna by service and submission. One should be surrendered to the spiritual master and one should render service to the spiritual master. Then the spiritual master reveals the secret, the truth, the most confidential knowledge about the transcendental nature of the Supreme Personality of God, Krishna. And everything becomes transparently clear, very, very clear. So, by such clear understanding, by realization, one is able to live transcendentally even before death comes. One's life is life dedicated to the Supreme Lord. And such a transcendental living continues till the end of life. And, Srila Prabhupada says, by scientific adaptation, one is able to remember the Lord even at the time of death.

**Key Quote:** "Actually, it is the grace of the Supreme Lord and His pure devotees, the spiritual masters. That is the real secret."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the difficulty of remembering the Lord at death due to bodily derangement, emphasizing the grace of the Lord and spiritual master as essential for success, exemplified by Parikshit Maharaj.

What happens at the time of death? Why is it difficult to remember normally for an ordinary person? That is because at the time of death, the power of remembrance is slackened due to derangement of bodily membranes. Something happens in this body when the time of death comes. We have to leave the body. The bodily functions are going to completely stop working. So, at that moment, last moment, it's not easy, it's not natural to remember the Supreme Lord. For a common man, it is very difficult to remember things as they are at the time of death. But by the grace of the Lord and His bona fide devotees, the spiritual masters, one can get this opportunity without difficulty. So, what really works? Actually, it is the grace of the Supreme Lord and His pure devotees, the spiritual masters. That is the real secret. And who can have that mercy or grace? Those who have dedicated their life for serving the Supreme Lord under the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master. And that was the case with Maharaj Pariksit. His life was dedicated for Krishna's service. And he got a very, very able spiritual master like Shukadeva Goswami.

**Key Quote:** "As long as the great powerful son of Abhimanyu remains the emperor of the world, there is no chance that the personality of Kali will flourish."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces Srimad Bhagavatam 1.18.5, explaining that as long as Parikshit Maharaj ruled, the influence of Kali could not flourish.

Tavit kalina prabhavet pravishto piha sarvatah yavad isho mahan urvyam abhimanyava ekarat. The meaning of this fifth verse is: as long as the great powerful son of Abhimanyu remains the emperor of the world, there is no chance that the personality of Kali will flourish. We discussed in detail the influence of Kali. Kali's influence is to entice people to engage in irreligion, adharma bandhu. So people become sinful and they miss the valuable opportunity in the human form of life to prepare oneself to go back to Godhead. So Kali cannot influence people. Kali cannot flourish as long as there is an emperor like Pariksit Maharaj ruling the entire world. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, as we have already explained, the personality of Kali had entered the jurisdiction of this earth long ago and he was looking for an opportunity to spread his influence all over the world. This will be explained in the next verse. The very day Krishna left this planet, after winding up his pastimes at the end of Dwapar Yuga, Kali, Purusha, tried to enter the earth planet. Kali was looking for an opportunity but he could not do so satisfactorily due to the presence of Maharaj Pariksit. That is a way of good government. The disturbing elements like the personality of Kali will always try to extend their nefarious activities. But it is the duty of the able state to check them by all means.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Parikshit Maharaj's governance, highlighting how he prevented Kali's influence by utilizing wealth for Krishna's Sankirtana, contrasting it with the sinful use of wealth in the present Kali Yuga.

Pariksit stopped Kali. Of course he was ready to kill Kali Purusha. But Kali Purusha surrendered. Pariksit Maharaj spared his life. That is the code of conduct for the king: that surrendered souls should never be killed. But at the same time, Kali was not given any opportunity for spreading his evil influence among the citizens of Pariksit Maharaj's kingdom. Although Maharaj Pariksit allotted places for the personality of Kali, at the same time he gave no chance for the citizens which swayed by the personality of Kali. How did he do that? He actually utilized all the stored gold for propagating the glories of the Supreme Lord Krishna for Krishna's Sankirtana. And that is the way to prevent the influence of Kali. If people do not use their excess wealth beyond what they require, minimum required for their bodily maintenance, beyond that, if they don't use the excess wealth for Sankirtana, for Krishna consciousness, then that accumulated wealth becomes the place for breeding all kinds of sinful activities. Like it is happening now, we can see that people use their excess wealth simply for sinful ways of enjoying sense gratification. So that chance was not given because of the strong governance of Pariksit Maharaj and that's being said here. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "the king who is the best amongst human beings is as good as the personality of Godhead because he is trained, he represents the Supreme Lord, he acts according to the Vedic injunctions given by the Supreme Lord"
**Summary:** The speaker explains verse 42, emphasizing the importance of a king's training, his representation of God, and his duty to protect citizens, highlighting how King Parikshit was glorified for his virtuous rule.

In this session, we will be discussing from two verses, the 42nd and the 43rd verses of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 42nd verse is as follows: नवैं रिभिर नरदेवं पराख्यं सम्मातुम अर्हसी अविपक्व बुद्धे यत्तेजसा दुर्विशहेण गुप्ता विन्दन्ति भद्राणि अकुतो भया प्रजाह. The meaning of this 42nd verse: O my boy, that Shamika Rishi is addressing his son Shringi, O my boy, your intelligence is immature, अपक्व बुद्धी, and therefore you have no knowledge that the king, who is the best amongst human beings, is as good as the personality of Godhead because he is trained, he represents the Supreme Lord, he acts according to the Vedic injunctions given by the Supreme Lord, so he is as good as the personality of Godhead. He is never to be placed on equal footing with common men. The citizens of the state live in prosperity being protected by his unsurpassable prowess. The sage himself, Rishi Shamika, he was able to nicely sit in his ashram and do tapasya without के लिए रोग और शिवाशिय और वापस से डिस्टर्बेंस से सोचे कि यह आराज उत्पास के लिए सुरति से पावधि कि अ उड़ी इसके साथ बार रूस में महाराज अरक्षीप महाराज इन दुष्पा पूछा उनको पर अधिक से नियुक्त नहीं भूल मिलागा इसुद ने उन्हें किंदम परिचित नाराज। ताज कि कैसे शत्य ख़ूंद बताए जाता है कि शमीका रुषी ने पता आ जाता है। So the Rishi is describing his son as immature. He is a small boy. He definitely doesn't have the maturity when to use his brahmanical power to curse somebody to die. He doesn't have a maturity and he doesn't know the position of the king, especially the emperor who is ruling the world so nicely that everyone is well protected by the unsurpassable prowess of Parikshit Maharaja. He is such a great king that people are living, they are experiencing safety and they are prosperous under the rule of Parikshit Maharaja. They are prosperous. Earlier there is a description when Parikshit Maharaja was touring the state, all the citizens received him very nicely and they were glorifying his rule that because he was the descendant of the great devotees of Krishna, the Pandavas, therefore they were glorifying not only Parikshit but also glorifying the Pandavas and glorifying Krishna who was actually guiding the Pandavas.

**Key Quote:** "one trained Monarch is far better than hundreds of useless ministerial rogues"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the qualities of a trained monarch with the shortcomings of modern democracy, where leaders may lack proper training and qualifications, leading to the exploitation of citizens in Kali Yuga.

By qualification, not merely by some occupying some post, decorating himself with a position, I am the king, I am the greatest, no, not simply some empty words or pride because pride somebody declares themselves as great, no, he actually has got the qualities of God and he is empowered by the Supreme Lord to protect the citizens. The battle of Kurukshetra was planned by the Lord to establish the real representative of the Lord, Maharaja Yudhishthira. Krishna is interested in protecting all the citizens by having his representative rule over the citizens. So the example is given that Krishna established Yudhishthira Maharaj as the emperor of the world, an ideal king thoroughly trained by culture and devotional service with the martial spirit makes a perfect king. So Prabhupada is comparing the present day government system of government with the previous system of government where the king was ruling. Such a personal monarchy is far better than the so called death, such a personal monarchy is far better than the so called death democracy of no training and responsibility. Simply by votes, these are representatives of the government, they rule, they sit in the, occupy the seat of power and they rule as elected representatives. Now what is his qualification? He has secured votes, that's all. That's the only qualification he has. He doesn't have any training, he doesn't have any, he has not acquired good qualities by education, training, culture, not necessarily. I mean not necessarily, I'm not condemning all the representatives but I'm just telling even without qualification somebody may by simply acquiring votes occupy the post. The thieves and rogues of modern democracy seek election by misrepresentation of votes and the successful rogues and thieves devour the mass of people. One trained Monarch is far better than hundreds of useless ministerial rogues and it is hinted herein that by abolition of a monarchical regime like that of Maharaj Parikshit, the mass of people become open to many attacks of the age of Kali. So Kali Yuga is characterized by the garment ruling over the people not having the proper qualification. So in the absence of a good king what really happens in the society will be.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the consequences of Kali Yuga, highlighting the lack of value for human life, the exploitation of women, and the general degradation of society.

And for all these sins, we shall be responsible. This is Rishi Shamika foreseeing the consequences of the abolition of the monarchical regime of such a great Rajarshi as Pariksit Maharaj. What will happen? Plundering of the people's wealth by rogues and thieves. What is exactly happening now? In many places, there is no safety for people in general. And as Kali Yuga progresses, the thieves and rogues will increase. The number of thieves and rogues will increase, and people's hard-earned money, honest people's hard-earned money, will be plundered by these rogues and thieves. Might is right. That's going to be the situation. When the government is weak or corrupt, or untrained, unqualified people occupying the post of the head of state, there will be great social disruptions. Society will be completely spoiled. That means people will be killed and injured. Nowadays there is no value for human life, especially if the person who dies is a most ordinary citizen. Nobody cares. Nobody cares that everybody has a right to live. But ordinary, insignificant, common people, if they somehow manage to survive or subsist, that's okay. But otherwise, nobody cares for them in this age of Kali, as Kali Yuga progresses. And animals and women will be stolen. Here, animals means the domestic animals. And women, women are unprotected in Kali Yuga. So many cases are being reported. More and more we can hear how women are exploited, women are unprotected, women are insulted.

**Key Quote:** "In a cultured society, five categories of people are offered protection. Brahmanas, women, children, old people and cows."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts a cultured society with the current degraded state, emphasizing the lack of protection for vulnerable groups and criticizing the democratic system as a means for plunderers to exploit the state's wealth.

So, this is a degraded society. In a cultured society, five categories of people are offered protection: Brahmanas, women, children, old people and cows. This is a proper cultured society, where there is perfect protection for everyone, and especially these five categories of vulnerable people are specially protected. Whereas, in present age, we don't see special protection for any of these five categories of personalities. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, the word Naha, V, is very significant in this verse. The sage, that is Shamika Rishi, rightly takes the responsibility of the Brahmanas as a community, for killing monarchical government. His own son wrongly cursed Parikshit Maharaj. So, Rishi Shamika is taking responsibility that the Brahmanas as a community have destroyed this monarchical regime, and thus giving an opportunity to the so-called Democrats, who are generally plunderers of the wealth of the state subjects. So, Srila Prabhupada explains what is going on in the present time, because he is the Acharya, who has appeared in this particular time of the Kali Yuga. Acharya points out, through the scriptural statements, how there are anomalies in the society that needs to be corrected, if people expect to live peacefully, and happily, and with prosperity. Then, what is required to be done? First of all, the government by so-called Democrats, democratic system. Democratic system means simply a person gets votes, and he occupies the position of a ruler. So, the so-called Democrats are generally plunderers of the wealth of the state subjects.

**Key Quote:** "And thus, instead of one king, a number of irresponsible kings grow up to tax the citizens."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to critique the democratic system, arguing that it leads to irresponsible rulers who prioritize personal gratification and burden citizens with excessive taxes, causing disturbance and plundering.

How does it happen? Prabhupada explains, the so-called Democrats capture the administrative machine without assuming responsibility for the prosperous condition of citizens. They have no responsibility that I will ensure the citizens will be taken care of nicely. There is no guarantee, there is no assurance, there is no proper mechanism to ensure that the rulers will properly take care of the subjects. Everyone captures the post for personal gratification. That is happening more and more now than earlier times, and they want their own enjoyment. And thus, instead of one king, a number of irresponsible kings grow up to tax the citizens. Formerly, the king used to collect taxes from the citizens who would be wealth generators, the Vaishyas. Only the Vaishyas were taxed. The Kshatriyas are protectors of the citizens, so they are not taxed. The Brahmanas don't accept any salary, so there's no question of asking tax from them. The Shudras are not given money, but they're given all the necessities. So they happily are taken care of, and they serve very nicely, ensuring that they actually make spiritual progress to achieve spiritual perfection, protected by the upper three classes. The Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, protect the Shudras. So only the Vaishyas, who are wealth generators, they are taxed by one king, not multiple kings. But here, the taxes are so many. So many taxes. And there is state tax, central tax, and earlier there used to be something called city tax. Now that has been abolished. So many taxes. It is foretold herein that in the absence of good monarchical government, everyone will be the cause of disturbance for others, by plundering riches, animals, women, etc.

**Key Quote:** "At that time, the people in general, will fall systematically, from a path of a progressive civilization...there will be an unwanted population, on the level of dogs and monkeys."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces verse 45, explaining how the decline in Vedic principles leads to a degraded civilization and an unwanted population characterized by animalistic tendencies.

This is a fact. We all have experience of this. The forty fifth verse, tadarya dharmah praviliyate nrnam, varnashramacharayutas trayimayah, tato artha kamabhi niveshitatmanam, shunam kapinam, iva varna sankaraham. This is a very strong verse. The meaning of this verse is: at that time, the people in general will fall systematically from a path of a progressive civilization, in respect to the qualitative engagements of the castes and orders of society. There is a standard, that civilized society, there are brahmana, kshatriya, vaishya, shudra, brahmachari, all of them are responsible. They properly follow the injunctions, and the whole society in this way is progressive. But people will fall from the standard of following the respective rules and regulations of the varna divisions and ashrama divisions. Thus they will be more attracted to economic development for sense gratification. They are simply interested in money. And money for what? Simply for enjoying their senses, some or the other. And as a result, there will be an unwanted population on the level of dogs and monkeys, shunam, kapinam, varna sankaraham. This is a unwanted population. And the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, it is foretold herein that in the absence of a monarchical regime, the general mass of people will be an unwanted population, like dogs and monkeys. Why they are compared to dogs and monkeys? As the monkeys are too sexually inclined, and dogs are shameless in sexual intercourse, the general mass of population, born of illegitimate connection, will systematically go astray from the Vedic way of good manners, and qualitative engagements in the castes and orders of life.

**Key Quote:** "The Vedic way of life is a progressive march, of the civilization of Aryans...they always have the goal of going back home, back to Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of good progeny and the Vedic way of life for spiritual progress, contrasting it with the degradation and unfortunate situation of Kali Yuga, where people are losing the opportunity for eternal happiness and knowledge.

Unless there is good progeny, sat santana, that happens by the husband and wife combining together according to the rules and regulations of the Vedic scriptures. There is a certain way of actually generating good population. It is not that by accident somebody is born with bad qualities, and somebody else is born with good qualities. No. There is no accident. So this is science. Complete science. So, when there is no proper ruler, who trains, and who directs, and who enforces good practices, the population will become completely degraded. The Vedic way of life is a progressive march of the civilization of Aryans. Aryans are those who know the values of life, and they always have the goal of going back home, back to Godhead, where there is no birth, no death, no disease, no old age, and no miseries. The Vedas direct everyone not to remain in the darkness of material world, but to go towards the light of spiritual kingdom, far beyond the material sky. So this whole varnashrama is designed in such a way that the entire population of human beings will actually follow the Vedic directions, and in that way, they'll produce good progeny, and the whole population will simply make progress towards going back home, back to Godhead. So people will not misuse or lose this opportunity of the human form of life to prepare themselves for eternal life of happiness and knowledge. So, this is the unfortunate situation in this Kali Yuga. People are degraded, they don't have good progeny, and gradually society is becoming more and more degraded. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 46th verse of the 18th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining the context of Shamika Rishi's reaction to his son cursing King Pariksit.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session we will be discussing from the 46th verse of the 18th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The verse: Dharmapalo Narapati Hi Satu Samrat Brihat Shavaha Sakshat Mahabhagavato Rajarshir Hayamedhayat Rajarshir Hayamedhayat Kshutrut Shrama Uthodino Naivasmat Sapa Arhati. The meaning of this verse is: The emperor Pariksit is a pious king. He is highly celebrated and is the first-class devotee of the personality of Godhead, equal capacity to all stations. He is a saint amongst royalty and he has performed many hard sacrifices. When such a king is tired and fatigued, being stricken with hunger and thirst, he does not at all deserve to be cursed. These are words spoken by Shamika Rishi on learning from his son that his son had cursed King Emperor Pariksit just because Emperor Pariksit, when he was thirsty and hungry, he came looking for water in Shamika Rishi's ashram. Not finding water, he became upset and he took a dead snake and put it round the shoulder of the Rishi who was sitting in meditation in trance

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Shamika Rishi's disapproval of his son's curse, emphasizing King Pariksit's high position and the inappropriateness of the punishment for a minor offense.

and walked away. So the reaction of the son of Shamika Rishi, Shringi, was to become very angry against the king and curse the king to die within seven days. So here Shamika Rishi is saying that he has cursed the king to die within seven days. So here Shamika Rishi is telling, "Who have you cursed, foolish boy, out of your immaturity?" He is particularly telling because that king is emperor of the world and his qualifications are being mentioned here by Rishi Shamika. He does not at all deserve to be cursed. So what is the meaning of this? What are all the qualifications of this king? Firstly, he is a pious king. He is highly celebrated and is a first-class devotee of the personality of Godhead. How can such a person be ever cursed by anybody? And that too, what he has done is a very, very small mistake. Such a great personality for a small mistake has been cursed to die. It is completely wrong on

the part of this boy Shringi to have cursed the emperor of the world. He is a Rajarishi, saint amongst royalty. He has performed many horse sacrifices and such sacrifices were performed by the king or the emperor for the welfare of the entire state, for the welfare of all citizens. As a duty, a king is supposed to perform sacrifices for the protection of welfare, prosperity of these citizens of the world, of the entire kingdom. When such a king is tired, fatigued, thirsty, hungry, he does not at all deserve to be cursed. And what kind of curse is it? To die within seven days? It is not at all justified to curse such a king. So in the Purport, Srila Prabhupada says, after explaining the general codes relating to the royal position and asserting the king can do no wrong and therefore is never to be condemned because a king has a great responsibility for ruling the kingdom and ruling the kingdom is no small task. His kingdom is the entire

world. Such a responsible king, such a heavy duty he has to perform and his position is so exalted that in his position, when he has taken responsibility, it is to be considered that such a king can do no wrong in the sense that even if he does some small mistake, he should never be considered as the object of punishment by anyone. The sage Shamika wanted to say something about Emperor Pariksit specifically. First he spoke in general about a king who is a responsible king should not be considered to do something wrong for a small mistake. But now the king who has been cursed is not just a dutiful king. He is the emperor of the world. He is Emperor Pariksit, descendant of the Kuru dynasty, Bharata Vamsa, descendant of the Pandavas. That emperor has been cursed. So what are his specific qualifications? So the specific qualifications of Maharaja Pariksit is summarized here by Shamika Rishi. The king, even calculated as a king only, was most celebrated as a ruler who administered the religious principles of the Royal Order. According to the scriptures, the kings have got specific duties to perform and they are very clearly defined. The kings have specific duty to perform and they are very clearly elaborated in the scriptures: Kshatriya Dharma. In the Dharma Shastras, there is clear delineation of Brahmana Dharma, Kshatriya Dharma, Vaishya Dharma, Shudra Dharma, Brahmachari Dharma, Grahastha Dharma, Vanaprastha Dharma, Sanyas Dharma, Shri Dharma, Raja Dharma. Like this, all different duties of different classes of people, under different circumstances, in different situations.

**Summary:** The speaker mentions the qualities of a Kshatriya as described in the Bhagavad-Gita and states that Pariksit possessed all those qualities.

if he is a ruler who is a strict follower of those Dharma Shastras, such a ruler is never to be punished, cursed by anyone.

All the qualities of a Kshatriya mentioned in the Bhagavad-Gita, in the 18th chapter, the 43rd verse, it is described what are the qualifications by which a Kshatriya functions. And that is mentioned in the Bhagavad-Gita. And Srila Prabhupada says in this purport, that Pariksit had all those qualifications which are mentioned in the Bhagavad-Gita. What are those qualifications mentioned in the Bhagavad-Gita? Shauryam is mentioned in the Bhagavad-Gita. So, how many are mentioned? Shauryam, Tejo, Dhritir, Daksham, Yudhecha, Api, Apalayanam, Danam, Ishwarabhava. Seven qualifications are mentioned. And what are those seven qualifications?

leadership. These are the qualities. So, heroism means he is bold, he is a man of his heart and he is like the ideal in leading people, in protecting people. He is the ideal hero. Just like Pariksit Maharaj, how he dealt with Kalipurusha. When he saw Kalipurusha is harming a cow and a bull, immediately he told him that you are a hero, took out his sword and said you deserve to be killed, you don't deserve to live, punishment, capital punishment for harming a cow and a bull exactly according to shastra. So heroism he displays. Power, he is a very powerful king. He tours his whole kingdom and all the people offer him tributes. He is so powerful. Determination, he is very, very strongly determined to do his duties. Resourcefulness, he is resourceful enough to arrange to provide for all the needs of the people. Courage, courage in battle, when he challenged Kalipurusha, Kalipurusha could understand that my life is in danger, so he's Kalipurusha surrendered to Pariksit. Elsewhere it is described when Pariksit used to tour his kingdom, all the kings simply used to come and pay their tributes without his even challenging them. That was how he was courageous. Generosity, he used to properly give in charity to the deserving, to the brahmanas, when he used to perform sacrifices, liberally he used to give charity to the brahmanas, dhanam. And leadership, he is the ideal role model for the other people in his conduct. In his conduct he is the ideal person. So he leads people by his own example. That's the perfect leader and people have got confidence in this leadership because they are very nicely protected, they are provided for, they are guided correctly. So he is the ideal

leader. So such a great devotee, how can he be cursed? So from all sides it is admitted by Shamika Rishi that Maharaj Pariksit was cursed most unjustly. Although for this boy's childish action, the brahmanas cannot be blamed, but still Shamika Rishi took responsibility for this act of this brahmachari boy, his own son, who wrongly used the brahmanical power as a result of which there is the deterioration of all the other orders in the whole world because unless the brahmanas are properly situated, they cannot lead and inspire and guide the other orders of society, the kshatriyas, vaishyas, sudras. Just like in our body, if the head is in order, brain is in order, all other parts can work properly, but the brain itself is not in order, change of the body means change of the body. If the brain is in order, then the action is good, then a good action in order. Even if the other organs are in good condition, they cannot function. So like that the brahmanas have to be ideal, then only the society can function.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session we will be discussing from the 47th verse of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Apapeshu Swabhrtyeshu Balena Apakvabuddhina Papam Krutam Tad Bhagavan Sarvatma Kshantum Arhati. The meaning of this verse is: Then the Rishi prayed to the all-pervading personality of Godhead to pardon his iniquity. He was an immature boy who had no intelligence and who committed the great sin of cursing a person who was completely free from all sins, who was subordinate and who deserved to be protected. So this is the statement of Suta Goswami to the sages of Naimisharanya.

#### Karma, Vaishnava Aparadh, Offense to Devotees

**Key Quote:** "When an offense is done unto the devotee of the Lord it is very difficult to overcome the reaction."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the law of karma and the severe consequences of offending a devotee of the Lord (Vaishnava Aparadh).

He is describing the whole incident leading to Pariksit Maharaj renouncing his kingdom and meeting Shukadeva Goswami, after which the Bhagavatam was spoken by Shukadeva Goswami to Pariksit Maharaj. So Srila Prabhupada explains elaborately this in the purport: Everyone is responsible for his own action either pious or sinful. This is the law of karma in this material world. Rishi Shamika could foresee that his son had committed a great sin by cursing Maharaj Pariksit, who deserved to be protected by the Brahmanas, for he, that is Pariksit Maharaj, was a pious ruler and completely free from all sins because of his being a first-class devotee of the Lord. So Pariksit Maharaj as a pure devotee deserves to be protected by the Brahmanas. Instead he is being cursed. It is totally unjust. So Srila Prabhupada further says: When an offense is done unto the devotee of the Lord it is very difficult to overcome the reaction.

**Key Quote:** "Generally Vaishnava Aparath cannot be overcome."
**Summary:** The speaker continues discussing Vaishnava Aparadh, emphasizing the responsibility of Brahmanas to protect subordinates and avoid disproportionate punishment.

Vaishnava Aparath is very, very, very dangerous. Generally Vaishnava Aparath cannot be overcome. By the person who has committed that offense or Aparath, it cannot be overcome. So further Srila Prabhupada says: The Brahmanas being at the head of the social orders are meant to give protection to their subordinates and not to curse them. A superior when dealing with somebody who is a subordinate, has to be considered; if they do some mistake, they cannot be disproportionately punished. In general they should not be punished when they make a mistake, especially when they are subordinate and they have not done a big mistake. For their small mistakes they should not be punished.

**Key Quote:** "Above the law of nature is the Supreme Lord's personal superintendence."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the specific case of Pariksit Maharaj's cursing, highlighting the foolish boy's pride and emphasizing Krishna's personal control over nature.

There are occasions when a Brahmana may furiously curse a subordinate Kshatriya or Vaishya. But in the case of Maharaj Pariksit there were no grounds as already explained. This was explained elaborately in the previous verse. The foolish boy had done it out of sheer vanity; vanity means pride, in being a Brahmana's son and thus he became liable to be punished by the law of God. Above the law of nature is the Supreme Lord's personal superintendence. This is very important to note. It appears like the nature's laws are working in an impersonal way because we don't see generally the hand of any person. Just like the seasons are changing, the sun is rising every day, and what is the explanation of the scientists? So called scientists. They have no explanation how it is happening. Scriptures are very clear: Bhishasmat vatapavate bhisho deti suryaha. Out of fear of the Supreme Lord who is the controller, director of the entire material nature, the sun is rising every day. The wind is blowing properly to ensure supply of the air for all the living beings on the earth. This is unknown to modern scientists. This is unknown to most people in this in today's world.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is the supreme director, controller, master."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's supreme control and administration, His affection for devotees (Bhakta Vatsala), and the distinction between sin and offense.

Krishna is the supreme director, controller, master. Under him there is a whole big administration of the devatas, headed by Brahma. Everyone is working under the superintendence of Krishna. This is unknown. So here Prabhupada is pointing out if some of the devatas, subordinate controllers make a mistake then they are liable to be punished by God Krishna. So Prabhupada further says: The Lord never forgives a person who condemns his pure devotee. Krishna is very, very attached to his pure devotees. He is called Bhakta Vatsala. Therefore by cursing a king the foolish Sringi had committed not only a sin but also the greatest offense.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Offense is dealt with only by the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to differentiate between sin and offense, emphasizing that only the Supreme Lord can pardon offenses and alter the laws of nature.

There is a difference between offense and sin. Sin is directly violating the laws of nature in our material activities. Offense is any offense done to a pure devotee, to a Vaishnava. Offending a Vaishnava is on a different level. Committing a sin whereby one violates the material laws of nature is different. Therefore the Rishi could foresee that only the Supreme Personality of Godhead could save his boy from his sinful act. Offense is dealt with only by the Supreme Lord, directly. The other subordinate controllers in material nature have no role to play. They cannot do anything about the offense. Further Srila Prabhupada says he therefore directly prayed for pardon from the Supreme Lord who alone can undo a thing which is impossible to change. Even the laws of nature which work perfectly, they can be changed only by Krishna. Nobody else can change it.

**Key Quote:** "Even the laws of nature which work perfectly they can be changed only by Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates Krishna's power to change the laws of nature and raises the question of why the Brahmana's son was made responsible for cursing Pariksit Maharaj.

No Devata, no Yogi, no Tapasvi, no Jnani, no Rishi can change any of the laws of nature. They are working perfectly. But Krishna can change. The appeal was made in the name of a foolish boy who had developed no intelligence at all. Rishi Shamika is appealing to the Supreme Lord that my boy who is a foolish boy he made a mistake. It was a big mistake but he is a foolish boy kindly pardoned him. Now Srila Prabhupada further explains very nicely a question may be raised herein that since it was the desire of the Lord that Pariksit Maharaj be put into that awkward position so that he might be delivered from material existence then why was a Brahmana's son made responsible for this offensive act?

**Key Quote:** "So Krishna arranged a child to make a mistake of cursing Pariksit."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna arranged for a child to commit the offense so that he could be easily excused, and the father's prayer would be accepted.

See earlier it is explained that Pariksit could not have become angry against this sage Shamika Rishi. Normally according to his proper conduct as a pure devotee. It was arranged by Krishna. So actually it is not Pariksit's mistake at all to have become angry against Shamika Rishi and provoke that Brahmana boy the son of the Rishi. No. Pariksit is not at fault. Krishna arranged it, so that Bhagavatam can be spoken. That was Krishna's higher purpose. But then why is the Brahmana's son made responsible? The Brahmana's son has made the mistake. Why is he in the picture? Is the question that may be raised. So Srila Prabhupada says the answer is that the offensive act was performed by child only so that he could be excused very easily. So Krishna arranged a child to make a mistake of cursing Pariksit, so that the child can be excused because children if they make a mistake they are not to be punished like an adult who makes a mistake. And thus the prayer of the father was accepted. Krishna accepted. Yes. Your boy is a foolish boy. He is an immature boy. He deserves to be pardoned for his mistake. Big mistake.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Why the Brahmana community as a whole was made responsible for allowing Kali into the world affairs."
**Summary:** The speaker raises the question of why the entire Brahmana community is held responsible for Kali's influence and explains that demons were allowed to take birth in Brahmana families in Kali Yuga.

Then further Prabhupada raises another question. If the question is raised why the Brahmana community as a whole was made responsible for allowing Kali into the world affairs. See one Brahmachari boy misusing his Brahmanical power. The whole Brahmana community is held responsible that Kali has entered through this boy and is now going to pollute the rest of the Brahmanas in Kali Yuga become polluted. So why the whole Brahmana community as a whole is getting polluted by this whole act. So the answer Srila Prabhupada says for this is given in the Varaha Purana. What is the answer in the Varaha Purana? The demons who acted inimically toward personality of Godhead but were not killed by the Lord by Lord Krishna when Krishna incarnated in Dwapara Yuga end of Dwapara Yuga. Such demons were allowed to take birth in the families of Brahmanas to take advantage of the age of Kali. So who are these Brahmanas in Kali Yuga who don't follow the Brahmanical principles but act irreligiously under the influence of Kali. These Brahmanas were formerly demons who deserve to be killed and purified by the Supreme Lord but they did not they were not killed. So such Brahmanas are taking birth in Brahmana families in the age of Kali in which they are polluted.

**Key Quote:** "The all-merciful Lord gave them a chance to have their births in families of pious Brahmanas so that they could progress towards salvation."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by explaining that the demons were given a chance for purification by taking birth in Brahmana families, but they often misuse the opportunity due to pride and vanity, ending with a thank you and Hare Krishna.

So Srila Prabhupada says further the all-merciful Lord gave them a chance to have their births in families of pious Brahmanas so that they could progress towards salvation. The demons missed the chance of being killed by the Supreme Lord and thereby become purified. So now they are given another chance for purification. Take birth in Brahmana families and thereby make some progress towards ultimate liberation. But the demons instead of utilizing the good opportunity misuse the Brahmanical culture due to being puffed up by vanity in becoming Brahmanas. Now Kali Yuga there is a good opportunity taking birth in a Brahmana family in any age there is good opportunity to make progress. But if they don't utilize then they are the losers. That's what is explained here. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 48th verse of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Tiraskrita vipralabdhaha shaptahah shivta hata api nashetat pratikurvanti tattbhaktah prabhavo api hi. The meaning of this verse is, "The devotees of the Lord are so forbearing that even though they are defamed, cheated, cursed, disturbed, neglected, or even killed, they are never inclined to avenge themselves." This is a word spoken by Suta Goswami glorifying a pure devotee of the Lord. What is the quality of a pure devotee? They are always very, very, very, very tolerant: titikshava karunika surdha sarva dehi naam. In another place in Bhagavatam, third canto, Lord Kapila describes pure devotees.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains Rishi Shamika knew that the Lord does not forgive a person who has committed an offense at the feet of a devotee. Move it definitely. The, obviamente, the Lord is not concise till we understand it is clear. So Straight Government today is to help benefit the poorasto, that is already been explained earlier. Therefore, he begged forgiveness from the Lord on behalf of his son. But, ah, what can the Lord do? Code 3, shelter of the devotee, like it happened in the case of Durvasamuni. When Durvasamuni offended Ambarish Maharaj, Ambarish Maharaj is a pure devotee, so Ambarish Maharaj did not retaliate, but the Supreme Lord cannot tolerate his devotee being harmed by anybody else. So when Durvasamuni started to harass Ambarish Maharaj by creating one Rakshasa to harass him, harass Ambarish Maharaj, immediately Krishna sent a Sudarshan chakra to kill that Rakshasa immediately, immediately. Then that Sudarshan chakra did not stop at that. Sudarshan chakra started chasing Durvasamuni himself. Durvasamuni tried to escape by all his mystic power, he could not escape. Finally, he thought of taking shelter of some powerful devatas, that didn't work. Finally, he was directed to go to Vishnu himself, who is actually the one who has released the Sudarshan chakra. So when he went to Vishnu, Vishnu said, "I am completely under the subordination of my pure devotees, so if at all you want any relief, you can get relief only if you are pardoned by Ambarish Maharaj whom you have offended."

**Key Quote:** "A pure devotee is callous about worldly advantages or reverses."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain the qualities of a pure devotee, emphasizing their indifference to worldly gains and losses and their willingness to tolerate personal offenses.

So Durvasamuni had Canyonаровός to come back to Ambarish Maharaj whom he had offended. So therefore, Prabhupada says the Lord can only give direction to take shelter of the devotee whom somebody has offended to get free from the offense. Further, Srila Prabhupada says he thought within himself, that is Rishi Shamika is thinking, that if Maharaj Pariksit would counter curse the boy, he might be saved. The boy can be saved from any action being taken by the Lord if Pariksit Maharaj would have taken some action against the boy. But Rishi Shamika knew also that a pure devotee is callous about worldly advantages or reverses. He knew that Pariksit Maharaj will never take any counter action against the boy because he is a pure devotee. He tolerates any amount of inconvenience for the personal self, a pure devotee simply tolerates. As such, the devotees are never inclined to counteract personal deformation, curses, negligence, and aversion. As far as such things are concerned, in personal affairs the devotees do not care.

**Key Quote:** "He considers that to be the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead"
**Summary:** The speaker quotes a verse spoken by Brahma, explaining that pure devotees see difficulties as the mercy of the Lord and believe they deserve worse punishment for their past misdeeds.

Tattenu Kampaamsu Sameeksham Ano Bunjana Evatma Krta Mvipakam. Hrid-Vaagva Purubhya Vidadhan Namaste Jivetayo Mukti Padesha Dayabhak. This is a verse spoken by Brahma. He has shown in offering his prayers to Krishna after the Brahma Vimohana Leela. What is Brahma saying this prayer? He says, "My dear Lord, those who are your pure devotees," Brahma is glorifying Krishna's pure devotees. He's telling Krishna, "Your pure devotees whenever they are facing some danger in the material world, only the material world this can happen, some danger, some deformation, some difficulty, some insult, anything that a pure devotee faces like this, he considers that to be the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead." A pure devotee does not think, "I am a pure devotee. I am fully dedicated and surrender to Krishna. Why does Krishna not prevent me from suffering?" So pure devotee never thinks like that. A pure devotee thinks that, "Let me gladly suffer whatever difficulty is, dangers, or miseries, or any situation in this material world, let me undergo, let me tolerate, suffer with tolerance. Why? Because the pure devotee thinks actually I deserve to suffer much, much more for my own past misdeeds, Atma Krita Vipakam. But Krishna is so kind to me that He is not giving me the punishment, which is the proper punishment which is due to my own misdeeds. I don't know I'm getting what I deserve. I am getting a small token, a small token of what I deserve to get. So that is Krishna's mercy upon me." That's how the pure devotee thinks.

**Key Quote:** "Then this pure devotee will not tolerate will not sit quiet. He will take proper action against the offender"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the devotee's tolerance of personal offenses with their active response to offenses against the Lord or other devotees, explaining why Shamika Rishi appealed to the Lord instead of Pariksit Maharaja.

But in the case of an offense committed by somebody against the Lord or Lord's other devotees, then the pure devotee takes strong action against the offender. So the way a pure devotee deals with somebody who's committing an offense, it's the consideration is twofold: if somebody offends the pure devotee himself, the pure devotee does not take any action against the offender. He tolerates whatever the offender might have done. But if the offender is offending the Supreme Lord or other pure devotees, then this pure devotee will not tolerate, will not sit quiet. He will take proper action against the offender. It was a personal affair and therefore Shamika Rishi knew that the king would not take counteraction. That Rishi Shamika knew because he knew Pariksit Maharaj is a pure devotee. Thus there was no alternative than to place an appeal to the Lord for the immature boy. Why did the Shamika Rishi appeal to the Supreme Lord and not to Pariksit Maharaj? Because Pariksit Maharaj, he knew, will never take any counteraction, will never take an offense. So don't have to go and ask him pardon, is he will never take any counteraction, but what about the Lord? Lord is not going to tolerate, so therefore,

**Key Quote:** "A pure devotee is the most powerful personality in the entire creation."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the power of a pure devotee, even exceeding that of a brahmana, and illustrates this with the example of Hanuman burning Lanka after Ravana insulted Lord Rama, highlighting that this power is used only in service to the Lord and his devotees.

So here for the Srila Prabhupada says it is not only that the brahmanas are powerful enough to award curses of blessings upon the subordinates, the devotee of the Lord, even though he may not be a Brahmana, is more powerful than a Brahmana. So here the pure devotee happens to be a Kshatriya, but generally Kshatriyas are subordinate to brahmanas. So even though Kshatriyas are definitely subordinate to brahmanas, but in the case of the Kshatriya being a pure devotee, such a pure devotee is more powerful than the brahmana, qualified brahmana. A pure devotee is the most powerful personality in the entire creation. He is more powerful than all the demigods, he is more powerful than the most pure brahmana, he is more powerful than all the jnanis, yogis, tapasvis, all kinds of people. He is more powerful than everybody. But a powerful devotee never misuses the power for personal benefit. This is the characteristic of a pure devotee. He knows he has power. As a pure devotee he knows. And that's how a pure devotee, because he is powerful, he can take action against offenders who are offenders against Krishna or offenders against other pure devotees. That's how a pure devotee can take action. He is capable, he is powerful to take action and he does so. What did Hanuman do? Hanuman burnt Lanka. Why? Because Ravana was blaspheming Lord Rama. At first when Hanuman went to get the whereabouts of Sita Devi, Hanuman was trying to see what is the strength of Ravana. So Hanuman did something by which Hanuman was taken in front of Ravana. So when he was taken in front of Ravana, Ravana first insulted Hanuman. Hanuman tolerated silently. But when Ravana started insulting Rama, Hanuman became angry, and in that anger he burnt half of Lanka. So a devotee is very, very powerful pure devotee, but he will use that power only against offenders who are offenders of the Supreme Lord or offenders against other pure devotees. He will never use his power to counteract offenses committed by somebody against himself. Whatever power the devotee may have is always utilized in service towards the Lord and his devotees, other devotees. That's all.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Parikshit's garlanding the sage with a dead snake was not at all a very serious offense, but Shringi's cursing the king was a serious offense."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains verse 49, focusing on the incident of Parikshit Maharaj and the sage's son, emphasizing that Parikshit's action was a minor offense compared to the curse, and the boy's foolishness warranted pardon.

In this session we will be discussing two verses, the 49th and the 58th verses of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. These are the last two verses of this chapter. This chapter is entitled Maharaj Parikshit Cursed by a Brahmana Boy. The 49th verse, Iti Putra Krita Ghena Sonu Tapto Mahamunihi Swayam Viprakrto Ragna Naiva Agham Tad Achintayat. The translation is, The Sage Dharamuddin thus regretted the sin committed by his own son. He did not take the insult paid by the king very seriously. Now this is summarizing the incident itself entirely. The whole chapter which is describing this incident, leading to Parikshit Maharaj renouncing his kingdom and thereby meeting Shikadeva Goswami and Bhagavatam being spoken and revealed for the benefit of the whole world. So in the Purport, Shila Prabhupada says, The whole incident is now cleared up. How is it cleared up? Maharaj Parikshit's garlanding the sage with a dead snake was not at all a very serious offense, but Shringi's cursing the king was a serious offense. So it's very clear. Now, Parikshit's action, which was the, which led to the whole incident of cursing by the Shamika Rishi's son, it is not at all a serious offense. And the cursing by Shringi was a very, very serious offense. Now, how is it adjusted? Very nicely it's adjusted. The serious offense is committed by foolish child only. Therefore, he deserved to be pardoned by the Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "The curse was in no way an impediment for him to achieve the highest perfection. Rather it became a kind of boon in disguise."
**Summary:** The speaker continues explaining the situation of Maharaj Parikshit, highlighting how he didn't mind the curse and used it as an opportunity to achieve liberation through hearing the Srimad Bhagavatam from Shukadeva Goswami.

Because the curse was given by a foolish boy. And the small boy has made a mistake unknowingly, immaturely, foolishly he has done a mistake. So he deserved to be pardoned by the Supreme Lord. Although it was not, it was not possible to get free from the sinful reaction. The reaction is, the sinful activity is very, very, very serious. So ordinarily a person cannot get away by committing such a very, very serious sinful activity. A grave sinful activity. Nobody can get away. But this case, specific case, the foolish boy deserves to be pardoned. Now, Maharaj Pariksit also did not mind the curse offered to him by a foolish Brahmana. This is Maharaj Pariksit's personal reaction. When he heard that he is going to die within seven days, having been cursed by the son of Shamika Rishi, so he did not mind at all. On the contrary, he took full advantage of the awkward situation. This clumsy situation in which Pariksit Maharaj had been placed. He took full advantage. What did he do? By a great will of the Lord, Maharaj Pariksit achieved the highest perfection of life through the grace of Srila Shukadeva Goswami. The events that led to Pariksit Maharaj achieving the highest perfection of life. The curse was in no way an impediment for him to achieve the highest perfection. Rather it became a kind of boon in disguise. They say boon in disguise. So it came as something very, very beneficial for Pariksit. That he took advantage by renouncing his kingdom and trying to prepare for meeting with death within one week. And in the course of that, he happened to meet Shukadeva Goswami and Shukadeva Goswami spoke the entire Bhagavatam to Pariksit Maharaj. Pariksit Maharaj got enlightened and thereby he achieved the ultimate liberation and also others who heard also achieved the same destination. And in future, anybody by hearing Bhagavatam can get the highest perfection of life simply by hearing like Pariksit Maharaj did. Simply hearing Bhagavatam.

**Key Quote:** "The whole series of events was a desire of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the events surrounding Parikshit Maharaj were part of the Lord's plan, using the analogy of Krishna using the Pandavas as instruments in the Kurukshetra war and Kala using instruments to bring about destruction.

Actually it was a desire of the Lord. The whole series of events was a desire of the Lord. And Maharaj Pariksit, Rishi Shamika and Rishi Shamika's son Shringi were all instrumental in fulfilling the desire of the Lord. The Lord wants to do something in the material world. Sometimes he directly does it. Sometimes he indirectly does it through somebody, through some instruments. Like it is actually Krishna only who killed all those Kauravas on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. But Krishna did it through the Pandavas headed by Arjuna. So Krishna tells Arjuna that I have already killed all these Kauravas. You can only be an instrument. As Kala, Krishna is always acting in this material world. Kala destroys everything in course of time. So destruction by Kala nobody can avoid. But sometimes Kala also uses some instrument to kill somebody. It is like people say natural death and death by some vehicle accident. So when it is death by vehicle accident people think oh he died because of vehicle accident. No it is Kala only who is using the vehicle accident as an instrument to actually destroy. Even if somebody dies a natural death it is Kala only who is actually bringing about the destruction. So similarly the Lord is using Maharaj Pariksit, Rishi Shamika and Shamika Sanshungi as instruments for his purpose.

The 50th verse, the last verse of this chapter. prayashaha sadavo loke paraidhvanveshu yojitah na vyathanti na hrishyanti yata atma agunashrayah The meaning of this verse is generally the transcendentalists even though engaged by others in the dualities of the material world are not distressed.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the behavior of conditioned souls, who seek material pleasure and avoid distress, with that of transcendentalists, who are indifferent to both.

Prabhupada explains this very nicely that those who are transcendentalists they are described as here sadavaha transcendentalists, saintly persons. They are never distressed or they are never happy in this material world. Why? Because they are always spiritually engaged. So they don't even consider what is the material situation. As materialists or as people who are under the crutches of maya we are always concerned whether we are getting material pleasure or material happiness and we try to avoid material distress. We are busy always. Conditioned souls are always busy trying to avoid material distress and trying to maximize material happiness. But the transcendentalists, the spiritualists those who are seriously engaged always in spiritual activities they never care whether by some reason they get material happiness or material distress. They don't care for either.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the three types of transcendentalists: jnanis, yogis, and bhaktas, and their respective goals of merging into the absolute, perceiving the Supersoul, and engaging in loving service to Krishna.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport the transcendentalists are of three kinds. The emperic philosophers the mystics and the devotees of the Lord. The jnanis, yogis and bhaktas. There is a samskara for that. Empiric philosophers aim at the perfection of merging into the being of the absolute. What is the ultimate goal of the emperic philosophers the jnanis those who cultivate spiritual knowledge with the aim of merging into the absolute truth. Sayujya mukti they want sayujya mukti. Mystics aim at perceiving the all pervading super soul. Mystics are the ashtanga yogis. Their goal is to realize the Paramatma who is all pervading in this material world. He is Paramatma is present in everyone's heart of every living being's heart and Paramatma is also present entered into every atom. So they want to perceive that Paramatma. This is their perfection. The ashtanga yogis. And devotees of the Lord are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the personality of God. Devotees pure devotees bhaktas they only want one thing. They want to be always engaged in the transcendental loving service of Krishna. Now Srila Prabhupada further explains Since Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan are different phases of the same transcendence This is explained in the Bhagavatam. vadantita tattva vidas tattvam yad jnanam advayam brahmeti paramatmeti bhavaneti sabhyate

**Key Quote:** "All categories of transcendentalists, their aim is the absolute truth only."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the three features of the Absolute Truth (Brahman, Paramatma, and Bhagavan) and how each type of transcendentalist aims for one of these features, emphasizing that they are all non-dual.

All categories of transcendentalists their aim is the absolute truth only. But there are three features of the absolute truth and accordingly the three categories of transcendentalists are aiming for one of the features. The jnanis aim for Brahman. The mystic yogis or the ashtanga yogis aim for Paramatma and the devotees or bhaktas bhakti yogis aim at Bhagavan. But Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan are described in the Bhagavatam as advayagyana non-dual substance of the absolute truth. They are all the same. Therefore Prabhupada says these three categories of transcendentalists are beyond the three modes of material nature. All of them are transcendental to the three modes. Agunashrayaha Atma Agunashraya Those are transcendentalists. They are always beyond the modes. Material distress and happiness are products of the three modes. Always interactions of the three gunas produces either distress or happiness. Material distress or material happiness. That's the nature of this material existence. Therefore the causes of such material distress and happiness have nothing to do with the transcendentalists. Transcendentalists are engaged in spiritual activities because of which they don't care whether a material situation gives them happiness or distress. They don't care for that. Because they don't want they neither want happiness nor want distress. What do they want? They want the supreme.

They only want the supreme. The king was a devotee and the rishi was a mystic. That's why all this is explained. Parikshit Maharaj was a pure devotee of the supreme lord. He was a he was a bhakta. And Shamika Rishi was a mystic yogi. So he was Shamika Rishi was also a transcendentalist seriously engaged in Ashtanga Yoga practice. That's why he was sitting in trance trying to fix his attention on the Paramatma within the heart. So therefore both of them were unattached to the accidental incident created by the supreme lord. Parikshit Maharaj did not mind the cursing of that boy. Shamika Rishi did not mind Parikshit Maharaj insulting him. Both are transcendentalists. The playful child was an instrument in fulfilling the lord's will. Other than these two the child was simply an instrument in the lord's plan. So I will stop here.

So this verse follows the previous verse which described that Kali entered this earth planet long before Parikshit Maharaj started ruling. That is Krishna's disappearance. At the end of Dwapar Yuga, Krishna's disappearance. Then the Pandavas learned about that and then they retired, and they handed over charge of ruling the entire earth planet to Parikshit Maharaj. Then Parikshit Maharaj began ruling, and while he was storing his kingdom, he came across this personality of Kali. Kali was trying to enter his kingdom, but Parikshit Maharaj stopped him from engaging in his nefarious activities. So this particular verse is very important to understand what is the way to counteract the irreligious influence of this age of Kali.

Krishna is present in the form of the deity because he's all-powerful he agrees to enter into the deity form... Krishna is present in his transcendental form with all his transcendental potencies Krishna is fully present"
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that chanting Krishna's name directly connects one with Krishna, and that Krishna is present in the deity form due to His all-powerful nature.

Whereas Krishna is not like that. You say Krishna, you directly contact the supreme person Krishna in full. Krishna is fully present. Now we are not able to perceive the presence of Krishna in his name or in his deity form. We think this name is just another sound like so many other sounds, material sounds, no it is not. Or we think the deity in the temple is just a statue made of wood or stone or metal. We think it is just a representation. Somebody believes that in the statue of Krishna there is Krishna, they are thinking that is Krishna, no it's not what we think. You are not able to perceive the presence of Krishna in his name or in his body. It's not what we believe, it is what actually is the fact. Krishna is present in the form of the deity because he's all-powerful. He agrees to enter into the deity form when Krishna is invited by the proper spiritual process of deity installation. That's a big subject, I won't talk about that in the next lecture. I won't get into the details of that, but in the deity Krishna is present in his transcendental form. In the sound vibration of Hare Krishna, Krishna is present in his transcendental form with all his transcendental potencies. Krishna

**Key Quote:** "Kali cannot enter our life. Kali cannot enter the jurisdiction of the place where such chanting goes on... That is the technique of driving away the personality of Kali from the world... So many ways one can remain immune to the influence of Kali."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Kali cannot influence those who constantly chant Hare Krishna, worship Krishna, and engage in devotional service, providing a practical method for protection from Kali's influence.

is fully present. So therefore Srila Prabhupada says the personality of Kali was not able to enter the jurisdiction of the earth due to the presence of the personality of Godhead. As long as Krishna incarnated and he was present on the earth, Kali could not enter. And similarly, if there is an arrangement for the constant chanting of the holy names, qualities, etc., of the supreme personality of Godhead, there is no chance at all for a personality of Kali to enter. Even now, if we chant Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Kali cannot touch us. Kali cannot enter our life. Kali cannot enter the jurisdiction of the place where such chanting goes on, where Srimad Bhagavatam is recited, where Krishna is worshipped in his Deity form, where topics of Krishna are discussed by devotees, where Krishna is remembered, where Krishna is glorified, where Krishna is offered food and Prasadam is distributed. Kali cannot influence. Kali cannot touch. Kali cannot enter. Kali cannot spread his influence. That is the technique of driving away the personality of Kali from the world. Now Kali is, Kali Yuga has begun, has started. Kali is present in this world, but Kali cannot influence, even if it is not Kali. Even if we use this technique of driving away Kali's influence by constant chanting Hare Krishna, or constantly engaging in different types of devotional service to Krishna, by constantly remembering Krishna, by constantly thinking of Krishna, by constantly hearing about Krishna.

#### modern technology, broadcasting Krishna's name, counteracting evil influence

**Key Quote:** "If the state arranges to distribute transcendental sound by resounding the holy name, fame and activities of the Lord... then a favorable condition will be created... But we can drive away this evil influence by broadcasting the holy name of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how modern technology like radio and television can be used to broadcast the holy name of Krishna and counteract the evil influence of Kali, suggesting a practical application of devotional principles in the modern world.

So many ways, so many ways one can remain immune to the influence of Kali. In modernized human society there are great advancements of material science, and they have invented the radio to distribute sound in the air. Very good example Prabhupada is giving. Now it is not just radio, it is also the television. But when Prabhupada was writing this purport, at that time the radio was there available everywhere. Television was not available everywhere in all countries. So Prabhupada is writing radio is spreading that sound everywhere. So earlier they used to have what is called as a radio set. They initially had a big set. Then they had a pocket transistor or a pocket device, where you just switch on with a battery operated device, and you can hear by tuning into some radio station, some music or some commentary or some news etc. Exactly like now you can switch on a TV, which is connected through a dish antenna to the satellite, which is broadcasting some TV program from some channel. All over the world it broadcasts, and you catch that broadcast by dish antenna, and you watch that program on a TV. So instead of vibrating some nuisance sound for sense enjoyment, if the state arranges to distribute transcendental sound by resounding the holy name, fame and activities of the Lord, as they are authorized in the Bhagavad Gita or Srimad Bhagavatam, then a favorable condition will be created. The principles of religion in the world will be reestablished, and thus the executive heads who are so anxious to drive away corruption from the world will be successful. In the present age, there is so much of corruption, there is so much of evil influence due to so much rampant sinful activities all over the world, everywhere. But we can drive away this evil influence by broadcasting the holy name of the Supreme Lord, the transcendental sound, through radio, through television, through satellite TV broadcasting, etc. Nothing is bad if properly used for the service of the Lord. There is radio, TV, all these things, they are not bad by themselves. If they are used properly, if they are used for broadcasting the holy name of the Supreme Lord, chanting of the holy name, then that will be very, very effective.

Nanu Dveshti Kalim Samrat Saranga Ivasarabhuk Kushalani Ashu Siddhanti Netarani Krithaniyat The meaning of this verse is Maharaj Parikshit was a realist like the Bhutakashtra. Maharaj Parikshit was a realist. He knew perfectly well that in this age of Kali, auspicious things produce good effects immediately, whereas inauspicious acts must be actually performed to render effects. So he was never envious of the personality of Kali.

#### Kali Yuga, Sinful Acts, Reactions

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "A person does not become a victim of a sinful activity until he actually performs that sinful activity."
**Summary:** The speaker explains a special facility in Kali Yuga: one is not affected by sinful reactions until the sinful act is actually performed, contrasting it with previous yugas.

This is a very important verse, which gives some practical guidance for us to understand what kind of evil influence does Kali have in this age on all of us. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, the age of Kali is called the fallen age. This is the age where the influence of the Kala, this particular Yuga, is the most evil influence compared to Sathya, Treta or Dwapara Yugas in the past. It's called the fallen age. In this fallen age, because the living beings are in an awkward position, the Supreme Lord has given them the power to do so. The Supreme Lord has given some special facilities to them. They are handicapped because of being in Kali Yuga, so the Supreme Lord has given some special facility. What is that? By the will of the Lord, a living entity does not become a victim of a sinful act until the act is actually performed. Please hear this carefully. A person is not a victim of a sinful act until the act is actually performed. Please hear this carefully. A person does not become a victim of a sinful activity until he actually performs that sinful activity. What does this mean? The next sentence will help you understand this better. In other ages, simply by thinking of performing a sinful act, one used to become a victim of the act. What does this mean? Supposing, in a previous Yuga, somebody thought of smoking a cigarette. Immediately, they become a victim of that sinful activity. They get sinful reaction simply for thinking of smoking. Now, Kali Yuga is such that if somebody thinks of smoking, they don't get any sinful reactions for thinking in a sinful way. They get the sinful reaction simply for thinking of smoking. The sinful reaction, only if they actually smoke, they actually perform the sinful activity.

**Key Quote:** "a living being in this age is awarded with the results of pious acts simply by thinking of them."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts sinful acts with pious acts in Kali Yuga, explaining that one can gain spiritual benefit simply by thinking of performing pious acts and reiterates Maharaj Parikshit's attitude towards Kali.

Now, in this same Kali Yuga, on the contrary, Prabhupada says, a living being in this age is awarded with the results of pious acts simply by thinking of them. Opposed to sinful activity, supposing I think of doing some worship of the Supreme Lord, I think of doing it, then simply by thinking I get some spiritual benefit of actually having performed. Simply by thinking you get the benefit. So this is the special facility the Supreme Lord has given us in this age of Kali because we are handicapped due to the influence of the age, evil influence of Kali. So therefore it is described about Maharaj Pariksit. Maharaj Pariksit, being the most learned and experienced King by the grace of the Lord, was not unnecessarily envious of the personality of Kali. See, personality of Kali is adharma bandhu, he spreads his evil influence, he wants to bring in irreligion in a place where there is no irreligion, so Kali is not a very welcome personality, but still...

**Key Quote:** "Pariksit Maharaj protected his subjects from falling prey to the sinful acts of the age of Kali and at the same time he gave full facility to the age of Kali by allotting him some particular places."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Maharaj Parikshit protected his citizens from the sinful influence of Kali while still allowing Kali certain places to reside.

a truly dikkat in the nakata of human nature, so Kali is a very polite and repentant and always engaging in good deeds. So Maharaj Pariksit was not unnecessarily envious of the personality of Kali. Why was he not envious? Because he did not intend to give him any chance to perform any sinful activity. Pariksit did not kill Kali Purusha, at the same time he did not allow Kali Purusha to remain in this kingdom and do his nefarious act of spreading his evil influence among innocent people. Poor Pariksit did not allow that. So it is further said by Srila Prabhupada, Pariksit Maharaj protected his subjects from falling prey to the sinful acts of the age of Kali and at the same time he gave full facility to the age of Kali by allotting him some particular places. He gave Kali Purusha some particular places, but he also protected the citizens from not performing the sinful activities. If somebody performs a sinful activity then they give Kali a place to reside and spread the evil influence among the people. So, it is trying to make it very easy for Kali to influence...

**Key Quote:** "Kali can come and reside and spread the evil influence of spreading irreligious activities so to prevent Kali from spreading irreligious influence evil influence one should not give Kali a place to reside"
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of tuberculosis bacteria to explain how Kali spreads his influence and lists the five places where Kali resides: meat-eating, intoxication, gambling, illicit sex, and accumulating wealth.

it is just like supposing there is a tuberculosis bacteria. If somebody catches that infection of the tuberculosis bacteria, they get tuberculosis infection, then the tuberculosis bacteria sitting in the body of one person who is infected will spread to others while living and multiplying in the body of a healthy person. So if Kali is not given a chance to reside in this earth planet, where will Kali be able to reside? Wherever sinful activities like meat-eating, intoxication, gambling and illicit sex are going on, four places, and of course there is a fifth place also where gold is kept accumulated for sins gratification, five places Kali can come and reside and spread the evil influence of spreading irreligious activities. So to prevent Kali from spreading irreligious influence, evil influence, one should not give Kali a place to reside. That means there should be nobody who indulges in these five things, indulges in these five things: consuming intoxication, killing animals for meat-eating and gambling, indulging in illicit sex and keeping wealth for sins gratification. So these five things if we avoid...

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the great advantage of Kali Yuga: one can attain liberation simply by chanting Hare Krishna, and mentions Maharaj Parikshit's efforts to propagate this chanting.

then Kali will have no place to reside and spread this evil influence. So it is further told by Srila Prabhupada in the purport, at the end of the Srimad Bhagavatam, it is said that even though all nefarious activities of the personality of Kali are present, there is a great advantage in the age of Kali: one can attain salvation simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord. Bhagavatam particularly says this. Bhagavatam is a special scripture for this Kali Yuga and Bhagavatam says simply by chanting Hare Krishna, one can attain ultimate liberation from material bondage. Thus Maharaja Pariksit made an organized effort to propagate the chanting of the Lord's holy name and thus he saved the citizens from the clutches of Kali, exactly what Srila Prabhupada has done, has done or is still doing through his sincere followers. Prabhupada's movement, Krishna conscious movement, Hare Krishna movement is a movement of life, wisdom, self-respect. This con movement is meant for spreading the chanting of the holy name of the Supreme Lord Krishna, the Hare Krishna mantra, so that Kali cannot exert his influence. Kali cannot spread his evil influence. And everyone can be saved simply by this propaganda of chanting Hare Krishna. It is only for this reason that sages sometimes wish all good for the age of Kali. On the one side it is said Kali Yuga is a dangerous age, because the influence of Kali people become very sinful. But another statement is also there, Kali Yuga is a very, very special age, where simply by chanting Hare Krishna, one can drive away the evil influence of Kali, one is protected completely by chanting Hare Krishna, and one is also able to achieve ultimate liberation simply by chanting. The example of Ajamila given in the sixth canto of Bhagavatam explains in detail this particular special facility in Kali Yuga.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of Krishna Katha and the role of a Vaishnava in protecting innocent people from negative influences.

In the Vedas also it is said that by discourse on Lord Krishna's activities, one can get rid of all the disadvantages of the age of Kali. In the beginning of the Srimad Bhagavatam, it is also said that by the recitation of Srimad Bhagavatam, the Supreme Lord becomes at once arrested within one's heart. The Supreme Lord is present in everyone's heart as Paramatma, but if we engage in hearing Krishna Katha, the Supreme Lord becomes active in our heart and then he protects us from the evil influence of Kali. These are some of the great advantages of the age of Kali and Maharaj Parikshit took all the advantages and did not think any ill of the age of Kali. True to his Vaishnavite cult, a Vaishnava is compassionate upon all the living beings, but a Vaishnava never allows a sinful living entity to influence other innocent people in a negative way. One sinful person should not influence other innocent people to...

So, first, verse number 8: Kimnu Baleshu Surena Kalina Dheera Bhiruna Apramatta Pramateshu Yovruko Nrushu Vartate. The meaning of this eighth verse: Maharaj Parikshit considered that less intelligent men might find the personality of Kali to be very powerful, but those who are self-controlled would have nothing to fear. The king was powerful like a tiger and took care of the foolish, careless persons. So, a very important description of the protection given by Parikshit Maharaj to the people of his kingdom.

**Key Quote:** "One who is a devotee of Krishna is actually very intelligent."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of spiritual intelligence versus material intelligence, emphasizing that true intelligence lies in devotion to Krishna and understanding God.

The purport to the Prabhupada says, those who are not devotees of the Lord are careless and unintelligent. Why is this said? Because unless one is thoroughly intelligent, one cannot be a devotee of the Lord. Ye Krishna bhaje sei bada chatura, the statement of Chaitanya Charitamrita. One who is a devotee of Krishna is actually very intelligent. So, only an intelligent person takes to devotional service. This intelligence is not ordinary material intelligence. It is actually spiritual intelligence. Spiritual intelligence is a little different. What is spiritual intelligence? How is it different from material intelligence? Material intelligence is to be able to use one's intelligence for eating, sleeping, mating, defending, defending for sense satisfaction, for some bodily meeting bodily demands. That intelligence even the animals have, the birds have, all creatures have. That intelligence is not being talked of here. The intelligence to actually try to understand God, try to understand what is spirit, engage in spiritual activities for eternal benefit, ultimate welfare, that is spiritual intelligence, and that is different. That is not necessarily connected with the material intelligence.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the negative influence of Kali on those who are not devotees and stresses the importance of propagating devotional service to protect people from sinful activities.

So, those who are not devotees of the Lord fall prey to the actions of Kali. Kali can influence somebody who is not a devotee. What will be Kali's influence like? They will be enticed into engaging in sinful activities like meat-eating, intoxication, gambling, illicit sex, or earn a lot of money for sense gratification. These are all the evil influence of Kali on unintelligent people. And who are these unintelligent people? They are basically not devotees of Krishna. It will not be possible to bring about a saner condition in society unless we are prepared to accept the modes of action adopted by Maharaj Pariksit, that is, propagation of the devotional service of the Lord to the common man. So, in this society, if we want to avoid Kali's influence, if we want people to be protected, then we have to propagate this devotional service among the common people. That is absolutely essential if at all we want to drive away Kali or keep people protected against the evil influence of Kali.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the ninth verse, explaining Suta Goswami's narration about Lord Krishna in connection with the history of Maharaj Parikshit to the sages of Naimisaranya.

Mata-Bhagavatam. The ninth verse: Upavaranyitam etad vah Punyam Pariksitam Maya Vasudeva Kathopetam Aakhyanam yad aprichathah. The meaning of this ninth verse is: O sages, as you did ask me, now I have described almost everything regarding the narration about Lord Krishna in connection with the history of the pious Maharaj Parikshit. This has got reference to Suta Goswami being selected as the president of the assembly where the sages of Naimsharanya are assembled to perform a thousand year sacrifice. So, the sages requested Suta Goswami to speak about Krishna katha. So, when Suta Goswami saw the eagerness of the sage Naimsharanya to hear about Krishna, he told them, "Now I shall recite the Srimad Bhagavatam because you are eager to hear about Krishna." But the sages said, "Before you begin this reciting Srimad Bhagavatam, kindly tell us something more about Pariksit Maharaj." So, in that regard, Suta Goswami is telling, "I have described almost everything about the history of the pious Maharaj Parikshit in connection with Lord Krishna."

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is never alone, Krishna performs his pastimes in relationship with his devotees"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Srimad Bhagavatam contains descriptions of both the activities of the Lord and the activities of His pure devotees, emphasizing that Krishna is always with his devotees.

So, that is completed by Suta Goswami at this juncture. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, Srimad Bhagavatam is history of the activities of the Lord, and the activities of the Lord are performed in relation with the devotees of the Lord. Therefore, the history of the devotees is not different from the history of Lord Krishna's activities. So, Bhagavatam contains a description of the activities of the Supreme Lord in his various incarnations, but Bhagavatam also contains a description of the activities of the pure devotees of the Lord in their relationship with the Lord. When Krishna descends, Krishna comes with his pure devotees. Those pure devotees also perform activities, just like the description is there of Sudama Vipra, Sudama Brahman. So, his activities, his devotion, his visiting Krishna, his mode of living, all that is described, and that is also Krishna katha. Anything in relationship with Krishna, a devotee, the Lord regards both the activities of the Lord and those of his pure devotees on an equal level, for they are all transcendental. Sometimes foolishly people think, "Why should I hear about some devotee's history? I don't want to hear. I want to hear about Krishna only." But such foolish people don't understand Krishna is never alone. Krishna performs his pastimes in relationship with his devotees. Krishna is always with his devotees, especially Krishna is always with his

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of systematically hearing the Bhagavatam every day, even in small portions, to progress towards eternal life.

So, we should hear topics connected with the transcendental activities of the Personality of Godhead because he's always with his devotees. In a purport, Srila Prabhupada says, the systematic hearing of the transcendental activities, qualities, and names of Lord Sri Krishna pushes one towards eternal life. This is described elsewhere in the Bhagavatam. Here in the first chapter, in the first canto, in the second canto, this is described. You should make a program to systematically hear the Bhagavatam. Bhagavatam is a very big scripture, 18,000 verses. But hear little by little by little every day. And what will happen if you hear every day? It is said here that you go on hearing, hearing, hearing Bhagavath Shravan. Hearing Srimad Bhagavatam every day. Prabhupada instituted the system of having a Bhagavatam discourse every day in the temple. And if you cannot come to the temple, you can watch the Bhagavatam discourse on the channel, on the broadcast channel. You can hear the Bhagavatam discourse. So, systematic hearing. Every day you hear, little, little, little, little. And if you cannot hear at the time the class is conducted, because morning you may be busy, class happens in the morning, then you can hear later in the day or in the evening. And you can hear the Bhagavatam discourse. You are hearing the same discourse. It is stored. So, by simply hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, you are progressing towards eternal life.

Systematic hearing means knowing Him gradually in truth and in fact. See. You know factually about Krishna, not as an imaginary person, not some sentiment, but in actuality become realized about Krishna's personality. It is very, very special. And knowing Krishna in truth and fact means attaining eternal life, as stated in Bhagavad Gita. Bhagavad Gita says that anyone who knows Krishna in truth and fact, Krishna says, janma karma chame divyam evam yo veti tatvatah tyatva deham punar janma neti mam eti sorjuna. Simply by knowing in truth and fact, in truth and fact about Krishna, means attaining eternal life. Tyatva deham punar janma neti mam eti. One goes back to the spiritual abode of the Supreme Lord, and attains eternal life in association with Him. Punar janma neti. So, that's why Prabhupada is saying here, make a habit of hearing Bhagavatam every day, and your life will be successful. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Accidental sins committed by a devotee are sincerely regretted, and by the grace of the Lord, all sins unwittingly committed by a devotee are burnt in the fire of repentance."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Maharaj Parikshit's repentance for his actions and how a devotee's sincerity can burn away sinful reactions through the Lord's grace.

Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya, Narayanam Namaskritya, Naram Chai Vanarottamam, Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udhirayet. In this session we will be discussing from three verses, verse numbers 1, 2 and 3 of the 19th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. We are beginning a new chapter. This 19th chapter of the first canto is entitled The Appearance of Shukadeva Goswami. This is text number 1. The meaning of this verse is: Shri Suta Goswami said, "While returning home, the king Maharaj Pariksha felt that the act he had committed against the faultlessness of the king was not right. The powerful brahmana was heinous and uncivilized. Consequently, he was distressed. The pious king regretted his accidental improper treatment of the powerful brahmana who was faultless. Such repentance is natural for a good man like the king, and such repentance delivers a devoted heart. The devotees are naturally faultless. Accidental sins committed by a devotee are sincerely regretted, and by the grace of the Lord, all sins unwittingly committed by a devotee are burnt in the fire of repentance." So essentially, Srila Prabhupada is telling that Pariksit, being a pure devotee, is naturally faultless, but accidentally he committed a mistake, and he was very, very repentant about it. So in the fire of repentance, such sinful reactions are burnt away.

**Summary:** This segment explains King Parikshit's understanding that neglecting the Supreme Lord's injunctions will lead to difficulties and his desire to face the consequences to learn from his mistakes.

The second verse, dhruvam tatome krita devahelanat duratyayam vyasanam nathidirghat tadastukamam yaga niskrtayame yathana kuryam unarevam addhav. The meaning of the second verse is, "King Pariksit thought, Due to my neglecting the injunctions of the Supreme Lord, I must certainly expect some difficulty to overcome me in the near future. I now desire without reservation that the calamity come now, for in this way I may be freed of this sinful action and not commit such an offense again." In this verse, Pariksit is thinking to himself, while he is returning home, that Pariksit has certainly neglected to follow the injunctions of the Supreme Lord. Now what are the injunctions of the Supreme Lord? That is explained in the purport, which we will just read. And because of that, he definitely is expecting to face some problem, some difficulty. Now he also is desiring that let that calamity happen now. Why? Because he will be then freed from that sinful action, and it will also be a lesson for him that he will never again commit such an offense. So this is sincere repentance by Pariksit,

**Key Quote:** "The Supreme Lord enjoins that Brahmanas and cows must be given all protection."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the importance of protecting Brahmanas and cows, the impartiality of God's laws, and how a devotee's actions affect their family, emphasizing the responsibility of a devotee.

In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The Supreme Lord enjoins that Brahmanas and cows must be given all protection. The Lord is himself very much inclined to do good to Brahmanas and cows. go brāhmaṇa hitāya ca." There is one prayer to Krishna: namo brahmaṇya devāya go brāhmaṇa hitāya ca jagadhitāya kṛṣṇaya govindāya namo namah. So in this prayer to Krishna, it is clearly declared that Krishna is very much inclined, go brāhmaṇa hitāya ca, for the welfare of go brāhmaṇa, cows and the brāhmaṇas. Maharaj Pariksit knew all this and thus he concluded that his insulting a powerful brāhmaṇa was certainly to be punished by the laws of the Lord. Laws of nature are the laws of God, and they operate in this material world very impartially, very strictly. Nobody can escape them. Somebody may escape the laws of the government, but nobody can escape the laws of God or laws of nature. And it is said further, he was expecting something very difficult in the very near future. He therefore desired the imminent calamity to fall on him and not on his family members. Why is this? Because it is said here, a man's personal misconduct affects all his family members. Therefore Maharaj Pariksit desired the calamity to fall on him alone, not on his family members. By suffering personally, he would be restrained from future sins, and at the same time, the sin which he had committed would be counteracted so that his descendants would not suffer. That is the way a responsible devotee thinks, very, very disciplined in thinking, speaking and acting. Through mind, through words, and through the body, we act three ways. So all of them are very regulated, restrained in the case of a devotee, a responsible devotee. The family members of a devotee also share the effects of a devotee's service to the Lord. Example is given by Srila Prabhupada, Maharaj Prahlad saved his demon father by his personal devotional service. A devotee's son in the family is the greatest boon.

**Key Quote:** "Progressive human civilization is based on Brahmanical culture, God consciousness, and protection of cows."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of Brahmanical culture, God consciousness, and cow protection as the foundation for progressive human civilization and how economic development is useless without these principles.

The third verse, adyaiva rājyaṁ balamṛddha-kōśam prakopita brahma kulānalome dahatu abhadrasya unarna me abhūt pāpīya sīdhir dvijadeva gobhyahā. The meaning of this third verse is, "I am uncivilized and sinful due to my neglect of Brahmanical culture, God consciousness, and cow protection. Therefore I wish that my kingdom, strength and riches burn up immediately by the fire of the Brahman's wrath so that in the future I may not be guided by such inauspicious attitudes." So this is another description in the Bhagavatam, in this chapter, that Pariksit was very, very, very repentant about the mistake he had done, and he wants the reaction to come immediately now. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, progressive human civilization is based on Brahmanical culture, God consciousness, and protection of cows. dvijadeva gobhyahā. This is the Sanskrit that is used in this verse. vijā refers to the Brahmanical culture, deva refers to God consciousness, gobhyahā refers to protection of cows. All economic development of the state by trade, commerce, agriculture and industries must be fully utilized in relation to the above principles, the principles of Brahmanical culture, God consciousness, and cow protection. Otherwise, all so-called economic development becomes a source of degradation. If economic development does not actually result in taking care of Brahmanical culture, God consciousness, and cow protection, then such economic development is useless.

**Key Quote:** "The age of Kali aims at killing the higher principles of life."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how cow protection leads to God consciousness and the perfection of human civilization, the negative influence of Kali Yuga, and the importance of engaging wealth and strength in advancing Brahmanical culture and God consciousness.

Human society will not make real progress without such principles being adhered to. Cow protection means feeding the Brahmanical culture, which leads towards God consciousness, and thus, the perfection of human civilization is achieved. The age of Kali aims at killing the higher principles of life. Kali Yuga is an age in which the influence of Kali promotes irreligion. Kali is called adharma bandhu. Kali influence spreads irreligion. The influence of Kali is the same throughout the state. Therefore, the age of Kali aims at killing the higher principles of life. Although Maharaj Pariksit strongly resisted the domination of the personality of Kali within the world, the influence of the age of Kali came at an opportune moment, and even a strong king like Maharaj Pariksit was induced to disregard the Brahmanical culture due to a slight provocation of hunger and thirst. How did Maharaj Pariksit commit this mistake? He was extremely thirsty and hungry. Now, such hunger and thirst is not difficult to tolerate for a great soul like Maharaj Pariksit, but somehow, it so happened that he did commit this mistake while he was thirsty and tired and looking for drinking water. Maharaj Pariksit lamented the accidental incident and he desired that all his kingdom strength and accumulation of wealth would be burned up for not being engaged in Brahmanical culture, etc. He wanted punishment, and that punishment also, should be such that he learns a lesson, he does not commit a similar mistake in the future, and also, the sin is counteracted so that the future generations of his family are not affected. So, considering all this, he wanted that immediately, he get the reaction. So, Srila Prabhupada says, the lesson for us is, where wealth and strength are not engaged in the advancement of Brahmanical culture, God consciousness, and God protection, the state and home are surely doomed.

Providence here means the laws of nature, the laws of God. If we want peace and prosperity in the world, we should take lessons from these words. Every state and every home must endeavor to advance the cause of Brahmanical culture for self-purification, God consciousness for self-realization, and God protection for getting sufficient milk and the best food to continue a perfect civilization. This is the conclusion by Srila Prabhupada. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Jai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet.

The meaning of this verse is: The fortunate king said, 'Indeed we are the most great, full of all the kings who are trained to get favors from the great souls. Generally you, the sages, consider royalty as refuse to be rejected and left in a distant place.' So these are the first words spoken by Pariksit Maharaj after receiving the great saintly persons, all categories of great sages, by bowing down and standing up with folded hands and telling them of his decision to fast until death. Then he is telling that the appearance of all those great saintly persons itself is indication that Pariksit Maharaj is the greatest saintly person who has ever been worshipped as a saintly person. He is very, very fortunate.

**Summary:** The speaker explains why saintly persons are independent of worldly power and wealth, quoting Srila Prabhupada and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu on the dangers of associating with materialistic people for those seeking spiritual advancement.

To be able to get such wonderful association at the last stage of his quitting the body in the association of great saintly persons, because such great souls, they have no respect for great kings who are powerful and have great personalities, who have great courage in fighting in battle and who wield power and rule over citizens. They are independent. Saintly persons are independent of all such Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and other greats of people. So why does Pariksit say that sages consider royalty as refuse to be rejected and left in a distant place? So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport. Prabhupada says, 'According to religious principles, stool, urine, wash water, etc., must be left at a long distance.' Formerly, the toilets, etc., were built or placed very far away from the living quarters because all such refuse garbage has to be discarded at a long distance, far away from where we live in a clean atmosphere. Attached bathrooms used to be... is cited herein in relation to the kingly order for those who are progressively marching back to Godhead. So, if you are serious about going back to Godhead, you should not associate too much with worldly-minded people. And Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said that to be in intimate touch with dollars and cents men or the kingly order is worse than suicide.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of renunciation and sense control for spiritual progress, quoting Chaitanya Mahaprabhu on the dangers of even glancing at objects of sense gratification.

for one who desires to go back to Godhead. What does Chaitanya Mahaprabhu say? Nishkinchanasyabhagavadbhajanonmukhasyaparamparamjigamishorbhavasagarasya. If one is a saintly person, nishkinchana means he is a renunciant, he has given up all material possessions and he is engaged in bhagavadbhajana, in devotional service to Krishna.

You cannot expect that you will cross over the ocean by swimming, by your own endeavour, independent endeavour. No. So material existence is not easy to cross over. It is compared to an ocean. So many obstacles and difficulties are there in crossing over this material existence. So such a person, a serious person, a serious transcendentalist, for him, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, sandarshanam vishainam atha yoshitam ca, merely glancing, sandarshanam vishainam sense enjoyers, or objects of sense gratification, vishainam atha yoshitam ca, ha hantahant vishabhakshanato pya sadhu, is worse than willingly drinking poison. So it is very, very important. So, it is very, very dangerous for a saintly person, who has renounced all material facilities and comforts, to even look at sense gratifiers or objects of sense enjoyment. So, this is Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's instruction.

**Key Quote:** "This material world is a perverted reflection of the spiritual world."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the material world is an illusion, a reflection of the spiritual world, and that true spiritual knowledge leads to detachment from material attractions.

So, this is Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's instruction. not generally associate with men who are too enamored by the external beauty of God's creation. Whatever material beauty that is actually the creation of the illusory energy meant for those who want to enjoy materially and thereby become entangled in material existence and continue the repetition of birth and death, whereas transcendentalists give up all illusory sense objects, objects of sense gratification and also don't associate with sense enjoyers. By advanced knowledge in spiritual realization, the transcendentalist knows that there is nothing but a shadowy reflection of the reality, the kingdom of God. This is very clearly explained in the 15th chapter. This material world is a perverted reflection of the spiritual world. Reflection means the object which is reflected and seen as a reflection. That object is the real reality. Reflection is not the reality, it is a shadow of the reality. So, if you are interested in reality. If you have a material world, which is the kingdom of God, then this material world, however nice it may appear or however nice it may be promising, it actually is nothing other than a reflection or a shadow. It means there is no substance in trying to enjoy materially. So, a transcendentalist who has got advanced knowledge in spiritual realization knows this fact, has realized this fact and therefore such transcendentalists are not very much captivated by royal opulence or anything like that.

**Key Quote:** "realized knowledge, jnana has to become vijnana, then vijnana means one is able to practice, one is able to follow, one is able to act on the platform of that knowledge."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the process of spiritual realization, from hearing to internalizing knowledge, and clarifies that Pariksit Maharaj's situation was unique, as he was being called back to Godhead by Krishna.

They are not attracted by the palace in which a king may stay, the comfortable facilities a very rich man may have for his bodily comforts, for his enjoyment, for his happiness, material happiness. A transcendentalist is never attracted by any of those things. This is not possible, only if there is realization of the knowledge. First of all one has to hear from the proper authority, spiritual authority. And then one has to internalize that, what has been heard and digest that information, that knowledge. realized knowledge, jnana has to become vijnana, then vijnana means one is able to practice, one is able to follow, one is able to act on the platform of that knowledge. Now here Srila Prabhupada says about Pariksit Maharaj, but in the case of Pariksit Maharaj the situation was different. Apparently the king was condemned to death by an inexperienced brahmana boy. So it appears like when the king was cursed, oh he had insulted the sage, therefore the sage Shamika Rishi, his Shamika Rishi's son Sringi, a powerful brahmana boy condemned him. King Pariksit to die within seven days by snake bite, so somebody may think that the king is a very ordinary person in spiritual terms, he is very ordinary person, he is foolishly acted by insulting a great saintly person, a great sage, but no. Prabhupada clarifies, don't mistake Pariksit to be an ordinary worldly person. But factually Pariksit was called by the Lord to return to him, to return to God. So it is Krishna's arrangement for Pariksit to return back to godhead immediately.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by highlighting the importance of devotional service and the association of devotees, explaining why great sages were eager to associate with Pariksit Maharaj, a descendant of the Pandavas.

So, Prabhupada says further, other transcendentalists, the great sages and mystics who assembled together because of Maharaj Parikshit's fasting unto death, were quite anxious to see him for he was going back to Godhead. Why did these great sages come there? They knew that Parikshit is not an ordinary king, he is a pure devotee and he is ready to go back to Godhead. Let us associate with him. Maharaj Parikshit could also understand that the great sages who assembled there were all kind to his forefathers, the Pandavas, because of their devotional service to the Lord. See, devotional service is the topmost spiritual practice and great devotees are recognized by advanced transcendentalists as the topmost transcendentalists in the material world. So, Pandavas were respected like that and Parikshit Maharaj was a descendant of the Pandavas. Therefore, he was very happy to actually receive the great sages and have their association at the last moment of his life.

**Key Quote:** "A devotee is fully surrendered to Krishna, and his life is in Krishna's hands. So he considers anything that happens, good or bad in his life, materially good or bad, to be the mercy of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains Pariksit Maharaj's humble acceptance of the brahmana's curse as the Lord's mercy, highlighting the devotee's surrender and detachment from material attachments.

In this session we will be discussing two verses, the fourteenth and the fifteenth verses of the nineteenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. So the fourteenth verse is as follows: तस्यैवमे अगस्य परावरेशो व्यासक्त चित्तस्य ग्रहेश्व भीक्षनं निर्वेदमूलो विजशापरूपो यत्रप्रसक्तो भयमाशुधत्ते. The meaning of this fourteenth verse is: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the controller of both the transcendental and mundane worlds, has graciously overtaken me in the form of a Brahmana's curse. Due to my being too much attached to family life, the Lord, in order to save me, has appeared before me in such a way that only out of fear I will detach myself from the world. So what is Pariksit telling? That he considers himself to be an attached householder. He is taking a humble position as a pure devotee. Pure devotees are always very, very humble. Even though they are the most advanced transcendentalists, they don't consider themselves as very advanced. So they are careful not to become proud, not to be arrogant, not to offend others. Pariksit is taking, especially in front of the saintly persons who have all assembled there, a very humble position: that I am too much attached to family life. I was living in a comfortable palace. I was surrounded by so much wealth, power, comforts. So in order to make me detached from this world, the Supreme Lord has appeared before me in the form of a brahmana's curse to die within seven days. So this is the nature of a devotee. A devotee is fully surrendered, a pure devotee especially, is fully surrendered to Krishna, and his life is in Krishna's hands. So he considers anything that happens, good or bad in his life, materially good or bad, to be the mercy of the Supreme Lord. This is explained in the Bhagavatam, 10th canto, 14th chapter, in the prayers of Lord Brahma to Krishna: Tattenu Kampam Susamiksha Mano Bhunjana Evatmakrita Vipakam. My dear Lord, it is only your mercy that I am facing some material difficulties or some material miseries because actually I deserve to suffer much, much, much, much more due to my own past misdeeds. But you are so kind to your devotee that you have reduced that suffering that I have to undergo to the minimum as a token to encourage me in my devotional service, and that is only because of your causeless mercy upon me. So this is the attitude of a devotee when the devotee faces some difficulty or some calamity or some danger or some misery. He never blames the Lord, but rather he considers that difficulty to be the Lord's mercy upon him, and as a result of that, the devotee becomes detached from everything material, becomes completely detached.

**Key Quote:** "Such direct action is taken by the Lord in the case of a special devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's explanation of Pariksit Maharaj's situation, emphasizing that the Lord directly intervenes in the lives of special devotees to detach them from material life, using Prabhupada's own life as an example.

100% detached. In the Purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, Maharaj Pariksit, although born in a family of great devotees, the Pandavas, and although securely trained in transcendental attachment for the association of the Lord, still found the allurement of mundane family life so strong that he had to be detached by a plan of the Lord. Now, Pariksit is no ordinary king. He has appeared in the family of great devotees, pure devotees, the Pandavas, and the Pandavas have trained him in spiritual practice because of which he has developed transcendental attachment for Krishna. In spite of that, he considers family attachment as very, very strong. It is so strong that he had to be detached by a plan of the Lord. Now, Prabhupada explains, such direct action is taken by the Lord in the case of a special devotee. Lord does not intervene in the lives of everyone. Only in the lives of very, very, very great devotees the Lord intervenes. Srila Prabhupada explains, in his own life, he was doing business to maintain his family, but he was an ideal grihasta. He was very strictly practicing Krishna consciousness and he was following the instructions of his spiritual master, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur. But, when Prabhupada faced a lot of difficulties in running his business, he underwent heavy losses, so much so that he had to wind up his business, close down his business and leave home and go away to Vrindavan. So, he considered that it was Krishna's special blessing upon him that he faced those great losses, that he was forced by Krishna to give up his family, give up the business, engagement, and fully dedicate himself exclusively for spiritual life. Similarly, Pariksit considers that this Brahmana's curse is an arrangement of the Supreme Lord. It's a direct action taken by the Lord

**Key Quote:** "The Lord resides with his devotees and therefore, the presence of the great saintly persons indicated the presence of the Lord."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains that Pariksit Maharaj understood the Lord's favor through the presence of great saintly persons, emphasizing that their presence signifies the Lord's presence and facilitates spiritual advancement, before beginning to explain the 15th verse.

because of Lord's mercy on Pariksit. Maharaj Pariksit could understand this by the presence of the topmost transcendentalists in the universe. However, assembled sages are no ordinary persons. The topmost transcendentalists in the universe, they have come to the earth planet. So, the Lord resides with his devotees and therefore, the presence of the great saintly persons indicated the presence of the Lord. Why? Why is it like that? Because these great saintly persons carry the Lord within their heart. They carry the Lord within their heart. So, their presence is the same as the presence of the Supreme Lord himself. The king, therefore, welcomed the presence of the great rishis as a mark of favor of the Supreme Lord. So, Krishna is favoring Pariksit by arranging the topmost transcendentalists to that holy place so that Pariksit could get their association during the last stage of his life in this material world in order to perfectly prepare himself to go back to Godhead. The 15th verse: tamopayatam pratiyantu vipra gangachadevi dhrtachittamise dhijopasrishtah kuhakas takshakova dashatu alam gayata vishnugathah. The meaning of this 15th verse is: O brahmanas, just accept me as a completely surrendered soul and let Mother Ganges, the representative of the Lord, also accept me in that way. For, I have already taken the lotus feet of the Lord into my heart. Let the snake bird or whatever magical thing the brahmana created bite me at once. I only desire that you all continue singing the deeds of Lord Vishnu.

So this is the right attitude for a perfect devotee who is properly prepared to go back to Godhead. That Parikshit is sitting there in the holy place on the bank of the river Ganga in the association of great saintly persons, that he is praying to them, accept me as a completely surrendered soul. Surrender does not mean only surrender to Krishna. Surrender means surrender to God, surrender to Krishna, surrender to the spiritual master, surrender to the Vaishnavas, surrender to the saintly persons. So this is surrender, perfect surrender. And he is also praying, let Mother Ganges, the representative of the Lord, also accept me in that way. That means he is surrendered even to Mother Ganga. Mother Ganga is especially carrying the dust of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, so she purifies whoever comes in contact with her. So Parikshit wants to be completely purified in preparation for going back to Godhead. So therefore he is praying to Mother Ganga also, please accept me as a surrendered soul and purify me. And also he is telling he has taken the lotus feet of the Lord into his heart. He is not afraid of death due to the snake bite which is the Brahmana's curse because he is firmly situated in Krishna consciousness. Of course he is requesting the saintly persons to sing the deeds of Lord Vishnu, Vishnugatha, so he will be immersed in hearing the glories of the Supreme Lord even at the last moment of his life in this material world.

**Key Quote:** "This freedom from fear of death is a very very important point."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami concludes by emphasizing the importance of freedom from the fear of death, which is achieved through complete surrender to the Lord and the creation of a spiritual atmosphere in the association of devotees.

The purport, Srila Prabhupada says, as soon as one is given up completely unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, he is not at all afraid of death. The atmosphere created by the presence of great devotees of the Lord on the bank of the Ganges and Maharaj Pariksit's complete acceptance of the Lord's lotus feet was sufficient guarantee to the King for going back to Godhead. See, when devotees are present they create a completely spiritual atmosphere and in such a spiritual atmosphere one can be perfectly situated in Krishna consciousness. An aspiring transcendentalist or even a devotee who is prepared to go back to Godhead cannot get a better atmosphere than this: the association of topmost transcendentalists in the universe and Pariksit Maharaj has also accepted the Lord's lotus feet in his heart. So these are guaranteed for the King to go back to Godhead. And in this way, Srila Prabhupada says, he became absolutely free from all fear of death. This freedom from fear of death is a very, very important point. It is only because of the fear of death, and when actually death comes we are so afraid, that we are completely bewildered in what we should do when we have to quit the body. We try to take steps to take some material shelter or some material remedy or some material attachment. All these things bewilder a conditioned soul when quitting the body at the time of death. It is a very fearful moment, but for a pure devotee it is not at all fearful. It is completely free from fear of death. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "if at all he takes birth again in the material world, he desires three things."
**Summary:** Pariksit Maharaj expresses his desires for his next life, focusing on attachment to Krishna, association with devotees, and friendly relations with all beings.

In this session, we will be discussing two verses, the 16th and the 17th verses of the 19th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavata. The 16th verse is as follows: Punashya Bhuvyad Bhagavatyanante Ratiprasangascha Tad Ashrayeshu Mahatsuyamyam Upayami Srishtim Maitriyastu Sarvatra Namo Dvijayabhyaha. The meaning of this verse is, "Again offering obeisances unto all you brahmanas, I pray that if I should again take my birth in the material world, I will have complete attachment to the unlimited Lord Krishna, association with his devotees, and friendly relations with all living beings." So, Pariksit is speaking to the assembled sages. Great sages, great saintly personalities from all the universe have assembled there to witness Pariksit quitting his body because Pariksit is a pure devotee. Therefore, they come to witness that event, but Pariksit is taking a humble position, and he offers his obeisances to all the brahmanas assembled there, and he prays that if at all he takes birth again in the material world, he desires three things. What are the three things? One is that he will have complete attachment to the unlimited Lord Krishna. The second thing he desires is association with Krishna's devotees. And the third thing he desires is friendly relation with all living beings.

**Key Quote:** "a devotee of the Lord is no one's enemy, although there may be many enemies of a devotee."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the qualities of a devotee, emphasizing their lack of enemies, preference for devotee association, and attachment to Krishna.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains these three points in the purport. Srila Prabhupada says that a devotee of the Lord is the only perfect living being explained herein by Maharaj Pariksit. Of all the different categories of people in this world, material world, the devotee is the only perfect living being. Why? Because of certain qualifications. Srila Prabhupada says, a devotee of the Lord is no one's enemy, although there may be many enemies of a devotee. What does this mean? Yudhishthira had no enemy. He had no enmity with anybody, including Duryodhana. But Duryodhana considered Yudhishthira Maharaj as his enemy. So, this is the position of a devotee. Further, Srila Prabhupada says, a devotee of the Lord does not like to associate with non-devotees, although he has no enmity with them. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said, the characteristic of a Vaishnava is asatsangatyag-e-Vaishnava-achar. So, one category of a devotee. Asat means those who are materially attached. One category of asat is non-devotee, Krishna-abhakta. And another category of asat is strisangi, those who are simply attached to objects of sense gratification, strisangi. So, a devotee does not like to associate with non-devotees. He always wants association of other devotees. So, Srila Prabhupada says further, he desires, that is, a devotee desires association with the devotees of the Lord. This is perfectly natural because birds of the same feather mix together. Naturally, a devotee is inclined to do devotional service, hear about and glorify the Supreme Lord always. So, he would like to be in the association of other like-minded persons who are devotees like him. And the most important function of a devotee is to have complete attachment for Lord Shri Krishna, the father of all living beings. A devotee perfectly understands Krishna is the supreme father of everyone.

**Summary:** The devotee's perspective on all living beings as children of Krishna, the importance of bringing others to Krishna consciousness, and the value of association with devotees regardless of material status.

As a good son of the father behaves in a friendly way with all his other brothers, so also the devotee of the Lord, being a good son of the Supreme Father Lord Krishna, sees all other living beings in relation with the Supreme Father. Why is it that a devotee has no enmity with anyone? Because he sees everyone, irrespective of their present condition. Everyone is part and parcel of Krishna. Everyone is a good son of the Supreme Lord Krishna. But presently, some of them are forgetful of Krishna. He tries to bring back the upstart sons of the father to a saner stage. It's insanity to forget Krishna, to be independent of Krishna, to disobey Krishna's instructions. It's insane. So, a devotee preaches in such a way that somebody may become sane. And also his preaching is meant to get them to accept the supreme fatherhood of God. Maharaj Pariksit was certainly going back to Godhead. But even if he were not to go back, he prayed for a pattern of life, which is the most perfect way in the material world. How to live in this world perfectly, if at all somebody wants to live like a devotee. So, Srila Prabhupada says, "A pure devotee does not desire the company of a personality as great as Brahma, but he prefers the association of a petty living being, provided that petty living being is a devotee of the Lord." So, a devotee desires association of other devotees. Now, the other devotees' material position doesn't matter. That's not important. Just important is the fact that they are devotees.

**Key Quote:** "Facing the north is still more favorable for attaining spiritual success."
**Summary:** Explanation of the 17th verse, detailing Pariksit Maharaj's preparations for leaving his body, including renunciation, auspicious arrangements, and facing the north for spiritual success.

The seventeenth verse: Itismaraja adhyavasayayuktaha Prachinamuleshu Deshu dhiraha Udanmukho dakshina koola aaste Samudra patnya swasuta niyasta bhara ha. The meaning of this seventeenth verse is, "In perfect self-control, Maharaj Pariksit sat down on a seat of straw, with straw roots facing the east, placed on the southern bank of the Ganges, and he himself faced the north. Just previously, he had given charge of his kingdom over to his son." This means Pariksit completely renounced all connections with his wealth, with his family, with his possessions, everything. But, responsibly, he did hand over charge of ruling the world to his worthy son. So, in the Patpotshila, Prabhupada says, "The river Ganges is celebrated as the wife of the sea." This is a description in the scriptures. The river always goes and joins the sea. The river flows from where it starts, and goes on flowing, flowing, flowing, till it joins the sea. So, in that sense, the river Ganga is celebrated as the wife of the sea. Here, Samudra Patnya, that is referring to the Ganges, the wife of the sea. The seat of Kusha's straw is considered to be sanctified if the straw is taken out of the earth complete with root, and the root is pointed toward the east, it is considered to be auspicious. That means Pariksit is preparing himself to go back to Godhead with all auspicious conditions, favoring his going back to Godhead. Facing the north is still more favorable for attaining spiritual success. Though, as a pure devotee, he is not dependent on all these arrangements, but taking a humble position,

**Summary:** Discussion of the Vedic varnashrama system, the roles of Brahmanas and Kshatriyas, and Pariksit Maharaj's responsible transfer of power to his son.

he adopts all the necessities required for going back to Godhead. Maharaj Pariksit handed over the charge of administration to his son before leaving home. You see, the Vedic culture, the Varnashrama system, the administration is carried out by the Kshatriyas, qualified Kshatriyas. The Brahmanas are intelligent persons who are learned in the scriptures, but they don't occupy the post of the administrator or the king. They give guidance to everyone else in the society, including the king, the Kshatriyas, the Vaishyas, the Shudras, everyone, for their spiritual success in life, and also guides them in maintaining themselves by appropriately carrying out some occupational activities. So, Brahmana is the perfect guide for everyone in the society. The Kshatriyas are meant to do administration. So, Pariksit Maharaj is ruling perfectly. When he was given charge by Yudhishthira, his grandfather, when the Pandavas retired timely, they handed over charge to Pariksit. They had trained up Pariksit before they could hand over charge. Similarly, Pariksit had trained his son Janamejaya, and Janamejaya took charge after Pariksit retired, renouncing the kingdom. So, Srila Prabhupada concludes by telling, Pariksit was thus fully equipped for all favorable conditions in order to go back to Godhead. That is the ultimate success of the human form of life, that one may simply aim to go back to Godhead after quitting the present body.

to fast until death and prepare himself to quit his body in order to go back to Godhead. So, the devatas took note of this because he is such a great personality, famous throughout the universe because of his being a pure devotee. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, Even up to the time of Maharaj Pariksit, there were interplanetary communications. And the news of Maharaj Pariksit's fasting unto death to attain salvation reached the higher planets in the sky where the intelligent demigods live. See, Prabhupada is telling us in the upper planets there are more intelligent beings than the humans on the earth. Modern day people tend to think that all other planets are vacant and there is life only on this earth planet. But that is completely wrong. There are living beings on every planet of this creation. And there are living beings even in the spiritual planets.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of life in a desert to illustrate that life exists in various forms adapted to different environments, including the sun planet and aquatic environments.

What to speak of other planets even in this desert area of this earth planet. There may seem to be only vast expanse of some sand. But that is the uninformed ignorant foolish people who think like that there is no life. But there are so many living creatures who are adapted to live there. It is like even in a desert there are some vegetation like there are date trees. There are cactus which grow. And buried in the sand there are so many crawling insects. Some varieties of worms. So naked eye cannot see them. So therefore somebody may wrongly conclude that there is no life. But actually every type of atmosphere supports life in its own way. Just like Srila Prabhupada informs us. Even in the sun planet there are living beings with bodies made of fire. In the water there are so many aquatics. They have bodies suitable for living in water. We are terrestrial beings. We are meant to live on the land. We cannot live in the sea, like the aquatics. The aquatics cannot live on the land. You bring a fish out of water and place him on the land. He will not survive for long. So similarly if this atmosphere on the land is suitable for us.

**Summary:** The speaker continues to describe different types of living beings and their corresponding bodies, emphasizing the superior qualities of the demigods, including their intelligence, piety, and devotion to the Supreme Lord.

Like there are so many germs that are living in the air. They live in the air. There are some living beings living in the sky. That we are not aware of. But from the scriptures we get information. So just like this body is made of the earthly element that we have. There could be a body made of fire. There could be a body made of water. There could be a body made of air. There could be a body made of sky. So these are different types of material bodies for different creatures, for adapting or acclimatizing themselves to live in different places, different types of atmosphere. So the demigods live in higher planets. They are adapted to living in those conditions. So they are many times more intelligent than humans. They have much better facilities for living there. And they have much much longer duration of life. And they are pious, many times more pious than the pious human beings on the earth. So Srila Prabhupada describes the devatas. The demigods are more luxurious than human beings. But all of them are obedient to the orders of the Supreme Lord. Vishnu Bhaktas Vruto Daiva. This is the definition in the scriptures. All of them are devotees of the Supreme Lord. Therefore they are obedient to the order of the Supreme Lord. There is no one in the heavenly planets who is an atheist or non-believer.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that demigods are pleased when someone becomes a devotee of Krishna, clarifying that worshipping Krishna does not anger the demigods, but rather pleases them, highlighting the cooperation between the Lord, demigods, and devotees.

Thus any devotee of the Lord on the surface of the earth is always praised by them, the residents of the demigods in the heavenly planets. And in the case of Maharaj Pariksit, they were greatly delighted and thus gave tokens of honor by scattering flowers over the earth and by beating celestial drums. A demigod takes pleasure in seeing someone go back to Godhead. He is always pleased with a devotee of the Lord. So much so that by his Adi Daivik powers he may help the devotees in all respects. So sometimes people foolishly think that when the scriptures, we point out in the scriptures it is said you should exclusively worship Krishna and not the devatas. They think oh if we don't worship the devatas, devatas may become angry against us. But Srila Prabhupada is telling here devatas are always pleased with a devotee of the Supreme Lord Krishna because they themselves are devotees of Krishna. So don't think that if a person who is in ignorance worshipping some devata stops devata worship and instead worships Krishna as Krishna is instructed in the Bhagavad Gita. Don't think that the devatas will become angry. No. On the other hand devatas will be very pleased with such a devotee. And by their actions the Lord is pleased with them. There is an invisible chain of complete cooperation between the Lord,

All the great sages who were assembled there also praised the decision of Maharaj Pariksha, and they expressed their approval by saying very good. This is called Sadhu Vada. Naturally the sages are inclined to do good to common men, for they have all the qualitative powers of the Supreme Lord. Therefore they were very much pleased to see Maharaj Pariksha a devotee of the Lord, and they spoke as follows. So this is a description of what is the reaction of the great saintly persons who were assembled in that spot where Pariksha was sitting and fasting unto death in the holy place on the bank of the river Ganga. What is their reaction? They said very good. They approved Pariksha's decision to fast until death and prepare himself to go back to Godhead.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the purport, explaining spiritual beauty and the nature of a Sadhu, emphasizing their dedication to the welfare of others and their complete surrender to Krishna.

The natural beauty of a living being is enhanced by rising up to the platform of devotion and service. This is called spiritual beauty. Spiritual beauty is different. Material beauty is different. Maharaj Pariksha was absorbed in attachment for Lord Krishna. Seeing this the great sages assembled were very pleased, and they expressed their approval by saying very good. Sadhu Vada. Sadhu. Sadhu. Because Pariksha requested them that I am asking your opinion whether it is appropriate for me to prepare myself to go back to Godhead by fasting until death after having renounced my kingdom. So they are telling very good because that is the natural way of preparation for quitting the body for a devotee of the Lord. Such sages are naturally inclined to do good to the common man. Sadhu means, the very word Sadhu means one who lives for the welfare of others. A Sadhu is not concerned about his own welfare because he is completely surrendered to the Supreme Lord Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker continues to describe the qualities of a Sadhu and the auspiciousness of devotional service, highlighting how even a curse can become a boon for a pure devotee like Pariksit Maharaj.

He doesn't have to care for himself. On the other hand a Sadhu as a devotee. Sadhu means a devotee. So as a good devotee of the Supreme Lord, a Sadhu tries to do good to others always. So if he doesn't have to do anything for himself doesn't mean he is inactive. He is very very active in doing good for others. And when a Sadhu sees a personality like Maharaj Pariksit advance in devotional service such a Sadhu's pleasure knows no bounds. And such saintly persons offer all blessings in their power. The devotional service of the Lord is so auspicious that all demigods and sages up to the Lord himself become pleased with the devotee. And therefore the devotee finds everything auspicious. For a devotee is preparing to go back to God and nothing is inauspicious. All inauspicious matters are removed from the path of a progressive devotee. Meeting all the great sages at the time of death was certainly auspicious for Maharaj Pariksit, and thus he was blessed by the so-called curse of a Brahmana's boy. It's ironical that Pariksit was cursed but that curse turned out to be a boon in disguise. That's because Pariksit is a pure devotee.

**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains Srila Prabhupada's purport on the verse, contrasting the attachment of materialistic politicians to temporary posts with the higher goal of achieving liberation and association with the Lord.

The meaning of this verse: the sages said, "O chief of all the saintly kings of the Pandu dynasty, who are strictly in the line of Lord Sri Krishna, it is not at all astonishing that you give up your throne, which is decorated with the helmets of many kings, to achieve eternal association with the Personality of Godhead." This is the praise of these assembled saintly persons with regard to Parikshit's action of renouncing his kingdom and coming to this holy place to prepare himself to go back to Godhead by fasting unto death. So, an elaborate purport is given by Srila Prabhupada explaining this appreciation of the saintly persons of Parikshit's action. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "Foolish politicians who hold political administrative force think that the temporary post they occupy are the highest material gain of life, and therefore they stick to those posts even up to the last moment of life without knowing that achievement of liberation as one of the associates of the Lord in his eternal abode is the highest gain of life." Here, Prabhupada is comparing modern-day politicians who are those who are ignorant about spiritual reality. They think that to hold some very high position in this material world, even though it is a temporary position, they think that the post they occupy is the highest gain of their life, and they stick on to that position till they are forced to leave that by being forced to die, quit the body, and they are ignorant of the fact that they are not the body, they are spirit soul. Therefore, after quitting the body at the time of death, they have to enter another body. That they are not aware. But if they know about spiritual reality, then they understand there is something much, much, much, much greater to be obtained in this human form of life by practicing Krishna consciousness and achieving liberation to become one of the associates of the Supreme Lord in his personal abode in the spiritual

world that they do not know. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport further, "The human life is meant for achieving this end. This is the goal of human life." The Lord has assured us in the Bhagavad Gita many times that going back to Godhead, his eternal abode, is the highest achievement: *yad gatva nani vartante tad dhama paramam mama*; *madh karmakrana madh paramo madh bhaktasangavarjitah nirvaira sarvabhuteshu yassa mameti pandava yaktvadeham punarjanmaneti mameti sorjuna*. So, many places in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna is talking about this. Further, Srila Prabhupada says, "Prahlad Maharaj, while praying to Lord Narasimha, said, 'Oh my Lord, I am very much afraid of the materialistic way of life.'" Prahlad Maharaj is a pure devotee, actually he is fearless, but still he is teaching us by telling that he is very much afraid of the materialistic way of life, and he further says, "I am not the least afraid of your present ghastly ferocious feature as Nrsimha Deva." Well, Lord Nrsimha appeared to protect Prahlad Maharaj against his demoniac father. Nrsimha was very, very, very angry. Against whom was he angry? He was angry against Hiranyakashyapu. He was never angry at Prahlad, and Prahlad knew this. Therefore, Prahlad is telling Lord Nrsimha, "I am not afraid of your ferocious form, because that ferocious form is meant for protecting the devotee. He is meant to chastise the non-devotee, atheist, demon," that the devotee is confident. And Prahlad Maharaj is telling why is he afraid of materialistic way of life. He is telling, "This materialistic way of life is something like a grinding stone, and we are being crushed by it." See, foolish people don't realize that taking birth in the material world means accepting a material body, and this material body is subject to so many miseries under the influence of these three *gunas* which are constantly harassing us in the form of different kinds of miseries being inflicted against our being—*vishnu*. *Adi bhautika klesha, adhyatmika klesha, adi daivika klesha, adi bhautika kess wastewater, abhyatmika klesha, vishulya, and any kunti and any sort of dem Dievikal klesha*. They don't want us to face the agenda beyond our awareness and control in the form of different kinds of miseries being inflicted against our wish. *Adi bhautika klesha Adi* spiritually 大以上的外外. And balanced by that divine nature and grit.

**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami continues explaining Prahlad Maharaj's prayer, using the analogy of being tossed in the ocean to illustrate the suffering in the material world and emphasizing the importance of seeking shelter at the Lord's lotus feet for liberation.

constantly being harassed by this. So, Prahlad Maharaj is giving an analogy, it's something like being crushed in a grinding stone continuously. And another example Prahlad is giving here when praying to Narasimha Deva, he is telling, "We have fallen into this horrible whirlpool of the tossing waves of life. My Lord, I pray at your lotus feet to call me back to your eternal abode as one of your servitors." Another example Prahlad is giving, suppose somebody who's meant to live on the land falls into the middle of the ocean, then ocean means continuously there are waves, and these waves will toss the person up and down, up and down. So, it will be a struggle to keep himself afloat because continuously waves will be coming and trying to overpower the person who has to protect himself against being drowned by those waves. So, in a similar way through this, Prahlad is telling, "This material world we are drowning in the waves of the attacked by Maya in the form of continuous miseries being inflicted through the *gunas*. Instead," Prahlad Maharaj is praying to the Lord, "Please call me back to your eternal abode as one of your servants." Prahlad further says, "This is the summit liberation of the materialistic way of life. If at all you want freedom from the suffering of this world, then you should simply aim to become one of the eternal associates of the Supreme Lord in his personal abode as his loving devotional servitor."

#### material suffering, separation from Krishna, unwanted miseries
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/tztk2AgxKQ4?t=627

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "In whichever species of life I have taken birth compelled by the force of my own activities I have very painfully experienced two things: separation from my beloved and meeting with what is not wanted."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami elaborates on Prahlad Maharaj's bitter experiences in the material world, focusing on the pain of separation from Krishna and the constant experience of unwanted miseries.

That is what Prahlad Maharaj is teaching in this prayer. And what is Pariksit praying for? He is also preparing to go back to the spiritual world to become one of the associates of the Supreme Lord. Further, Prahlad is telling, "I have very bitter experience of the materialistic way of life." He has already said it is like a grinding stone in which we are getting crushed, or like falling into a rock, or like falling into a middle of the ocean being tossed by the waves continuously. Now further he is telling the bitter experience he has had in this material world. What is that? "In whichever species of life I have taken birth, compelled by the force of my own activities, I have very painfully experienced two things." This is common for everyone, not just for Prahlad. Please hear carefully, two things that everyone is experiencing which they don't realize. What are the two things? Separation from my beloved. Who is our beloved? Our beloved is the Supreme Lord Krishna. In the material world we are separated from him. And the second thing is we all experience meeting with what is not wanted. Unwanted miseries are forced upon us in this material existence. And further Prahlad says, "To counteract these unwanted miseries, the remedies which I undertook were more dangerous than the disease itself." We are suffering from a disease called *bhava roga*. *Bhava roga* and material means to counteract this *bhava roga* are worse than suffering the disease of *bhava roga* itself. So, I drift from one point to another birth after birth. The misery doesn't stop simply by giving up one body thinking that my suffering will be coming to an end when I quit the body. Just like when somebody is suffering too much, they wish that they die rather than live, especially somebody who has got a terminal illness, chronic disease, they cannot tolerate the suffering and they wish and pray that I may die. But death is not the solution because they are going to take birth again, and taking birth again without preparing to go back to God, it means one more material body, and again that material body also under the clutches of Maya, they are going to suffer similarly. Therefore, Prahlad is concluding the prayer by telling, "I pray to you therefore to give me shelter at your lotus feet. I don't want to be under the clutches of Maya." That's what Prahlad is telling.

**Key Quote:** "The Pandava kings who are more than many saints of the world knew the bitter results of materialistic way of life, they were never captivated by the glare of the imperial throne they occupied."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami concludes by highlighting the detachment of the Pandava kings and their readiness to give up their thrones to associate with the Lord, emphasizing the importance of following Krishna's instructions and living unattached to material possessions.

Now Srila Prabhupada continues by telling, "The Pandava kings who are more than many saints of the world knew the bitter results of materialistic way of life. They were never captivated by the glare of the imperial throne they occupied." They were very, very powerful. They were emperors of the world, entire world, very powerful, but they were not captivated by some allurement of Maya. Therefore, they always sought the opportunity being called by the Lord to associate with him eternally. They were just waiting, "As long as the Lord wants us to rule this world, we will rule, but when he calls us back, we are ready to go for eternal life there." So, this is temporary, material existence is temporary. So, Maharaj Parikshit said that, so Maharaj Parikshit was the worthy grandson of Maharaj Yudhishtira. So, just like Maharaj Yudhishtira gave up the imperial throne to his grandson, who is his grandson, Parikshit. Similarly, Parikshit gave up the imperial throne to his son Janamejaya. That is the way of all the kings in the dynasty. They are all strictly in the line of Lord Krishna. That is what is described in this verse by the sages. All the kings in these saintly dynasty of saintly kings, *Rajarshi Parampara*. Krishna says, *evam parampara praptam imam rajarsha yo viduh*, the saintly kings, they strictly follow the instructions of Krishna. They don't permanently hold on to any post in the material world. So, they live unattached to all the objects of materialistic way of life. They never are attached. So, giving up is very easy for them, and giving up for what? For spiritual life. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's purport, contrasting the limited material creation with the vast spiritual sky (Paravyoma) and the Vaikuntha planets, referencing the Bhagavad Gita.

This verse is spoken by the assembled sages. They have assembled in that holy spot where Pariksit decided to sit down to fast until death, preparing for quitting his body to go back home, back to the environment, on the bank of the river Ganga, a holy place. These sages who were received very respectfully by Pariksit, it was, keep saying that, Maharaj, they have come from different parts of the universe and they are all very, very great saintly persons and they could foresee that the Srimad Bhagavatam is going to be spoken and therefore they have come here to listen to the Bhagavatam. And the purport Srila Prabhupada explains, beyond the limitation of the material creation which is compared to the cloud in the sky, there is the paravyoma or the spiritual sky full of planets called Vaikunthas. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita and the Srimad Bhagavatam. In the Bhagavad Gita it is said by Krishna. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . changes in terms of creation, maintenance and destruction.

**Key Quote:** "The information or the reality of the truth about spiritual planets in the spiritual sky is known only to the devotees only to bhakti yogis the category of transcendentalist called personalists or bhakti yogis or devotees"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while materialists and impersonalists have limited or incomplete understanding of the spiritual realm, only devotees (bhakti yogis) truly understand the Vaikuntha planets.

So, Srila Prabhupada is quoting that Bhagavad Gita and telling beyond the limitation of the material creation. Material creation is limited even though in the material creation there are millions of universes and each universe has millions of planets, each planet has millions of living entities but still it is comparable to a cloud in the sky. It is like a sky is very vast but the cloud is just few hundred meters or at the most a few kilometers spread over the sky, vast sky, expanse of the sky. Similarly, there is the Paravyoma, the spiritual sky, Paravyoma. Vyoma means the sky and Paravyoma is the spiritual sky. Now, the spiritual sky is not known to everyone. Of course, the materialists have no conception of spiritual nature at all because they only accept what is perceivable by their gross senses. And some other materialists who may accept something about the mind. They may imagine something beyond what is grossly manifest. But the transcendentalists from the authoritative scriptures are aware of the spiritual nature. But even among the spiritualists, there is a spiritual nature. transcendentalists who are aware of the spiritual nature the impersonalists only know about the spiritual sky which is called paravyoma or brahma jyoti or brahman manifestation beyond the material creation but they do not know that the spiritual sky is full of planets called vaikunthas so the information or the reality of the truth about spiritual planets in the spiritual sky is known only to the devotees only to bhakti yogis the category of transcendentalist called

**Key Quote:** "Vaikuntha planets also have different names such as purushottama loka achyuta loka trivikrama loka hrishi kesha loka kesava loka aniruddha loka"
**Summary:** The speaker lists various Vaikuntha planets and explains that they are named after the specific form of the Supreme Lord who predominates there, unlike the material world where different planets are ruled by different demigods.

personalists or bhakti yogis or devotees such vaikuntha planets are also differently known as proper gives the names of different vaikuntha planets just like the material planets we have names like brahma loka mahar loka jana loka tapo loka satya bhu loka bhuvar loka atala sutala vitala talatala like that so vaikuntha planets also have different names such as purushottama loka achyuta loka trivikrama loka hrishi kesha loka kesava loka aniruddha loka mada loka pradyumna loka sankarshana loka mada loka sridhar loka vaikuntha contains the ultimate nirvana of all things good and evil the true and absolute truth of the whole world is that Shridhara Loka, Vasudeva Loka, Ayodhya Loka, Dwarka Loka and many other millions of spiritual Lokas. So the name of the Vaikuntha planet if it is say the name is Purushottama Loka because it is predominated by the Supreme Lord whose name is Purushottama. If the predominating deity of the Vaikuntha planet is Trivikrama that planet is called Trivikrama Loka. If the predominating deity is Vasudeva it is called Vasudeva Loka like that. Now Dwarka is... Krishna's own abode. Ayodhya is Lord Ramachandra's own abode. Like this there are many millions of spiritual Lokas wherein the personality of Godhead predominates. Unlike in the material world the different planets the predominating deities are different Devatas. So different Devatas are different. Different living beings. But in the spiritual world in the spiritual sky the spiritual planets are predominated by one person.

#### liberated souls, spiritual bodies, freedom from suffering

**Key Quote:** "Unlike in the material world the different planets the predominating deities are different Devatas...But in the spiritual world in the spiritual sky the spiritual planets are predominated by one person."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the conditioned souls in the material world with the liberated souls in the spiritual planets, emphasizing that the latter possess spiritual bodies and are free from birth, death, old age, and disease.

One and only one Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now the Supreme Personality of Godhead himself even though he is one and only one person he expands himself in millions of forms each form having a different name. So according to the name of the particular form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the Loka also derives its name. Achyuta is one expansion of the Supreme Lord. So where Achyuta predominates that planet is called Achyuta Loka like that. Now the special thing about these planets is the spiritual planets is all the living entities there in the spiritual planets are liberated souls. They are all liberated souls. And in the material world in the material planets in the material universes all are conditioned souls. You see the difference. Here anybody who is taking birth in this material world with a material body is a conditioned soul. The liberated souls never accept a material body. They live in the spiritual planets Vaikuntha Lokas. They live with spiritual bodies as good as that of the Lord. The Lord has a spiritual body. He never comes in touch with matter. He never has any material contact or material body never. So just like the Lord the living entities also there are liberated souls with spiritual bodies as good as that of the Lord. There is no material contamination. We are just come. Everything there is spiritual. And therefore there is nothing objectively lamentable. Vishokam. They are full of transcendental bliss and are without birth, death, old age and disease. See the material world is characterized by these four defects. Janmamrtyu, Jaravyadhi, Dukha, Doshanu, Darshanam. That is a description of the material world. The spiritual world in the spiritual planets there is no birth, no death, no disease, no old age.

**Summary:** The speaker mentions Goloka Vrindavana as the supreme abode of Lord Krishna and explains that Maharaj Pariksit was destined to achieve it, then introduces the 22nd verse and describes Pariksit's positive reaction to the sages' words.

Amongst all the above mentioned Vaikuntha Lokas there is one supreme Loka called Goloka Vrindavana, which is the abode of the Lord Shri Krishna and his specific associates. Maharaj Pariksit was destined to achieve this particular Loka, Shri Krishna Loka or Goloka Vrindavana. And the great rishis assembled there could foresee this. All of them consulted among themselves about the great departure of the great king, and they wanted to see him up to the last moment, because they would no more be able to see such a great devotee of the Lord. The 22nd verse: Ashutyata Drishiganavaca Pariksit Samam Madhuchad Guru Chavyalikam Abhashata Enan Abhinandya Yuktaan Shushrusha Manah Charitani Vishnu. The meaning of this verse is, "All that was spoken by the great sages was very sweet to hear, full of meaning and appropriately presented as perfectly true." They have very great personality, so when they speak, it is very, very pleasing to the ears, and it is full of meaning. When they speak it is very, very pleasing, so it is full of meaning, and appropriately presented as perfectly true. They are above illusion. They are liberated souls, so when they speak everything is perfectly true. So after hearing them, Maharaj Pariksit, desiring to hear of the activities of Lord Shri Krishna, the personality of God had congratulated the great sages. So Maharaj Pariksit congratulated the great sages. This is Pariksit's reaction. When the sages spoke something, what was his reaction? So that we describe what Pariksit's reaction was in the next verse. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on why Parikshit is glorifying the sages, emphasizing their selfless welfare activities and then explaining the six opulences of Bhagavan, referencing Srila Prabhupada's purport.

Parikshit is glorifying the great sages who assembled there in that holy place. So, Parikshit is telling them, you have very kindly assembled here. Why is he telling like this? Because these sages, they have no personal interest, they only want to do welfare activity for the others, for the other conditioned souls, so therefore they are very great personalities, they are very kind to everyone, so they have kindly assembled there and they have come from different parts of the universe. The universe is very vast compared to one tiny planet that we know of, the earth planet. The universe is very vast and they are being described as good as supreme knowledge personality personified. The Sanskrit that is used is Veda Yatha Murti Dharaha. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport six kinds of opulences namely wealth, strength, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation: Aishwarya, Viriya, Yasha, Shri, Jnana, Vairagya. These are the six opulences are all originally the different attributes pertaining to the absolute personality of the universe and the absolute personality of the universe and the Godhead. This is a definition of the term called Bhagavan which is specifically applicable only to the Supreme Personality of Godhead Bhagavan Sri

Krishna. So Bhagavan Sri Krishna is full of six kinds of opulences Aishwarya Samagrasya, the sum total of all wealth belongs to Krishna. Similarly, the sum total of all the strength belongs to Sri Krishna, like that all the six opulences. The living beings who are part and parcel entities of the supreme being have all these attributes partially up to the full strength of 78 percent. Partially means the Lord has unlimited quantity of these six opulences and the living entities have very, very, very, very, very little of these opulences. Living entities have a limited quantity of each of these opulences. Lord has unlimited quantity of these opulences, so this difference eternally exists under all conditions whether the living beings have very, very, very, very, whether the living being is conditioned soul or is a liberated soul. Living being always is a part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and is always very tiny, has got limited opulence. So what is this 78% that Prabhupad is talking about? This has got reference to a comparison made in the scriptures. So that is what I am trying to explain and what it says in majlis that are the quantities of the such that God tensor Lageen ji Maha Padopal the sovereignness of the time it says thatu 살sayeri Tamsil Baseela chant 라 clothing tons of the living being already if Allah has arisen to share a partial soul or has window of seeking himself autistic of the supreme lord and is always very tiny has got limited opulence.

**Key Quote:** "The supreme personality of godhead has got unlimited qualities but among those qualities the important qualities the principal qualities are counted as 64."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the 78% figure by comparing the 64 qualities of Krishna to the 50 qualities of living entities, and how material energy covers these attributes.

between the qualities of the living entities and qualities of the supreme personality of godhead. The supreme personality of godhead has got unlimited qualities, but among those qualities, the important qualities, the principal qualities are counted as 64. Out of the 64 qualities, the living beings, the jivatmas have only 50 qualities. So both in terms of the number of principal qualities when they are compared between the living entities and Krishna, living entities have 50 and supreme lord Krishna has 64. So that 50 divided by 64 comes to 78 percent. If you work out that arithmetic it will come to 78 percent. That's what is being talked about by Prabhupada. The living entities or living beings have up to full strength of 78. In the material world these attributes up to 78 percent of the Lord's attributes are covered by the material energy, they are never exhibited as completely spiritual, but they are covered by the material energy.

**Key Quote:** "Just like the sun is covered by a cloud...similarly the original glare is pushed toward the..."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of the sun being covered by a cloud to illustrate how material energy covers the original spiritual form and effulgence of living entities.

Now an example is given, just like the sun is covered by a cloud. Sometimes it happens that the sun will be shining in the sky, but when the sun becomes covered by a cloud, the sun cannot get covered by a cloud, it appears like that to our eyes. What is blocking our view of the sun? Sun is very huge, but what is blocking the view of our sight when we try to see the sky where sun is present? We cannot see there is a cloud because the cloud is blocking our vision. Cloud cannot block the sun. So here it is said the covered strength of the sun is very dim compared to the original glare. Sun is very, very, very powerful. So the sunshine that is emanating from the sun planet, this sunshine its original glare is very, very bright, but when covered by a cloud you can dimly see some light in the sky. Similarly, the original glare is pushed toward theuis aqui similarly the original glare is pushed toward the heat of the sun andきた comes as a light right here but theASE in this case it is suppose to be visible light in the sky, but when covered by the cloud we can dimly see some light in the sky. Similarly, the original glare is very bright when covered by a cloud it is possible to see some light in this kind the strong..... color of the living beings with such attributes becomes almost extinct. So, the living entities have got their original spiritual form, have got their original effulgence, but that is covered by the material energy, covered by the material energy.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 24th verse of the 19th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Tata shchava snaam pritsam ifo ne把ram bhi chalo 擊ี่ विप्रा एति ईत्यचे अलला करिmealा ज़ब्बमरिया आनैसचे कृत्यस्य सर्वात्मणा मरीयम अनैश्य कृत्यम शुद्धमचतत्र अमृशता अभीयुखताहा.

So Parikshit is asking those great saintly persons, what is my immediate duty? Please, after proper deliberation, tell me of the unalloyed duty of everyone in all circumstances, and specifically of those who are just about to die. Parikshit asked two questions. He is asking about duty. He is asking about the unalloyed duty of everyone in all circumstances, that's the first question. And the second question is the unalloyed duty of those who are just about to die.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of Parikshit's questions and draws a parallel to Arjuna's inquiries in the Bhagavad Gita.

So Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport very nicely in these words: the king has placed two questions before the learned sages. Mind you, these are the most important questions anybody can ask with regard to spirituality. Arjuna asked Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, karpanya dosho pohata svabhavah pruchami. Here also, prucham imambi pruche, that which is to be asked, I am inquiring from you, I beg to ask you. Similarly, Arjuna is asking me...

First question of duty, about the duty of everyone in all circumstance. And the second question is, what is the specific duty of one who is to die very shortly, was about to die, what is his duty? If you remember, Pariksit Maharaj has been cursed to die in seven days, so is particularly concerned about what is his duty before he dies, what should he perform, what duty should he perform?

How to die before you die? Of the two, the question relating to the dying man is most important because everyone is a dying man, either very shortly or after 100 years. Especially on the earth planet, everyone is a dying man, mriyam aane hi. Especially those are about to die, mriyam aane hi. The duration of life is immaterial, but the duty of a dying man is very important. The whole of Bhagavad-Gita actually talks about duty, so that karma refers to prescribed duties.

So duty is a very important subject of the Bhagavad-Gita. So here that question is pertaining to the duty of a dying man, one who is about to die, what is his duty? Maharaj Pariksit placed these two questions before Sukadev Goswami also on his arrival. We will hear in after a few verses the arrival of Sukadev Goswami in that assembly. So therefore this chapter is entitled the appearance of Sukadev Goswami. So these two questions in Pariksit ask the assembled sages, the saintly persons, great sages, the same two questions he'll place in front of Sukadev Goswami a little later. So Prabhupada says practically the whole of the Sreemad Bhagavatam beginning from the second canto up to the last twelfth canto deal with these two questions, so important these questions.

are. Bhagavatam is a very, very vast literature, but everything is explained in the Bhagavatam in answer to these two questions are by Pariksit from Sukhadeva Goswami. The conclusion arrived at thereof is that devotional service of the Lord Shri Krishna, as it is confirmed by the Lord himself in the last phases of the Bhagavad Gita, is the last word in relation to everyone's permanent duty in life. Situationally, according to our present condition or situation, we may have some temporary duties, like a student has got a duty to study as long as the student. A householder has a duty towards maintenance of his family members, but that is also limited to the period of the life of the householder. When he is a householder, if the question is asked what is everyone's permanent duty in life, that is answered in the Bhagavatam. The permanent duty of everyone is to render...

...service to Krishna. Maharaj Pariksit was already aware of this fact because he is a devotee, and what does a devotee do? He simply engages in Krishna's service to please Krishna. So Maharaj Pariksit was aware as a devotee, but he wanted the great sages assembled there to unanimously give their verdict on his conviction, so that he might be able to go on with his confirmed duty without controversy. See, Pariksit is taking a very humble position. He is respecting the great sages who are assembled there as superiors, even though he himself is a pure devotee and is well aware that his only business is spiritual activity. That he knew, but taking humble position, he wanted to get it confirmed from authority.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses different methods of transcendental realization, highlighting bhakti yoga as the first-class method involving surrender to Krishna.

Now Pariksit has especially mentioned the word Shuddha are perfectly correct. For transcendental realization or self realization, many processes are recommended by various classes of philosophers. In this material world, always there are different class of philosophers. Ah, Srila Prabhupada talks about the first class method, ah, or process of, ah, uh, transcendental realization, the second class method, and the third class method. So Prabhupada says the first class method demands that one give up all other methods and surrender onto the lotus feet of the Lord and thus be safe on all sin and their sins. So first the first class method that says may stock one up all other methods and give reactions this is the first class method this is the method of bhakti bhakti yoga the other methods are dhyana yoga ashtanga yoga dhyana yoga or ashtanga yoga then there is one more method called buddhi yoga the same as bhakti yoga then there is dhyana yoga so all different methods different processes without exerting oneself without taking a risk guaranteed success at the end of this life you can take a risk and you can take a risk and you can take a risk and you can take a risk and you can take a risk and you can take a risk that is possible only when adopts the first class method of bhakti yoga.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by quoting Krishna from the Bhagavad Gita, certifying that bhakti yoga is the topmost yoga and that a devotee is the most intimately connected with Krishna.

Only then it is possible. Krishna certifies that bhakti yoga is the first class method. What does he say? Yoginam api sarvesham madgatena antaratmana shraddhavan bhajate yomam same yuktatamomata ha. Yuktatama means is most intimately united with me in yoga, who? The one who with devotion, faith, renders devotional service to me. So such a person is declared by Krishna to be the topmost yogi, yuktatama. Yoga means to connect to the supreme, and topmost yogi is one who is perfectly connected with Krishna. So therefore, yuktatamomata. So I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

This verse describes the appearance of Shukadeva Goswami, and that is the title of this chapter: The appearance of Shukadeva Goswami. Where is he appearing? He is appearing in the place where Parikshit Maharaj has decided to sit and fast until death, in that holy place, on the bank of the river Ganga, where many saintly persons have come from all over the universe to witness Parikshit quitting his body.

#### Bhagawan, Liberated Soul, Devotional Service, Detachment

**Key Quote:** "Devotional service is so satisfying that a person taking satisfaction from always being engaged in devotional service loses all interest in material affairs."
**Summary:** This segment explains the meaning of 'Bhagawan' and its application to great devotees like Shukadeva Goswami, emphasizing their detachment from material affairs due to their engagement in devotional service.

And the description is a wonderful description of Shukadeva Goswami. He is described, Prabhupada explains that in the purport elaborately. He is described by so many nice adjectives. Bhagawan. Here Bhagawan, Prabhupada says in the purport, in the purport Prabhupada says the word Bhagawan is sometimes used in relation to some of the great devotees of the Lord, like Shukadeva Goswami. Bhagawan actually means the supreme personality of Godhead, Krishna. Bhagawan, one who possesses six particular opulences to an unlimited degree. That is a precise definition: Ayishwar Yashya Samagrasya Veer Yashya Yashyasa Shreyaha Gyanavairagya Yoshchaiva Shannambhaga Itingana. This is very specific, specific definition for the word Bhagawan, when it applies to the supreme personality of Godhead, Krishna. But here Bhagawan is used for Shukadeva Goswami. Sometimes Bhagawan is used for Vyasadeva. Sometimes Bhagawan is used for Narada. Now when it is used in relation to some of the great devotees of the Lord, then it is explained by Prabhupada. Why? It doesn't mean that they are God. No. Such liberated souls are disinterested in the affairs of this material world. This is a characteristic. They are all liberated souls. So because they are liberated, they are completely pure. They don't have any taint. They don't have any taint of material contamination. They are never touched by any of the three gunas, three material modes. So they are always spiritually active. They are only engaged in spiritual activities, even in this material world. Now Shri La Prabhupada explains, why is it that they are disinterested in the affairs of this material world? Because they are self-satisfied by great achievements of devotional service. Devotional service is so satisfying that a person taking satisfaction from always being engaged in devotional service loses all interest in material affairs. Therefore it is described, disinterested in material affairs.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Shukadeva Goswami is a liberated soul by birth so he doesn't need to study the Vedas he doesn't need to practice any process of self-realization because it is already self-realized"
**Summary:** This segment discusses Shukadeva Goswami's unique position as a liberated soul by birth, explaining why he didn't require formal spiritual training or reformatory performances like Upanayana.

Anapek shah, disinterested in material affairs. As explained before, Shukadev Goswami never accepted any formal spiritual master, nor did he undergo any formal reformatory performances. This was explained right in the beginning of the Bhagavatam, first canto, second chapter, divinity and divine service, when Suta Goswami begins to speak, address the sages of Naimisharanya, the beginning of the Bhagavatam, opening of the Bhagavatam, the sages ask Suta Goswami six questions and Suta Goswami answers them. So before he begins to answer, he offers his prayers to his spiritual master, whose Suta Goswami's spiritual master? Shukadeva Goswami. So in that, in those prayers, he says that Shukadeva Goswami is a liberated soul by birth. He is liberated soul by birth, so he doesn't need to study the Vedas, he doesn't need to practice any process of self-realization because it is already self-realized. Though before he studied the Bhagavatam under his father Vyasa Deva, he was only realized, he had only realized the impersonal aspect of the absolute truth, Brahman, realized his soul. There are three of the absolute truth: Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan. So Shukadeva Goswami had realized only the Brahman feature. But after he heard the Bhagavatam, he became fully self-realized in the Bhagavan feature also. Brahman, Paramatma, Bhagavan. So Bhagavan is the highest realization, complete realization of the absolute truth. And Bhagavan realization includes Brahman and Paramatma realization. So after hearing the Bhagavatam, Shukadeva Goswami became Bhagavan realized, became a great devotee of the Supreme Personality. Got it? So he never accepted any formal spiritual master, like one goes to Gurukul or one takes initiation and begins to study the scriptures under the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master. No, he did not have to do that. Nor did he undergo any formal reformatory performance. Reformatory performance is samskara, purification, cultural purification. Just like Upanayana, the sacred thread ceremony. That signifies that one is eligible to study the Vedas under the spiritual master. One receives the Gayatri mantra from the bona fide spiritual master and one begins study of the Vedas. But Shukadeva Goswami did not have to undergo any of these samskaras including Upanayana because he was already a liberated soul. He was realized. He didn't have to study the Vedas.

#### Vyasa Deva, Narada, Srimad Bhagavatam, Krishna, Spiritual Master

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This dissatisfaction is because none of the literatures you have compiled, in none of them you have exclusively glorified the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna."
**Summary:** This segment explains how Vyasa Deva compiled the Srimad Bhagavatam under the instruction of Narada, focusing on the exclusive glorification of Krishna, and how Shukadeva Goswami heard the Bhagavatam from his father.

Shukade Goswami's father Vyasa Deva was his natural spiritual master. Why natural spiritual master? Because Shukade Goswami heard Srimad Bhagavatam from Vyasa Deva, his own father. Vyasa Deva was compiling the Bhagavatam after being instructed to do so by Narada. This has already been described in an earlier chapter in this first canto, fifth chapter. Vyasa Deva, after compiling all the Vedic literature, after compiling the Mahabharata, after compiling the other Puranas, Dharmasastras, everything he did, extensive work for the welfare of the human beings, in this Kali Yuga especially, he was dissatisfied, feelings incomplete. So his spiritual master Narada noticed this dissatisfaction and pointed out, this dissatisfaction is because none of the literatures you have compiled, in none of them you have exclusively glorified the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna. So Narada instructed Vyasa Deva to compile this Srimad Bhagavatam, which is the only literature, which is containing the exclusivity, exclusive glorification of Krishna and nothing else. So Vyasa Deva compiled the Bhagavatam exactly according to the instructions of Narada, and when he was revising the Bhagavatam, Shukadeva Goswami heard the Bhagavatam from Vyasa Deva. Shukadeva Goswami got attracted to the description of Krishna in the Bhagavatam, so he began inquisitive, who is this personality Krishna? Special personality. Not another person like so many other historical persons, no. He is the absolute truth. He is the personality of Godhead Bhagavan, who is the absolute truth. So that he realized by hearing the Bhagavatam. He was father Vyasa Deva, natural spiritual master. Father is described as the first spiritual master. In the case of Brahmanas especially, father is the first spiritual master. And Vyasa Deva was self-realized himself. He was a great devotee, empowered incarnation. So Vyasa Deva taught the Bhagavatam to Shukadeva Goswami.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So, Avadhuta means disinterested in all social customs."
**Summary:** This segment describes Shukadeva Goswami's complete self-satisfaction after hearing the Bhagavatam, his indifference to social customs, and his status as an Avadhuta, similar to Nithyananda Prabhu and Rishabhadeva.

Now after hearing the Bhagavatam from Vyasa Deva, Shukadeva Goswami became completely self-satisfied, Nijalabha Tushto, completely satisfied within himself. Thus, he did not depend upon any formal process. The formal processes are necessary for those who are expected to reach the stage of complete liberation. But Shukadeva Goswami is already in that status by the grace of his father, so he didn't require it. As a young boy, it is described here, he was dressed as if neglected by others. That means, he did not care to dress himself properly. In fact, he was not even dressed. He was walking around naked. That we will describe a little later in the next verse. So he went about naked, uninterested in social customs, indifferent to everything. That, people following the civilized society, he was disinterested. He was neglected by the general populace. If somebody walks naked, not properly tending the body, not properly dressing themselves, common people will not be able to identify that here is a great personality. No. They will think he is some madman. So they will generally neglect. They will not pay any attention. But, he was surrounded by inquisitive boys and women, less intelligent persons, as if he were a madman. Why will somebody walk naked unless they are mad? So, we should understand, those who are spiritually very, very, very, very advanced, not just advanced, they are completely self-realized, but they are disinterested in social customs. They are called Avadhuta. Nithyananda was Avadhuta. And Nithyananda Prabhu, the associate of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, member of the Panchatattva, incarnation of Lord Balarama, he was an Avadhuta, like Shukadeva Goswami was an Avadhuta. Rishabhadeva, he became Avadhuta, later stage of his life, the incarnation of the Supreme Lord. So, Avadhuta means disinterested in all social customs.

**Summary:** This segment concludes by emphasizing that even though a liberated soul may appear aimless, they are actually guided by the Supreme Lord within their heart, leading them to perform specific actions like speaking the Bhagavatam to Parikshit Maharaj.

So, it is described by Srila Prabhupada here, he thus appears on the scene while traveling on the earth of his own accord. He is freely roaming. But, we should also know, he is directed by the Supreme Lord within his heart. There is a characteristic of a liberated soul. Even though he may appear to be like simply roaming without any particular aim in life, but actually he is directed by the Lord. He is constantly in touch with the Supreme Lord within the heart. So, Supreme Lord directing him, go and speak Bhagavatam to Pariksit Maharaj. So, he has appeared there. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

In this session, we will be discussing three verses: the 26th, the 27th, and the 28th verses of the 19th chapter, the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. All three verses are describing the personal features of Sukhadeva Goswami, a great personality. So, to recognize him is not easy, as somebody very, very great, very exalted pure devotee, fully realized, is very difficult to make out. As you would have heard in the previous words, he was avadhuta. He was completely disinterested in properly dressing himself, in displaying any symptoms of belonging to any particular social order. No, none of those could be made out by his appearance.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the science of physiognomy, explaining how external bodily features can reveal inner qualities and how the sages in Pariksit's assembly could recognize Sukhadeva Goswami's greatness.

So, these beautiful features are special.

By studying his external features, that is called the science of physiognomy. It's a special science. The bodily features when observed externally can tell a lot about that personality, the nature of that personality within. Because the person is not the body. But still, great persons by their external bodily features, they are recognized by those who know these specific symptoms by which to recognize such personalities. So, Sri

**Key Quote:** "A person is honored for his achievements and not for advanced age."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada, emphasizing that honor is due to achievement, especially spiritual, rather than age, and that Sukhadeva Goswami's knowledge surpassed that of the elder sages.

La Pravapa says in the purport, a respectable personality is described beginning with the legs. And this honored system is observed here with Shukadeva Goswami. Always from the bottom to the top. Even the Supreme Lord, we should have darshan of the deity of the Supreme Lord beginning with the feet, and then gradually move up. He was only sixteen years of age. Compared to the other persons in the assembly, probably he was the youngest in that assembly of great saintly persons. So, Shri La Pravapa remarks here, a person is honored for his achievements and not for advanced age. Merely being elderly in terms of physical age is not the basis of honoring somebody. That alone is not the basis. So, a person is honored for his achievements, especially when they have spiritual achievements. A person can be older by experience and not by age. Shri Shukadeva Goswami, who is described herein as the son of Vyasa Deva, was by his knowledge more experienced than all the sages present there, although he was only sixteen years of age.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains these bodily features of Shukadev Goswami. In the purport, his bodily features indicate him to be different from common men. Distinct features are there by which he can be distinguished as an extraordinary personality, even among great persons. So, Srila Prabhupada says, all the signs described in connection with the bodily features of Shukadev Goswami are uncommon symptoms, typical of greatness, great personalities according to physiognomical calculations. See, there are many branches of Vedic knowledge. One of them is how to recognize a person's greatness by studying his external features. For example, if somebody's arms, when they stretch, when they're standing and they stretch the arms in front of their body, it goes below their knees. That is called Aajanabahu. Aajanabahu. That's a description of Lord Ramachandra. Lord Ramachandra, when he appeared, he had his hands, when he stretched, it would reach up to his knees or even below his knees. No common personality will have such a description. No common personality will have such arms in a human form, will have his arms reaching up to his knees, it will always be above the knees, you can check, you stretch your arms, it will reach only somewhere in the thigh region, it will not reach up to your knees, unless you are a great personality. So, one of the symptoms is of a great personality, the arms will reach up to the knees.

Because of the glamour of his body and his attractive smiles, he was pleasing to women, though he tried to cover his natural glories. The great sages present there were all expert in the art of physiognomy, and so they honored him by rising from their seats. They were all seated. Parikshit Maharaj received the great saintly persons who arrived from all over the universe. They arrived before Shukadeva Swami came to that assembly. So, they were all seated and Parikshit Maharaj bowed down to them and acknowledged their presence, glorified them. But now they were standing up to receive Shukadeva Swami, who could not be recognized by common people, who thought him some mad man. They neglected him and he was surrounded by some urchins and some foolish people, but he is a madman. But not these sages who knew the art of physiognomy. They recognized him as a very, very, very great personality simply by seeing his bodily features. So, that is the description here, that Lakshanagya, the sages, very, very great personalities from the upper planets of the universe, they have arrived there. So, they could recognize, even though gudavarchasam, his glories were covered externally. Common people cannot make out he is a great person, and that too when he is walking naked, you will think he is some great personality. So, these sages could recognize, so they all stood up out of respect for Shukadeva Swamy.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Pariksit was very glad to receive a great devotee of the Lord, and he bowed down before Shukadeva Goswami with all the limbs of his body."
**Summary:** This segment focuses on the arrival of Shukadeva Goswami and the respectful reception he received, particularly Maharaj Pariksit's humble obeisances, and how Shukadeva Goswami reciprocated greetings based on individuals' positions.

Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya, Narayanam Namaskritya, Naram Jai Vanarottamam, Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udhirayet. So, in this session, we'll be discussing three more verses, the 29th, the 30th, and the 31st verses of the 19th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. These set of verses are describing the appearance of Shukadeva Goswami, and so far we have heard the sages in that assembly, they stood up out of respect for Shukadeva Goswami, recognizing him to be a very, very great personality. What was Pariksit's reaction? That we are going to hear now. 29th verse. Sravishnurato atithaya agataya tasmaisa pariyam shirasajahara tato nivrttahi abudhastriyo arbhaka mahasanesopavishesha pujitaha Sorry. mahasanesopavishesha pujitaha The meaning of this verse is, Maharaj Pariksit, who is also known as Vishnurata, Vishnurata means one who is protected always by Lord Vishnu, he bowed his head to receive the chief guest, Shukadeva Goswami. At that time, all the ignorant women and boys ceased following Srila Shukadeva. He was surrounded by some urchins and some foolish women, so all of them became alerted that here is a great personality, he is not a madman, so then they stopped following him, they just disappeared from there. Receiving respect from all, Shukadeva Goswami took his exalted seat. It's in the purport Srila Prabhupada explains very nicely. On Shukadeva Goswami's arrival at the meeting, everyone except Srila Vyasadeva, Narada and a few others stood up. See, it was described, great sages, because of physiognomy, they could recognize Shukadeva Goswami, even though he is not properly dressed by his external bodily features, so they stood up out of respect. But not Vyasadeva Narada. Why? Because Vyasadeva is Shukadeva Goswami's own spiritual master. Narada is the spiritual master of the spiritual master. Narada is Vyasadeva's spiritual master. So Vyasadeva and Narada did not stand up, and few others who were great personalities, they did not stand up. But everybody else stood up out of respect for Shukadeva Goswami. Now, what about Maharaj Pariksit? It is described here. Maharaj Pariksit was very glad to receive a great devotee of the Lord, and he bowed down before Shukadeva Goswami with all the limbs of his body. Dandavat, dandavat pranama, or sastanga pranama, different ways this is said. So here it is described that he bowed down with all his limbs of his body. Saparyam shirasam ajaharao. With all the limbs of his body, he bowed down completely to Shukadeva Goswami. Shukadeva Goswami also exchanged the greetings and reception by embrace, shaking of hands, nodding and bowing down, especially before his father and Narada Muni. Shukadeva Goswami knew how to exchange greetings, depending on the different person's position or achievements. So with some equals, he was shaking hands. With juniors, he was embracing them. And acknowledging some people's greetings by nodding his head. And especially to his father Vyasadeva and Narada Muni, he bowed down himself, because he is a junior. Thus, Shukadeva Goswami was offered the presidential seat at the meeting, because he was the greatest, realized, advanced, spiritually advanced personality of his time, recognized by all other great persons. So he was offered the seat of the president of the assembly, the chief person in that assembly of Parikshit Maharaj. When he was so received by the kings and sages, the street boys and less intelligent women who were following him were struck with wonder and fear. So they retired from their frivolous activities. Everything was full of gravity and calm. You see how the whole atmosphere changed completely after the arrival of Shukadeva Goswami.

**Summary:** This segment describes the glorious appearance of Shukadeva Goswami in the assembly, comparing it to the moon surrounded by stars, emphasizing his radiance amidst other great personalities.

The 30th verse. The meaning of this 30th verse is Shukadeva Goswami was then surrounded by saintly sages and demigods, just as the moon is surrounded by stars, planets and other heavenly bodies. His presence was gorgeous and he was respected by all. So, Shukadeva Goswami's appearance there in the assembly of Parikshit Maharaj is very, very special, because in that assembly, Parikshit Maharaj himself is a pure devotee, the greatest Rajarshi of his time. And other Rajarshis, Devarishis, Brahmarishis, Arunodayas, they all arrived from different parts of the universe to witness Parikshit Maharaj quitting his body. So, in that great assembly, how was Sukhadeva Goswami appearing? Like the moon is surrounded by stars, planets and other heavenly bodies. This is a natural beauty in the sky at night, especially on a full moon night. How does it look? The moon will be shining the brightest among all the other heavenly bodies in the sky as seen from the earth at night. But the other heavenly bodies will be twinkling like stars, planets and other heavenly bodies. Moon will outshine all others, all other heavenly bodies, particularly on a full moon night. So, that is the beauty, natural beauty. So, this presence, the presence of Sukhadeva Goswami surrounded by all varieties of saintly persons, all great personalities is compared to this moon in the night sky, full moon surrounded by stars, planets and other heavenly bodies.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The devotee of the Lord is more honored in the world than the Lord himself."
**Summary:** This segment explains that a devotee of the Lord is more honored than the Lord Himself, quoting Krishna's instruction to Uddhava that His devotees should be worshipped with greater respect than Him.

So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, In the great assembly of saintly persons, there was Vyasadeva, the Brahmarshi, Narada, the Devarishi, Parashurama, the great ruler of Kshatriya kings, etc., Rajarishi. Some of them were powerful incarnations of the Lord. Parashurama was an incarnation of the Supreme Lord. Vyasadeva was an incarnation. Narada was an empowered incarnation. Sukhadeva Goswami was not known as Brahmarshi, Rajarishi, Devarishi, nor was he known as an incarnation, like Narada, Vyasa or Parashurama. Yet, he excelled all of them in respects paid. There is something very, very important to note. Sukhadeva Goswami, in spite of not having a formal position like all the many other personalities in the assembly, great personalities, he was offered more respect than all of them. Why? Srila Prabhupada explains, This means that the devotee of the Lord is more honored in the world than the Lord himself. So, Srila Prabhupada many times quotes another verse in the Bhagavatam. Krishna, while instructing Uddhava in the 11th canto of the Bhagavatam, he says to Uddhava, Madbhakta Pooja Abhyadhika What does it mean? Krishna says, My pure devotee, who is very, very dear to me, he should be respected more than me by the others. Madbhakta Pooja Abhyadhika He should be worshipped with greater respect than me. Krishna is the topmost worshipable personality among all worshipable personalities in this whole universe. But it is Krishna's own choice that he would be more pleased if instead of worshipping Krishna, we worship Krishna's pure devotee. So, therefore, Prabhupada concludes this purport by telling, One should therefore never minimize the importance of a devotee like Shukadeva Goswami.

**Key Quote:** "One should humbly approach a spiritual master to understand the transcendental signs."
**Summary:** This segment describes Shukadeva Goswami's readiness to answer questions and Maharaj Pariksit's humble approach to him, emphasizing the importance of approaching a spiritual master with humility and proper etiquette.

31st verse Prasantham asinam akuntha medasam munim rupo bhagavato abhyupetya pranamya murdha avahita avahita tutanjalir natwagira sunruta anvaprichat So, the meaning of this 31st verse is The sage Shri Shukadeva Goswami sat perfectly pacified, intelligent and ready to answer any question without hesitation. Shukadeva Goswami knew by the indication of the Paramatma within his heart what is he supposed to do in that assembly. Even without Pariksit speaking, before Pariksit could even speak anything, he knew why he was there, what was his purpose in being brought there by the Supreme Lord, and what was he supposed to do in that assembly, everything he knew. So, it is described, he sat perfectly pacified. He was the most intelligent personality among all the persons assembled there. And therefore, he was ready to answer any question without hesitation. He was fully knowledgeable, fully self-realized, greatest authority. So, he was ready to answer any question. Because, already we have heard, Shukadeva Goswami, Pariksit Maharaj asked two questions from the assembled saintly persons. So, Prabhupada says further, The great devotee Maharaj Pariksit approached him, offered his respects by bowing before him, and politely inquired with sweet words and folded hands. Pariksit inquired from him. So, what Pariksit, what inquiry did he make of Shukadeva Goswami will be described in the later verses. But, Prabhupada says in the purport, The gesture adopted by Maharaj Pariksit of questioning a master is befitting in terms of scriptural directions. What do scriptural directions say? One should humbly approach a spiritual master to understand the transcendental signs. One must approach a bona fide spiritual master. So, Pariksit Maharaj is already actually fully aware what he is supposed to do. He has already told assembled saintly persons, kindly sing the glories of Vishnu, so that I can fix my mind on the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord before I quit my body. But, when Shukadeva Goswami came, as a matter of etiquette, he approached Shukadeva Goswami with folded hands and actually began to inquire about the transcendental signs, assuming humble position.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the verse about the power of a pure devotee to sanctify places and the benefits of remembering, seeing, touching, and serving such a devotee.

In this session we will be discussing from the 33rd verse of the 19th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, येशाम सम्स्मरनात पुम्साम, सद्यशुद्यन्तिवैगृहाह, किम्पुनर्दर्शनस्पर्ष, पादशौच आसनादिपिही। The meaning of this verse is, "Simply by our remembering you, our houses become instantly sanctified, and what to speak of seeing you, touching you, washing your holy feet, and offering you a seat in our home." This is Pariksit speaking to Shukadeva Goswami, addressing Shukadeva Goswami. That, the spiritual potency of a pure devotee who is completely immersed in Krishna consciousness is so great, simply by remembering him, one's house becomes, one's surroundings, one's place becomes completely sanctified instantaneously. In what way sanctified? All the material influences are, negative influences are nullified, just by remembering a saintly person like Shukadeva Goswami. And then if one is more fortunate, one is able to not only remember him, but even see him, touch his holy feet, wash his feet, and give him a seat of honor, and serve him by hearing from him, worshipping him,

**Key Quote:** "The presence of the great saints in such holy places disinfects the accumulated sins."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that holy places are sanctified by the presence of great saints who counteract the sins left behind by ordinary people who visit those places for purification.

So, Shri La Prabhupada explains in the purport, the importance of holy places of pilgrimage is due to the presence of great sages and saints. What is the, why is a place called a holy place of pilgrimage? It is primarily because in that place great saintly persons are present. And by their presence what happens to that holy place? That's explained by Shri La Prabhupada in the next sentence in this purport. Prabhupada says, it is said that sinful persons go to holy places and leave their sins there to accumulate. Anybody goes to holy place, ordinary people, they will take a bath there, and they will leave behind their sinful reactions. They get purified. They get purified means, their sinful reactions are washed away by going there and taking a bath in the holy place. But, the presence of the great saints in such holy places disinfects the accumulated sins. Now so many people go to holy place, ordinary people, big numbers, they go, and they leave behind all their sinful reactions. Now those sinful reactions become a burden, a big burden in the holy place. But that burden is cleared away by the presence, mere presence, of the saintly persons like Shukadeva Goswami. And, because of the presence of the saintly persons in such holy places, the holy places continue to remain sanctified by the grace of the devotees and saints present there. See this is not known to many people. This is explained in another place in the Bhagavatam. So Prabhupada is quoting from that portion of the Bhagavatam, that a holy place becomes burdened by sinful reactions of those ordinary people who visit the holy place and wash away their sinful reactions. But such accumulated sin is cleansed away by the presence of saintly persons.

**Key Quote:** "The only aim of such saints is to sanctify the houses of the householders."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that when saints visit the homes of worldly people, they do so without self-interest, aiming only to purify the house and help the householders advance spiritually.

Now further Srila Prabhupada says, if such saints appear in the homes of worldly people, certainly the accumulated sins of such worldly enjoyers becomes neutralized. Home also, people are staying, ordinary people stay in their home. But, generally they are inclined to enjoy materially, and thereby accumulate some sinful reactions. Now, if such a home is visited by a saintly person like Shukadeva Goswami, then again, the home becomes completely purified. Home becomes completely purified. That's what Shukadeva Goswami, Parishad Maharaj is telling Shukadeva Goswami. Therefore, Prabhupada says further, the holy saints actually have no self-interest with the householders. That means, when a saintly person visits a home of an ordinary person, a worldly person, then the saint has nothing to get for himself from the householder. Don't mistakenly think that when saints come to your house, genuine saints, I'm talking about genuine saints, they come to your house, it's not that they want some bhiksha, they want some benefit from you, they want to take something from you, no. It's never. They have no self-interest. The only aim of such saints is to sanctify the houses of the householders. Only aim, to purify their house, to make their house free from sinful reactions, so that it will benefit them to practice spiritual life,

Therefore, Srila Prabhupada says further, the householders should feel grateful when such saints and sages appear at their doors. So when a saintly person comes to the door of a householder, householder should welcome them and take spiritual benefit from their presence. A householder who dishonors such holy orders is a great offender. It's an offense to not honor such a saintly person. It is enjoined, therefore, that a householder who does not bow down before a saint at once must undergo fasting for the day in order to neutralize,

#### Bodily Identification, Ignorance, Materialism, Spiritual Platform

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "If this attitude a person has, such a person is considered Saha eva Goh Kharaha. He is no better than an animal, like an ass or a cow."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Krishna speaking about the ignorance of identifying with the material body and the foolishness of seeking purification in holy places only for material enjoyment, comparing such a person to an animal.

So, the Bhagavatam says, in the 10th canto, these are very strong words, strongly worded words, they are spoken by Krishna in the 10th canto, in an assembly of saintly persons at Kurukshetra, when there was solar eclipse. There was a gathering of saintly persons on that occasion, and Krishna was speaking to the saintly persons. Krishna had gone there as the king of Dwaraka. Krishna is playing that role in his pastimes, in his Leela, Dwaraka, the king of Dwaraka. So, Krishna is telling, a human being who identifies this body, this material body, made up of three elements, with the self, Yesya Atma Buddhi, who am I? Actually, most people think, I am this body, this body, this body is who I am, is myself. But, Shastra says, no, scripture says, no, Bhagavad Gita says, no, this body is not you, you are not the body, you are spirit, soul. So, what if a person, in ignorance, mistaken identity, that I am this body, and what is this body made of? It is described here, Kunape, Tridhatuke, Kunape means a bag consisting of three dhatus, three elements. What are the three elements? According to Ayurveda, this body is made up of Kapha, Vata, and Pitta. Kapha is mucus, Vata is air, and Pitta is bile. So, somebody who thinks this bag is, this bag is, this bag is, this bag is, this bag is, a point, this bag is called the physical body, which consists of three elements, somebody thinks this has the self, and further, Swadhi, Kalatra, Deishu, who considers the byproducts of the body to be his Kingsman, that is, my wife, my children, they are all mine, who considers his land of birth, they give a lot of importance. I have taken birth, let us say, in Mysore. So Mysore is a very, very, very important place for me. And he thinks, such a person, a materialistic person, an ignorant person, a foolish person, a person under the influence of the illusory energy, thinks that one should go to a place of pilgrimage simply to take a bath, so that if all my sins are washed away, I don't have to suffer any sinful reaction. I can enjoy without any hindrance. If this attitude a person has, such a person is considered Saha eva Goh Kharaha. He is no better than an animal, like an ass or a cow. Kharaha means ass, and Goh means cow. That means he is not a human being with developed intelligence.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that human life is meant for spiritual advancement, to rise above the material platform, and ultimately return to Godhead.

Everywhere in the scriptures this is said. Human beings should not remain on the bodily platform, on the material platform, on the platform of material enjoyment. No. Human life gives us an opportunity to rise to the spiritual platform and act on the spiritual platform to gain complete freedom from material bondage and go back to Godhead.

Just to refresh your memory this chapter is entitled The Appearance of Shukadeva Goswami. In this chapter it will be described how Shukadeva Goswami and Pariksit Maharaj met at a time when Pariksit was actually prepared. To quit his body after having renounced his kingdom he was in a holy place on the bank of the river Ganga and he was surrounded by so many saintly persons from all over the universe and exactly when Pariksit was inquiring from the sages assembled there that kindly tell me what is my duty. Exactly at that time Shukadeva Goswami walks into that assembly and the description has already been given in the previous few verses. The appearance of Shukadeva Goswami was certainly a very very divine event that he was sent by Krishna. And he was sent by Krishna. And he was sent to speak Srimad Bhagavatam to Pariksit Maharaj for the first time after it was compiled by Vyasadeva under instruction of Shri Narada. So this 32nd verse now Pariksit is addressing Shukadeva Goswami after Shukadeva Goswami has been welcomed he has taken the seat the seat of honor. And when everyone has settled down acknowledging. Shukadeva Goswami's most exalted position is the top most among the transcendentalists of his time even though he is just 16 years old and he doesn't formally belong to any category of transcendentalists as Brahmarshi or Rajarshi or Devershi or Arunodaya. He is not. Formally initiated he has not undergone any reformatory process samskara. Yampravra jantam anupetam apetakrutyam in the beginning of the Bhagavatam in the first canto in the same canto second chapter. Suta Goswami offers respects to his spiritual master Shukadeva Goswami and he says my spiritual master. He was a liberated soul by birth he did not undergo any reformation after his birth because he already liberated so that Shukadeva Goswami was recognized by the great transcendentalists rishis who had arrived from higher planets. They knew the art of physiognomy. That means by looking at the external. Features bodily features face symptoms the the build up they could say here is some very very very advanced transcendentalist so they all stood up in respect except Vyasa Deva and Narada Muni Vyasa Deva was the father of Shukadeva Goswami. Shukadeva Goswami natural spiritual master and Narada was the spiritual master of the spiritual master Jick Riva swan the spiritual master of. Vyasa Deva so they did not stand up and few others. Parashurama the incarnation of the supreme personality of Godhead. So they did not stand but everybody else stood up in respect and Parikshit Maharaj was very glad to receive him now what is Parikshit telling Shukadeva Goswami.

**Key Quote:** "It is more abominable than drinking poison willingly. That means, it is very very dangerous. It is a big big big obstacle for spiritual advancement."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the principle of detachment from worldly enjoyers and women for serious transcendentalists, using the example of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu refusing to meet King Pratap Rudra and quoting a verse emphasizing the danger of associating with materialistic individuals.

So, it is also true that great saintly persons who are completely aloof from worldly enjoyers, they do not bother to meet or contact or approach any of the materialistic persons or people in royal position, big big kings, big big wealthy merchants, people in big positions in material estimation, they never approach. So, Srila Prabhupada next gives an example. Maharaja Pratap Rudra was a follower of Lord Chaitanya. He was the king of Orissa. But when Maharaja Pratap Rudra wanted to see the Lord, see Lord Chaitanya, Lord Chaitanya refused to see him because he was a king. So, Pratap Rudra, even though he was a king, he was a saintly king. So, he was seeking an interview with Chaitanya Mahaprabhu just to get blessings, just to get some instructions, personal instructions, when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was staying in Puri. So, Pratap Rudra, who would not give any appointment, would not agree to meet Pratap Rudra Maharaj, why? Why would Chaitanya refuse? Prabhupada says, for a devotee who desires to go back to Godhead, two things are strictly prohibited, worldly enjoyers and women. Now, this is based on a verse that is there in the Chaitanya Charitamrita. That verse says, The meaning of this verse is, It is more abominable than drinking poison willingly. So, as Prabhupada says in this purport, two things are strictly forbidden for a serious transcendentalist who is practicing spiritual life in order to get out of material existence entirely and go back to Godhead. So, this verse says, this is a verse quoted by, spoken by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. When Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was requested by one of his associates, Sarvam Bhattacharya, that please give an appointment for Maharaj Pratap Rudra who wants to come and see you, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said, no, I cannot give an appointment. Why? This is the reason he is quoting. Nishkinchanasya, for one who is completely detached himself from material enjoyment. Bhagavad Bhajanon Mukhasya. And, he is engaged, eager to be engaged in serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For him, and also, Paramparam Jigamishor Bhavasagarasya. He wants to cross over the ocean of material existence and go back to Godhead. For such a person, Sandarshanam, just seeing. Not even mixing or interacting. Not even interacting very closely. No, just seeing. Sandarshanam. Two categories of people. Vishayinam, Yoshitam. Vishayinam means those who are engaged in materialistic activities. Vishayinam. Sense enjoyers in this world. And, Yoshitam means women. Women here refers to a member of the opposite gender. Who is very much interested in enjoying. For a woman, it is man. Yoshit is man. For a man, a Yoshit is woman. Who is interested in enjoying. Such a Darshan, just a Sandarshanam, just seeing, is very, very dangerous. How dangerous? More dangerous than drinking poison willingly. Than knowingly drinking poison. That means, it is very very dangerous. It is a big big big obstacle for spiritual advancement.

**Summary:** This segment reiterates the principle of detachment from worldly enjoyers and women for serious transcendentalists, using the example of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu refusing to meet King Pratap Rudra and quoting a verse emphasizing the danger of associating with materialistic individuals.

Pratap Rudra Maharaj. Why? Why would Chaitanya refuse? Prabhupada says, for a devotee who desires to go back to Godhead, two things are strictly prohibited, worldly enjoyers and women. Now this is based on a verse that is there. Here in the Chaitanya Charita Amrita, that verse says, Nishkinchanasya Bhagavad Bhajanon Mukhasya Paramparam Jigamishor Bhavasagarasya Sandarshanam Vishayinam Atha Yoshitamcha Hahantahantavishabhakshanatopyasadhu The meaning of this verse is Alas for a person who is seriously desiring to cross the material ocean and engage in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord Krishna without material motives, seeing a materialist engaged in sense gratification or seeing a woman who is similarly interested is more abominable than drinking poison willingly. So, as Prabhupada says in this purport, Two things are strictly forbidden for a serious transcendentalist who is practicing spiritual life in order to get out of material existence entirely and go back to Godhead. So, this verse says, this is a verse quoted by, spoken by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. When Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was requested by one of his associates, Sarvam Bhattacharya, that please give an appointment for Maharaj Pratap Uddhara who wants to come and see you. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said, no, I cannot give an appointment. Why? This is the reason he is quoting. Nishkinchanasya, for one who has completely detached himself from material enjoyment. Bhagavad Bhajanon Mukhasya And he is engaged. Eager to be engaged in serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead for him and also Paramparam Jigamishor Bhavasagarasya. He wants to cross over the ocean of material existence and go back to Godhead. For such a person, Sandarshanam, just seeing, not even mixing or interacting very closely, no, just seeing, Sandarshanam, two categories of people. Vishayinam, Yoshayinam. Vishayinam means those who are engaged in materialistic activities. Vishayinam, sense enjoyers in this world. And Yoshayinam means women. Women here refers to a member of the opposite gender who is very much interested in enjoying. For a woman, it is... For a man, Yoshayinam is man. For a man, Yoshayinam is woman who is interested in enjoying. Such a Darshan, just a Sandarshanam, just seeing, is very, very dangerous. How dangerous? More dangerous than drinking poison willingly, than knowingly drinking poison. That means, it is very, very dangerous. It is a big, big, big obstacle for spiritual advancement. So, therefore, such a transcendentalist will never agree to see or meet or interact or mix with such worldly-minded people. Therefore, Parikshit Maharaj, thinking, I am a king, and Shukade Goswami has arrived and he has accepted my respects and his... agreed to sit in this assembly and instruct me. So, I am very, very, very, very fortunate and blessed by Shukade Goswami. So, I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Lord Krishna, the personality of Godhead, who is very dear to the sons of King Pandu, has accepted me as one of those relatives just to please his great cousins and brothers."
**Summary:** Parikshit Maharaj emphasizes the close family connection between Krishna and the Pandavas, highlighting their devotion.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet In this session, we will be discussing two verses, the thirty-fifth and the thirty-sixth verses of the nineteenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The thirty-fifth verse is as follows: Apime Bhagavan Preetaha Krishna Pandu Sutapriyaha Paitrishvaseya Preetyartham Tadgotrasyathabandhavaha The meaning of this verse is, Lord Krishna, the personality of Godhead, who is very dear to the sons of King Pandu, has accepted me as one of those relatives just to please his great cousins and brothers. This is what Parikshit has spoken while addressing Shukadeva Goswami. Parikshit is particularly relating the close connection between his grandparents, Arjuna and the other Pandavas, their connection with Krishna in a family relationship. So Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead, but when he appears in this world, he definitely does take his birth, even though he is unborn. He takes his birth as the son of Devaki and Vasudeva. Now Vasudeva is a Kshatriya, and Vasudeva's sister, Kunti, her sons are the Pandavas. So there is a family relationship between Krishna, the supreme personality of Godhead, and the Pandavas, their cousins. Not only that, the Pandavas are great devotees of Krishna, pure devotees of Krishna. So, given these facts, Prabhupada explains the significance of this particular statement by Parikshit Maharaj.

#### Devotion vs. Illusion, Family service through devotion, Krishna's protection of devotees' families
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/gLgxrCFkVVs?t=251

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "The Lord gives special protection to the family members and descendants of a devotee, even though such members are themselves non-devotees."
**Summary:** Prabhupada explains that pure devotees serve their families better than those attached to illusory family affairs, as Krishna protects the families of devotees.

In the Purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "A pure and exclusive devotee of the Lord, serves his family interest more dexterously than others who are attached to illusory family affairs." Pure devotees are never under illusion. But commonly, ordinary people, they are completely under illusion, because their relationships are based on, "I am this body, and therefore, all bodily connections are mine. My wife, my children, my relatives, my brothers, my cousins, my aunt." You see, totally based on illusory family affairs. Whereas the pure devotees, the Pandavas, they know that Krishna is related to them, but independent of that relationship, they are pure devotees of Krishna. You see, so that makes a big difference. So Prabhupada says, "Generally people are attached to family matters, and the whole economic impetus of human society, is moving under the influence of family affection. Such deluded persons have no information, that one can render better service to the family, by becoming a devotee of the Lord." People think that if I become a devotee, I have to cut off all my relationships with my family members, and completely forget them, as if I have nothing to do with them. That's not correct. That understanding is not correct. Why? Because, Prabhupada says, "The Lord gives special protection to the family members and descendants of a devotee, even though such members are themselves non-devotees." Of course, in the case of Pandavas, they were all devotees. Pandu was a devotee. Kunti was a devotee. Subhadra was a devotee. Draupadi was a devotee. Everyone was a devotee. But, here is an example. Maharaj Pariksit was a great devotee of the Lord, but his father, Hiranyakashipu, was a great atheist, and declared enemy of the Lord. Even though the Lord is nobody's enemy, but these atheists and non-devotees, they consider Vishnu or Krishna as their enemy. Despite all this, Hiranyakashipu was awarded salvation, salvation means liberation, due to his being the father of Maharaj Prahlad. Krishna is so kind. Hiranyakashipu does not deserve to get liberation. He is an atheist. But, just because he is the father of a great devotee, Prahlad, the Lord gave liberation to this Hiranyakashipu. So, Srila Prabhupada says further, "The Lord is so kind that he gives all protection to the family members of his devotee, and thus the devotee has no need to bother about his family members, even if one leaves such family members aside to discharge devotional service."

**Key Quote:** "Krishna personally saved this Pariksit when he was in the womb of his mother, because this Pariksit was the only surviving descendant of the entire Pandava family."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna takes care of the family members of devotees, even if the devotee has to give up family responsibilities to serve the Lord's mission, citing the example of Parikshit being saved by Krishna.

Generally, when somebody dedicates oneself to serving the mission of the Lord, they may have to give up the family responsibility. Then, is there a loss for the family members? That somebody is giving up their responsibility and not discharging family duties, duties towards family members? No, because Krishna takes care. Maharaj Yudhishthira and his brothers were the sons of Kunti, the paternal aunt of Lord Krishna. And Maharaj Pariksit admits the patronage of Lord Krishna because of his being the only grandson of the great Pandavas. Krishna personally saved this Pariksit when he was in the womb of his mother, because this Pariksit was the only surviving descendant of the entire Pandava family.

#### Inspiration by Krishna, Recognition of pure devotees, Benefit of hearing Bhagavatam

**Key Quote:** "Krishna arranged, Pariksit should hear Bhagavatam, so that Pariksit is benefited, by Shukadeva Goswami speaking the Bhagavatam, and not only Pariksit, through Pariksit, many many millions of people, and all future generations of people, are benefited."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Shukadeva Goswami was inspired by Krishna to appear before Parikshit and impart the teachings of Srimad Bhagavatam, benefiting not only Parikshit but also future generations.

The 36th verse, Anyathate avyakta-gathir darshanam na katham drinam nitharam mriyamananam samsiddhasya vaniyasah The meaning of this 36th verse is, otherwise, without being inspired by Lord Krishna, how is it that you have voluntarily appeared here, though you are moving incognito, incognito means unrecognized to the common man, and are not visible to us for on the verge of death. Shukadeva Goswami was just roaming around, as if he has no aim in life, he has nothing to do with society, he is not having any proper social appearance, he was roaming around naked, he appeared like a madman, and he did not bother about what people thought, what people said, the way people reacted, he never bothered about it, he was completely absorbed within himself in Krishna Consciousness. So, such a paramahamsa, who cannot be recognized by most people, and he himself has come voluntarily, he has walked into that assembly, and Pariksit is able to recognize him, because of, of course, Pariksit can recognize Shukadeva Goswami, because Pariksit himself is a pure devotee, it takes a pure devotee to recognize another pure devotee, but there is another way, that is, great saintly persons, who are recognized spiritual authorities, they certify that here is a pure devotee, because when Shukadeva Goswami walked into that assembly of great saintly persons, they immediately recognized him, and stood up in respect, and welcomed him with folded hands into that assembly, and he was offered the seat of honor, the presidential seat in that assembly, by all present. So, Pariksit Maharaj is telling that I am so fortunate that you have come at the time when I am about to die, so I can get your instructions, I can get your advice. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The great sage Shukadeva Goswami was certainly inspired by Lord Krishna to appear voluntarily, before Maharaj Pariksit, the great devotee of the Lord, just to give him the teachings of Srimad Bhagavatam." Krishna arranged Pariksit should hear Bhagavatam, so that Pariksit is benefited, by Shukadeva Goswami speaking the Bhagavatam, and not only Pariksit, through Pariksit, many many millions of people, and all future generations of people, are benefited.

#### Spiritual Master, Guru-Krishna Kripa, Authorized Representative of the Lord, Direct Help from Krishna

**Key Quote:** "To get the assistance and help of a bona fide spiritual master means, to receive the direct help of the Lord himself."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of the spiritual master as the manifested representative of the Lord, stating that receiving help from a bona fide spiritual master is equivalent to receiving direct help from Krishna.

So, Prabhupada says, one can achieve the nucleus of the devotional service of the Lord, by the mercy of the spiritual master, and the personality of Godhead. This is what Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, in his teachings, Guru Krishna Kripaaye Paaye Bhakti Lata Bheech. The spiritual master is the manifestation or manifested representative of the Lord, to help one achieve ultimate success. Nothing is disconnected in the life of a devotee. Everything is in relationship with Krishna. One who is not authorized by the Lord, cannot become a spiritual master. It's not that somebody is a very learned scholar, therefore he is Guru, or somebody has got some mystic, magical, mystic powers, and therefore he is Guru. No. None of these things are qualifications. They may have mystic power, they may not have mystic power. They may be very learned, they may not be learned, formally I mean, formally no learning. But the important point is, the spiritual master is necessarily authorized by the supreme personality of Godhead, and he acts as the representative of the Supreme Lord. So, Srila Shukadeva Goswami is an authorized spiritual master, and thus he was inspired by the Lord to appear before Maharaj Parichar, and instruct him in the teachings of the Srimad Bhagavatam. One can achieve the ultimate success of going back to Godhead, if he is favored by the Lord's sending of the spiritual master. So, one can achieve the ultimate success of going back to Godhead, if he is favored by the Lord's sending. So, the conclusion is, that to get the assistance and help of a bona fide spiritual master means to receive the direct help of the Lord himself. So all of us, who have got Srila Prabhupada as our spiritual master, we are directly getting the help of Krishna himself. This is what we should understand and realize, and accept, and take advantage.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "I am therefore begging you to show the way of perfection for all persons and especially for one who is about to die."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 37th verse of the 19th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining Parikshit Maharaj's question to Shukadeva Goswami about the path to perfection, especially for one facing imminent death.

In this session, we will be discussing two verses, that is, the 37th and the 38th verses of the 19th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. The 37th verse is as follows: Ataprishami Samsiddhim Yoginam Paramam Gurum Purushasyehayatkaryam Priyamanasya Sarvatha. Now, Parikshit is asking Shukadeva Goswami a very specific question. What is that question? That is a translation of this verse, the 37th verse: You are the spiritual master of great saints and devotees, Yoginam Paramam Gurum. The same thing was said by Suta Goswami at the beginning of the Bhagavata. Suta Goswami offered prayers to Shukadeva Goswami, and he said to him, "This is the question that was asked to Shukadeva Goswami before he began speaking Bhagavatam to the sages of Naimisharanya." There he described that Shukadeva Goswami is the spiritual master of great saints and devotees. So Parikshit is telling, "I am therefore begging you to show the way of perfection for all persons, and especially for one who is about to die, Purushasyeha yatkaryam mriyam anasya sarvatha." Mriyam anasya means one who is about to die. His own position: He is going to meet with death in seven days. So he is preparing for quitting the body, but he is preparing by asking the greatest of the transcendentalists, the spiritual master of great saints and devotees. He is asking such a personality, "Kindly show the way of perfection for everyone, including me."

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the purpose of a spiritual master, emphasizing that their role is to guide individuals towards perfection and out of material entanglement, aligning with Krishna's mission.

who is about to die. So, in the purport, Prabhupada explains, "Unless one is perfectly anxious to inquire about the way of perfection, there is no necessity of approaching a spiritual master." That means a spiritual master is only meant for one thing in everyone's life. He is not meant for anything else. He is meant for showing the path of perfection for everyone in this material world who is entangled in the material existence, because that is Krishna's mission in this material world. That is what Krishna wants. Why this creation? Actually, there is no need for Krishna to create, because there is a whole spiritual world, perfect, complete, full of transcendental bliss, full of transcendental knowledge, full of everything required for our perfect existence.

**Key Quote:** "Because I want to enjoy independent of Krishna... This is utter foolishness because there is no such thing that you can enjoy independently."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the futility of seeking independent enjoyment separate from Krishna, explaining that the material world is created to facilitate this desire, but ultimately Krishna also makes arrangements to help us return to Him.

But foolish persons that we are, we left everything and come here. And why have we left that and come here? Because I want to enjoy independent of Krishna. This is utter foolishness, because I want to enjoy independent of Krishna, because there is no such thing that you can enjoy independently, because that is not your position, that is not your actual position. There is no existence for you without the help of Krishna, without support of Krishna. There is no existence. So Krishna is so kind that because we are adamant, he makes arrangement. He is all powerful, so he makes arrangement. What arrangement does he do? He creates this material world, and after creating for us to try and enjoy independently, he is making elaborate arrangements, because we have got so many varieties of desires, how I like to enjoy independently. So many arrangements Krishna has made. So to get us out of this madness, trying to enjoy in so many different ways unsuccessfully, Krishna is actually also making arrangement to help us to get out of this madness.

**Key Quote:** "A spiritual master is not a kind of decoration for a householder... this is not what a Guru is meant for, for material happiness."
**Summary:** The speaker warns against engaging with so-called spiritual masters who focus on material happiness, emphasizing that a genuine spiritual master guides towards ultimate spiritual benefit, not temporary material gains.

So Krishna himself comes for that purpose, to extricate us, to get us out of this entanglement, and he sends his bonafide spiritual masters, the pure devotees, for the same purpose that he comes. He also sends them from his personal abode. So Prabhupada says, "A spiritual master is not a kind of decoration for a householder." Some people, for a fashion, they say, "We also have a Guru. I have got this Guru." And what for you have got a Guru? "Oh, he gives me blessings by which I will be materially very, very happy." This is not what a Guru is meant for. For material happiness, material happiness, there are millions of ways, concocted ways, illusory ways. Spiritual master is not meant for that. So Prabhupada says, "Generally a fashionable materialist engages a so called spiritual master without any profit." Any profit means without any real benefit, spiritual benefit. "The pseudo spiritual master flatters the so called disciple, and therefore both the master and his ward, that is the disciple, go to hell."

**Summary:** The speaker laments the scarcity of genuine spiritual masters who can provide ultimate solutions to life's problems, contrasting them with those who cater to material desires.

Without a doubt, you see, this material world is a place which is full of material actions and reactions. So foolish disciples, they approach even greater fools who pose as spiritual masters and only ask from them, "How can I be materially happy? How can I get some material wealth? How can I get some material sense gratification?" And the foolish spiritual masters, so called spiritual masters, they also either in ignorance or even sometimes those who are not ignorant also by way of cheating, they try to give some material wealth, give some material happiness, material wealth, material solutions to their problems. Where is the bona fide guru to be found in this world who will give ultimate solution to all problems? Such spiritual masters are very, very rare.

**Summary:** The speaker praises Parikshit Maharaj for asking vital questions relevant to everyone's welfare, highlighting that these questions form the foundation of the Srimad Bhagavatam.

in this material world. And so we have to understand this point. So Prabhupada says about Pariksit Maharaj, "Maharaj Pariksit is the right type of disciple because he puts forward questions vital to the interest of all men, particularly for the dying man." Pariksit's questions are very, very vital. They are of the utmost importance. You can ask a spiritual master so many different questions, but the essential questions which are relevant for our ultimate welfare, for getting us out of this material entanglement, those questions are not generally asked by common people. So about Pariksit Maharaj, Prabhupada says, "The question put forward by Maharaj Pariksit is the basic principle of the complete thesis of Srimad Bhagavatam." See, Pariksit asked one or two questions in the beginning, but the answer to those two questions led to Shukadeva Goswami speaking the entire Srimad Bhagavatam. So you can imagine how vital those questions are. Now let us see how intelligently the great master replies. This is how Prabhupada is ending the purport of this particular verse, how Shukadeva Goswami will answer these vital questions.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 38th verse, focusing on Parikshit's intelligent inquiry about what one should do (hear, chant, remember, worship) and what one should avoid.

The 38th verse: yad srotavyam atho japyam yad kartavyam nrbhit prabho smartavyam bhajaniyam va bruhiyadva viparyayam. Very intelligent question asked by Pariksit Maharaj to Shukadeva Goswami. Already he has asked in the previous verse. What question has he asked? "Kindly show the way of perfection." Now he is asking, what is he asking now in the 38th verse? The translation is, "Please let me know what a man should hear, yad srotavyam, what he should chant, yad japyam, what he should remember, smartavyam, and worship, bhajaniyam, what is worship about for him, and yadva viparyayam, and also kindly tell me what he should not do." He is asking both positive and negative, what he should do and what he should not do. This is very, very intelligent question.

**Key Quote:** "It is very important that we should know for achieving the ultimate perfection specifically what we should do and also what we should not do."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding both positive and negative injunctions (vidhi and nishedha) in Vedic literature for achieving ultimate perfection.

Please explain all this to me. So we should understand Pariksit is most intelligent king of his time. So he is asking, of course he is asking about his own welfare, but he is also asking about the others' welfare. He is also asking about others' welfare. So it is very important that we should know for achieving the ultimate perfection specifically what we should do and also what we should not do. That is why in the Vedas there are so many instructions, but they all can be broadly classified into two different set of instructions: what is to be done and what is not to be done, vidhi nishedha. This is explained elsewhere by Srila Prabhupada. All the Vedic injunctions can be classified in two headings: vidhi means what you should do, and nishedha means what you should not do.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that the most important positive injunction is to always remember Krishna, and the most important negative injunction is to never forget Krishna, emphasizing that this is the key to achieving perfection.

And in the Bhagavatam it is said among all these different instructions, the most important positive injunction that you must do is always remember Krishna. What is the most important positive injunction of the Vedas? Always remember Krishna. And what is the most important negative injunction? Never forget Krishna. It is very interesting. Both are the same. Both are the same. Now, always remember Krishna means never forget Krishna. Never forget Krishna means always remember Krishna. Why is it said like this? Because the only thing you need to do to achieve perfection is to always remember Krishna and never forget him. Simply by doing that you will get all perfection. Now, how to do it, that's another matter, but this is the injunction, the most important injunction. So if somebody is not able to directly take up this always remembering Krishna, then there are other methods by which they are brought to that point, and that is the entirety of the Vedic literature. I will stop here.

**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami introduces the Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining its structure of 12 cantos, chapters, and verses, highlighting the significance of the 10th canto which focuses on Krishna Leela.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing two verses, the 39th and the 40th verses of the 19th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. These are the last two verses in this chapter, and with the end of this chapter, even the first canto comes to an end. So these are the last two verses of this entire canto itself of the Srimad Bhagavatam. As you might be aware, Bhagavatam is divided into 12 cantos, skandha in Sanskrit, and each of those cantos have got many chapters, and each chapter has got many verses. So totally, the number of verses is 18,000 in the Srimad Bhagavatam, and the number of cantos is 12, and there are different number of chapters in each canto. Just like this first canto has 19 chapters, the second canto has 10 chapters, whereas the 10th canto has got 90 chapters, 9-0, the biggest canto. Why? Because the 10th canto exclusively describes Krishna Leela. The other cantos describe the pastimes of the other incarnations of the Supreme Lord, and even the pastimes of the activities of the devotees of the Supreme Lord, including the devotees of Krishna like the Pandavas.

#### Vedic Culture, Renunciation, Importance of Cows, Householder duties

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "In the Vedic culture, even the poorest of the householders keep at least 10 cows."
**Summary:** The lecture delves into the meaning of verse 39, discussing the Vedic culture where householders maintain cows and provide milk to mendicants, emphasizing the self-sufficiency and charitable nature of this lifestyle.

So, 39th verse. The meaning of this 39th verse is, "O powerful Brahmana! It is said that you hardly stay in the houses of men long enough to milk a cow." Shukadeva Goswami has appeared in that assembly. Now, what is the duration for which if Shukadeva Goswami goes to somebody's house? So, Prabhupada explains this in the purport. Saints and sages in the renounced order of life go to the houses of householders. At the time, they milk the cows early in the morning and ask some quantity of milk for subsistence. Even though somebody will be completely renounced from everything material, as long as this body is there, for the bodily maintenance, at least devotees, they beg for some milk. And from whom do they beg? From the householders who keep cows. That's the Vedic culture generally. Vedic culture means the householders generally keep at least one cow or a few cows, and they have some land for growing some food. Very easily all economic necessities can be met by having some land for cultivation of food grains, vegetables, growing some flowers or fruits, and also having one or more cows. So, Prabhupada says the householders are able to not only get enough for themselves, but if some saintly person comes begging, Bhavati bhikshan dehi, they want very little, little milk. So the householders can easily give that little milk. So, Prabhupada says a pound of milk fresh from the milk bag of a cow is sufficient to feed an adult with all vitamin values, and therefore saints and sages live only on milk. Very, very easy. They take some milk, drink that, and that's enough to give them all necessary nutrition for their subsistence, for engaging in devotional service exclusively, without the need for gathering some grains, cooking it, preparing some foodstuff. Either oneself or somebody else has to prepare nothing. Directly take the milk, especially when milk is being taken from the cow, the cow is being milked, just take that milk, drink it, finished, over. So, Prabhupada says in the Vedic culture, even the poorest of the householders keep at least 10 cows. This is Vedic culture, each delivering 12 to 20 quarts of milk, and therefore no one hesitates to spare a few pounds of milk for the mendicants.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So, to take advantage of the saintly persons coming for begging is the real business of a householder."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that saintly persons stay only briefly, and householders should use that opportunity to gain spiritual knowledge, emphasizing the importance of association with saints.

But, these are, but, I don't know, I don't know the exact conversion of these quarts to pounds. Of course, pounds, generally one pound is about half a kilo, kilogram. And I think quarts means something like some 15 or 20 quarts make a pound, something like that. So, when they have ten cows, each of those cows can give so much milk, and they have plenty of milk to even spare for, even the poorest of householders is considered poor householders. They can spare some milk for the saintly persons who come begging. Anybody can give. So, Srila Prabhupada says it is the duty of householders to maintain the saints and sages like the children, like their own children. They give some milk at least to those who come begging for some milk, milk or food. So, a saint like Shukadeva Goswami would hardly stay at the house of a householder, for he would hardly stay for more than five minutes. He would hardly stay for more than five minutes. That means he would not even stay for five minutes at the house of a householder. So, what does this mean? In other words, such saints are rarely, very rarely seen in the houses of householders, very rarely. If at all they approach a householder, little milk, less than five minutes. When they are milking the cow, just take little milk and go on. So, therefore, Maharaj Pariksit therefore prayed to Shukadeva Goswami to instruct him as soon as possible. So, Raupar is giving us a lot of instructions here. Householders should understand saintly persons when they come begging, they are not going to stay for long. So, to take advantage of the saintly persons coming for begging is the real business of a householder, the real duty of a householder.

#### Spiritual Knowledge, Material Bondage, Purpose of Existence, Reciprocal relationship between saints and householders

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "The purpose of our existence should be to get that which is not available anywhere and what is that how to extricate oneself from this material bond"
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes that householders should seek spiritual knowledge from saints, focusing on liberation from material bondage rather than material benefits, highlighting the unique value that saints can provide.

That from the saintly persons, get some valuable spiritual sustenance, spiritual instructions to make one's life completely successful in attaining ultimate liberation or complete total liberation from all material bondage, and it's possible for everyone. So Srila Prabhupada says the householders also should be intelligent enough to get some transcendental information from visiting sages. Saintly person means they're exclusively meant for giving spiritual knowledge, spiritual instructions for achieving ultimate perfection. The householder should not foolishly ask a saint to deliver what is available in the market, some material thing. Sometimes people think, "Oh, sadhu, he can give me some treatment by which I will get cured of some disease, and he'll do it free of charge. He will not charge me. If I go to a doctor, doctor may ask for some fees, or I have to purchase some medicine. Doctor may write a letter to the doctor. If I go to a doctor, doctor may ask for some fees, or I have to purchase some medicine. Doctor may write a letter to the doctor, some medicine I have to purchase. The sadhu, he will do it free. There's no need of money." So this is not very intelligent, is foolish. Ask the sadhu what he can give which nobody else can give, which is not available anywhere for purchase or even for free. Nothing is available other than from such pure devotees. Nobody else can give you. So ask for that. A similar verse is there in the earlier chapter, we discussed this, fifth chapter, first canto, tasya eva heto prayatetu kovido nalayateta yad brahmate pessoal sRY on this image那 ربward من الصحpre suchen narad unaisi ka motherfucker for р quotaiedy instructing the asadeva, one should actually live for that purposeful end which is not obtained by wandering throughout the entire universe, all the planetary systems. The purpose of our existence should be to get that which is not available anywhere, and what is that? How to extricate oneself from this material bond, how to get out of this material bondage. That you cannot get simply by going to different planets with different material facilities, or somewhere you've got long duration of life, somewhere you've got siddha loka, you can get all mystic powers, somewhere you got very nice beautiful gardens called nandana kanana, and somewhere else you have got some lot of nice vegetables, fruits, flowers. This is not the purpose of existence. The purpose of existence is how to get out of this material bondage and get eternal freedom, complete total freedom. That is the real purpose. So, Shri Prabhupada concludes by telling that should be the reciprocal relation between the

saints and the householders. The 40th verse, the last verse, the meaning of this verse is, "Shree Sruthi Goswami said, the king thus spoke and questioned the sage using sweet language. Then the great and powerful personality, the son of Vyasa Deva, who knew the principles of religion, began his reply after hearing the question just asked very sweetly, very nicely." His Pariksit himself is a great devotee. The devotee is qualified in multiple ways. He can ask the perfect and precise question. He can ask the question in very sweet words. He is well behaved. So this is another fact about a devotee. One who is a pure devotee of Krishna, he has got all the good qualities that are to be found in even the devatas. All the good qualities. So therefore, Pariksit asked the perfect question of perfect questions, and Shikudai Goswami, who is the great and powerful personality, who knew the principles of religion, Dharmagya, he began his reply. That will come in the second canto of the first chapter, his reply, beginning of his reply.

The meaning of this fourth verse is, while the king was thus repenting, he received news of his imminent death, which would be due to the bite of a snake bird, occasioned by the curse spoken by the sage's son. The king accepted this as good news, for it would be the cause of his indifference toward worldly things.

**Key Quote:** "One can stop the repetition of birth and death only by going back to Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the nature of material existence as a cycle of birth and death, contrasting it with spiritual existence and the possibility of returning to Godhead.

This suggests that the king was actually a very great devotee. He was realized sattva. He is welcoming this curse, which is going to be the cause of his death by the bite of a snake bird. So who would welcome death? It's our natural tendency to live on. Nobody wants to die. But here, Pariksit Maharaj, he is repenting, and he warns that the sinful action of his is counteracted by the appropriate punishment. And when he heard that he was cursed by the sage's son, he thought that this is the right punishment for me. And it's an extreme punishment. It's not a small punishment. But we will see Prabhupada explaining how the king accepted this particular news as good news. So in the purport, Prabhupada says, "Real happiness is achieved by spiritual existence or by cessation of the repetition of birth and death." So, spiritual happiness, material existence, is freedom from birth and death. And material existence is characterized by repetition of birth and death. One who is born, death is certain. And one who dies, rebirth is certain. So, this repetition of birth and death is the characteristic of material existence.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "One can stop the repetition of birth and death only by going back to Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of 'going back to Godhead' and mentions Srila Prabhupada's 'Back to Godhead' magazine, emphasizing that even attaining Brahma Loka doesn't free one from the cycle of birth and death.

One can stop the repetition of birth and death only by going back to Godhead. What does going back to Godhead mean? Going to the personal abode of Krishna, the Supreme Lord, God's own abode. It's called the Absolute, the Absolute pure within. Going back to Godhead. Srila Prabhupada started one magazine sometime in 1944 on the order of his spiritual master, and he gave the title for that magazine Back to Godhead. So, that magazine is particularly meant for all human beings, whose goal in life should be to stop the repetition of birth and death, and how can that be done? By going back to Godhead, by preparing oneself in such a way that at the end of this life, when we have to leave this body, we will not take another material body, but we will go to the spiritual kingdom of God in our spiritual body. Further, Srila Prabhupada explains, "In a material world, even by attaining the topmost planet, Brahma Loka, one cannot get rid of the conditions of repeated birth and death."

**Verse References:** BG 8
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Therefore those who are materially poverty are better candidates than those who are materially prosperous."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the limitations of even the highest material planets in escaping birth and death, highlighting the importance of detachment and the path of perfection, suggesting that material poverty can be an advantage.

This is the statement in the eighth chapter of the Bhagavad-Gita. It means we undergo repetition of birth and death. So beginning from the topmost planet, Brahma Loka, down to the lowest, Patala, all are places where repetition of birth and death takes place. Though there are different conditions on different planets, higher planets have a longer duration of life, there are better facilities for comfortable living, there is better arrangement for sense enjoyment, people are more pious in the upper planets, but still one cannot avoid a repetition of birth and death, even by going to the topmost planet in this material existence, that is Brahma Loka. So Prabhupada says, even if you go to Brahma Loka, we do not get freedom from birth and death. And knowing this, one should accept the path of attaining perfection. Generally, people don't take up this path of perfection of going back to Godhead. The path of perfection frees one from all material attachments, and thus one becomes fit to enter into the spiritual kingdom. See, there's a qualification: who can go to this spiritual kingdom of God? Those who are free from all material attachments. And the material attachments, we can become free only if we follow the path of perfection. Therefore, those who are materially poverty-stricken are better candidates than those who are materially prosperous. This is explained in many places in the scriptures.

#### material prosperity, detachment, spiritual progress, curse as a blessing

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Material prosperity is like a fever."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of fever to explain that material prosperity is a diseased condition, emphasizing the need to detach from worldly affairs and highlighting how the curse on Pariksit Maharaj was a blessing in disguise, prompting him to renounce his kingdom and prepare for death.

Material prosperity is like a fever. Fever means the body, a healthy body, is in a diseased condition. So when somebody is diseased, they should cure the disease and return to the healthy condition, which is the normal condition. But instead of curing the disease and thereby reducing the fever, if somebody is doing things by which the fever keeps on increasing, then that is counterproductive. Similarly, material prosperity is like the diseased condition of human society. Why? Because in this material existence, we are not meant for making arrangements for living comfortably here or settling down in this place, no. This is certified as a place of suffering and misery under all circumstances. So therefore, we should endeavor to go back to God and prepare ourselves by becoming free from all material attachments. So materially poverty-stricken people, they never make arrangements, they cannot make arrangements for staying comfortable, because they are materially not prosperous. Maharaj Pariksit was a great devotee of the Lord and a bona fide candidate for entering into the kingdom of God. But even though he was so, his material assets as the emperor of the world were setbacks to perfect attainment of his rightful status as one of the associates of the Lord in the spiritual sky. If somebody is materially prosperous, there is a possibility that they have attachment for such material wealth or material belongings. In the course of dealing with this material world, we do develop attachments, and these attachments are impediments on the path of spiritual progress. As a devotee of the Lord, he could understand that the cursing of the brahmana boy, although unwise, was a blessing upon him. So how was this cursing the brahmana boy to die a blessing for Pariksit Maharaj? Because this curse would become the cause of detachment from worldly affairs, both political and social. Why? Because if he knows he is going to die within seven days, he is going to prepare for death by renouncing his kingdom and going to a sacred place to associate with saintly persons to prepare himself to become detached and go back to Godhead.

#### Shamika Muni, Pariksit Maharaj, self-realization, detachment

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Both Shamika Muni and the king were self-realized souls."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Shamika Muni's role in conveying the news of the curse to King Pariksit, emphasizing that both were self-realized souls, not afraid of death, and that Pariksit Maharaj understood the situation and decided to prepare for his imminent death.

Now, Srila Prabhupada explains something very important here. Shamika Muni also, after regretting the incident, conveyed the news to the king as a matter of duty so that the king would be able to prepare himself to go back to Godhead. If you remember, in the previous chapter, it was explained that Shamika Rishi learnt that his son had cursed the king, the emperor. Just for a small fault of the emperor, this Shamika Rishi's son, Shungi, had cursed the king to die, which was not at all the proper punishment. For a very minor mistake, a severe punishment was given. It was unjust. It was improper, immature on the part of the boy. But still, he conveyed the news to the king so that the king could prepare. Shamika Muni sent news to the king that foolish Shungi, his son, misused his spiritual power by cursing the king unwarrantedly. Why did he say this? Because the incident of the king's garlanding the Muni was not sufficient cause for being cursed to death. But since there was no way to retract the curse, the king was informed to prepare for death within a week. Shamika Rishi is not an ordinary Muni, not an ordinary Brahmana. That will be explained by Srila Prabhupada here. Both Shamika Muni and the king were self-realized souls. Both were very, very advanced spiritually. Shamika Muni was a mystic. Mystic means he had practiced Ashtanga Yoga. So he was an Ashtanga Yogi. And Maharaj Pariksit was a devotee. Maharaj Pariksit had practiced Bhakti Yoga. So he was a Bhakti Yogi. Therefore, there was no difference between them in self-realization. Both were self-realized. That means they understood, they realized, I am not the body, I am spirit, soul. I don't belong to this material world. I belong to the Supreme Lord in the spiritual kingdom of God. Neither of them was afraid of meeting death. Shamika Rishi was not afraid of death, being self-realized. Neither Pariksit Maharaj was afraid of death, being also self-realized. Maharaj Pariksit could have gone to the Muni to beg his pardon. But the news of imminent death was conveyed to the king with so much regret by the Muni that the king did not want to shame the Muni further by his presence there. Pariksit Maharaj understood that Shamika Rishi has sent word to him that his son has foolishly cursed the king. Therefore, the punishment is, according to Pariksit Maharaj, proper. So no need to further go and beg any forgiveness from the Muni. He decided to prepare himself for his imminent death to find out the way to go back to Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "Loving devotional service to Krishna is the greatest achievement nothing else can compare with that"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces verse 5 of the 19th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on Maharaj Pariksit's preparation for death through Krishna consciousness and renunciation of other self-realization practices.

In this session we will be discussing from the 5th verse of the 19th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Atho Vihayemam Amum Chalokam Vimarshitau Heyataya Purastat Krishnangri Sevam Adhimanyamana Upavishatprayam Amartyanadyam. The meaning of this 5th verse is Maharaj Pariksit sat down firmly on the banks of the Ganges to concentrate his mind in Krishna consciousness, rejecting all other practices of self-realization, because transcendental loving service to Krishna is the greatest achievement, superseding all other methods. So this verse is directly describing what did Pariksit do to prepare for death, having got the news that he was cursed to die within a week by a snake bite. So he renounced his kingdom and he went to a sacred place on the bank of the river Ganga, sat down firmly to concentrate his mind in Krishna Consciousness. Why? Because he's a devotee and he knows that bhakti yoga is the best system for self-realization, so he rejected all of the practices of self-realization because he knew that loving devotional service to Krishna is the greatest achievement, nothing else can compare.

**Key Quote:** "For a devotee like Pariksit Maharaj none of the material planets even the topmost brahma loka is as desirable as Goloka Vrindavana"
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, contrasting the desires of a devotee (Goloka Vrindavana) with the limited understanding of material existence by modern scientists and philosophers, emphasizing the superiority of Krishna's abode.

With that, so in the purport Srila Prabhupada explains, for a devotee like Maharaj Pariksit, none of the material planets, even the topmost brahma loka, is as desirable as Goloka Vrindavana, the abode of Lord Sri Krishna, the primeval Lord and original personality of Godhead. This means a devotee like Pariksit Maharaj knows what is the nature of material existence. He is not ignorant like modern day people, even so-called learned scientists and philosophers. They do not know what is the nature of material existence. Sages do not know. They do not even know about the different varieties of planets in this material universe. So Srila Prabhupada explains here, for a devotee who is in knowledge, he knows that none of the material planets, including the topmost brahma loka, is a desirable place to transfer oneself to after quitting this body. So the best place, the most desirable place for a devotee is the personal abode of Shri Krishna which is called Goloka Vrindavana.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's personal abode is called Goloka Vrindavana and that is the destination desired by pure devotees of Krishna like Parikshit Maharaj."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the vastness of the material creation, including innumerable universes and planets, and the insignificance of human beings within this scheme, while highlighting the importance of Goloka Vrindavana.

Goloka Vrindavana. Goloka eva nivasati akhilatma bhutaha govindam adipurusham tamaham bhajami. So several places in the scripture it is described Krishna's personal abode is called Goloka Vrindavana and that is the destination desired by pure devotees of Krishna like Parikshit Maharaj. Further Srila Prabhupada says this earth is one of the innumerable material planets within the universe. There are millions and billions of planets in this one universe and there are millions of universes within this material cosmic manifestation and the spiritual world is beyond all this. This the modern day scientists and philosophers and people do not know, they have no knowledge, they have no understanding, they have no idea. So the spiritual world is beyond all this. So, Srila Prabhupada says there are innumerable universes also within the compass of the Mahatattva. Mahatattva is the material creation, entirety of material creation is called Mahatattva. So, within this Mahatattva there are innumerable universes and each universe consists of innumerable planets and each planet consists of innumerable living beings. And among innumerable living beings in 84 lakh species, the human beings are one species of living beings, so very very very insignificant, human beings are insignificant in the scheme

But due to false ego, due to ignorance, due to being under the influence of illusion we think oh human beings are the greatest in the entire creation, no there are higher beings even within this universe and the topmost supreme personality is even beyond the material creation, the supreme lord, personality of God is Krishna of whom people do not have proper knowledge, proper understanding. So, Prabhupada is educating us by writing this elaborate purport. The devotees are told by the lord and his representatives, the spiritual masters or acharyas that not one of the planets within all the innumerable universes is suitable for the residential purposes of a devotee. These are all explained in the Bhagavad Gita, but you have to read Bhagavad Gita as explained by the Acharya. The bona fide Acharya Sri de Prabhupad, he has translated and given purport to Bhagavad

**Key Quote:** "The devotee always desires to go back home, back to Godhead just to become one of the associates of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the fundamental misery of material existence is the repetition of birth and death, and the best place for residence is the spiritual world, desiring to be an associate of the Lord.

Gita and he calls it Bhagavad Gita As It Is. Because in English language, before Prabhupadan wrote, nobody else had written the Bhagavad Gita to explain this fact that as the Lord explains in the Bhagavad Gita itself, all places are places of repetition of birth and death. And this is the fundamental misery of material existence, repetition of birth and death. That people do not know. And they also do not know that the best place for our residence is the kingdom of God in the spiritual world, personal kingdom of God. So, Prabhupada says the devotee always desires to go back home, back to Godhead just to become one of the associates of the Lord, in the capacity of servitor, friend, parent or conjugal lover of the Lord, either in one of the innumerable Vaikuntha planets or in Goloka Vrindavana, the planet of Lord Sri Krishna. So, this statement, it's being explained. There are many, many, many, many planets in the spiritual sky beyond the material creation.

**Key Quote:** "The planets in the spiritual sky, the Vaikuntha lokas and Goloka Vrindavana are eternally situated."
**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between Vaikuntha planets and Goloka Vrindavana in the spiritual sky, emphasizing their eternal nature compared to the temporary nature of material planets.

And those planets are of two categories. The Vaikuntha planets is one category of spiritual planets where the Supreme Lord as Narayana is residing with his devotees. And there is another planet called Goloka Vrindavana also in the spiritual sky where Lord Sri Krishna resides with his devotees. Narayana is four-handed Lord and Sri Krishna is two-handed Lord. But both are the supreme personality of Godhead in different forms. All these planets, that means Vaikuntha lokas and Goloka Vrindavana are eternally situated in the spiritual sky. The characteristic of material planets, whether Brahma loka or Indra loka, Chandra loka, Bhu loka, Patar loka, Sutala loka, all material planets are not eternal. Bhutva bhutva praliyate. They are constantly created, maintained and destroyed, including Brahma loka. And so are the living beings. The living beings are created, maintained and destroyed also. So the planets in the spiritual sky, the Vaikuntha lokas and Goloka Vrindavana are eternally situated. There is no creation, there is no destruction, there is no need for maintenance. That we have to understand, we have to realize, we have to accept.

**Key Quote:** "In the spiritual sky, there are so many spiritual planets, eternally situated, no creation in the spiritual planets, no misery, no birth, no disease, no old age, no suffering, only pure transcendental bliss"
**Summary:** The speaker describes the location of the spiritual sky beyond the causal ocean, highlighting the absence of misery and the presence of transcendental bliss, emphasizing the confidential nature of this knowledge.

We have to appreciate this fact. And where is the spiritual sky? It is on the other side of the causal ocean within the Mahat-tattva. Mahat-tattva is the entire material creation and this material creation is one side of an ocean called the causal ocean. It is called Karana Jala and the other side of the causal ocean is the spiritual sky. In the spiritual sky, there are so many spiritual planets, eternally situated, no creation in the spiritual planets, no misery, no birth, no disease, no old age, no suffering, only pure transcendental bliss in association with Krishna or Narayana as one of his associates. So, this is very, very, very, very confidential knowledge Prabhupada is giving here. Maharaj Pariksit was already aware of all this information due to his accumulated piety and birth in a high family of devotees and Vaishnavas.

**Key Quote:** "Only the Vaishnavas, the pure devas, are able to promote themselves to higher planets in this universe."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the Vaishnavas' knowledge of the spiritual and material planets with the limited understanding of modern scientists, emphasizing that even the heavenly planets are still places of death.

Thus, he was not at all interested in material planets. This means to say, there are people who are conversant with the Vedas, which explain how one can promote oneself to higher planets in this universe, the heavenly planets particularly, where there is better, much better standard of living than on the earth planet, millions of times better. But even that place is a place of death. So therefore, only the Vaishnavas, the pure devas, are able to promote themselves to higher planets in this universe. They are devotees of the Supreme Lord Vishnu or Krishna. They have proper knowledge about the nature of all these material planets as opposed to the real nature of the spiritual planets, the Vaikunthalokas. So Maharaj Pariksit was a Vaishnava. So he knew all this, therefore, he was not interested in promoting himself to a material planet. Now Prabhupada compares the modern scientists, they are very eager to reach the moon planet or some other Mars planet. But they cannot conceive of the highest planet of this universe. They do not even know what are the conditions in Brahmaloka. But in contrast, Prabhupada says a devotee like Maharaj Pariksit does not care for any of these material planets, whether moon planet or Brahmaloka.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by describing Maharaj Pariksit's determination in transcendental loving service through fasting on the banks of the river Yamuna, clarifying a potential discrepancy with earlier mentions of the Ganges.

He does not care for any of these material planets, whether moon planet or Brahmaloka. So when he was assured that he is going to die within seven days, on a fixed date he was assured that he is going to die, he became determined in the transcendental loving service of Lord Krishna by complete fasting in the bank of the transcendental river Yamuna. Now earlier it was mentioned that Pariksit Maharaj was sitting down firmly on the bank of the Ganges. And here in the purport Shrita Prabhupada is telling Pariksit Maharaj sat down on the bank of the river Yamuna. So Prabhupada explains in a later purport, actually even though some places scriptures mention that Pariksit sat down on the bank of the river Ganga, but actually he sat down on the bank of the river Yamuna because Yamuna flows through the Ganges. So he sat down on the bank of the river Yamuna, Hastinapura which is the capital of the Delhi state. So he was ruling from Hastinapura, so he sat down on the bank of the Yamuna. Now this is explained better in the next verse. So we will hear about this more in the next verse. Thank you very much.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 6th verse of the 19th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Yavailasach Shri Tulasi Vimishra Krishnangri Renu Abhyadikambu Netri Punatiloka Nubhayatra Seshan Kastamna Sevet Marishyamanah. The meaning of this 6th verse is as follows: The river Ganges, by which the king sat to fast, carries the most auspicious water, which is mixed with the dust of the lotus feet of the Lord and Tulasi leaves. Therefore, that water sanctifies the three worlds inside and outside, and even sanctifies Lord Shiva and other demigods. Consequently, everyone who is destined to die must take shelter of this river.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore this verse is telling everyone who is destined to die must take shelter of this river."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the glorification of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers, emphasizing their purifying qualities and suitability as a shelter for those facing death.

So something about the glorification of this Amartana Dhyam, the transcendental river, on whose bank Parikshit was sitting to fast in order to prepare himself to go back to Godhead, to meet death, and thereby go back to Godhead. So what is the special thing about this river? That this river carries the most auspicious water. How is that? Because of two reasons. The water of this river, either Ganges or Yamuna, Ganga or Yamuna, is mixed with the dust of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, and it also contains Tulasi leaves. Now how is that? That is explained by Prabhupada in the purport. And because of this reason, the verse is telling, therefore this water of Ganges or Yamuna sanctifies the three worlds inside and outside, completely purifies all the three worlds. So whoever is the first one inside and outside of this world, and not only it purifies the three worlds, it purifies all the devatas including Lord Shiva. Shiva is the topmost among the devatas, so everyone becomes purified by coming in touch with this holy water of the Ganga or Yamuna. Therefore, this verse is telling everyone who is destined to die must take shelter of this river.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Pariksit just after receiving the news of his death within seven days at once retired from family life."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Parikshit Maharaj's immediate renunciation upon learning of his impending death and contrasts this with the traditional varnashrama system and its stages of life.

Either Ganga or Yamuna is the ideal shelter for those who are destined to die. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, Maharaj Pariksit, just after receiving the news of his death within seven days, at once retired from family life. Time is very short, seven days, but he did not waste any time at all, at once retired from family life. Generally, in the varnashrama system, it is assumed that people live for 100 years, so there are four spiritual stages of development of spiritual perfection: brahmacharya, grahastha, vanaprastha, sanyas. So ideally, a person divides his hundred years into four parts, 25, 25, 25, 25. So first 25 years is the stage of brahmacharya, one practices brahmacharya, student life. Then in the next 25 years, the householder life, one gets married and raises the family. Then after that, at the age of 51, retires compulsorily and enters vanaprastha ashrama, means leaves home, pancha shoredwam vanam frajeth, goes to the forest. Forest means goes sacred place away from materialistic living, away from city, town, village, all that, away from that to a sacred place, to a holy place, to a place where saints live and exclusively practice spiritual life, vanaprastha. That is from 50th year up to 75th year and that is preparation for taking sanyas by renouncing all material connections 100%, and that sanya stage is from 75 to the 100th year. But we should also remember it is not guaranteed everybody will live 100.

**Key Quote:** "Srila Jiva Goswami statement appears to be more accurate because of the geographical situation."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why Srila Jiva Goswami suggests Parikshit Maharaj took shelter on the bank of the Yamuna rather than the Ganges, based on geographical considerations.

years, especially in this Kali Yuga, the duration of life in Kali Yuga shortened. Therefore, it is said here, everyone who is destined to die and who is not destined to die, everybody is destined to die. And who you do not believe, one said that all that situation will happen in the material world. In this video is broken and it will be and then what did he do? Shifted himself to the sacred bank of the river. Now again Prabhupada will explain why even though it was not for Gayatri opposition translation says Ganga river, Ganges, Amartyanadhyam, Transcendental river which is referred to as Ganga river. Here Prabhupada is telling in the purport Yamuna, it will be explained now. Generally it is said that the king took shelter on the bank of the Ganges, but according to Srila Jiva Goswami, one of the previous Acharyas who is the authority on Srimad Bhagavatam. According to Srila Jiva Goswami, the king Pariksit Maharaj took shelter on the bank of the Yamuna. Now Srila Prabhupada justifies why Srila Jiva Goswami says Pariksit Maharaj took shelter on the bank of river Yamuna and not Ganga. Srila Jiva Goswami statement appears to be more accurate because of the geographical situation. What is the geographical situation of Pariksit Maharaj? That Srila Prabhupada says Maharaj Pariksit resided in his capital Hastinapura situated near present Delhi and the river Yamuna flows down past the city of Delhi. Even now Yamuna is flowing. Comes from Himalayas, Yamunotri. Comes down and then flows through Delhi and later on flows through Vrindavan, Brajabhumi, Yamuna river. It divides Brajabhumi into two parts, the eastern side and the western side of the river Brajabhumi or Brajamandal. So, Prabhupada says naturally the king would take shelter of the river Yamuna because she was flowing past his palace door. His kingdom was situated in present-day Delhi and along Delhi, Yamuna is flowing. As far as sanctity is concerned.

the of his onsite kundalini is omitted. From the point of view of the sages in this sages' river Yamuna is more directly connected with Lord Krishna than the Ganges than the river Ganga. Now about Lord Krishna Srila Prabhupada mentions here one interesting fact Lord Krishna sanctified the river Yamuna from the beginning of his transcendental pastimes in this world how is that while his father Vasudeva was crossing the Yamuna with the baby Lord Krishna what happened if you remember hearing or reading the birth of Krishna Krishna was born when Vasudeva and Devaki were imprisoned by Kamsa Krishna was the eighth son of Devaki and Vasudeva so when Krishna appeared Devaki and Vasudeva were very anxious to protect this baby child from the hands of Kamsa Kamsa Kamsa killed the first six sons of Devaki and therefore Devaki and Vasudeva were very anxious to save the eight child somehow from the clutches of Kamsa so Krishna being the supreme lord seeing the anxiety of Devaki and Vasudeva to protect him he directed Vasudeva you hide me in of Gokula in the house of Nanda maharaaj he carried baby krushna across the river Yamuna because on one side of river Yamuna is Mathura on the other side of river Yamuna across Yamuna the other side is Gokula 跟 Kulta was felt safe in the house of Nanda Maharaj you are not offhand, Kamsa's hands can't lay on me so Vasudeva agreed and he carried baby Krishna across the river Yamuna because on one side of river Yamuna is Mathura on the other side of river Yamuna across Yamuna the other side is Gokula, So what did this baby Krishna do to him it has been concluded someone told this was he died and then he haseping , the other-side this 100 earth person trek.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord fell down into the river Yamuna Krishna fell down and by the dust of his lotus feet the river at once became sanctified"
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of Krishna's pastimes in the Yamuna, explaining how the river became sanctified by the dust of his lotus feet and the presence of Tulasi leaves.

And Vasudeva do he took that baby in a basket and cross the river Yamuna to safely hide the baby child Krishna in Gokula. So here the description is by Srila Prabhupada when Vasudeva was crossing with baby Krishna being carried on his head in a basket. What happened? The Lord fell down into the river Yamuna Krishna fell down and by the dust of his lotus feet the river at once became sanctified this is a pastime of Krishna remember Krishna is Supreme Lord he is not a small child. So Vasudeva was very anxious for the protection of Krishna so he became extremely anxious to protect Krishna when accidentally he thought the child had fallen. But actually Krishna was performing his Leela of sanctifying the river Yamuna by falling into the river so that his lotus feet touched the river. So therefore it is said here it is especially mentioned herein that Maharaj Pariksit took shelter of that particular river which is beautifully flowing carrying the dust of the lotus feet of Lord Krishna mixed with Tulasi leaves. Now how are dust of lotus feet of Krishna and Tulasi leaves both in Yamuna? We heard how dust of lotus feet of Krishna is in Yamuna because Krishna fell down into the river Yamuna when Vasudeva was crossing over. Now also Tulasi leaves are present in Yamuna because Lord Krishna's lotus feet are always besmeared with the Tulasi leaves. And thus as soon as the lotus feet contact the water of the Ganges in the Yamuna the rivers become at once sanctified. The Lord however contacted the river Yamuna more than the Ganges. Krishna performed his pastimes in Vrindavan on the bank of the Yamuna so he was more in contact with Yamuna than the Ganga. According to the Varaha Purana as quoted by Srila Jiva Goswami there is no difference between the water of Ganges and the Yamuna because both these waters are washing the lotus feet of the same Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "There is no difference between the water of Ganges and the Yamuna because both these waters are washing the lotus feet of the same Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the origin of the Ganges and emphasizes the oneness of Ganga and Yamuna, as well as the ultimate oneness of Vishnu, Rama, and Krishna, before concluding the lecture.

What is the pastime of the river Ganga appearing in this world? When the Lord appeared incarnated as Vamana, he stretched his leg to measure three steps of land. When he stretched his leg, it pierced the coverings of the universe and the water of the Karna ocean leaked into this universe. It washed the feet of Lord Vaman Dev and that became the river Ganga which flows through all the planets from the topmost planet Brahmaloka to the bottom most Pataloka and purifies the entire universe by the sacred water because that water contains the dust of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord Vaman Deva. So therefore Varaha Purana says there is no difference between Ganga and Yamuna. Both are washing the lotus feet of the same Supreme Lord whether Vamana or Krishna it is only one Supreme Lord. One and only one Supreme Personality of Godhead. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Then it is called as Yamuna. So Prabhupada cites another statement from the scriptures. It is said in the scriptures that 1000 names of Vishnu equal to 1 name of Rama and 3 names of Rama are equal to 1 name of Krishna. So I will explain this some other time what is the difference between the names of Vishnu, Rama and Krishna. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** This segment focuses on the meaning of the 7th verse, explaining Pariksit Maharaj's renunciation and his focus on Krishna for liberation, emphasizing Krishna's unique ability to grant Mukti.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Jai Vanarottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 7th and 8th verses of the 19th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 7th verse first: Munivrata Mukta Samastha Sangaha. The meaning of this verse is: Thus the king, the worthy descendant of the Pandavas, decided once and for all and sat on the Ganges bank to fast until death and give himself up to the lotus feet of Lord Krishna, who alone is able to award liberation. So, freeing himself from all kinds of associations and attachments, he accepted the vows of a sage. There are many, many points in this verse. The verse itself is very nicely describing Pariksit renouncing his kingdom and deciding to prepare himself to quit his body within a week by fixing his mind on the lotus feet of Lord Krishna. Why did he choose to fix his mind on the lotus feet of Lord Krishna? Because Krishna alone can award liberation. That's why Krishna's another name is Munivrata. That's why Krishna's another name is Mukunda, one who can give Mukti, liberation. Even Lord Shiva admits, nobody else can give liberation. Mukti Pradata Sarveshaam Vishnureva Nasamshayaha. Shiva says nobody else can give liberation other than Vishnu. So Vishnu, Krishna, only they can give liberation. That is the supreme personality of Godhead. And in order to become liberated, one has to become free from all kinds of material association and material attachments. So Pariksit prepared himself by giving up all kinds of material association and material attachments.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is the fountainhead of the principle of Vishnu Tattva means Krishna is the source of all other incarnations, all other forms of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** This segment explains the relationship between Krishna and Vishnu, emphasizing Krishna as the source of all Vishnu forms and the unlimited nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

So, in the Sixth verse, Shrila Prabhupad explains the significance of Pariksit Maharaj retiring and going to a holy place on the bank of the sacred river Ganga. Shrila Prabhupada says in the Sixth verse, "The water of the Ganges sanctifies all the three worlds including the gods and the demigods because it emanates from the lotus feet, the personality of Godhead Vishnu." Lord Krishna is the fountainhead of the principle of Vishnu tattva, and therefore shelter of his lotus feet can deliver one from all sins including an offense committed by a king unto a Brahmana. Now here Srila Prabhupada explains what's the relationship between Krishna and Vishnu, actually they are one person called the principle of Vishnu tattva. You should understand that the supreme personality of Godhead Krishna is an unlimited personality, so he is not limited to one form. His original form is that of Krishna and he has many, many, many countless other forms which are forms of his own personality, like the form of Vishnu in this material world or the form of Narayana in the spiritual world or the form of Balarama, form of Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Keshava, Madhava, Govinda, unlimited forms because he is unlimited personality. He has unlimited forms, he is unlimited, but one should not mistake the form of the living being to be the form of the Lord, no, the form of the living being is never the form of the Lord. The living being is a very, very, very, very, very tiny living being, Anu Atma, and Krishna is Vibhu Atma. He is unlimited. He is a super soul and we are all individual, tiny, very, very infinitesimal spirit soul. So there is a difference. Both are spiritual by nature, the living entity and the Supreme Lord, but the Supreme Lord is unlimited person and we are limited, very, very, very, very tiny like comparing an atom to diamond. The whole universe, it's like that, the difference is like that. We can't measure how big is this universe. It's billions and trillions of times the size of an atom. So the living entity should never be equalized or even compared with the Supreme. So, Krishna is the fountainhead of the principle of Vishnu Tattva means Krishna is the source of all other incarnations, all other forms of the Supreme Lord. From Krishna emanate Narayana, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Vasudeva, Vishnu, and Vishnu. There are three forms of the Supreme. Keshava, Madhava, Govinda, all the Vishnu forms, all the Narayana forms, emanate from Krishna. That's the meaning of Krishna telling in the Bhagavad Gita, Aham sarvasya prabhavo matta sarvam pravartate.

#### purification, Pariksit Maharaj, devotional service

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Therefore, Srila Prabhupada says, Maharaj Pariksit began to meditate upon the lotus feet of Lord Krishna, who is Mukunda, or the giver of liberation."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Pariksit Maharaj's meditation on Krishna's lotus feet and the arrival of great sages, highlighting the importance of devotional service and the rarity of pure devotees.

So, it's said here, anyone who takes shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna becomes freed from all sins, including all offenses, accidentally committed, unknowingly committed, inadvertently committed. Therefore, Srila Prabhupada says, Maharaj Pariksit began to meditate upon the lotus feet of Lord Krishna, who is Mukunda, or the giver of liberation. Now, the bank of the Ganges or the bank of Yamuna can give a chance to a person to remember the Lord continuously. Therefore, Pariksit Maharaj decided to sit on the bank of the Ganga and meditate on the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord Krishna to become free from all sins. Now, the eight words of the nineteenth chapter of the first canto, it is described. The meaning of this eighth verse is, at that time, when Pariksit Maharaj sat to fast until death, preparing himself for quitting the body, purifying himself, all the great minds and thinkers, accompanied by their disciples and sages, who could very sanctify a place of pilgrimage, just by their presence, they arrived there, where Pariksit Maharaj was sitting, for fasting and purifying himself. They arrived there on the plea of making a pilgrim's journey. Sushila Prabhupada explains this in the purport. When Maharaj Pariksit sat down on the bank of the Ganges, the news spread in all directions of the universe. It's a very, very, very great incident, because he was Hindu. He was a great devotee of the Lord. And he was the ideal emperor, ruling the whole earth planet. He was a very powerful king. He was a descendant of the Pandavas. Pandavas were pure devotees of Krishna. So was Pariksit, the grandson of Arjuna, also a pure devotee of Krishna. So, when such a great personality dies, when such a great personality decides to renounce his kingdom, it is not a small incident. It even is important for the great personalities living in higher planets. The personalities of the higher planets know the aim of life is to purify oneself.

#### pilgrimage, purification, Srimad Bhagavatam

**Verse References:** SB 1.19.8
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The absolute truth is the personality of Godhead Krishna and this can be realized only by those who follow the process of pure devotional service."
**Summary:** This segment explains why great sages visited Pariksit Maharaj, emphasizing their ability to purify places and their interest in hearing the Srimad Bhagavatam from Shukadeva Goswami.

And to prepare oneself to go back to Godhead. All the great personalities know this, but they are unable to themselves engage in a specific activity for complete 100% purification, because among them, different sages have different understanding of what is the best means for attaining the absolute truth. Because to understand what is the absolute truth is not at all easy if one simply studies the Vedas. It becomes different kinds of spiritual practices. The absolute truth is the personality of Godhead Krishna and this can be realized only by those who follow the process of pure devotional service. Such pure devotees are very, very, very rare in this whole universe, including the upper planets, including Brahma Loka, Mahar Loka, Jana Loka, Tapo Loka, including the heavenly planets. It is very rare to find a 100% pure devotee like Pariksit Maharaj, or it is very rare to find a 100% pure devotee like Shukadev Goswami. So when they receive news, Pariksit Maharaj is preparing to quit his body, they actually came to meet Pariksit Maharaj. But when they were asked, where are you going? Where are you traveling? They made an excuse that we are going to a holy place to take a bath to become purified. But what is their qualification? They themselves are personalities who can purify a place by their presence. They don't require to become purified. Neither they require to take a bath in a holy place. No. So the significance of such great personalities visiting a holy place is also described by Prabhupada. The places of pilgrimage become overburdened with the sins of common people. The common people go to a place of pilgrimage, take a bath, and they leave behind all their sinful reactions. So as millions of people go, let's say, a Kumbha Mela, so many millions of people go there to purify themselves by taking a bath at the auspicious time in the holy place of Prayag, Prayag Raj. So they leave behind all their sinful reactions. The holy places become overburdened with these sinful reactions of common people. But when such sages who are very, very powerful personalities, they visit overburdened places of pilgrimage, they sanctify the holy places by their mere presence. So the sages who came there, they were not interested in their own purification. They were already pure, but they came there to meet Maharaj Pariksit who was a great personality. Now they could foresee, Prabhupada says, that the Srimad Bhagavatam would be spoken by Shukadeva Goswami. Therefore they came there to hear the Bhagavatam spoken by Shukadeva Goswami, which was going to be spoken by Shukadeva Goswami to Maharaj Pariksit. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the weaknesses that even great personalities can exhibit due to material influence, emphasizing the importance of rectifying mistakes and avoiding bad association.

kidnapped. See even among great personalities, there is some weakness of enviousness, weakness of greed, weakness of pride. This is the nature of material existence you should understand. So, briefly Prabhupada is describing, he was born prematurely, Chavana is one of the six sons of his father Bhrigu Muni, great personalities, because of their practicing severe austerities, diligently studying the Vedic literature, cultivating spiritual knowledge, and living a very austere life, teaching this most important branch of knowledge, which is spiritual knowledge, Atmavidya, to other aspiring students, all these great works are done by these great sages. But, not all of them are always in this material world, living a pure life, sometimes overcome by some bad influence, or overcome by some weakness of the heart, they may make some mistake, they may commit some mistake. But, because they are great personalities, they immediately take steps to rectify their mistakes. That's the difference between great personalities and ordinary people. So, we should never show them disrespect, or ignore them, or neglect them, just because they commit a mistake, or they have done something wrong in the past because of some weakness, or because of being influenced by the overwhelming, overpowering material energy. So, it's a lesson for us, of course, we are very very ordinary persons compared to such great personalities. So, we are constantly subject to the influence of this most powerful material energy. And we often practice this in ourouls. So, we are constantly subject to the influence of this most powerful material energy. And we are prone to make mistakes again and again and again and again.

He explained how air, fire, water and earth are generated from ether. At the beginning of the creation, there is only the material energy in the inactive state. So when material energy is activated by the glance of Maha Vishnu, then material energy becomes activated and first of all there is a trap. He explains this and says that the will of the Father is an intensity of energy and there is a trap. So when material energy is activated by the glance of Maha Vishnu then material energy becomes transformation of Pradhana to Mahatatva. Mahatatva is the active principle of the material energy that Mahatatva transforms into false ego and false ego transforms into other elements like that how these elements get transformed and generated from one element another element is generated.

**Key Quote:** "Vasishta is the great celebrated sage among the brahmanas, well known as the Brahma Rishi."
**Summary:** This segment explains the different types of Rishis, focusing on Vasishta as a Brahma Rishi, and discusses the vast durations of the Yugas and the lifespans of great sages.

The historical details about the great sages, their personality, how they are such great personalities themselves. Vasishta. Vasishta is the great celebrated sage among the brahmanas, well known as the Brahma Rishi. Rishi means a sage. There are different kinds of rishis. Brahma rishi is a sage among the brahmanas. A deva rishi is a sage among the devatas, devas. Narada is a deva rishi. Vasishta is a Brahma rishi. Pariksit is a Raja rishi. He is a sage amongst great kings. Raja rishi. So like Pariksit is a Raja rishi, Narada is a deva rishi, Vasishta is a Brahma rishi. Now Vasishta is a prominent figure in both the Ramayana and Mahabharata periods. You should remember Ramayana is in Treta Yuga, historical narration of a history of the great incarnation of the Supreme Lord, Lord Rama. Mahabharata is the history of the Pandavas and Kauravas during the Dwapar Yuga, a later age. But still, such personalities as Brahma, Shiva, Vasishta, Bhrgumuni, they all live beyond the duration of one Yuga. A Yuga itself, this Kali Yuga, lasts 432,000 years according to the calculation of time on the Earth planet. So they live beyond even the four Yugas put together. The four Yugas, put together Sathya, Treta, Dwapara, Kali, each previous Yuga to the Kali Yuga is two times, three times, four times the duration of Kali Yuga.

**Summary:** This segment continues the discussion on the duration of Yugas and the lifespan of great sages, emphasizing their presence in Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Puranas, and their residence in the upper planets.

So the sum total of the four Yugas duration, Sathya, Treta, Dwapara, Kali, is 43 lakhs of years. 43 lakhs of years. That's 4 million, some 320,000 years. Millions of years. So even beyond that they live. They are all residents of the upper planets, where these planets are not destroyed at the end of Brahma's day. They live even beyond one day of Brahma. One day of Brahma is 1000 cycles of the four Yugas on the Earth planet. So they live beyond all this. So these great personalities, they appear in descriptions of the incidents in Ramayana. They appear in the descriptions of the incidents in Mahabharata. They appear in the descriptions of the Puranas. The Puranas are very ancient histories. They go back to the beginning of creation. They go back to the previous day of Brahma. Like that. So Vasishta Rishi is a prominent figure in both the Ramayana and Mahabharata periods. He celebrated the coronation ceremony of the personality of God Sri Rama.

**Summary:** This segment narrates the story of Lord Rama's exile, focusing on Kaikeyi's boons and Dasharatha's heartbreak.

Mahabharata periods, he celebrated the coronation ceremony of the personality of God Sri Rama. If you remember the description in Ramayana, Lord Rama appeared as a son of Dasharatha and one of the queens of Dasharatha, Kausalya, was his mother. So Rama was about to be enthroned. He was the eldest son of Dasharatha. He was about to be enthroned as the next king of Ayodhya, succeeding Dasharatha Maharaj. But the day before the coronation, Dasharatha's youngest queen, Kaikeyi, she asked him for two boons which he had promised to give her earlier. So the boon she asked, which Dasharatha had promised to fulfill, she asked that her son be coronated as the king of Ayodhya and not Rama. So Dasharatha had agreed to give her this boon, and every mother wants her own son to be the king. Okay. He agreed for that. But the second boon she asked was very, very, very heartbreaking. It shattered the heart of Dasharatha. The second boon she asked is not only that my son should be coronated as the king in place of Rama, but Rama should be in exile for 14 years from today, so that her son can establish himself as the king without any opposition from Rama.

**Summary:** This segment continues the Ramayana story, highlighting Rama's agreement to exile, Bharata's refusal to rule, and Rama's eventual coronation, also mentioning Vasishta's presence in Kurukshetra.

This was Kaikeyi's opinion. This was Kaikeyi's calculation. So Dasharatha was completely heartbroken. But nevertheless, he lived up to his promise. And when Rama came and inquired from Dasharatha, what is the cause for his grief, the day before his coronation, when Dasharatha said, I have given such a boon to Kaikeyi, two boons, and she's asking these two things. Rama readily agreed to keep the promise of his father intact. He readily agreed to Bharata, his younger stepbrother, being coronated as the king of Ayodhya to succeed Dasharatha. And he agreed to go to the forest and live in exile for 14 years, to keep his father's promise intact. This is the ideal son of his great father. So later on, after 14 years, when he came back, Bharata, of course, did not want to be the king. And he would not accept the position of the king of Ayodhya. He ruled on behalf of Rama. And when Rama returned after exile, he handed over charge of ruling the kingdom to Rama. Rama was coronated as the king of Ayodhya after he returned from exile. And Vasishta was present in that coronation ceremony of Lord Rama. He was also present on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. After Treta Yuga, the Dwapara Yuga began and towards the end of Dwapara Yuga there was the battle of Kurukshetra. So Vasishta was present during the battle of Kurukshetra.

**Summary:** This segment discusses Vasishta's greatness and long lifespan, acknowledging the weaknesses of even great sages, and emphasizing the rarity of pure devotees.

He could approach all the higher and lower planets and his name is also connected to the history of Hiranyakashipu. Hiranyakashipu was in Sakhi Yuga. So this Vasishta is a very, very great personality and he has a very, very long duration of life. All these sages, great sages, they have a very long duration of life. There was a great tension between him, that is Vasishta, and Vishwamitra. There was a quarrel between Vasishta and Shabu. As I said in the previous session, they are great personalities, Vasishta, Vishwamitra, Bhrigu Muni, Bharadwaja, but they do have some weakness. They do have some weakness. Now as I said earlier and repeating, because of their weakness we should not disrespect them or we should not look down upon them. You should understand that this material world is a very, very difficult place to live and to find somebody who is spotless in character, who is completely free from all defects and weaknesses is extremely rare. And who is such a personality, who is completely free from all defects? It is, one is the Supreme Lord himself, who is eternally pure, eternally full of all good qualities, and his pure devotees like Narada, the Pandavas, Pariksit Maharaj, Shukadeva Goswami. So these personalities who are pure devotees are very, very, very, very, very rare.

It says that among the millions and billions of liberated souls and perfected beings, it is very, very rare to find one pure devotee of the Supreme Lord Narayana. That is what the Bhagavatam says. So don't think that it is very easy to find a pure devotee in the entire universe. In the entire universe it is difficult to find a pure devotee. So given that kind of knowledge, understanding, we can just imagine how we are fortunate to come in touch with Srila Prabhupada, the pure devotee in our age, our time. Very, very rare, such pure devotees on the level of Narada, Shukadeva Goswami, the Pandavas, Pariksit Maharaj.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the greatness of personalities like Vasishta, despite their imperfections, and narrates the story of the quarrel between Vasishta and Vishwamitra over the Kamadhenu cow.

On their level, to find a pure devotee is very, very difficult. Nevertheless, those who are not pure devotees but are very, very great personalities compared to common people, compared to even the Devatas, just like Vasishta Rishi. He is a very, very great personality, though he is not 100% free from all defects still. Because of some weakness, there was a quarrel between Vasishta and Vishwamitra. What happened? Vasishta had one wish-fulfilling cow called Kamadhenu. And Vishwamitra while visiting Vasishta noticed that Vasishta has that Kamadhenu. So he wanted that Kamadhenu. Vasishta Muni refused to spare his Kamadhenu. And Vishwamitra, he killed 100 sons of Vasishta because Vasishta refused to give him the Kamadhenu, because Vishwamitra was a powerful king. So like this, there was some quarrel between them. But both of them nevertheless are great personalities. They have their own greatness, great qualities in themselves. So we will discuss more in the next session.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of Parikshit Maharaj's preparation for death and emphasizes the importance of Krishna consciousness for attaining eternal life.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet Om Namah Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam In this session, we will continue to discuss from the same two verses, verses 9 and 10 of the 19th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. These two verses list the names of some of the great sages who were visiting the place where Pariksit Maharaj decided to sit down on the bank of the river Ganga and fast unto death, preparing himself for quitting the body in one week's time. So these great saintly persons from the upper planets of the universe, they could understand the importance of this event of Pariksit Maharaj quitting his body because he was a first class devotee, a great devotee, pure devotee of the Lord. Therefore, his quitting the body is instructive for everyone all over the universe. That is the greatest test we have to face in life: how to be prepared to quit this body or how to face death in such a way that we don't enter another body, material body. That is the greatest test, but instead, if we are situated in right consciousness, like Parikshit Maharaj was, then we don't take another birth after we leave this body, which is what happens at a time of death. We leave this body, and if we are ready, we are prepared, we are situated in the right consciousness. What is that right consciousness? That is Krishna consciousness, situated in devotional service to Krishna, situated in bhakti, then we straight go to Krishna's personal abode for eternal life full of bliss and knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "But a pure devotee like Parikshit Maharaj has the guarantee that he is going back to Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the position of a pure devotee with that of materially powerful beings, highlighting the devotee's assurance of returning to Godhead.

In association with Krishna. So, that is what the confidential portions of the Vedas describe to us. So, these great personalities, they know how important it is to actually prepare oneself to quit the body, to leave the body at the time of death, in the right consciousness. So, they are anxious, they are eager to learn by witnessing the passing away of such great personality as Parikshit Maharaj. So, by this you can also estimate what is the position of a pure devotee in the entire universe. Parikshit Maharaj, by virtue of his birth in a family of great kings, Kshatriya family, Pandavas, Pandava family, he was entitled to become the emperor of the entire world, this earth planet. But, compared to the position of an emperor of this earth planet, there are many many great personalities or greater personalities in other higher parts of the universe who have much better power, much more power, much better position, much greater duration of life, bodily beauty and facilities for material enjoyment and lot of knowledge. And, they also have a lot of good aristocratic society in which they live, etc. The Devatas, the Rishis, the Siddhas, the Charanas, the Vidyadharas, the Kinnaras and so many different grades of higher beings in the upper planets up to Brahma Loka, but none of them are actually, by virtue of their actual material position, none of them are free from death, none of them are, by virtue of their material position, in a proper situation to face death so that they don't take birth again and go back to godhead. None of them have that assurance simply by virtue of their position as some great devata or great jnani, tapasvi, yogi, brahma rishi, raja rishi, deva rishi, none of them have this assurance or guarantee, but a pure devotee like Parikshit Maharaj has the guarantee that he is going back to godhead.

**Summary:** The speaker outlines the simple method of Krishna consciousness, emphasizing chanting, hearing Srimad Bhagavatam, and following the teachings of Srila Rupa Goswami.

But a pure devotee like Parikshit Maharaj has the guarantee that he is going back to godhead when he quits this body because of his being 100% Krishna conscious before even quitting the body. So therefore, the scriptures say simply practice devotional service, become a pure devotee and go back to godhead at the end of this very life. Scriptures describe you have to wait for millions of births before you even become liberated from material bondage, but a devotee does not endeavor for freedom from material bondage separately like the other practitioners of different other yoga systems or other spiritual recommendations do. A devotee does not endeavor like that. A devotee simply is engaged in devotion, authorized devotional service. What is authorized devotional service in this Kali Yuga? It is to practice chanting and hearing of the name, holy name of Krishna, particularly the Harikrishna Mahamantra and also supplement it with hearing the Srimad Bhagavatam or reading or studying the Srimad Bhagavatam and Bhagavad Gita, associated with devotees, accept the simple principles of sadhana bhakti as taught by Sri La Rupa Goswami, one of our previous acharyas, the direct disciple of Sri Chaitanya Maha Prabhu. Simply accept this easy method of Krishna consciousness and prepare yourself to go back to God. Now let us hear.

**Summary:** The speaker recounts the story of Parikshit Maharaj being cursed and his subsequent decision to renounce his kingdom and prepare for death.

Sri La Prabhupada describing the personality of the great sages, some of the great sages who assembled in that saintly assembly of great persons where Pariksit Maharaj had retired after renouncing his Indian religion, his kingdom in order to prepare himself to go back to godhead at the end of seven days when he was due to die due to a snake bite, due to a curse by the son of a brahmana, a sage Shamika Rishi. Shamika Rishi's son, feeling that his father was insulted by Pariksit, he cursed Pariksit to die within seven days by his snake bite because his father was insulted by Pariksit taking a dead snake and putting it around the shoulder of his father who was sitting in meditation completely in trance, unaware of the external surroundings. So Pariksit accepted the curse because he was an intelligent king. He knew he has to die someday sooner or later. Let me now accept this notice of death which has come of its own accord by higher arrangement of providence or, as devotees understand, by arrangement of Krishna, the Supreme Personality caught in the ultimate controller of providence itself. So let me accept that opportunity that I now have seven days to prepare myself being exclusively dedicated for such preparation by completely renouncing my kingdom, my family, my wealth, my material connections, everything material and simply sitting down on the bank of the Ganga and associating with saintly persons who naturally live in such holy places, themselves being engaged in spiritual activities meant exclusively for self-realization. So let me associate with them, take their good advice and accordingly follow their instructions to prepare myself to attain self-realization. This was Pariksit Maharaj.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces Parashara Muni, describing his lineage and relationship to other prominent sages.

This was Pariksit Maharaj's plan. So yes, at the previous session we heard about Vasishta. Now let us hear about another great sage, Parashara Muni. So it is described by Srila Prabhupada, Parashara Muni was the grandson of Vasishta Muni, sorry we should not talk in the past because these are all great personalities who live a very very long life span, running over several yugas, several thousands of yuga cycles. So Srila Prabhupada says he is the grandson of Vasishta Muni and he is the father of Vyasadeva. All these personalities are still living in the universe. Parashara Muni is the son of Maharshi Shakti and his mother's name was Adrisha. That means he was born in the past but he is still living. He was in the womb of his mother when she was only 12 years old. Those days there was a child marriage. Now child marriage is decried in modern age but actually those days it was understood that child marriage is the most conducive for marriage. It is called as a spiritual advancement.

It is called as a spiritual advancement. Why? Because the parents understand that their children have to be properly established in Grahastha ashrama so that they can live peacefully together without unnecessarily having some distress and so many misunderstandings etc. So two good families they agree to marry their son and daughter and thereby the marriage is fixed when the boy and girl are young, in fact too young, but the actual marriage take place when they come of age and then they are trained up how to live as husband and wife, how to have a nice family, how to cooperate with each other for spiritual advancement and for living harmoniously while in this material body for each other's spiritual benefit. This is the training that is given and such a life is a very

glorious life, human form of life properly utilized. So in the womb of his mother he learned the Vedas and it is described here his father was killed by a demon named Kalmashapada and to avenge this death of his father he wanted to annihilate the whole world because he was a very powerful sage, he could have done that, but he was restrained by his grandfather Vasishta. He then performed a rakshasa killing yagna. He decided, "Oh, I'm not going to destroy the whole world, I'm going to kill these rakshasas who are demons who are meant for simply giving trouble to innocent saintly persons." But Maharshi Pulastya restrained him. You see how this wholesale killing is not at all proper. Somebody has to be punished specifically for the specific mistake or crime or sin he has done, but that punishment should be commensurate with the particular activity. So Parashara Muni is famous for begetting Vyasa Deva. He begot Vyasareva in the womb of one Satyavati. Satyavati later on became the wife of Maharaja Santanu and Satyavati's sons were Vichitravirya and Chitra Virya. Vichitravirya became the emperor of the world after Santanu Maharaja and Vichitravirya's sons were Dhritarashtra, Pandu and Vidura. Vasishta, sorry, I am sorry. Parashara Muni was present also during the time of Bhishma's death. He was also the spiritual master of Maharaj Janaka. He is the author of many Vedic scriptures in sociological directions. So that is about Parashara Muni. I will stop here.

For the description is now being given in the purport by Srila Prabhupada, the description of Vishva Mitra Muni or Rishi, famous personality Vishva Mitra. You would have heard the name many times. So, he is also called as Gadhi Suta, son of Gadhi. So, Srila Prabhupada describes a brief history. This great sage, a great sage of austerity and mystic power, all these sages are famous for having performed severe austerities, and by dint of performing austerities, they acquire mystic power, and that mystic power is extraordinary mystic power which actually ordinary people cannot have.

Now, an adult has more physical strength than a small child, but among different adults, different adults have different degrees of physical strength. Now, when you compare the physical strength of a human being on this earth to the physical strength of a woman heavenly devata, then the devata will have many, many, many times more physical strength than the human beings. Of course, when I say physical strength, the devatas don't have a physical body. I mean the strength, material strength, the bodily strength possessed due to material position. So, devatas have many times more power, more strength, more knowledge, more intelligence, more beauty, more wealth, more facilities, longer duration of life than humans on the earth.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the mystic powers and long lifespans of beings in higher planets, emphasizing that even in Brahma loka, the fear of death and the cycle of birth and death persist.

This is a general description, but there is a gradation. So, the mystic power possessed by great sages who are living in the topmost planets like Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, Satyaloka, the topmost planets in this universe, they have a very, very, very long duration of life. Some of them have a duration of life as much that of Brahma himself. Some live for several kalpas. A kalpa is a day of Brahma, which is 1000 cycle of four yugas on the earth planet. 1000 cycle of four yugas is something like four billion years on the earth. So, there are saintly persons whose duration of life is four billion years. We can't even imagine how long the duration of life they live, but still a long duration of life does not mean that they are free from the material conditions of birth and death, the material miseries of birth and death. That is never absent even in the topmost planet called Brahma loka. So, there is always the fear of death even for Lord Brahma, what to speak of others. So, the duration of life is fantastically long, but still they have to face death, and for that they have to be prepared. So, they are always anxious how to actually leave this body at the time of death so as to be able to go back to Godhead, become free from the repetition of birth and death in this material world.

**Key Quote:** "The way the universe is made is that our necessities are supplied according to the system of sacrifice that is carried out by the different human beings in different parts of this world and different parts of the universe"
**Summary:** The speaker recounts the story of Vishwamitra's quarrel with Vasishta over the Kamadhenu cow, explaining the importance of sacrifice for universal welfare.

He picked a quarrel with Vasishta Muni when he was a Kshatriya king. It is described briefly in the description under Vasishta. You would have heard this in a previous session, that Vasishta was having one kamadhenu, one special cow which would give as much milk as one desires whenever one desires to have milk, that's a kamadhenu. And Vasishta was using that milk given by kamadhenu, the cow, special cow, for his performing daily sacrifice. Sacrifice means one has to offer huge quantities of ghee in a sacrificial fire. Of course, the kind of sacrifice one does, there are varieties of sacrifice one can do as recommended in scriptures. So, if one performs a fire sacrifice, one requires several ingredients of which the most important ingredient for a fire sacrifice is a cow ghee. So, such cow ghee is obtained by taking the milk of a cow and then turning that milk into yogurt or curds, dahi, and churning that dahi to get butter and heating that butter to make it into ghee, wonderful properties and qualities. So, such huge quantities of ghee are required for performing a fire sacrifice, especially the saintly persons, the sages, they perform fire sacrifice for the sake of universal welfare. See, the way the universe is made is that our necessities are supplied according to the system of sacrifice that is carried out by the different human beings in different parts of this world and different parts of the universe. So, the more the sacrifice that is performed, the better the supply of necessities for the different

living entities in this material world by mother nature. So, Vasishta Muni was having the kamadhenu and this Vishwamitra as the king was visiting, was going to the forest, and he happened to come to the ashram of Vasishta Muni, and he was received very nicely by Vasishta Muni, given a grand reception. So, he was curious, how is this saintly person living in the forest able to give me a grand reception? While of course, I am a king, I am very pleased with the reception I have received, but what is the source of wealth by which he has given such a grand reception? So, he found out this, that Vasishtamuni had a kamadhenu. So, when he learned that Vasishtamuni had a kamadhenu, he became very much desirous of getting such a kamadhenu. Now, such kamadhenu is not available anywhere and everywhere. So, he decided that he is going to take away that kamadhenu from Vasishta, and that is how a quarrel began. So, therefore, Srila Prabhupada says he picked up a quarrel with Vasishtamuni when he was a Kshatriya king because Vasishtamuni, he requires that cow for his sacrifice, but this Vishwamitra forcibly took it away, and then there was a big fight and so many things happened, and some details are given elsewhere, but it is just mentioned that when he realized his mistake, Vishwamitra then he decided to retire from his kingly position.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Vishwamitra's severe austerities, his failure to control his senses leading to the birth of Shakuntala, and Indra's attempt to distract him with Menaka.

And he decided to perform austerities to purify himself of all the reactions. So, he began very severe austerities and he also performed a great sacrifice in cooperation with Matangamuni and thus was able to vanquish the sons of Vasishta. He became a great yogi and yet, he failed to check his senses and thus was obliged to become the father of Shakuntala, the beauty queen of world history. So, he actually fathered a child, Shakuntala daughter, who was raised by one Kanva Rishi, when Indra sent Menaka from the heavenly planet, from Apsara, to distract this Vishwamitra Rishi when he was performing severe tapasya, because Indra is afraid of somebody else taking away his position as the king of heaven. So, when somebody is performing tapasya to accumulate Punya, they automatically accumulate Punya when they perform tapasya. So, Indra is afraid that somebody else will exceed his Punya, Indra's Punya and take away his position. So, he tries to distract them from performing tapasya. So, he sends this Apsaras who will entice such saintly persons or sages to give up their performing the tapasya and simply enjoy life with the Apsara. So, Menaka came and Vishwamitra did get distracted by Menaka and later on he realized that he was distracted because of Menaka's enticing him and he gave up Menaka and Menaka's company and continued his tapasya.

Vishwamitra was defeated by the spiritual strength of Vasishtha. Thus, Vishwamitra decided to become a brahmana and before becoming a brahmana, he underwent severe austerity on the bank of Kaushika.

**Key Quote:** "So from his mind Narada is born and Angira is also a Rishi who is born from Brahma's mind."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the roles of Vishnu and Brahma in creation, and introduces Angira Rishi and his connection to Brahma and Brihaspati.

We are discussing the different sages who visited Pariksit Maharaj's temple. So, these are the verses. Pariksit Maharaj's... These are some of the six Tiya. Here she goes. universe at the beginning of creation so brahma is born on a lotus flower that emanates from Garbhodakashayi Vishnu Padmanabha. Vishnu Padmanabha, he is called Padmanabha. This Vishnu is called Padmanabha because from his navel one lotus flower comes out and on that lotus flower Brahma is born. So, Brahma is also called Padmaja, one who is born on a lotus flower. He is the first created being. He is created directly by Vishnu because at the beginning of creation there is no one else other than Vishnu in this material world. Of course, in the spiritual world which is eternal, Supreme Lord and all his expansions, his devotees, eternal devotees, everyone is there always, but in the material world it is always created by Vishnu. So, Brahma is also called Padmanabha, created, maintained and destroyed. So, at the time of creation first of all Brahma is born among the living beings who have to take birth again because they are not liberated in the previous previous time of destruction of this material world. Those who are not liberated, they are lying in a dormant condition in the material energy, mahat tattva. So, then they are again given birth, given bodies, given birth means given bodies by the arrangement of the Supreme Lord called creation. So, creation two things happen. One is creating the material diversities or the varieties from the material energy in terms of the elements, earth, water, fire, air, sky and then the different planets and the varieties of living conditions on the planets, the rivers, the mountains, the forests, etc, etc, all that. All the places of inhabitation of the living entities have to be first created. And that is done by Garbhodakashayi Vishnu. He creates the different diversities in this material world. Then Brahma is born from Vishnu and Brahma creates the first of the different state, the Prajapatis from his mind, from his different parts of the body. So from his mind Narada is born and Angira is also a Rishi who is born from Brahma's mind. So therefore Angira Rishi is described as Manasa Putra, mental son of Brahma at the beginning of creation and Narada is another Manasa Putra, the son of Brahma. And Angira is also described as the father of Brihaspati, the great learned priest of the demigods in the heavenly planets. Brihaspati is another great sage. He is the learned priest of the Devatas that means he advises the king of heaven Indra on all religious matters, spiritual matters. He advises King Indra as well as the Devatas. Angira was born of the

Utatya and Sambhartha are his sons, Angira's sons. It is said that Angira Rishi is still performing austerity and chanting the holy name of the Lord at a place known as Alokananda on the bank of the Ganges, especially in the Himalayas. There are crores of holy places. How many? Crores of holy places. Koti, Koti, Koti. In fact, it is not an exaggeration if we say every spot in the Himalayas is actually a holy place. That is the significance of the Himalayan mountains. That is why this tract of land which is having Himalayas to the north and ocean or seas on the three other sides is actually a very special tract of land. It is a very special tract of land. It is the most holy land on the entire earth planet. This what we now call as India, the most holy place. And among the different holy places, maximum number of holy places are concentrated in the Himalayan mountains. So in those Himalayan mountains, there are many many many millions and billions of saintly persons. Most of them we cannot see with these eyes. We cannot see with these eyes even if you visit the Himalayas because they are present there in subtle body. And what are they doing generally? Saintly persons live in holy places performing spiritual tapasya, spiritual activities, engaged in meditation, engaged in worshipping the Supreme Lord, engaged in chanting the holy name of the Lord, engaged in spiritual activities. That is the purpose of a saintly person residing in a holy place.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces Parashurama, an incarnation of God, and describes his mission to eliminate corrupt Kshatriyas using his axe.

Next there is a description of Parashurama. He is the son of Maharishi Jamadagni and Srimati Renuka. He is also known as Renuka Sutta by his mother's name, Renuka Sutta, the son of Renuka. He is one of the powerful incarnations of God. In the Dasha Avatara Stotra his name is mentioned as one of the Lila Avataras, past time incarnations of the Lord. As a past time what did he do? He killed the Kshatriya community as a whole twenty one times. He went round the earth planet when the earth was overburdened by Kshatriyas who were posing as kings, but they were actually very very puffed up with power and they were not properly ruling in a righteous way. They were exploiting, they were exploiting the citizens. So Parashurama became very angry at these Kshatriyas and he decided to clean up the earth planet, get rid of such Kshatriyas and therefore he killed them completely, almost completely by going round the earth twenty one times. He just had one Parashu. He is called Parashurama. His name is Parashurama, but he is, he is named as Parashurama because there are three Ramas mentioned in the Dashavatarasthotra. All three incarnations are known as Rama, but depending on the specific quality or characteristic they are distinguished. The first Rama mentioned is Parashurama, the son of Maharshi Jamadagni and Renuka. He is having a, a weapon called Parashu. Parashu means an axe. Axe as a weapon. With that one Parashu, one axe, he went round simply chopping off the heads of all these miscreant Kshatriyas. He went round the world and simply killed all these Kshatriyas. So he is called Parashurama.

With that plough once Balarama when he was insulted by the Kurus, Kauravas, then he decided to teach them a lesson by using his plough. He decided to chip off the Hastinapura City with the Kshatriyas, with the Kauravas and put, drown that in the Yamuna River. So when he just began to carve out this tract of land called Hastinapura then the Kauravas realized their mistake and they went to him and begged forgiveness and immediately he forgave them and he restored that land back in its place.

**Key Quote:** "So in order to teach us that killing is not good so he himself underwent severe austerities in order to free himself from the sin of killing."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes the discussion on Parashurama, explaining that despite his divine status, he performed austerities to teach the importance of non-violence, and that being killed by the Lord leads to liberation.

So this Parshurama, he killed the Kshatriya community as old 21 times. With the blood of the Kshatriyas he pleased the souls of his forefathers. Later on this is at the Mahendra Parvata because he wanted to teach, even though his killing the Kshatriya was justified, but still the killing business is very very sinful activity. Killing is sinful. So in order to teach us that killing is not good, so he himself underwent severe austerities in order to free himself from the sin of killing so many millions of Kshatriyas. Actually there is no sin on his part because he himself is the incarnational Supreme Lord. So there is no sin because whoever he kills will be liberated, will be purified. Being killed by God one becomes liberated, purified of all sinful reactions. So there is no sin on the part of the Supreme Lord when the Supreme Lord kills any person in this world. So it is a favor done by the Supreme Lord upon a soul, a sinful soul because by killing that sinful soul the Supreme Lord will put an end to that person's sinful activity and also purify him of sinful reactions and also liberate him from this material bondage. So there is more description. We will hear more about Parchurama in another session.

**Key Quote:** "life is a journey so it's a journey we have undertaken in order to reach a final destination"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses life as a journey towards Krishna's personal abode, emphasizing the importance of understanding death and fixing our destination in the spiritual realm.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Jai Vanarottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udhirayet. In this session, we will be discussing the 9th and 10th verses of the 19th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is a continuation of the discussion of the same two verses which we have done in the past five sessions. We completed part 5 of the discussion of these two verses because it is a long purport. So, this session will be part 6 of these two verses which we will be discussing. These two verses are listing the great sages who arrived from different parts of the universe to witness the great emperor Mahabhagavata, pure devotee Parikshit Maharaj, put his body in perfect Krishna consciousness. So, this quitting the body, which means when death comes, we have to leave the body. We means each one of us is spirit, spirit soul. So, we have to leave the body and we have to leave this body. So, one in knowledge is able to face death perfectly by understanding that time has come to leave this body and move on. So, in that sense, life is a journey, so it's a journey we have undertaken in order to reach a final destination, just like you travel, whenever you travel, you have a certain destination you want to reach. Exactly like that, if life is understood to be a journey, then our destination should be Krishna's personal abode. In the Bhagavad-Gita, and several places including the verse I just cited, Krishna says his abode, personal abode, is such a place having gone where we will never come back to this material world. So, ultimately liberation means to fix our destination as Krishna's personal abode and travel this spiritual path which leads us to that specific destination, Krishna Krishna Krishna dhama, Goloka dhama.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the suffering inherent in material existence with the blissful nature of the spiritual world, highlighting the cycle of birth, death, disease, and old age in the material realm.

There are so many different planets in the material world and in the spiritual world, but of all the places, none of the planets in the material world, even though some of them belonging to the upper planetary system have millions of times better material facilities than what we have on the earth, none of them are suitable for a person who knows the nature of material existence, that he can be omnipresent. The existence of the known meaning is not only the ability of the existence of users of man and species, no matter the age, even if you might say that biology numbers are repeated, what can be said about personality or aspiration is simply this is a wise to deadly list of material existences. Material life means, material existence means, anudarshanam, repeatedly we experience these four things, whether Brahmaloka or Maharloka or some Tapoloka, Siddhaloka, Bhuloka, Patarloka, every place in this material creation, in this material universe, in this material world, is a place of repeated birth, disease, old age and death, whereas the spiritual world is that place where there is no misery, no birth, no death, no disease, no old age, no suffering, no scarcity, no deterioration.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam reveal our connection to Krishna's abode and encourages us to strive to return there, using Parikshit Maharaj as an example.

So, wonderful characteristics of the spiritual planets is given in the confidential portions of the Vedic literature. So, of all the confidential portions of the Vedic literature, the most important ones are two particular scriptures, Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam. So, in both these literatures, it is very elaborately and clearly explained that we belong to Krishna's personal abode, and we belong to the physical world. We are connected to Krishna in loving devotion. Having forgotten, we have somehow come to this material world and now let us get out by making that spiritual abode, our personal abode of Krishna, my destination, Goloka dhama, pursuing the dhama. And the great personalities of the Bhagavatam, they show us the way we should prepare ourselves just like Parikshit is preparing.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of learning from great sages and engaging in devotional service (sadhana bhakthi) as taught by the Acharyas to perfect the process of quitting the body and going to Krishna's abode.

And lessons of the Bhagavatam are applicable to even the great sages, such great personalities, that there are sages who are millions of times more powerful in terms of mystic power. They are learned, they studied the Vedas, they are engaged in severe austerities, they have a long duration of life, they have millions of times better facilities on the upper planets than what we have on the earth, but still they also know that when time comes to quit the body, we should be prepared to leave this body and straight go to Krishna's personal abode. Now, how does it happen? We have to learn from those who have perfected the process of quitting this body and going to Krishna's abode. So, Parikshit Maharaj is one of the best examples of the perfect person who prepared himself simply by hearing Bhagavatam. So, now that you are engaged in hearing Bhagavatam, this is the perfect process. So, all activities of sadhana bhakthi centered around devotional services to Krishna, in particular, method of rendering service as taught by the

**Key Quote:** "Parshurama actually is one of the powerful incarnations of the Supreme Lord who destroyed the ruling class the miscreant Kshatriyas who were actually not ruling according to the religious principles"
**Summary:** The speaker begins to discuss Parshurama, a powerful incarnation of the Supreme Lord who destroyed miscreant Kshatriyas and underwent penance, highlighting the significance of his actions.

Acharyas of our time, we have to follow in their footsteps. So, we were discussing about Parshurama. So, some more details about Parshurama, the great sage, we had heard how Parshurama actually is one of the powerful incarnations of the Supreme Lord who destroyed the ruling class, the miscreant Kshatriyas who were actually not ruling according to the religious principles. So, he went round the entire earth planet 21 times to kill all these miscreant Kshatriyas. So, after doing that, he underwent six severe penances at the Mahendra Parvatha. Even now this place is there near Mangalore, between Mangalore and Udupi, Mahendra Parvatha, the spot where Parshurama sat and did penance is even now there, there is a temple there. And why did he undergo this penance? To teach us that ultimately the killing business is not a very good business, even though Lord Parshurama is justified, but as a saintly person it is not his business to do this killing, but the killing is also good for those who are the miscreant Kshatriyas, that when they are killed to bring a eternal life and death coming to them can feel good.

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "the Supreme Lord's mercy upon them is shown when the Lord kills them purifies them and actually liberates them from sinful reactions"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Parshurama's actions, though involving killing, were acts of mercy that purified and liberated the miscreants from their sinful reactions.

By the Supreme Lord or his incarnation or his pure devotee, then the person who is killed actually becomes purified of all sinful reactions because they are miscreants, they have done so many sinful activities, but the Supreme Lord's mercy upon them is shown when the Lord kills them, purifies them, and actually liberates them from sinful reactions. So, therefore, Parshurama's action is never to be mistaken to be some kind of sinful activity he is doing, no, but in order to teach us that this killing business is not very good like a ordinary person, at the end of his life he may undergo severe austerity to atone for his sins committed in the past. Similarly, Parshurama underwent severe penances at the Mahindra Parvatha and after taking the whole earth from the Kshatriyas, he gave it in charity to Kashyapa Muni. He freed the earth from the misrule, misconduct of the twin Kshatriyas and gave it away to Kashyapa Muni. Actually, the earth planet, not only earth planet, the entire creation belongs to the Supreme Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses how everything belongs to Krishna and how devotees take responsibility to guide others, mentioning Parshurama giving the earth in charity and instructing Dronacharya in military science.

Everything belongs to Krishna, but on behalf of Krishna, they take responsibility of carrying out their duties of guiding the people how to live in this world, how to maintain oneself with the minimum needs of the body, at the same time cultivate Krishna consciousness and prepare oneself to ultimately go back to Godhead. So, Parashurama is instructing us by performing the severe penances and after he has become free from all reactions by the atonement through the recommended method of this shastra, he gave away the earth planet because he had conquered. He is the rightful owner. But he gave it away to Kashyapa Muni. Next, it is said Parashurama instructed the Dhanurveda or the science of fighting to Dronacharya because Dronacharya happened to be a Brahmana. Parashurama was a Brahmana, he was a teacher. Because he was expert in military science, he taught that military science to Dronacharya. And Dronacharya is described in the Mahabharata as, Parshurama said to Dronacharya,

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Parshurama's presence at Yudhishthira's coronation and emphasizes the importance of righteous leaders following Krishna's instructions for the benefit of the world.

In this session we continue to discuss from the 9th and 10th verses of the 19th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. We were discussing in the previous session about Parshurama. So Parshurama has been described as a brahmana who was expert in the military science, Dhanurveda. Therefore he taught that military science to Dronacharya who further instructed that military science to the Pandavas and Kauravas. So it is described Parshurama was present during the coronation of Mahabharata, Maharaja Yudhishthira, and he celebrated the function along with other great rishis. The saintly persons know very well that the Pandavas are the righteous persons to rule the world, not the Kauravas, especially Duryodhana. It is described in the Bhagavad Gita, He was wicked, crooked minded, evil minded. So he was not the fit person to rule Duryodhana. So therefore the Pandavas, in order to obey the instructions of Krishna that righteous people should rule this world, then only the people will be guided properly and will actually rule this world. They will actually benefit from the rule of such righteous persons like Maharaja Yudhishthira. So Parshurama celebrated the function of coronation of Maharaja Yudhishthira after the battle of Kurukshetra along with other great sages.

#### time scales, respect for devotees, Krishna's perspective

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna says you should respect them more than what respect you offer to me."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the different time scales on different planets and emphasizes the importance of respecting Krishna's devotees, even more than Krishna himself.

The sages are always there to advise, instruct, guide the Kshatriya kings. Now Srila Prabhupada says, Parshurama is so old that he met both Rama and Krishna at different times. He is a very, very old personality. Several millions of years they lived, because their time scale is different from the time scale that we are subject to on this earth planet. To give an example, Brahma's one day consists of a day and a night. A complete cycle of a day and a night of Brahma is something like two thousand cycles of our four yugas. That is Brahma's day and night. So that comes to some 8 billions of years. So 8 billions of years is Brahma's just one day and night. So the time scale on different planets is different than the time scale of Brahma. The time scale of different planets is different. So, Parashurama is a resident of a higher planet. So, he doesn't, his body doesn't follow the time cycle, time scale of this earth planet. So, his life span will be very, very, very, very long. It is described that he fought with Rama, that is Lord Ramachandra, but he accepted Krishna as a Supreme Personality of Godhead. He also praised Arjuna when he saw Arjuna with Krishna, because Arjuna is a celebrated devotee of Krishna. If Krishna is respected as a Supreme Personality of Godhead, definitely one must also offer respect to Krishna, respect to Krishna's pure devotees like Arjuna. Because if somebody commits an offense at Krishna's lotus feet, one may beg forgiveness from Krishna and Krishna will pardon very easily. But if somebody offends Krishna's pure devotee, Krishna will never forgive, never pardon. Even if you ask Krishna forgiveness, Krishna will not pardon. So, therefore, it is very important to respect not only Krishna, but Krishna's pure devotees also, and they should be offered as much respect as we offer to Krishna. In fact, Krishna says the opposite. He says, as far as my devotees are concerned, you should not just respect them as much as you respect me. Krishna says you should respect them more than what respect you offer to me.

**Key Quote:** "My devotee is more worshipable than me."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's statement that His devotees are more worshipable than Him and highlights the exalted position of the spiritual master and Parshurama's glorification of Arjuna.

Krishna says in the eleventh category of Bhagavatam while instructing Uddhava, madbhakta puja abhyadhika. What does it mean? My devotee is more worshipable than me. So Krishna is thoroughly pleased if we worship Krishna's devotee and show respect more than what we show to Krishna. Of course, one should not do that, that you disrespect Krishna or show some disregard to Krishna. It should never be done. But nevertheless, a devotee should be respected. Devotee should be respected at least as much as we offer respect to Krishna, because Krishna is supremely worshipable, a devotee is also supremely worshipable. A pure devotee of Krishna is more worshipable than all the demigods put together. In the eleventh canto, Krishna says, acharya mambhijaniya sarva-devamayo guruhu. That is spiritual master is described as acharya and guru in this particular verse, and Krishna says, the acharya or the spiritual, bona fide spiritual master is non-different from me, and he is to be respected as the sum total of all the demigods. So he is very, very exalted position. So Parshurama actually glorified Arjuna. He not only glorified Krishna, but he also glorified Arjuna, the pure devotee of Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "So then both of them fought very severely, Bhishma and Parshurama."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Amba, Bhishma, and Parshurama, focusing on Bhishma's refusal to marry Amba due to his vow of celibacy and the subsequent battle between Bhishma and Parshurama.

Then further Srila Prabhupada says, when Bhishma refused to marry Amba, who wanted him to become her husband, Amba met Parshurama. See the history is given in the Mahabharata that Bhishma wanted to arrange the marriage of his step-brother, Vijitravirya. So in order to get a suitable princess to marry this prince, Vijitravirya, the son of Satyavati and Shantanu, so Bhishma arranged that he went to some place where some princesses were about to be married, and he kidnapped them and brought them to be married to Vijitravirya. Of the three princesses, Amba, Ambika and Ambalika, two of them were married to Vijitravirya. But Amba refused to marry Vijitravirya. Amba's argument was that Bhishma has kidnapped her. So she wanted to marry Bhishma. But Bhishma refused to marry Amba because he had taken a vow that he is going to remain a Brahmachari, a celibate, rest of his life. So he refused to marry Amba. And then Amba insisted that she is not going to marry Vijitravirya, that is Bhishma's stepbrother, but she only wants to marry Bhishma. So when Bhishma refused, then Amba went to Parshurama and requested him to force Bhishma to marry her. So then Parshurama asked Bhishma, you should marry Amba because she has been kidnapped by you, and then as a chaste woman, she will not accept anybody else as her husband other than the one who has kidnapped her. So when Bhishma refused to obey the order of Parshurama, because Bhishma had learned the military science from Parshurama, so Parshurama was one of the gurus of Bhishma, spiritual masters. So Parshurama, as the spiritual master, he ordered Bhishma, you should marry Amba. But Bhishma refused because he had taken a vow of celibacy. So then both of them fought very severely, Bhishma and Parshurama. And at last Parshurama was pleased with Bhishma because Bhishma fought very valiantly and he was the disciple. So the teacher is thoroughly pleased when the disciple, having learned the military science, actually displaced the courage, valour and the skill in fighting to the teacher. Then Bhishma, when Parshurama was pleased with Bhishma, then he gave Bhishma the benediction of becoming the greatest fighter in the entire world. During this time, Bhishma was the greatest warrior.

#### Utatya's story, Varuna's offense, misuse of mystic power

**Key Quote:** "Varuna, in order to satisfy his own desire to enjoy that beautiful woman, he kidnapped this wife of the great sage Uthathya, and to retaliate this offense of Varuna, Uthathya, he drank all the water of the world."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts the story of Utatya, his wife Bhadra, and Varuna, highlighting Varuna's offense of kidnapping Bhadra and Utatya's reaction of drinking all the water in the world, questioning the proper use of mystic power.

So that much about Parshurama. Then the next sage being described here is Utatya, one of the three sons of Maharshi Angira. He was a spiritual master of Maharaj Mandhata. He married Bhadra, the daughter of Soma or the moon god. Varuna kidnapped his wife, and he made her the wife of Maharaja and her son. Varuna said to him, Lord, you know, I am a great warrior but you will not be able to match me in this game, or I will not be able to match your mother, so I will not be able to match your father. You will not be able to match my mother. After all, the daughter of Soma was very beautiful. Varuna, the daughter of Maharshi Angira, did not know who she was. However, Varuna, in order to satisfy his own desire to enjoy that beautiful woman, he kidnapped this wife of the great sage Uthathya, and to retaliate this offense of Varuna, Uthathya, he drank all the water of the world. Varuna is the controller of water bodies, but the water bodies on this earth planet were completely emptied by this Uthathya. They have so much of mystic power, yogic power, by their severe austerities, but sometimes they don't use it properly. This is not a proper use of the mystic power to take revenge against another devata, because that devata did some mistake. So, like this, there is sometimes some altercation or some quarrel or some kind of, later on, things are settled by the superiors of these personalities. Sometimes Brahma intervenes, sometimes Shiva intervenes, sometimes Vishnu himself intervenes. When the devatas were supposed to be ideal in their character and behavior, and they are controlled in their senses, and they carry out the administration on behalf of Vishnu, they are empowered personalities to rule the world, the creation, the whole universe, but sometimes they are carried away by the influence of one of the gunas, the lower modes, Rajoguna, Tamoguna.

**Key Quote:** "So the demoniac qualities are described in 16th chapter of Bhagavad Gita so you can study those demoniac qualities they never listen to others"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how even devatas and great sages can make mistakes and be corrected by superiors, contrasting this with the incorrigible nature of demons who can only be purified through being killed by the Lord or His devotees.

And that is when the intervention of the elderly personalities is actually meant to correct these mistakes that even such a devata or great sages do. And when they're corrected, of course, they become, they come to their senses and they access to the human body, their fault and they stand corrected. But the demons, they never can be corrected. They can never be collected because their demonic mentality is such that they never think they are wrong and they don't care for the superior instructions of greater personalities, of great sages or saintly persons or Vishnu himself. They don't listen to others. They're too proud, they're too puffed up, they're too arrogant. So the demoniac qualities are described in 16th chapter of Bhagavad Gita. So you can study those demoniac qualities. They never listen to others. They are never remorseful about the mistakes they do or the sins they come to. It so therefore sometimes the only way they can be purified is when the Supreme Lord or his pure devotee or an incarnation of the Lord kills them and purifies them. That's the only way they can be purified. So I'll stop here, thank you.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how following the Vanashrama Dharma leads to gradual elevation through different planetary systems, contrasting it with the direct path of Bhakti Yoga.

This Kanvamuni brought up Shakuntala in the forest. And Shakuntala was left behind by Menaka.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the direct path of Bhakti Yoga, which leads to immediate liberation, with other gradual processes like Jnana, Karma, and various Yoga systems, emphasizing the importance of a spiritual master.

This is step-by-step elevation. But the Bhakti Yoga process is directly go back to Godhead by completely concentrating one's attention on Krishna alone. This is explained by Krishna in the 8th chapter, that one who remembers me alone at the time of death, such a person when he quits the body, he directly attains shelter at my lotus feet in my personal abode. He is directly transformed to Krishna's personal abode. So, those who don't know about this Bhakti Yoga process, or those who are not having the guidance of the spiritual master or master as the laity, master who is expert in Bhakti Yoga, such people have to follow the gradual process of elevation, the other process of Jnana, Karma, Ashtanga Yoga, Hatha Yoga, so many other, Sankhi Yoga, so many other yoga systems are there for the gradual process of elevation.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the significance of Gautama Rishi as one of the Saptarishis and clarifies the two types of descendants within the Gautama gotra: family descendants (Brahmins) and those in disciplic succession (Kshatriyas and Vaishyas).

Next, Gautama, one of the seven great sages of the universe. In every universe, there is a position of Saptarishis. They are elevated to that post, they have their own planet in the upper part of the universe, Saptarishi Mandala. It's called Saptarishi Mandala. And Gautama Rishi is one of the Saptarishis. Sharadwaan Gautama was one of his sons. Now, Srila Prabhupada clarifies one very important point. Persons in the Gautama gotra today are either his family descendants or in his disciplic succession. Like those in the Vedic culture, they say, to which gotra do you belong? To which lineage? Lineage of ancestors. So, those belonging to Gautama gotra, generally a rishi's name is associated with the gotra. Gotra means this descendant of a particular sage. So, two kinds of descendants: those who are family descendants are the brahmanas. Just like Gautama Rishi, he had his sons and his sons had their sons, their sons, their sons, their sons. Like that in the brahmana lineage, present day brahmanas who are actually Gautama gotra descendants, they are coming from the Gautama Rishi himself as the descendants. And those who are Kshatriyas and Vaishyas who claim to be of Gautama gotra, they generally are having Gautama Rishi as their priest, as their preceptor, as their guide and saintly teacher. So, two kinds of descendants, those in the disciplic succession who follow Gautama Rishi

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Ahalya, the wife of Gautama Rishi, who was molested by Indra and turned into stone, later delivered by Lord Ramachandra, also mentioning Gautama's connection to Kripacharya.

and those who are family descendants, seminal descendants and the descendants who are having the spiritual guidance given by Gautama Rishi. Gautama Rishi was the husband of the famous Ahalya. Ahalya is a personality who was delivered by Rama or Ramachandra. So, it is described here that Ahalya turned into a stone when Indradeva, the king of heaven, molested her. You see, among the devatas, there is always this enviousness because there is so much material desires for enjoyment. Sometimes they become envious. Ahalya was the wife of Gautama Rishi. But because Indra wanted to enjoy with her, because she is a chaste lady, she will refuse to satisfy Indra. This is the instruction in the scriptures that another's wife should be respected on the level of one's mother. So, there is a question of enjoying. So, similarly, Indradeva, he should not have even approached the wife of Gautama Ahalya even though she might have been very beautiful. But he nevertheless approached her. When she refused, he molested her. He forced her. So, then she, by her chastity, she turned into a stone so that Indra could no longer do any more harm to her. And then she was delivered by Rama. When Rama touched her, she was delivered. When Rama was in exile, Ahalya was delivered by Lord Ramachandra. Gautama was the grandfather of Kripacharya who was one of the heroes of the battle of Kurukshetra.

So, later on, Kripacharya actually became the guide for Yudhishthira. There was no enmity as such. They would fight on one side or the other side. There was no enmity actually.

**Key Quote:** "You have to hear from a Self-realized soul. That is the only way and there is no other way."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces Maitreya Rishi as the spiritual master of Vidura, emphasizing the importance of hearing from a self-realized soul to acquire Brahmavidya and highlighting the parampara system of knowledge transmission.

Then the last sage being described here is Maitreya Rishi, a great Rishi of yoga. He was the spiritual master of Vidura. In fact, most of the Bhagavatam, a good portion of the Bhagavatam is describing the conversation between Vidura and Maitreya, which is cited by Shukadeva Goswami. When Shukadeva Goswami was speaking the Bhagavatam to Pariksit Maharaj, to answer some of Pariksit's questions, Shukadeva Goswami would cite a similar question was asked by someone else in the past. This is called parampara system. Nobody has to manufacture any answer for any question. The entire body of spiritual knowledge is descending from Krishna. Krishna first instructed Brahma, Brahma instructed Narada, Narada instructed Vyasa, Vyasa instructed Deja. Shukadeva Goswami and other personalities. So Vidura inquired from Maitreya Rishi when on pilgrimage. He met Maitreya Rishi in Badrikashram. And he inquired from Maitreya Rishi. Of course, Vidura himself is enlightened and learned, pure devotee, Mahabhagavata. He is one of the Mahajanas. But in order to teach us how we have to make inquiries from the right authority, from the right source, we have to acquire this knowledge of the Self, Brahmavidya. You cannot study Brahmavidya or become knowledgeable in the Brahmavidya simply by studying books, simply by doing some meditation and all that. You have to hear from a Self-realized soul. That is the only way and there is no other way. There is no substitute for that. So Vidura heard from Maitreya who was Self-realized. And that conversation is elaborately described in the later cantos of the Bhagavad Gita. So Maitreya Rishi is famous as the one who instructed Vidura in this spiritual subject matter, Brahmavidya.

**Summary:** The speaker recounts Maitreya Rishi's advice to Dhritarashtra to maintain good relations with the Pandavas, Duryodhana's disagreement, and the subsequent curse, also mentioning Maitreya's discourses with Vyasadeva.

Maitreya advised Dhritarashtra to keep good relations with the Pandavas. And Dhritarashtra was plotting and planning to kill the Pandavas. Actually, Dhritarashtra was not planning to kill the Pandavas. It was Duryodhana who wanted to kill the Pandavas. So Dhritarashtra, instead of stopping his sons from attempting to kill the Pandavas, he supported his sons. That is when the others intervened. Like Maitreya Rishi, he advised Dhritarashtra not to ill-treat the Pandavas because Dhritarashtra was a caretaker, so not to ill-treat his brother's sons, his nephews, but rather to keep good relations. Duryodhana disagreed and thus Maitreya Rishi cursed Duryodhana. Maitreya also met Vyasadeva and had religious discourses with Vyasadeva.

**Key Quote:** "There cannot be any incarnation without a particular function. Every incarnation has got a very specific function and such functions are always extraordinary."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains the significance of Lord Varaha's incarnation, citing a verse from the Bhagavatam and emphasizing the Lord's extraordinary power in lifting the Earth and the specific purpose behind each incarnation.

Today is the most auspicious appearance day of Lord Varahadeva, a very extraordinary incarnation of the Lord in the form of a transcendental boar incarnation. I will be reciting a verse from the Bhagavatam. Bhagavatam contains a nice description of Lord Varahadeva's appearance and pastimes. The first canto, third chapter, entitled Krishna is the source of all incarnations. In this chapter, there is a description of the Varaha incarnation in the seventh verse: Dviteeyam tu bhavayasya Dviteeyam tu bhavayasya Dviteeyam tu bhavayasya Dviteeyam tu bhavayasya Rasatala Gatam Mahim Uddharshan Upadatta Yajnesha Savukaram Vapuhu. The meaning of this verse is, "The supreme enjoyer of all sacrifices, Yajnesha, accepted the incarnation of a boar, Savukaram Vapuhu, the second incarnation, Dviteeyam tu, and for the welfare of the earth, He lifted the earth from the nether regions of the universe." So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains regarding this appearance of the Lord as a boar. The indication is that for each and every incarnation of the personality of Godhead, the particular function executed is also mentioned. So this verse says, why did the Lord appear as Varaha? To lift the earth from the lower regions of the universe. There cannot be any incarnation of the Lord to lift the earth from the lower regions of the universe. There cannot be any incarnation without a particular function. Every incarnation has got a very specific function and such functions are always extraordinary. Lifting the entire earth planet out of the depths of the Garbhodaka ocean simply by lifting it on the snout. You can imagine how big the Varaha form of the Lord would have been simply to support the earth between the two tusks on the snout and lift it effortlessly as a Leela and place it back perfectly in the orbit. That is what the Lord did. So, such a Leela. Extraordinary activities are impossible for any living being to perform. This is very important. That nobody else can do it. No yogi, no jnani, no karmi, no devata, no asura. Nobody can do it. The incarnation of the Bohr was to take the earth out of Pluto's region of filthy matter, the bottom of the universe. From there, the earth was to be lifted up. Picking up something from a filthy place is done by a Bohr. And the all-powerful personality of Godhead displayed this wonder to the asuras who had hidden the earth in such a filthy place.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The form of the Lord is always transcendental."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Hiranyaksha's role in hiding the Earth and emphasizes the transcendental nature of the Lord's form, even as a boar, distinguishing it from material forms.

Particularly the asura by name Hiranyaksha. He had hidden the earth in the filthy place. And the earth is the place of residence for the human beings and many other varieties of living entities. But at the beginning of this Manvantara, when the earth was to be populated, then the earth itself was in the bottom of the Garbhodaka ocean, Garbha ocean. So to pick it up was required because the earth is the place of residence for so many living beings in different life forms. There is nothing impossible for the personality of Godhead. And although he played the part of a Bohr, by the devotees he is worshipped. Nobody worships a hog. But the Lord, when he appears in this particular form, he is always worshipable in all forms because all forms are transcendental. We should never think that this form of the Lord as Bohr is similar to the Bohr form in this material world. No. The form of the Lord is always transcendental. It is very beautiful. It is very very extraordinary. So devotees worship the Lord even in the form of Bohr. And the Lord is always staying in transcendence. He always remains in the spiritual platform. He never becomes affected by the material nature. He never is influenced by material nature. On the other hand, he is always the controller of material nature. And he remains the Supreme Lord under all circumstances, eternally, always, in any form he may appear.

#### scheduled incarnations, Brahma's words, demons vs. demigods

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Only under certain conditions do the planets float as weightless balls in the air."
**Summary:** The lecture moves to a description from the second canto, highlighting Brahma's perspective on the Varaha incarnation and the eternal conflict between demons and demigods.

Just for the sake of his Leela, he assumes different forms. Then, in one more place, in the second canto, seventh chapter, which describes the scheduled incarnations, the first words are spoken by Brahma: yathrodhyata shiti taloddharanaya vibhrat kraudim tanum sakalayajnamayim anantah antar maharnava upagatam adhidaityam tam damstraya adhrim iva vajradharo dadhara. The meaning of this verse is, Lord Brahma is speaking, when the unlimitedly powerful Lord assumed the form of a Bohr as a pastime, just to lift the planet Earth, which was drowned in the great ocean of the universe called the Garbhodaka. The first demon, Hiranyaksha, appeared and the Lord pierced him with his tusk. This Hiranyaksha had hidden the Earth in the bottom of the Garbhodaka ocean. So the Lord came to lift this Earth. And when Hiranyaksha prevented the Lord from rescuing the Earth, then there was a fight between the Lord, Lord Varaha and Hiranyaksha. And Hiranyaksha was delivered simply by the Lord piercing with his tusk, Hiranyaksha's huge powerful body. So in the purport to this verse, Srila Prabhupada says, since the beginning of creation, the demons and demigods or the Vaishnavas are always two classes of living beings to dominate the planets of the universe. The demons, Asuras and Suras. Sura means the Devatas. They are all Vaishnavas. They are all Vishnubhakta. Vishnubhakta spruto daiva. That is the definition. So among the Devatas, Lord Brahma is the first Devata. And among the demons in this universe, Hiranyaksha is the first demon in this universe. Brahma and Hiranyaksha.

**Key Quote:** "So this disturbance by modern demons can result in a greatly harmful reaction to the floating condition of the earth."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami discusses the delicate balance of the planets, warning against modern exploitation of resources and drawing parallels to Hiranyaksha's disruptive actions.

The first Devata and the first Asura. Only under certain conditions do the planets float as weightless balls in the air. The planets are gigantic bodies. They float in the air only under specific conditions. And as soon as these conditions are disturbed, the planets may fall down in the Garbhodaka ocean, which covers half the universe. The universe is like a huge shell. And half the shell is covered by water called Garbhodaka ocean. And the planets are above. That is what is explained here. The other half is a spherical dome, within which the innumerable planetary systems exist. The floating of the planets in the weightless air is due to the inner constitution of the globes. And the modernized drilling of the earth to exploit oil from within is a sort of disturbance by the modern demons. So much oil exploration is going on. So much oil is being taken out of the earth. But then it does disturb the conditions under which the earth is floating in the atmosphere. So this disturbance by modern demons can result in a greatly harmful reaction to the floating condition of the earth. So it is not humanly possible. Neither it is possible by any Devata or anybody else other than the Supreme Lord to maintain this balance of the earth remaining in the atmosphere above the Garbhodaka ocean. And the earth also moving in its orbit perfectly. That is facilitated by the Lord. A similar disturbance created formerly by the demons headed by Hiranyaksha. Hiranyaksha is described to be the great exploiter of the gold rush. It means he was, Hiranya means gold. So he was interested in gold. Why? Because Asuras want to enjoy unlimitedly, sense gratification. And they require huge amounts of money for that. Therefore this Hiranyaksha was always after gold. And therefore he is called Hiranyaksha, the exploiter of the gold rush. And the earth was detached from its weightless condition and fell down into the Garbhodaka ocean due to the mischief of this Asura, Hiranyaksha. The Lord as maintainer of the whole creation of the material world therefore assumed the gigantic form of a boar with a proportionate snout and picked up the earth from the water of the Garbhodaka. The Lord went inside the water and picked up the earth from the bottom of the Garbhodaka ocean.

**Key Quote:** "The incarnation of the Lord is not the concocted idea of fanciful men who create an incarnation out of imagination."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces Jayadev Goswami's Dasavatara Stotra, emphasizing the unique and extraordinary circumstances surrounding the Lord's incarnations, contrasting them with imagined or concocted forms.

Sri Jayadev Goswami, the great Vaishnava poet, has sung as follows. Jayadev Goswami has written a song called Dasavatara Stotra. In that Dasavatara Stotra, the third verse describes the incarnation of the Lord as Varaha: Vasati dashana shikhare dharanitava lagna Shashini kalanka kaleva nimagna Kesava drita shukara roopa jaya jagadishahare. This is the third verse sung by Jayadev Goswami in glorification of Supreme Lord. Jayadev Goswami says, O Keshava, O Supreme Lord, who assumed the form of a boar, O Lord, the planet earth rested on your tusks and it appeared like the moon engraved with spots. So here is a comparison. When the Lord lifted the earth, the earth was resting on his tusks, then the Lord appeared very very beautiful. Shashini kalanka kaleva nimagna. So therefore Srila Prabhupada says, Such is the symptom of an incarnation of the Lord. The incarnation of the Lord is not the concocted idea of fanciful men who create an incarnation out of imagination. The incarnation of the Lord appears under certain extraordinary circumstances, like the above mentioned occasion. Above mentioned occasion is when there was a need for the Lord to annihilate this demon Hiranyaksha. Then the Lord appears as Varaha and he kills this demon Hiranyaksha. The incarnation performs a task which is not even imaginable by the tiny brain of mankind. We have all got brains, but it is beyond our comprehension how the Lord can appear in the form of a boar or Varaha. How he can perform so many pious activities. We cannot imagine what all the kind of activities he performs. Extraordinary, extraordinary. But for him all activities are leela, pastimes. There is no exertion on his part because he is unlimitedly powerful. The modern creators of the many cheap incarnations may take note of the factual incarnation of God as a gigantic boar. So these modern people who think that they can concoct some idea about Varaha in their own way. No, that is not Varaha. Varaha is the specific form of the Lord who is incarnated in order to bless the people of this world.

**Key Quote:** "Varaha is the specific form of the Lord who is incarnated in order to bless the people of this world."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami reiterates the specific form and purpose of the Varaha incarnation, highlighting Hiranyaksha's attempts to disrupt the Lord's mission and Brahma's initial contemplation on the situation.

So that Varaha incarnation not simply appeared but actually lifted the earth with a suitable snout to carry the planet earth. He appeared. So this is the description of Lord Varaha lifting the earth in two different verses. Now it is also described here when the Lord appeared to pick up the earth the demon of the name Hiranyakya tried to create a disturbance in the methodical functions of the Lord and therefore he was killed by being placed by being pierced, I am sorry, he was killed by being pierced by the tusk of Lord Varaha. Now in the Bhagavatam third canto there is another description of the appearance of Varaha. Here in the third canto it is mentioned in the 14th chapter it is described that the Lord appeared as Varaha for a specific purpose to lift the earth. Now how did the earth fall down into the water? So it is said here one two different reasons are given in this narration. The the creator Brahma he thought while I have been engaged in the process of creation the earth has been inundated by deluge. Inundated means flooded. By what? By what? A flood. There was a flood and has gone down into the depths of the ocean. It has gone down to the depths of the ocean. What can we do who are engaged in this matter of creation? When a Devata or a devotee has got a problem naturally they turn towards the Supreme Lord Krishna for solving their problem. So similarly Brahma is praying to Krishna. So he is telling it is best to let the Almighty Lord direct us. Krishna is seated in our heart. He gives us knowledge. He gives remembrance. He gives us forgetfulness. So when he directs a devotee it need not be that he has to only personally do that. No. He can do it personally because he is seated in everyone's heart as Paramatma. But he also empowers somebody else to do this work. So in accordance with the Lord's empowerment certain devotees certain great saintly persons they perform extraordinary activities. So when Brahma was thinking like this suddenly a small form of bores came out of his nostril. The measurement of this creature which came out of the nostril of Brahma was as small as the upper portion of a thumb. Upper portion of a thumb.

**Key Quote:** "Is he the supreme personality of God and Vishnu?"
**Summary:** The lecture describes Brahma's astonishment at the sudden appearance and growth of the Varaha form, leading to his recognition of Vishnu and the subsequent chanting of Vedic hymns by sages.

Very very small. While Brahma was observing him the bore became situated in the sky. Bore became situated in the sky. And the bore was appearing as a as gigantic as a great elephant. It is small when it was born. But it became big like a huge elephant. Now struck with wonder at observing the wonderful bore like form in the sky Brahma along with other Brahmanas like Marichi as well as the Kumaras and Manu began to argue began to argue in various ways. He argued that who is this who has come in the pretence of a bore. So Brahma says is this some extraordinary entity come in the pretence of a bore? It is very wonderful that he has come from God and as a result of this the the empowered person can do something which may appear to be like an extraordinary thing. But actually even an empowered person cannot do anything extraordinary like God that is not possible for us. So God only has to do it. So first of all this bore was seen to be no bigger than the tip of the thumb and within a moment he was as large as a stone. My mind is perturbed. Is he the supreme personality of God and Vishnu? See Brahma is not like the bore. Therefore immediately Brahma was not able to recognize but he came to know that this could be Vishnu. So while Brahma was deliberating with his sons the supreme Lord who appeared as the bore in the form of a mountain he roared very loudly like a great mountain. Formerly there used to be mountains which used to fly and which used to roar. Now we don't have experience but this was an extraordinary bore who is very powerful in the world. The inhabitants of Brahma loka or the next three lokas Janaloka Tapoloka they all became alerted and it was very very loud sound. So that sound which was the all auspicious sound of the All Merciful Lord they chanted auspicious chants from the three Vedas.

#### Appearance of Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur, Early Life, Ray of Vishnu

**Key Quote:** "therefore, from the very beginning of his appearance, Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur, exhibited all the signs of an exalted eternal associate of the Lord"
**Summary:** This segment describes the auspicious appearance of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur, his birth circumstances, and early signs of his divine nature, including the astrologer's predictions and his preference for the Srimad Bhagavatam over coins.

Today is the most auspicious appearance day anniversary of His Divine Grace, Shri La Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur Prabhupāda. Shri La Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur is the spiritual master of the founder āchārya of ISKCON, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda. So, a little about his biography on this day of his divine appearance. Shri La Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur was born on February 6th, 1874, corresponding to Māghamāsā Krishna Paksha Panchami. So, according to the Vedic calendar, today is that day, Māghamāsā Krishna Paksha Panchami. He was born at 3:30 in the afternoon. His name before initiation was Bhimala Prasādatta. He was born in Jagannātpuri, in a house in which Shri La Bhaktivedanta Thakur resides. His father was staying very near to the temple of the famous Jagannāt Baldev Subhadrā in Jagannātpuri. He was the fourth son of Shri La Bhaktivinoda Thakur and Shri Yukta Bhagavati Devi. At the time of his birth, all 32 bodily symptoms of a Mahāpūruṣa, a great personality, were pointed out by an experienced astrologer. Furthermore, the boy was born with his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck like a Brahmin's thread. The astrologer commented at the time of his birth, "I have done many horoscopes in my life, but I have never before seen such a horoscope filled with all the signs of a great personality. This child will become world famous as a brilliant teacher of life's ultimate goal." This was the comment by the astrologer upon preparing the horoscope of the newly born child. When the child was six months old, Lord Jagannāt's Rathiyatra festival was in procession. भगवती देवी, that is the mother of the child, brought the child before the cart, Jagannath Ratha, and offered garland fell from the neck of Lord Jagannath, encircling the boy. This was taken as a sign of special favor by all present, the child is blessed by Lord Jagannath. At the time of the grain ceremony, it was customary to offer the child both coins and books, in order to get some indication of the future tendencies of the child, means one side they will keep some money, and one side they will keep the bhagavatam, the books, so he was offered the child, on one side coins and other side the Srimad Bhagavatam, he accepted the bhagavatam instead of the coins, so this also indicates the future of the child. Therefore, from the very beginning of his appearance, Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur, exhibited all the signs of an exalted eternal associate of the Lord. He had descended in answer to Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur's prayer, for a ray of Vishnu, to help him spread the Krishna consciousness movement. Now Srila Prabhupada explains the meaning of a ray of Vishnu. Prabhupada says, there are two kinds of children born of good fathers, one is educated in Krishna consciousness, so that he can be delivered from the clutches of Maya, in that very life, and the other is a ray of Vishnu, who teaches the world the ultimate goal of life. So Thakur Bhakti Vinod also wanted to beget a child who could preach the philosophy and teachings of Lord Chaitanya to the fullest extent. Bhakti Vinod Thakur himself was a preacher, a great Acharya, but he prayed to the Supreme Lord, "I want to have a child who can preach the teachings of Lord Chaitanya to the fullest extent, preach all over the world." By his prayers, that is by Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur's prayers to the Lord, he had as his child, Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaj, who at the present moment is preaching the philosophy of Lord Chaitanya, throughout the entire world, through his bona fide disciples. This is what Srila Prabhupada explains, what is the meaning of the word, term, ray of Vishnu, that means, Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami, was specially empowered by Lord Chaitanya, simply for the sake of preaching Krishna Consciousness all over the world, that is the exclusive purpose for which he appeared in this world.

#### Childhood incidents, Education, Devotional Inclination

**Key Quote:** "just because a small child had done a small mistake, but he took it very very seriously, this is the characteristic of the Acharya"
**Summary:** This segment narrates childhood incidents of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur, highlighting his strong devotional inclination, commitment to Krishna consciousness, exceptional memory, and early education in devotional literature and astrology.

When he was a small boy, perhaps two or three years old, his father Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur brought some ripe mangoes from the market, it was the season. Bimal Prasad, that was his name when he was born, Bimal Prasad took one to eat, saying, "This is mine." Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur got up and said in a grave voice, "What is this? New fruit has come into the house, it has not been offered to Lord Krishna, and you have taken it first. Remember, new fruit is to be given first to the Lord, without giving the first share to the Lord, nothing is to be taken." The child was very repentant upon hearing this from his father, and he exclaimed, "What evil thoughts I have had, throughout my whole life, I shall not eat these fruits again, this is the right punishment for one ruled by greed." So this is what the child exclaimed, he made the promise and observed it throughout his whole life. Later on when somebody would offer him nice mangoes, Bhakti Siddhartha Srila Vinod Thakur would say, "I am an offender, I don't deserve to eat these mangoes," in this way he observed that, wow, never again to eat mangoes, just because a small child had done a small mistake, but he took it very very seriously, this is the characteristic of the Acharya. When Bimal Prasad was seven years old, Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur was constructing the Bhakti Bhavan in Calcutta at Rambhagan. During that construction, a deity of Lord Kurma was unearthed. Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur ordered his son Bimal Prasad, to begin regulated worship of that deity of Lord Kurma. From the very beginning, the boy used to hear the preaching of his father, Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur's preaching, with rapt attention. Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur as well as his audience were amazed, to see how a small boy could hear the topics of Krishna consciousness, with such total absorption. By the age of seven, he had committed the entire Bhagavad Gita to memory, and could wonderfully explain the verses as well. See this is a special thing, there may be some children who can commit to memory all the seven hundred verses, but a seven year old small boy, being able to explain all the verses very nicely, that is extremely unusual. Later on, he was trained in publishing and proofreading at Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur's printing press, in connection with Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur's well known spiritual journal, the Sajjana Toshani. At the age of eleven, Bimal Prasad toured the various places of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's leelas with his father. Bimal Prasad had a photographic memory, whatever he would read once, he could later recall with perfect clarity. He was trained in mathematics and astrology at Sri Rampur school, and he achieved such astounding scholarship, that he was eventually awarded the title Siddhanta Saraswati by his tutors, Pandit Mahesh Chandra Chowramani and Pandit Sundar Lal, just when he was eleven years old, he was awarded this title, Siddhanta Saraswati. During this period, he used to attend the Sunday weekly meetings of Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur's Vishwa Vaishnava Rajya Sabha, and hear his father lecture on the Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu of Srila Rupa Goswami. He was never known to study his school assignments, and while sitting at home, he placed those assignments with studies of devotional literatures, like Srila Narottam Das Thakur's Prarthana and Prema Bhakti Chandrika. However, whenever questions were asked by his teachers, he would immediately answer, and he got excellent results on all of his examinations at school. When the boy was in seventh class, Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur, brought Tulsi beads for his son from Jagannath Puri, and gave him the name of Hari, and a Narsimha mantra to chant, which he executed very faithfully, along with the worship of his Kurma Deity, according to the instructions of his father, Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur.

#### Education, Rejection of Material Life, Condemnation of Religious Malpractices, Importance of Pure Teachings

**Key Quote:** "only because of such acharyas, as Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, and later on, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur, and Bhakti, his divine grace, are we able to distinguish between the genuine teachings of Lord Chaitanya"
**Summary:** This segment discusses Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur's education, his decision to leave Sanskrit College to avoid family life, his condemnation of religious malpractices, and the importance of distinguishing between genuine and deviant teachings of Lord Chaitanya.

At the age of sixteen, while his schooling continued, the books of Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur formed the serious content of his studies. He also began writing books on astrology. In 1892, at the age of eighteen, Bimal Prasad, who had got the title of Siddhanta Saraswati, took an entrance examination, and entered Calcutta Sanskrit College. As before he paid scant attention to the prescribed books, but he found the time to read all of the philosophical books contained in the library. In 1895, he left the college, as he was very eager to execute his worship of the Lord, and to remain free from the pressure to enter family life. He stated in his autobiography, "If I remain studying with careful attention at the college, Sanskrit College, then extreme pressure will be brought upon me to enter family life, but if I am considered to be foolish and inefficient, then no one will be, no one will put such an inducement upon me, for becoming so engaged, by this consideration, I left the Sanskrit College, and in order to maintain my life for the service of Hari, I was desirous of getting an honest occupation, which I could perform with the intention of earning a humble income." During his student days, he also wrote essays on spiritual topics, for various magazines, and strongly condemned various religious malpractices, which had become prominent in society. At the request of Srila Jagannath Das Babaji, he composed the Navadvipa Panjika, a Krishna iced almanac, in which the months, lunar fortnights, days, lunar days, stars, etc, were all given names of Vishnu. He did not spend very long in his astronomical pursuits, however, and soon dedicated himself fully, to the worship and distribution of the teachings of Lord Chaitanya. Siddhanta Saraswati had been engaged in regularly chanting the Maha Mantra, and a Nusimha Mantra, given to him by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, when he was in the seventh class. He had been worshipping the Kurma Deity since the age of seven. From 1885 onward, he had received special training in printing, editing, etc, at the press, at the Bhakti Bhavan. Thus, the young man was a very qualified candidate, for becoming the disciple of a guru. Many pseudo-gurus of the Sahajiya category wanted to have him, as their disciple, to increase their false prestige, but Siddhanta Saraswati, was not interested in such pretenders. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur explains, during his time, there were so many upper sampradayas, claiming to be representing Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, so Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, rightly pointed out, how people had deviated, many different groups of people, claiming to be followers of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, but not strictly following the actual regulated principles, compromising on the strict rules and regulations of Sadhana Bhakti, but externally dressing themselves as devotees, and concocting their own methods of worship, deviating from the philosophy, taught by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the philosophy of Bhakti, and misleading the mass of people, so only because of such acharyas, as Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, and later on, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur, and Bhakti, his divine grace, are we able to distinguish between the genuine teachings of Lord Chaitanya, strictly according to the authorized scriptures, Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavatam, Chaitanya Charitamrita, and the deviant teachings.

#### Association with Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj, Renunciation, Humility

**Key Quote:** "Upon seeing my spiritual master, the extent of my worldly false ego diminished."
**Summary:** This segment describes the arrival of Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj in Navadvipa and Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur's attraction to him, highlighting the renunciation and humility of Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj and the impact he had on Siddhanta Saraswati.

And false philosophical doctrines of the deviants. In 1898, after Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur had constructed his residence in Navadvipa Dhamma at Godruma Dwipa, and called it Svananda Sukhada Kunjal, and had also discovered Lord Chaitanya's birth site, Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj arrived in Navadvipa Dhamma, to see the site of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's birth, and to hear the discourses of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur. Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj was singing in ecstasy when he arrived in Navadvipa. His only possessions were the Tursi Mala he wore around his neck, and another set he kept in his hand for counting. He was extremely renounced, and genuinely so. He kept a few books such as Narottam Das Thakur's Prarthana and Premabhakti Chambrika. Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji had been performing bhajana for many many years in Vrindavan. He was extremely renounced and was the disciple of another great renunciant, Bhagavad Das Babaji, who was the disciple of Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj. Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji was not very well educated, and had been a grain merchant in his previous ashrama, but it was widely known that he was a liberated Paramahamsa of the highest caliber in the area of Vraja Mandala. At the time of his arrival, Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj was wearing a cap made of tiger skin, and was carrying a basket of various items and materials for his devotional service. He spotted Siddhanta Saraswati, and offered him four or five pieces of knotted rope for chanting rounds, a Tilak stamp with the initials for Hare Krishna, a tiger skin cap and paraphernalia for worship. Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj had received the basket and the cap from his spiritual master, Bhagavad Das Babaji Maharaj. Siddhanta Saraswati was very attracted to Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj. At the first sight, he was later to comment with humility, saying, "I have been busy within this material world trying to bring sense gratification within the grasp of my hand. I have often thought by obtaining the objects of sense gratification, all my shortcomings will be fulfilled. I often attained different facets that were indeed very rare, but my own personal shortcomings were never mitigated. In this material world, I have had the association of very high-class aristocratic persons. However, seeing their various deficiencies, I could not offer them praise. The most merciful Supreme Lord Sri Gaurasundara, that is Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, seeing me in such a lamentable condition at such a time of adversity, gave permission to two of his dear most devotees, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur and Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj, to grant their blessings to me. Because I was always intoxicated with a worldly false ego, wanting again and again self-appraisal, I deprived myself of my own real benefit. But because of the influence of my previous birth's activities and devotional service, I came into the association of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, who was the form of my spiritual well-wisher. My spiritual master, from whom I took diksha, Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj, would go and visit Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur and many times would reside with him. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, out of his compassion for other living entities, pointed out my spiritual master, Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj. Upon seeing my spiritual master, the extent of my worldly false ego diminished. I knew that all the other living entities who have taken the human form of life were also fallen and low like myself. But by gradually observing the spiritual character of my spiritual master, I realized that only a Vaishnava could reside in this material world and be of exemplary character."

**Key Quote:** "So, he told, Siddhanta Saraswati, go take your bath in the Saraswati river and then come back to me."
**Summary:** This segment narrates the story of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur's initiation by Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj, his engagement in compiling a Vaishnava encyclopedia, and concludes with a prayer for his blessings to advance in Krishna consciousness.

So, Shastras say, a true Vaishnava is decorated with all good qualities. At Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur's urging, Siddhanta Saraswati approached Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji for initiation in the month of Magha of the year 1900. Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj expressed reluctance to accept Siddhanta Saraswati as a disciple, knowing him to be a very, very great scholar. Of course, Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj was not known to be well-educated, but he was a liberated Paramahamsa, a devotee of the topmost caliber through his devotional service. So, when Siddhanta Saraswati pleaded with Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj for initiation, he got the reply that Mahaprabhu will be asked and if Mahaprabhu gives me permission, then only I will initiate you. So, Siddhanta Saraswati approached him again after some days and asked him, what was Mahaprabhu's order? Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj replied, I forgot to ask. The third time Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj was requested, he replied, I asked Mahaprabhu, but I did not receive the permission from Mahaprabhu to initiate you. Siddhanta Saraswati then stood up, his heart breaking, and said, If there is no mercy, I will give up my life. After thus indicating his readiness to take his life, Siddhanta Saraswati began to cry. Srilank Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj's heart was melted to see this. So, he told Siddhanta Saraswati, go take your bath in the Saraswati river and then come back to me. At that time of initiation, Siddhanta Saraswati received the name Sri Varsha Bhanavi Devi Daita Das. This is another name for Adarani, Varsha Bhanavi Devi. So he is given the name of the servant of one who is very very dear to Radharan and that is Krishna. So he got the name as servant of Krishna. In 1898, Siddhanta Saraswati had accompanied his father to Kashi, Prayag and Gaya and had gathered many facts about all these holy places which were later incorporated into his commentary on the Chaitanya Charitam Rishis. This Chaitanya Charitam Rishis are called Anubhashya. So Srila Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur, whose name later was Sri Varsha Bhanavi Devi Daita Das, he was engaged in compilation of a Vaishnava encyclopedia which contained an explanation of Vaishnava terminology, brief biographies of great Vaishnavas, an introduction to the books of the Vaishnava Acharyas, a description of Vaishnava, a description of Vaishnava Tirthas and various conclusions of Vaishnava sects. So this compilation is a very very valuable compilation and the work was begun in Puri and continued as Siddhanta Saraswati made his preaching rounds of Sri Mayapur Dham, Sri Jagannath Puri Dham, Sri Vraja Dham. He also studied the various books of Sri Ramadvacharya and Sri Ramanujacharya and published some of them in Bengali. He published biographies of these and other Vaishnava saints in the Sajjana Toshani magazine of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur. So there are a lot more details. I don't have time to narrate the whole biography. In conclusion, today being the most auspicious day of his divine appearance, let us pray to him for his blessings so that we can very rapidly make advancement in Krishna consciousness by his mercy.

**Key Quote:** "The impersonal interpretation of the Lord is not according to the divine and personal The interpretation of the mundane wranglers is completely refuted in this verse because it is clearly stated here that the Supreme Lord has His qualities, form, pastimes and everything that a person has."
**Summary:** The speaker reads a purport discussing the Lord's transcendental qualities, his affection for devotees, and refuting impersonal interpretations by emphasizing the Lord's personal qualities, form, and pastimes.

The Lord has unlimited numbers of transcendental qualities, and one of them is, his affection for his unalloyed devotee. In the history of the mundane world we can appreciate this transcendental quality. The Lord incarnates himself for the protection of his devotees and for the annihilation of the faithless. His activities are in relationship with his devotees. Srimad Bhagavatam is full of such activities of the Lord in relationship with his devotees and the non-devotees have no knowledge of such pastimes. The Lord lifted the Govardhan hill when he was only seven years old and protected his pure devotees at Vrindavan from the wrath of Indra who was over flooding the place with rain. Now this lifting of the Govardhan hill by a seven-year-old boy may be unbelievable for the faithless but for the devotees it is absolutely believable. The devotee believes in the almighty potency of the Lord while the faithless says the Lord is Almighty but do not believe it. Such men with a poor fund of knowledge do not know that the Lord is the Lord eternally and that one cannot become the Lord by meditation for millions of years or by mental speculation for billions of years. The impersonal interpretation of the Lord is not according to the divine and personal The interpretation of the mundane wranglers is completely refuted in this verse because it is clearly stated here that the Supreme Lord has His qualities, form, pastimes and everything that a person has. All these descriptions of the transcendental nature of the person that you have got it are factual realizations by the devotee of the Lord and by because of this mercy of the Lord they are revealed to his pure devotee and to no one else.

**Key Quote:** "Please understand that nirguna means without any material qualities."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Lord is telling Brahma that Brahma can get factual realization of the personal feature of the absolute truth, the personality of God, and clarifies that 'nirguna' means without material qualities, contrasting them with personal qualities like feelings and affection.

They have spoken to Brahma and the Lord is telling Brahma that Brahma can get factual realization of the personal feature of the absolute truth, the personality of God. So one of the attributes of the personal feature is the transcendental qualities of the Lord. So one of the attributes of the personal feature is the transcendental qualities of the Lord. The impersonalists, when they hear about the word quality, dhūna, they immediately think or consider God is nirgūna. So nirgūna literally means without any qualities. So nirgūna literally means without any qualities. So nirgūna literally means without any qualities. But, the devotees are not those who don't know about the whole picture of the Divine, Please understand that nirguna means without any material qualities. Our experience in this world is that there are so many different material qualities. Every object, material object has got quality. Every person has quality. Now, the objects have qualities based on the material they are made of. This table, if it is a wooden table, it has got qualities of wood. If there is a metal table, it will have qualities of metal. So that we can understand, these are all material qualities based on the material of which the object is made. But what about a person of this world? What are his qualities like? So we can understand there are qualities of a person which are different than the qualities of different material objects when we consider a person. So person means he has feelings. He has got affection. He has got anger. He has got some compassion. So these are all personal qualities which are not to be found in any material object, in any dead thing, material thing.

**Key Quote:** "So the qualities a person displays or appears to have are not spiritual qualities. They are all material qualities."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how personal qualities in this world are not permanent and are therefore not attributed to the eternal soul, emphasizing that the absolute truth is without material qualities.

So these are qualities or attributes of a person. But our experience in this world also is that the personal qualities are not permanent qualities. A person's qualities keep changing. Just like a child may display some playful behaviour. Or playful qualities. The same child grows up and becomes a mature person. Then the playful qualities are not there. So we see these qualities of a person can change. So even though we understand, person's qualities are different than the qualities of this world. Material objects. Still, because the qualities are changing, we do not attribute those qualities to the soul. To the eternal soul within the body. To the real person. And Bhagavad Gita also describes that every person who takes birth in this world has got what is called as an acquired nature. Itchaa dvesha samutthena dvanga mohena bharata sarva bhuttani sammoham sargeyati paramtaka At the beginning of creation, every person has got a certain acquired quality due to association with the gunas, with material nature. Karanam gunasamkosthir sarasadyogijanvasu Everybody takes birth according to the association with the gunas and accordingly they have different qualities. So the qualities a person displays or appears to have are not spiritual qualities. They are all material qualities. Even though they are not like the qualities of matter, still they are material qualities. Which means to say that if the absolute truth is without material qualities, nirguna,

#### anger, material quality, incarnation of Narasimha

**Key Quote:** "So then how do we understand that the Supreme Lord appears in His form as Narasimha and He displays anger?"
**Summary:** The speaker poses the question of how to reconcile the idea of an absolute truth without material qualities with the Lord's appearance as Narasimha displaying anger, and presents the impersonalists' view that such incarnations are material forms.

then the absolute truth will not have any of the qualities that we have or we display. So if we display anger, then the scriptures also say you should control anger. Anger is not good for you. Anger may lead to so many dangerous things. Just like somebody becomes very angry, then they lose their discrimination, they lose their intelligence. Grodhar bhavati sammoha One becomes bewildered, one's intelligence is lost, one's memory is completely bewildered. So, anger should be controlled. Anger is not a good quality. One should conquer anger. So naturally, the conclusion will be that anger is actually a material quality, which is not a desirable quality. And certainly we don't expect that the absolute truth will have anger. Because absolute truth is nirguna, without any material qualities. So then how do we understand that the Supreme Lord appears in His form as Narasimha and He displays anger? So, the impersonalists will say, Oh, that incarnation of Narasimha is a material incarnation, a material form. Material form, naturally there will be anger. And that anger has to be controlled. And that is why the impersonalists will say, Oh, Bhagavatam is described, the Lord was very angry, Narasimha was very angry. Then Prahlad Maharaj went and pacified the Lord. And then the Lord became free from anger. And then very lovingly He placed His lotus hand on Prahlad and blessed him. Sometimes even God becomes angry when He comes in the material form. And then His anger has to come down. Just like a human being of this world. He becomes angry then he has to pacify himself or somebody has to pacify him. He has to give up this anger.

**Key Quote:** "But the Bhagavatam describes that Absolute Truth is a transcendental person and Absolute Truth has got transcendental qualities."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the impersonalists' argument that the Absolute Truth doesn't have form or qualities, contrasting it with the Bhagavatam's description of the Absolute Truth as a transcendental person with transcendental qualities.

Like that God also. So they say that Absolute Truth actually doesn't have any form. But when the Absolute Truth incarnates then they may, the Absolute Truth may accept some material form. And that material form may display sometimes anger, sometimes display compassion, even compassion. Compassion also, the impersonalists think, if a person has compassion, that compassion sometimes we see is misplaced. Just like a mother is very very compassionate with her child. But we also know when the mother does not strictly correct the child and the child grows up with some pampering by the mother then everybody will say mother has spoiled the child. So she should not have shown compassion for the child when it was not properly placed, improperly placed compassion. Undue compassion. So even this compassion, this materialistic, this impersonalism will say that's also a material quality. That quality also should be absent in the Lord or in the Absolute Truth, it should not be there. This is material quality. So impersonalists will argue that all these qualities we see in a person of this world are all material qualities. So there is no question of Absolute Truth having compassion, Absolute Truth having anger, Absolute Truth having impersonal qualities. So it goes on to prove their point apparently that Absolute Truth is impersonal. It does not have personality. Because person means having some material qualities. But the Bhagavatam describes that Absolute Truth is a transcendental person and Absolute Truth has got transcendental qualities. Now what are these transcendental qualities? What is this transcendental personality? This cannot be understood if we try to understand through our material conception

**Key Quote:** "You are eternally a person. Purusham shashvatam, purusham means person, shashvatam means eternal person."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the material conception of a person with the concept of an eternal person as described in the scriptures, quoting Arjuna's description of Krishna as the supreme Brahman and an eternal person.

of a person. In this world we only have experience of what is a material conception of a person. We know of people who take birth and they may be having a good birth, they may be having a very good education, they may be having so many good qualities. But we also know that ultimately even such persons with good qualities, good birth, good education, good upbringing, they also ultimately die. They also become old. They also lose their all their qualities. The qualities they may display for some time but it is all ultimately lost. So the experience we have of a person in this world however great the person may be, however powerful he may be, however powerful he may be, he may be a great person, he may be a great person, he may be a great person, however nice qualities the person may display, still our experience is a temporary personality. A temporary personality. But the Bhagavatam goes on to describe there is another kind of personality. An eternal person. Purusham shashvatam dhiyam Bhagavad Gita describes in the words of Arjuna, Arjuna describes Krishna param brahma paramdhama pavitram paramam bhavan purusham shashvatam dhiyam eternally the supreme person, the transcendental person, param brahma, the supreme brahma, paramdhama, the supreme resting place for everyone and everything. param brahma paramdhama pavitram paramam supreme pure pavitram paramam bhavan you Krishna, you are the supreme Brahman, you are the supreme above, you are the supreme pure.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the origin of devatas and Krishna's transcendental birth, emphasizing the need to abandon material conceptions of form, person, qualities, and activities when understanding the personality of God.

you are a transcendental person. Adidevam, you are the origin of all devatas. Devatas have so many good qualities in this world. Compared to humans, compared to other created beings, devatas have so many good qualities. They have beautiful form. They have long lifespan. They have noble qualities. So, even those devatas, they have an origin. Adidevam, that is Krishna. Adidevam. Ajam, Krishna is unformed. But, Ajam, Ajopisan, Avyayatma, even though Krishna is actually unborn, he appears to take birth. Our Ajopisan, Avyayatma, Bhutana, Vishwopisan, Prakritim, Svamudishthaya, Sambhavami, Krishna appears in this world. Krishna takes birth, appears to take birth. That birth is described as Jarmakarma, Jame, Divyam, that is transcendental appearance, transcendental birth. That birth is part of his pastimes, Nila, transcendental activity, part of his transcendental activity, taking birth. So, there is a different kind of personality, not within our experience normally, but which is described in the scriptures like Bhagavatam and Bhagavad Gita. And, those type of qualities or appearance or activities or transcendental form or transcendental name, all these are described in the confidential portions of the Vedic literature. So, when we hear about the personality of God from the scriptures, it is clearly stated in the scriptures that we should give up all our material conceptions of form, person, qualities or activities.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's qualities are not a product of any of the gunas. He is gunatika. He is above the material modes."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the negation of material qualities in Vedanta philosophy is meant to help us understand transcendental attributes, and that Krishna's qualities are not a product of the material modes.

We have to give up all those conceptions. To help us give up those conceptions, the Vedanta philosophy says the absolute truth is nirguna, nirakara, nirmishesha, nirmikalpa. So, all the negation is negation of material qualities, material form, material personality, material attributes. And, at the same time, there are transcendental attributes, satchidananda-vikraha, janma-karma-chame-diljam, sambhavami-atma-mayaya. All these are transcendental attributes, spiritual qualities, spiritual names, spiritual forms, spiritual qualities. So, these are entirely different from material qualities. Now, in the Bhagavad Gita, we can clearly understand from the Bhagavad Gita that if a person becomes angry, kama-esha, krodha-esha, rajo-guna-samut-bhava, it is a product of rajo-guna. Whereas, please put your mobiles on silent mode, it disturbs the class. Whereas, the material qualities a person displays, like kama, krodha, are a product of rajo-guna. Krishna's qualities are not a product of any of the gunas. He is gunatika. He is above the material modes. So, when the Lord appears, Absolute Truth appears as Narsimha, He displays anger that is not a result of rajo-guna, because He is completely transcendental to the modes. Then, what is that anger? That anger is actually one of the transcendental reciprocation of the Lord with His devotees.

#### transcendental reciprocation, affection for devotees, Hiranyakashipu and Pralad

**Key Quote:** "So, when the Lord displays anger, it is transcendental anger. Out of his affection for his devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the story of Hiranyakashipu and Pralad to illustrate how the Lord's anger is a transcendental reciprocation born out of affection for his devotees.

Transcendental reciprocation. Just like Hiranyakashipu, he was giving so much trouble to Pralad, even though Pralad was his own son. And the only fault of this boy was that he was chanting the holy names of the Supreme Lord, Vishnu, Narayana. And Hiranyakashipu, with some misunderstanding, thought that Vishnu or Narayana is his enemy. So, Hiranyakashipu was telling his son, Why are you glorifying or chanting the name of my enemy? So, Pralad tried to explain very gently, very patiently, very nicely, Vishnu is not your enemy. Vishnu is nobody's enemy. Vishnu is nobody's anything. Vishnu is everybody's best friend, topmost well-wisher, Surudam Sarvabhutanam. But Hiranyakashipu would not try to understand, would not agree. He only became more and more angry and more and more inimical, to Pralad. So, out of his anger, inimical attitude, he began to give trouble to Pralad. So much so that the boy was tortured. He was tortured mercilessly. And that made the Lord very angry against Hiranyakashipu. Why did you torture my son, my devotee? Why did you torture your son, my devotee? So, when the Lord displays anger, it is transcendental anger. Out of his affection for his devotees. So, Prabhupada mentions here in this Papad, the Lord has unlimited numbers of transcendental qualities and one of them is his affection for his unallotted devotees. So, Pralad is a pure devotee of the Lord. The Lord has got affection for his devotee, Pralad. And when his devotee is in danger, is in trouble, is being troubled by somebody, the Lord will protect his devotee. And in the course of protecting his devotee, the Lord may actually do anything to the not-devotee. To the perpetrator of the trouble, the Lord may do anything. So, because Hiranyakashipu was giving so much trouble to Pralad, Narasimha became very angry. He became very angry against Hiranyakashipu.

**Key Quote:** "So, this display of anger is called transcendental anger."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain transcendental anger, emphasizing that it is not a result of the material modes but is an expression of the Lord's internal potency for the sake of his devotees and the demigods.

And in that anger, he actually killed Hiranyakashipu and all his supporters also, who came to attack Lord Narasimha. So, this display of anger is called transcendental anger. Why? Why is it called transcendental anger? It appears like, you know, anger which is there in this material world, which is displayed by any ordinary person. No, it is not. Because such anger is not a result of Prajopuna. Why? Because the Lord is unaffected by the Gunas. He is completely transcendently situated above the Gunas. How is that he is above the Gunas? Because he is the controller, the master, the source of all the Gunas. All the Gunas are being controlled by the Lord. And they are employed for a different purpose by the Lord. So, when he displays anger, it is his internal potency, his Atmamayam or Yogamayam. Lord has got different energies. One of his energies called his internal potency is employed by the Lord for the sake of his devotees. So, for the sake of Prahlad, the Lord employed his internal potency and using his internal potency he displayed anger. He displayed affection for Prahlad. He blessed the demigods. The demigods were so much harassed by his indecency. So, the demigods prayed to the Supreme Lord that you have to do something to stop this terrorist activity, the terrorist activities of Hiranyakashipu. He had terrorized the whole universe. So, the demigods prayed to the Lord. So, the Lord in response to the demigods prayers, he came and finished off this terrorist Hiranyakashipu. So, the Lord employs his internal potency for the sake of his activities, for the sake of displaying transcendental qualities, for the sake of protecting his devotees. And that is completely free from

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Lord's use of internal potency leads to liberation for those killed by him, and clarifies that the Lord's actions are not partial but are for the ultimate welfare of all.

the interactions of the kundas. The internal potency is completely a different potency, a different energy. It is completely spiritual. And the effect of the internal potency is that when the Lord kills anybody because the Lord employs his internal potency, the person who is killed is actually liberated. Generally, any person in this world who dies under the influence of the kundas, such a person has to take birth again in this material world and has to undergo the reactions of his karma, past karma. Whereas, when the Lord kills somebody, such a person killed by the Lord is very fortunate that he becomes purified of all karma, all sinful reactions. He becomes completely purified by the touch of the Lord. And also, the person gets liberation. The person gets liberation. That liberation is not possible if a person dies under the influence of the kundas. So, from that we can understand the Lord's killing is as good as his protection. Both are meant for the ultimate welfare of the particular person being killed or protected. So, when the Lord protects his devotees or the Lord kills the demons, both of them are benefited by the Lord transcendentally. Both of them are getting spiritual benefit from the Lord. It appears like the Lord is partial to the lay devotees. The Lord is partial to the devotees. But actually, the Lord says in the Bhagavad Gita, samoham sarva bhuteshu na me deshu astina priyaha Nobody is the object of envy of the Lord. Nobody is the object of special favor of the Lord. Then, we see that the Lord is sometimes favoring his devotees. Whatever is his favor? How do we understand? That's explained here with Prabhupada. That the Lord lifted a golden hill when he was only seven years old and protected his pure devotees at Vrndavana from the wrath of Indra.

**Key Quote:** "So, Krishna, when he was seven years old in Vrndavana, when the Vrajavasis were getting ready for one Indra Yajna, he stopped them from doing Indra Yajna."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts the story of Krishna lifting Govardhan hill to protect the Vrajavasis from Indra's wrath, highlighting the devotees' attachment to Krishna and Indra's realization of Krishna's true nature.

The Vrajavasis once they were preparing for the Indra Yajna because they were wanting to offer their gratitude to Indra who supplies rain. The Vrajavasis, they are agriculturists. They depend on the land and cows. So, they require water. So, that water being supplied by Indra as the controller of rains, annually they would worship Indra by performing one Indra Yajna. So, Krishna, when he was seven years old in Vrndavana, when the Vrajavasis were getting ready for one Indra Yajna, he stopped them from doing Indra Yajna. And he told, instead of worshipping Indra, you worship Govardhana. So, the Vrajavasis, because they are very attached to Krishna, very affectionate to Krishna, they agreed to follow Krishna's direction to not worship Indra, but to worship Govardhana. So, when they worshipped Govardhana, Indra became angry. Why are these Vrajavasis not worshipping me? So, I will teach them a lesson. So, he became angry against the Vrajavasis and he sent forth torrential rains, devastating rains. And when the Vrajavasis were harassed in this way, they approached Krishna and told him to protect them against this torrential rains. So, what did Krishna do? Krishna simply lifted the door of the hill and protected the Vrajavasis. Then, Indra realized his mistake. Indra realized his mistake. And Indra came, he stopped the rainfall and came and apologized to Krishna, offered what he prays to Krishna. He understood who is Krishna, not an ordinary covered void, not simply some powerful yogi. Because Krishna lifted the door and protected the inhabitants of Vrindavanam. So, somebody may think Krishna is some powerful yogi. No. Krishna is not a powerful yogi. Not just another covered void. Not simply some attractive child who is the center of attraction of the Vrajavasis. No. He is actually the Supreme Lord who is the master of all the devas, all the devas. So, Indra understood that Krishna is my master. He is my well-wisher. So, therefore, he came and begged forgiveness and he offered wonderful prayers to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "So, the only way to understand this aspect of the Absolute Truth, the personality aspect, whether it is personal qualities, or personal form, or personal name, or the absolute truth of the personality of Godhead, transcendental personality, we cannot understand without the truth."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the understanding of devotees with that of non-devotees regarding the personality of Godhead, emphasizing that only through devotional service can one truly understand the Absolute Truth as a person.

So, the devatas, because they are devotees, even if sometimes they mistake Krishna to be an ordinary person, by Krishna's grace, their mistaken understanding of Krishna is corrected by Krishna. Their mistaken understanding is corrected by Krishna. And they actually offer wonderful prayers to Krishna. They actually beg forgiveness from Krishna. They actually seek Krishna's protection and blessings. Whereas the demons, because they are non-devotees, therefore they cannot understand the personality of Krishna. They cannot understand the incarnations of the Lord. They cannot understand the personality of Vishnu. They categorize Vishnu as a person of this world. They categorize Vishnu as one of the devatas. They categorize Vishnu to be just another powerful devata. But they cannot understand Vishnu is not just another powerful devata. He is not a person of this world. He is completely a transcendental personality. He is the master of the gunas. He is the master of the devatas. He is the source of everything that they cannot understand. So, non-devotees, whether they be demons, whether they be impersonalists, whether they be yogis, whether they be jnanis, whether they be tapasvis, whether they be pious actors, they can never understand the personality of Godhead. Vishnu or Krishna or Narasimha or Vamana or Narayana, they cannot understand as long as they don't take the devotional service. So, the only way to understand this aspect of the Absolute Truth, the personality aspect, whether it is personal qualities, or personal form, or personal name, or the absolute truth of the personality of Godhead, transcendental personality, we cannot understand without the truth. So, Bhagavad Gita, it is said, bhakti-yamā abhijānāti yamā yaccha-asmi tattva-tahā In truth, if you want to understand what is the nature of the personality of the Absolute Truth, then you have to take the devotional service. bhakti-yamā abhijānāti yamā yaccha-asmi tattva-tahā So, only by bhakti it is possible to understand the Absolute Truth as a person. And that person is the supreme ultimate manifestation of the Absolute Truth. The supreme, the source of even Brahman and Paramatma, the source of the impersonal Brahman, the source of all energies, the source of everything and everyone. So, that source is ultimately the Supreme Person, Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker begins to answer a question about the location of the Supersoul by discussing the nature of location in material space and the location of the mind, explaining that the mind is where your thoughts are.

And that is what the Bhagavad Gita says. So, Brahman is now given the realization of the Absolute Truth as the Supreme Person. That is what Brahman is getting the realization through the mercy of Vishnu. And that is being described here by the Supreme Bhagavad Gita. Can the staff have any questions? Now, when we talk of location, we are talking of material space. Just like I am sitting here or all of us are sitting in this hall. So, we are not in some other place. We may have a residence or we may have a place of residence. So, if you are here, you are not in your home. If you are near home, you are not in the temple. Right? So, we say a person is in a particular place based on where his body is. Correct? After all, the body is matter. Matter or material object can have a material location or place. Even when it comes to subtle matter, this is gross matter. For example, a person is sitting in this hall, but mentally he can be somewhere else. He can be in his home. Right? He is sitting here, but he is thinking of his own. Maybe. He has left his child and come. Oh, child! He is afraid. Where is my father? Where has he gone? Child has been waiting, anxiously waiting for me to go back home. So, I have to return immediately. Right? So, mentally he may be not here. Mentally, he can be somewhere else. So, where is the mind? If I ask you, where is the mind? Is it here? Or is it there? Or is it in America? So, what is the answer? Where is the mind? Mind is where your thoughts are. That is where the mind is. Generally, our thoughts are centered around our body. Therefore, we say the mind is inside here. But actually, the mind cannot be located in physical space because mind is not a physical object.

**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain the location of the soul, stating that the soul is where the consciousness is, and that consciousness can be changed.

This table, does it have a mind? No. So, table is here means it is here. That's all. You cannot say table is here, but it can also be somewhere else. No, not possible. Similarly, your body, gross body, we can only say it is in one place. You cannot say your body is here as well as in your house. No. If your body is here, it is in your house. But your mind is not like that. Your mind is where your thoughts are. If you are thinking of your body, then your mind is in your body. If you are thinking of America, your mind is in America. It's not difficult to understand, isn't it? Likewise, where is the soul? The soul has got an activity of consciousness. Consciousness belongs to the soul. So, if you are bodily conscious, where is the soul? In the body. If you are Krishna conscious, where is the soul? With Krishna. If you are America conscious, where is your soul? In America. So, the soul is where the consciousness is. Now, the consciousness need not be in one place always. The consciousness can be changed. Generally, people are body conscious. Because they think, I am the body. So, where is their soul? In the body. If they are conscious of their wealth, all the time thinking, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, it's bigger than honey. Then, where is their consciousness? In money. So, where are they? Where is the soul? In money. If they are very much attached to some person, then where is their consciousness? In that person. So, they are always with that person. Always with that person. So, the soul is where the consciousness is. If you become Krishna conscious, then you are with Krishna. You are always where your consciousness is. So, if you become Krishna conscious and you become fixed up in Krishna consciousness, then you are always with Krishna. Even though your body may be here, your mind may be somewhere else, it doesn't matter. Your consciousness is Krishna consciousness, you are Krishna. And where is Krishna? Krishna is always in the spiritual world.

So, you are always in the spiritual world. So, if you want to go to the spiritual world, you have to change your consciousness from material consciousness to Krishna consciousness. So, going to the spiritual world involves a change of consciousness. That's all. That's why Krishna says, Man Mana Think of me. Go and become my devotee. What happens if you think of Krishna? Then you are with Krishna. If you think of Krishna, you are with Krishna. If you become Krishna's devotee, then your consciousness is Krishna consciousness. Your consciousness is changed. You become his devotee. So, now coming to the question, where is the super soul? Super soul is, again, person. Person means consciousness. What is consciousness of the super soul, Paramatma? Krishna consciousness. So, where is the super soul? May be where the Krishna is. In the spiritual world. But we also read in the Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavad Gita, there is a word that says, the Supreme Lord as Ishwara, as the Paramatma, He is in the heart region of every living entity. He is inside every living entity, in the heart region, Brut Deshe. It's a particular location. So, that is the localized aspect of the Supreme Lord Krishna, who has entered into the heart of every living entity in order to animate this body, in order to give intelligence to the soul who is trapped in this body.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Supersoul is present in the heart region of every living entity, animating the body and providing intelligence, and that the Supersoul manifests the fire of digestion.

To help that soul, the Supreme Lord expands Himself and enters into every body, everybody's heart, and gives the person knowledge, gives him remembrance, enables him to utilize this body for certain purposes. Just like I am using this body for the sake of eating food and digesting the food. So, Paramatma is present in the heart region and He manifests one fire of digestion called Vaishvanara. That also Krishna tells us in Bhagavad Gita. Aham Vaishvanaro Bhutva Praninam Dehama Svitah Pranapana Samayukta Pacham Yantam Chatur Vidah He simply eats some rice, dal, kondal, whatever you like. How is it digested? What are you doing for digestion? You can't do anything. Only when food is not digested, you come to know, Oh, I am indigestion. I have loose motion. I am vomiting. I have stomach pain. Then you run to the doctor. But actually, when digestion happens, everything is fine. Who is digesting the food? How is the food getting digested? You are not doing anything. It is Paramatma who is digesting the food by manifesting one fire of digestion called Vaishvanara. So, Paramatma is here for my sake. For me to digest the food I am eating. For me to lift my hand. Paramatma is seated there. And he has made one elaborate arrangement called nervous system, circulatory system, digestive system, muscular system. See, some signal in the brain. Signal comes here. The nerves give another signal to the muscle to contract. The muscle contracts and then I lift my hand. I foolishly think, I am lifting my hand. Neither this is my hand nor I am able to lift this hand. This is Paramatma who is annotating this body. So, in that sense, we can say Paramatma is here. But since Paramatma is a spiritual personality, he cannot be located in space, material space. So, they search for Paramatma inside, they will never find Paramatma. Because Paramatma is a spiritual personality, not a physical body, not a physical object.

#### Paramatma, spiritual personality, body consciousness

**Key Quote:** "So, when Bhagavad Gita Krishna says, I am seated in everybody's heart as Paramatma, it means that the Lord is actually enabling everything that is happening in this body as Paramatma."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that Paramatma is a spiritual personality and cannot be located in material space, but enables everything happening in the body, giving consciousness to what would otherwise be dead matter.

What is there in material space? Physical object. You can locate. Even mind you cannot locate. What does become Paramatma? Can you locate the mind here? Or anywhere in space, can you locate the mind? No. Mind is not a gross physical object. So, it doesn't have a physical location. Similarly, Paramatma doesn't have physical location. So, when Bhagavad Gita Krishna says, I am seated in everybody's heart as Paramatma, it means that the Lord is actually enabling everything that is happening in this body as Paramatma. In His creatures, Paramatma, He is facilitating everything that is happening in this body. He is the one who gives this body what is called as consciousness. Otherwise, the body is dead matter. Body is dead matter. Like this table is dead matter. Similarly, body is also dead matter. It is made up of earth, water, fire and sky. Similarly, table also. But how is this body appearing to have life symptoms? It is only because of the presence of Paramatma who manifests something called Chetana. Consciousness. The consciousness that is flowing in this body is due to the pancha vayu. Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana. In common parlance they say, when a person dies, what they say? Prana hoito. Prana chale gaya. In Tamil also they say Prana. In Tamil you say that? When a person dies? Prana hoito. Prana. Prana hoito. So, what is that Prana? The Paramatma has left and along with him the Prana is gone. The consciousness which animates this body, which makes this body living, show life symptoms. That is gone. So, I am not in this body and because of me, oh, this body is living. No. It is because of Paramatma, the body appears to be living. Of course, I am also there in this body. Trapped in the false consciousness called body consciousness. I think I am this body. I think I am, this body is mine. Aham mama. Two conceptions for the false seeker. Aham kara. What is that? One is that I am this body or this body is mine. Two conceptions. So, both are actually false conceptions of the soul, of the person, of the you, of the real you. So, you are not the body. Neither the body belongs to you. But you think like that out of falsehood. In reality, what is happening? Paramatma is animating this body and make you feel as if you are the body or the body belongs to you. To facilitate your sense gratification, your enjoyment, material enjoyment, Paramatma is making elaborated. But it is a temporary arrangement. Nevertheless, it is not a permanent arrangement. So, actually Paramatma is not here. Paramatma is spiritual. Paramatma is a supreme person. But he expands and actually localizes himself in this heart region for the sake of the body.

**Key Quote:** "God for the atheist is not present in this form. For the Atheist, this form is simply a statue."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the yogis' attempts to find Paramatma with the devotees' understanding of Krishna's presence in statues, and the atheists' view that statues are merely metal.

So, you cannot search out for Paramatma here and find him. The yogis, they try to search out for Paramatma in the heart. They do conceive form of Paramatma in their mind and they meditate. But simply because they meditate, simply because they do Ashtanga Yoga, they cannot see Paramatma. Because there is no Paramatma here. Paramatma is there in the spiritual world. So, they can see the Paramatma only when Paramatma by his blessings, by his grace, he actually gives darshan. Just like we say Krishna and Balarama are here. But, those who are not devotees, they will say, this is simply one statue, we are calling it God. This is not God. See, it's a metal statue. But for a devotee, this is not a metal statue. This is actually Sakshat Krishna and Balarama, the transcendental personalities. So, what is the difference? You say God is here. Atheists would say, God is not here. This is simply one statue. You foolish people, you believe. You have got some sentiment. You have got some philosophy. You have been cheated. You are brainwashed. To think one statue is here, to think that the statue is God, you have been brainwashed. And how will they prove their point? See, when some invaders came and attacked, did your brother go in them? In Vrindavan? What did Krishna do? You say God is there, worshipping. What did God do? God was simply silent. Silently sitting, doing nothing. The fellow came, he broke the temple, he stole away the deities, whatever, the jewellery, you decorate. Oh, God is there, I have to decorate you. Anamkar, Priya Vishnu, your scriptures, you know. And then you do so much decoration. Oh, so nice. Sentimental, foolish people, there is no God. Simply one statue, one doll, you are decorating. Because when somebody comes to take away the real jewellery, golden jewellery, you are putting out a sentiment for God. The gold jewellery nicely attracts thieves, plunderers. They come, they say, oh, foolish people, they think God is, statue is God. And then there is no God. They come, he will steal the golden ornaments and go away and then you people think, oh, what has happened? You police come to it. That's all you people can do. Sentimental, foolish people. This whole atheist will not do that. So, what is other understandable? If God is present in the form of this statue, then what is God doing? So, other understanding is that God is present, yes, only for the devotees. God for the atheist is not present in this form. For the atheist, For the Atheist, this form is simply a statue. For the Atheist, the form is simply a statue.

**Key Quote:** "But for the devotee, there is another spiritual dimension in existence. And in that dimension, that is above the material dimension."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to contrast the atheists' materialistic view with the devotees' understanding of a spiritual dimension, where Krishna is eternally present and can manifest for the sake of his devotees.

Just like for the atheist, there is no person inside this body. This body is simply one mechanical arrangement of blood and flesh and bones and skin and brain and nervous system, circulatory system. There is no person inside this, there is no soul. All foolish people believe, Atheists would say. According to the Atheists, what is this body? It is simply one arrangement. That's all. The arrangement, it will stay for some time. Any arrangement in this material world, you can see in this world, you can see any arrangement, it will stay for some time, that's all. No arrangement is permanent in this world. So this arrangement, it will stay. 30 years, 40 years, 50 years, 80 years, it will stay. And then the arrangement is finished. Over. Everything is finished. You say, person died. Why are you crying, person died? Simply one arrangement was made and the arrangement is finished. So for the Atheist, there is no soul in this body. There is no real person. Simply one mechanical arrangement. Kama. Kima arhya. Kama hai dhukam. Demons. Asuras. They argue. Due to kama, man and woman combine and produce one offspring, a child. What is that child? Simply one lump of flesh, blood, bones, mucus. That's all. That arrangement will remain for some time, yes. With some changes, like changes happen in matter. And these changes will happen. There is no person. So, for the Atheist, there is no soul. There is no God. There is no spirit. But for the devotee, there is another spiritual dimension in existence. And in that dimension, that is above the material dimension. It is beyond the material dimension. So even though Krishna is present here as the Didi, that Krishna is not in the material dimension. He is not located in space and time. He is eternally there as the spiritual transcendental personality. And for the sake of his devotee, even though he doesn't exist in the material dimension, he is in the spiritual dimension.

**Key Quote:** "As long as they don't take to bhakti, for them, there is no personal God, there is no spirit, there is no soul, there is no spiritual dimension."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing that atheists will remain unconvinced of the personal aspect of God without taking to bhakti, as they are under the influence of the illusory energy.

He can come in the material dimension for the sake of his devotee and accept the devotee's seva. Bless the devotee. Take the devotee's seva. So when you offer a flower to Krishna Balram here at the beauty park, Krishna Balram accepts it. Not on the material dimension. On the spiritual dimension. When the atheist comes in front of the Didi, then the Didi is simply one statue itself. Like any other statue. Any other statue which may not be God. Like statue of one political personality is put somewhere. Nobody will think that the actual political personality is there. Just try. Aid for remembering, memory. For memory. For the sake of our memory. For the sake of our sentiment. The person is dead and gone. But we have to remember his great deeds or his great contribution he did for the country and for the people. So out of a token of appreciation of the greatness of the person, of the wonderful deeds he performed, he will garland one statue. Everybody knows that statue is not a person. This way, the way of expressing our gratitude, the way of remembering, memory, in memory of this person we are garlanding the statue. That's the way of understanding of the statue. So, atheists think like that, here you are going for Krishna. If at all there is Krishna, then Krishna is not here. If at all there is God, then God is in your imagination. In that imagination you are projecting on one statue. And because you have some sentiment you want to express gratitude to God, that God protected me, that God is protecting me. So you garland the statue. These are all atheistic arguments. And these will be proven to atheists and atheists will prove to others as long as they don't take to bhakti. As long as they don't take to bhakti, for them, there is no personal God, there is no spirit, there is no soul, there is no spiritual dimension. Simply the imagination are the descriptions in the scriptures, some textbooks, some books, some teachings. Like, the atheists would always, the non-devotees would always argue like that. And they will never be convinced that, because they are completely under the grip of this illusory energy. So illusory energy will convince them, yes, there is no God. You are God. Or everything is God. This world is real. It will convince them. That's the action of the illusory energy. So if you want to know God in his personal aspect, you have to come out of this illusion. Come out of the influence of the illusory energy. Okay, let's stop it. Adraji, Bhagavad Gita, and Yajna,

**Key Quote:** "Those who are helpless must be taken care of by their respective guardians. Otherwise, the guardians will be subjected to the punishment of Yamaraj who is appointed by the lord to supervise the activities of sinful living creatures."
**Summary:** This segment focuses on the importance of protecting defenseless creatures (brahmanas, cows, women, children, and old men) and the consequences guardians face if they neglect their duties, drawing parallels to vultures dealing with serpents.

Translation: The brahmanas, the cows, and the defenseless creatures are my own body. Those whose faculty of judgment has been impaired by their own sin look upon these as distinct from me. They are just like furious serpents, and they are angrily torn apart by the bills of the vulture-like messengers of Yamaraj, the superintendent of sinful persons. Please repeat this translation. The brahmanas, the cows, and the defenseless creatures are my own body. Those whose faculty of judgment has been impaired by their own sin look upon these as distinct from me. They are just like furious serpents, and they are angrily torn apart by the bills of the vulture-like messengers of Yamaraj, the superintendent of sinful persons. Please repeat this translation. The defenseless creatures, according to Brahma Samhita, are the cows, brahmanas, women, children, and old men. Of these five, the brahmanas and cows are especially mentioned in this verse because the Lord is always anxious about the brahmanas. The Lord's blessings are the benefit of the brahmanas and the cows, and He is prayed to in this way. The Lord especially instructs, therefore, that no one should be envious of these five, especially the cows and brahmanas. In some of the Bhagavatam readings, the word duhitruh is used instead of duhatihi, but in either case, the meaning is the same. Duhatihi means cow. Tuhithruhu can also be used to mean cow because the cow is supposed to be the daughter of the sun god. Just as children are taken care of by the parents, women as a class should be taken care of by the father, husband, or grown-up sons. Those who are helpless must be taken care of by their respective guardians. Otherwise, the guardians will be subjected to the punishment of Yamaraj, who is appointed by the Lord to supervise the activities of sinful living creatures. The assistants or messengers of Yamaraj are likened here to vultures, and those who do not execute their respective duties in protecting their wards are compared to serpents. Vultures deal very seriously with serpents, and similarly, the messengers will deal very seriously with neglectful guardians.

**Key Quote:** "The whole of Krishna Consciousness is dependent on Brahmanical culture, protection of Brahmanical culture."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of Brahmanas and cows in Krishna consciousness, highlighting Krishna as their protector and asserting that protecting them leads to the welfare of the entire world.

So, this is a verse spoken by the Supreme Lord Narayana. He is speaking to the Kumaras. He is particularly mentioning, not only in this verse but in the past few verses, the position of the Brahmanas as so very, very, very important. The whole of Krishna Consciousness is dependent on Brahmanical culture, protection of Brahmanical culture. That's why, every day when we offer food to Krishna, we particularly chant this prayer: Namo Brahmanya Devaya. Go Brahman Hitaya Cha. Go Brahman Hitaya Cha. Jagadhitaya Krishnaya Govindaya Namo Namah. So, Krishna is the protector especially of the Brahmanas and cows. He is actually the protector of everyone. Jagadhitaya. Go Brahman Hitaya. Jagadhitaya. Simply by giving protection to cows and brahmanas, the entire world can benefit; welfare activity is possible for the entire world by simply protecting brahmanas and cows.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the king's responsibility to protect five categories of defenseless creatures: cows, brahmanas, women, children, and old men, emphasizing the special mention of brahmanas and cows in prayers.

So the king or the governmental head has to particularly protect the brahmanas and cows. Actually, shastra says five categories of persons are to be particularly protected by the king or the guardians: defenseless creatures, bhutani alabdha sharanani, defenseless creatures. Otherwise, if they are not particularly, if these five are not protected, they can be exploited, they can be harmed very easily. Who are they? The cows, the brahmanas, the women, the children, and old men. They can be harmed very, very, they are defenseless. And among these five categories of defenseless creatures, two are singled out in that special prayer: namo brahmanya devaya go brahmana hitaya jagad hitaya krishnaya govindaya namo namah. But in this verse, the Lord is particularly mentioning, Lord Narayan is mentioning, dvijavaran duhatir bhutani alabdha sharanani, dvijavaran, dvijavaran, dvijavaran, dvijavaran, dvijavaran, dvijavaran, the brahmanas.

**Key Quote:** "Envying brahmanas is very, very, very sinful."
**Summary:** This segment explains that those who are envious of brahmanas, women, children, cows, or old men are considered sinful and will be punished by Yamaraj's messengers.

But if somebody who, out of enviousness, sees them as different from me, envy is such a bad thing that even though somebody may be respectful to Krishna, but out of enviousness towards a brahmana, let me see the brahmana not as belonging to Krishna, they will see the brahmana as different from Krishna. Such people are actually, if they are envious of brahmanas, they are envious of Krishna because brahmanas are not different from Krishna. They are envious of all the other creatures. There are some class of people in the society, they somehow have hatred towards women, and it is a mental disorder actually. They are called misogynist in English, there is a term for this, they hate women, women haters. So according to this verse, such people, by hating women, they are hating the Supreme Lord Narayana, so they are punishable. How are they punishable? They are angrily torn apart by the bills of the vulture-like messengers of Yamaraj, the superintendent of sinful persons. It's sinful to maintain hatred, to be envious of brahmanas or cows or children or women or old men is actually sinful.

**Key Quote:** "The yamadutas punishing is only in hell."
**Summary:** This segment describes the punishments inflicted by Yamadutas in hell, emphasizing that those sent to hell are the most sinful and that even mental sins like envying brahmanas can lead to such severe consequences.

And such sinful persons are punishable by yamadutas, and how are they punished? They are torn apart by the messengers of Yamaraj. This punishment is given in hell. The yamadutas punishing is only in hell. Of course, before the punishment, the yamadutas come to take such sinful people to Yamaraj. That is also punishment only because yamadutas are very, very sinful, very, very fierce to look at. The description is there in sixth canto of Bhagavatam, but the punishment is in hell. They just take, arrest, and take them in their custody to Yamaraj. After Yamaraj's judgment, then only the punishment comes, particularly those who are to be punished by being sent to hell. Hell means special punishment. So what is mentioned here, torn apart by the bills of the vulture-like messengers, Yamaraj is a punishment in hell. So you can imagine how grievous it is. Those who are sent to hell for punishment by yamadutas are the most sinful people in the entire universe, most sinful people.

But if they are to be degraded and taken birth as a hog, then first they have to be punished in hell to accustom them to eating stool and living like a hog because the mentality has to change, the mind has to get adjusted to enter hog's body. So they are punished in hell, and that punishment is not in the subtle body. The subtle body is covered by one yatana sharira, one special body, and that body is meant for just inflicting punishment, that's all. Yatana means suffering due to punishment. Yatana means suffering due to punishment.

**Key Quote:** "A devotee is non envious."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the qualities of a brahmana, particularly focusing on mind control (shama) and non-enviousness, emphasizing that anyone who wants to avoid suffering in hell should not be envious of brahmanas.

That's why in spiritual life it is said, brahmana's quality, what is brahmana's quality in Bhagavad Gita? First quality that is mentioned, shama shamaha dhamaha, shamo dhamo tapasya ucam. Shama is particularly control of the mind. Open, open 18.42, 18.42 word for meaning, shamaha, ah shamaha, what is the meaning? Shravana mangala, peacefulness, peacefulness in the word, in the translation, same thing. It specifically refers to control of the mind. Some other translations or explanation Prabhupada gives control of the mind. So mind control is essential in devotional service or in yoga practice itself. The sixth chapter particularly refers to control of the mind. So mind control is essential in yoga practice itself. So mind control is essential so that we don't have any kind of enviousness. A devotee is non-envious, pure devotee is completely non-envious, he is not envious of any creature, but a brahmana at least should not be envious, not a brahmana, brahmana, any pious person who doesn't want to suffer in hell should not be envious of brahmanas, at least should not be envious of brahmanas, it's very dangerous.

**Key Quote:** "No one should be envious of these five, especially the cows and brahmanas."
**Summary:** This segment explains that giving up enviousness and repenting for past envy can free one from punishment, emphasizing the responsibility of guardians to protect cows, brahmanas, women, children, and old men, and the king's potential sinful reaction for failing to do so.

Now again, somebody has got envy towards brahmanas, if they give up that enviousness, then they are not liable to be punished. They are repentant, they are repentant, they understand the mistake, and they are repentant, then they are freed from the reaction of being, having been envious of brahmanas. Some misunderstanding, somebody may develop some kind of envious feeling towards a brahmana, but afterwards if they realize their mistake and they are repentant, they are freed from that sin. But somebody maintains enviousness towards brahmanas, then this punishment is definitely there in hell for such people. Therefore, Prabhupada says in this purport that no one should be envious of these five, especially the cows and brahmanas, and it is the responsibility of the guardians to give protection to these five categories of creatures, created beings: cows, brahmanas, women, children, and old men. The king has to give protection to the citizens, but particularly these five categories of citizens, these five categories particularly the king has to protect. If he does not give protection, and if they are suffering at the hands of some exploiters, the king gets a portion of the sinful reaction for not having protected them, and what a great responsibility the king has got. It is a very big responsibility for the king.

Similarly, being a husband or a father, you see, it is a big responsibility protecting the woman or protecting the mother or protecting the wife or daughter, it is a very big responsibility. If a husband is envious of his wife and maintains that enviousness, this is a punishment because they are also mentioned here, alabdha sharanani bhutani, defenceless creatures. Lord Narayan says they are like me, my body, they are my body. Those who are envious, they are angrily torn apart by the bills of vulture-like messengers of Yamaraj, and these are all not just some poetic descriptions, this is cent percent fact what is said here, so maintaining enviousness is very serious.

**Key Quote:** "All the sinful activities that we may perform in the mind can be rectified by realizing the mistake and being repentant."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how to rectify sinful activities committed through the mind, words, and body, emphasizing the importance of repentance and forgiveness, and noting that the severity of the remedy should correspond to the degree of the sin.

Maintaining enviousness, all the offenses that we commit in the mind, not offenses, sinful activities that we may perform in the mind can be rectified by realizing the mistake and being repentant, being repentant at the mind level. Mentally we can ask forgiveness, but at the level of words, if somebody offends, then they have to ask for pardon using the tongue actually, go and ask pardon or actually beg forgiveness, not mentally, verbal mentally. And if physically somebody has been, we committed a sin, then physically we have to beg forgiveness by bowing down using our body, you see. So mentally if somebody commits sins, then then realizing within one's own mind and being repentant is enough because the degree of sin in the mind is not as severe as the degree of sin committed by words, and the degree of sin committed through physical violence or physical abuse or physical action is not as, sorry, the physical one is very more serious than even verbal sin. So degrees of sin are there, accordingly the the remedy for becoming free from such sins is also correspondingly.

**Key Quote:** "Vaishnava prad you have to bow down you have to actually ask for forgiveness and in the mind also you should be very repentant."
**Summary:** This segment contrasts the process of seeking forgiveness for material sins with that of offenses against Vaishnavas, emphasizing that even mental offenses against Vaishnavas require physical acts of humility and seeking forgiveness directly from the offended Vaishnava.

Mentally, verbally, or physically we have to beg forgiveness, but in the case of offenses against Vaishnavas, offense against Vaishnavas, even if mentally we have offended a Vaishnava, we cannot mentally beg forgiveness and expect that we will be absolved of the offense. No, it doesn't work like that. What did Lord Narayana say, Lord Vishnu say to advise to Durvasambali when he offended, when Durvasambali offended Amrish Maharaj, said go to Amrish Maharaj and fall at his feet. So it is Vaishnava prad, you have to bow down, you have to actually ask for forgiveness, and in the mind also you should be very repentant, and we should mindfully ask forgiveness, all the three levels we have to. That's why when we pay obeisances to Vaishnavas every morning, Vaan Chha Kalpat Rubh Yasha, we have to physically bow down, we have to also vibrate that prayer using our tongue, not mentally chant, we have to verbally chant, and we also have to, our mind should be there in the act of offering obeisances and chanting the prayer. So Vaishnava prad is very serious, whereas at the level of on the material platform, sinful activities, there is consideration of levels of sin, mind, words, or body, ok.

**Key Quote:** "If the person is not punished, definitely he is going to be punished by Yamaraj."
**Summary:** This segment addresses the difference between punishment given by state laws and Yamaraj, explaining that if state punishment is commensurate with the sin, there is no further punishment by Yamaraj, using the example of capital punishment for murder.

Punishment given by state laws is different from punishment given by Yamaraj. Yes, it is different, but if the if the punishment is commensurate with the particular mistake or the sin that has been done, then there is no punishment by Yamaraj. Just like somebody has committed a murder, I will give an example, it is a very gross example, but that is the example very easily understandable. Somebody has committed a murder, so if the person is not punished, definitely he is going to be punished by Yamaraj. If the person is punished by the state, the only punishment which can absolve the person is capital punishment, that means he also has to be killed as a punishment, he has to be killed. Now supposing the state law pardons him, nowadays they are after capital punishment to be abolished, it is very, very inhuman, it is considered inhuman. So if they don't give capital punishment for a murderer, then he is going to be punished by Yamaraj, he is going to be punished by Yamaraj like that.

**Key Quote:** "Manusamhita is perfect law book for mankind."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the ideal of state laws following shastras, particularly Manusamhita, contrasting it with the imperfections of state laws enacted by imperfect persons, and highlighting the differing views on animal killing, especially cow killing.

As per shastras, the punishment level is different, and as per state laws, the punishment is different. See, when they don't follow Manusamhita, state laws are not to be specially enacted by the state shastras, they just have to follow shastra, what the shastra says. Manusamhita is perfect law book for mankind, for human beings. So formally kings used to follow Manusamhita, that's all. What are the laws of the state? Manusamhita. Everybody is guided, everybody is following Manusamhita, that's all. Even Yamaraj follows Manusamhita only when it comes to punishing human beings. Yamaraj also follows Manusamhita only, nothing else. See, it is because the state laws are being enacted by imperfect persons, there could be some wrong punishment or less punishment or no punishment, whatever, there is a possibility, there is a possibility, there is a possibility, there is a possibility, there is a possibility. But just like in state law to kill an animal is not considered a state offence, correct? To kill an animal is not considered a state offence, but Manusamhita, laws of God, is an offence, it is an offence, and killing a cow is the worst offence, most grievous offence.

**Summary:** This segment answers a question about why women, children, and old men should be protected, elaborating on the reasons for protecting each group, such as women for generating Krishna conscious progeny.

But people are saying you should kill a cow, some people are saying increasing the number of cows and even killing one cow, if you are killing a cow you can only kill one, if you are killing a cow you can only kill one, but you are killing a cow that is the most a first you can only kill one. Whatever they do, there is no karma. Ok. Yes Madhav. My next question. See that's why human form of life is junction point. From human life one can go down or one can remain on the human level or one can be elevated to the higher level. But lower creatures simply keep getting higher births till they come to the human form. Yeah. Next question. Maharaj, in purport it is explained these five kind of people to be protected like brahmana, cows, women, children and old person. So like brahmanas they are protected because they are carrying or giving this brahmanical culture to the society. So they should be protected. Then cows like they are maintaining. So like old person or children could you please elaborate. Why they can be protected other three.

**Key Quote:** "Witnessing the sin is not sinful."
**Summary:** This segment addresses the question of witnessing sin, explaining that witnessing alone is not sinful, but being a mute spectator and failing to fulfill one's duty or responsibility is, using the example of a father witnessing the ill-treatment of his wife.

Any other question? Like if someone witnesses some sin, what is, how it, will it affect the person who witnesses someone, someone's sin? Witnessing the sin is not sinful, but if somebody is a mute spectator, just like I am seeing something is happening and I am not doing something which I am supposed to do. Just like to give a simple example, a father is seeing the son is ill-treated. Why? Ill-treating the mother. Now the father as a husband has got responsibility for his wife. So he can't be just standing and or watching telling, I am not harming her, no. So then he has to act. Okay. So everybody has to perform their particular duty or responsibility irrespective of whether they are involved in a particular activity or not. Just like the king, he may say, I am not killing cow, somebody else is killing cow. No. No. No. No. No. No. So he stands there and he is trying to act. And he tries to prevent that cow killing. Because he is responsible. If he takes no action for preventing cow killing, then the reaction of the cow killing, the king will also get. Prabhupad mentioned this in 1st Cantau.

**Key Quote:** "Animal killing it is considered murder according to the laws of God."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the responsibility for animal killing, stating that it is considered murder according to God's law, and that all involved, from the rearer to the eater, are part of a gang of conspirators and will be punished.

In 1st Parpot. 3. Animal killing. 4. 5. It is considered murder according to the laws of God. So, who are all responsible for the murder? Not just the person who killed, physically actually did the killing. It is the person who reared the animal, person who transported that animal. You see? The person who was responsible for selling the meat, person who is cooking the meat and person who is eating the meat. All of them are actually like a gang of conspirators to kill a person. This is state law also. If there is a gang involved in a murder, all the members of the gang are held responsible for the murder. They are all punished by state law. This is state law actually. Similarly, there is a gang of criminals according to God's law in animal killing. One animal is killed. A gang of conspirators are punished. See, how dangerous it is in modern-day society. Somebody is working in a supermarket as a cashier. So, the person who is working in a supermarket as a cashier may be a vegetarian. But if he is in the cashier counter, he is handling that meat packet and just swiping that through that barcode reader to register that purchase for the person who is purchasing. So, he is selling meat. And if it is, Krishna forbid, cow meat, he is held responsible for the cow killing. And cow killing, he is held responsible for the cow killing. And cow killing, he is held responsible for the cow killing. And cow killers are punished in hell are punished in hell as many times as there are hair on the body of the cow. Can you imagine how much punishment is awaiting this fellow? This is the most dangerous situation in our modern-day society.

**Key Quote:** "This is the most dangerous situation in our modern-day society."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the dangers of modern society, where many people are unknowingly involved in cow killing, using the example of a supermarket cashier handling meat, and the severe punishment awaiting cow killers.

Modern day society. See formerly there used to be a butcher and he would only sell meat that's all. There was no meat shop as such separate from the killing of the animal. No separate meat shop concept didn't exist. They'll only kill and they'll only sell. But now so many people not even aware of this killing they are all involved in selling. So it's a very very dangerous society. Risky, very risky. Last question. Hare Krishna Maharaj. Maharaj, if someone borrows money from us and we are not sure what he is doing like he is purchasing something meat or some for some intoxication. So that also we are responsible or we are held for it?

**Summary:** This segment answers a question about the responsibility for borrowed money used for sinful activities, explaining that if the money is not returned, the lender becomes responsible, but that taking to Krishna consciousness can completely free one from sinful reactions, especially cow killing.

If he does not return the money, then you become responsible. Before he dies or before you die, if he does not return the money then you are responsible. If he returns the money then you are not responsible. I am telling this because many times people don't return money. Not one time. No. Not one time. Not one time. Yeah. One time you give generally they will return in a responsible way habitual borrowers they don't return it's very risky what they use the money for because your money which is spent if they don't return so in the laws of god it is like you have spent for whatever that's why the punishment will come not full punishment portion of the punishment but then somebody is taken to krishna consciousness even cow killers they take to krishna consciousness they come completely freed completely freed in fact other than taking to krishna consciousness there is no other way of becoming free from the sinful reactions for cow killing there's no other way that's why chaitanya maha prabhu is so particular please preach this chanting of haray krishna in the worst sinners can be completely freed from all sinful reactions simply by chanting haray krishna

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of preaching Krishna consciousness to save people from suffering in hell, particularly those who break the four regulative principles, and highlighting the transformative power of chanting Hare Krishna.

That's a gift of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to this world. Many times it happens they are ignorant of how grievous a sin it is to be involved in cow killing. They are very, very ignorant, you see. Like all those who took to Krishna consciousness after Prabhupada preached in the western countries, they are very, very ignorant, they are very, very ignorant, they are very, very ignorant, they are very, very ignorant, they are very, very ignorant. They were eating cow flesh, they were eating cow flesh, but they stopped, completely stopped. They realized how dangerous and how grievous sin it is, and now they're chanting haray krishna, they're completely freed, they're completely freed from all sinful reactions of cow killing. So that's why we should preach to people, somehow make them chant haray krishna, otherwise their destination is to suffer in the worst kind of hell. You read in 26th chapter of fifth canto what are the punishment for those who get habituated to intoxication, meat eating, illicit sex. You read actually the suffering is horrible, horrible, very, very, very horrible. So to save people from this and you know four regularity principles are broken by people outside so very common isn't it very common nowadays especially so they're all candidates for hell, they're all candidates for hell, but they can all be saved, they can all be saved, that's why we have to actively vigorously preach to save people from suffering.

Purport by Srila Prabhupada: as previously described, Tulasī has attained all superior qualities due to being placed at the lotus feet of the Lord.

So here it is being described by Kumaras that the Goddess of Fortune, Lakshmi, what is her position actually? She is, the dust of her feet is worn on the head by others. Who are the others? Prabhupada says in the purport: those who are seeking the Goddess of Fortune are the Devatas, the Brahmanas, the Vaishnavas, and everyone else, they are seeking blessings, the favor, the mercy of the Goddess of Fortune. That Goddess of Fortune, she waits upon the Supreme Lord Narayana, Lakshmi Narayana, correct? So Lakshmi waits upon Narayana, for she is anxious to secure a place in the abode of the King of Bees, which is the abode of the King of Bees: Madhu, Vrata, Pater, Dhamma, Dhamnaha. The King of Bees actually is hovering over the fresh Tulasī leaves, which are all over the place, always permanently situated at the lotus feet of the Lord. So the lotus feet of the Lord is the most desired place in the entire Vaikuntha.

Now, many times devotees think Pada Sevanam means we should actually approach the lotus feet of the Lord and actually render service, but in the purport to one particular verse, which is that verse? The verse which describes the nine types of devotional service is spoken by Prahlad Maharaj. Once Hiranyakashipu called his son, after he had finished some Gurukul education, said, "What is the best of what you have learnt in the Gurukul?" So he was expecting the son will tell something about economic development, sense gratification, administration, politics, diplomacy. That's what he wanted his son to learn, and that's what the teachers also were willing to teach in the Gurukul, Shanda and Amarka, two sons of Shukracharya. Instead, Prahlad was not interested in learning all that. He had already learnt whatever he had to learn when he was in the mother's womb. He had learnt from Narada about Bhakti, and that is the highest education, highest knowledge, king of all knowledge. That's what Krishna says in the ninth chapter, Raja Vidya. What is that Raja Vidya? Bhakti is the highest knowledge of all knowledge, Bhakti, pure devotional service. So that he had already learnt.

**Summary:** The speaker defines intense attachment in devotional service, using the example of a devotee constantly chanting Hare Krishna.

What is the characteristic of intense attachment? Attachment we all know, because we already have some attachments, material attachments. What is the characteristic of intense attachment? Absorbed in thinking is intense attachment for thinking. Yes, that's correct. But what is the symptom of, let us say, somebody is intensely attached to chanting? What is the symptom of such a person? What can we say? Eagerness to chant more. But how do we know that he has got eagerness to chant more? Huh? Always chanting. Constantly chanting. What is the astakur? What is he doing? Always chanting. Three lakh names a day. Almost 24 hours. Almost 24 hours chanting Hare Krishna. So that is intense attachment for devotional service. So Prabhupada in many places he says a pure devotee is 24 hours daily engaged in serving the Lord. That is because of intense attachment to serving the Lord. So one way of Pada Sevanam that's distinctly described here in the purport is being intensely attached to thinking of the Lord's Lotus Feet.

Now Vrindavan is not just the physical place Vrindavan, that is Vrindavan of course, but any place where the glories of the Lord are sung by devotees who are dedicated for such glorification.

Just like many times, those who are staying outside and practicing devotional service seriously, they feel that they should also stay in such a temple and do seva, because they can make out the difference, right? For at least some of us, it would have been the impetus to join, so that we can nicely stay amidst devotees and do seva. We might have been doing seva outside, but one of the impetus for joining is, we can stay amidst devotees and completely engage in devotional service. So similarly, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur explains, that a progressive devotee goes through these stages. I will read that portion in Nectar of Instruction, because sometimes devotees think that Prabhupada has not given details beyond sadhana bhakti, how to execute sadhana bhakti practically. Practical tips, practical description Prabhupada has not given. Actually he has given that.

under the guidance of devotees. Obviously more advanced devotees. One should follow in the footsteps of the Lord's beloved devotees who are deeply attached to his devotional service. Intense attachment. Same thing. So in the purport, it's a very big purport, I'll read this portion of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur's... So he says, one who has not yet developed interest in Krishna consciousness should give up all material motives and train his mind by following the progressive regulated principles, namely chanting and remembering Krishna and his name, form, quality, pastimes, and so forth. Chanting and remembering. Rasana manasi niyodhya. Tongue. You have to vibrate the tongue. Not chanting in the mind. Chanting by vibrating the tongue. And of course, one has to engage the mind in remembering. So for remembering in the mind, one has to not only chant, one should also hear. Chanting and hearing constitutes remembrance. Attentively. Chanting and hearing attentively constitutes remembrance. So here, one should practice without material motives chanting and remembering Krishna and his name, form, quality, pastimes. In this way, after developing a taste for such things, for chanting and remembering constantly, one should try to live in Vrindavan and pass his time constantly remembering Lord Krishna's name, fame, pastimes, and qualities under the direction and protection of an expert devotee.

Uninterrupted. Of course, one should never imitate all these stages. As is told very clearly, imitating is very dangerous. Just like somebody who wants to lazily sit and do now physical activity, to tell him do some service, he will say, oh no, I am engaged to you. You are not going to help us. Cheating is because they are lazy or they want to imitate advanced devotees, you see. So, that cheating should not be done. That is why, step by step, one should carefully progress one step at a time. And these things take time. Absorption, meditation, when you become absorbed in chanting and hearing always without interruption, then naturally your mind gets fixed on chanting and hearing. And that is exactly what is meditation. Prabhupada gives a definition of meditation in one purport in Bhagavatam that is concentration upon the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord.

So, somebody asked me, concentration upon the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord means should we try to keep a picture of the lotus feet of the deity in our mind? So, which is what brings me to this question? How to do this remembrance? If you speculate how to do remembrance, then you will try to imagine some or picturize something in the mind. That is not what is told, is the method. So, one should actually meditate on the lotus feet. So, that is meditation stage, sub-stage of smarana. Recollection, absorption, meditation. Then, the fourth one is constant remembrance. By meditation, 24 hours a day, one has no other business or engagement for the mind than meditation. 24 hours a day, constant remembrance. And that leads to trance, samadhi, total absorption in meditation. The mind is completely soaked up only in one activity. Only in one activity. No other activity.

Same thing with Brajavasis. Brajavasis you already know. But have you heard this? You should read this in the 10th canto, 98th chapter. This is what Sukadeva Goswami described about yadus in Dwaraka. They were so attached to Krishna that their other bodily activities were done automatically without their specific attention on those activities. Oh, it is time to eat something? Okay, we will eat. But eating also, you see, constant remembrance leading to trance. That's why all these yadus, Brajavasis, they are always in Samadhi.

One who is situated in Shantarasa should follow a devotee who is perfected that Shantarasa. One who is because the constitutional position will reveal our specific type of devotee. One who is situated in Shantarasa or Dasya or Sakya or Vatsalya or Madhurya. Accordingly, we have to select the particular perfect devotee in Vrindavan. And one has to take shelter of such a devotee and then render and follow in the footsteps of such a devotee. So, one has to take shelter of such a devotee. So, all these neophyte devotees jumping to some Babaji's instructions in Vrindavan. You know, Siddha Pranali.

The fellow is not even able to chant properly 64 rounds every day, and he'll go to Vrindavan and he wants to take Siddha Pranali, some special mantra. I heard one devotee in Vrindavan say that he wants to chant Vrindavan in Vrindavan. So, this of course eagerness may not be a wrong thing, but why before one becomes qualified should one even attempt Vrindavan? Where is Prabhupada giving us all these directions? How will we know our constitutional position? Prabhupada is clearly given here. Has he not given clearly? They won't read all these things and then say Prabhupada has not given us, not taught us. So, carefully studying Srila Prabhupada's books is so important. Only then we will realize Prabhupada has given us A to Z everything to achieve our goal.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the concept of the personal feature of God and contrasts it with the impersonal view, focusing on the qualities of the Lord.

So these are words spoken by Vishnu, Prabodha Kishayi Vishnu. They have spoken to Brahma and the Lord is telling Brahma that Brahma can get fractured. This is the realization of the personal feature of the Absolute Truth, the Personal Attribute of God. So one of the attributes of the personal feature is the transcendental qualities of the Lord. The impersonalists, when they hear about the word quality, guna, they immediately think or consider God is nirguna.

**Key Quote:** "So these are all personal qualities, which are not to be found in any material object, in any dead thing, material thing."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of 'nirguna' as being without material qualities and differentiates between material and personal qualities.

So nirguna literally means without any qualities. But the devotees understand that nirguna means without any material qualities. Our experience in this world is that there are so many different material qualities. Every object, material object has got quality. Every person has quality. Now the objects have qualities based on the material they are made of. This table, if it is a wooden table, it has got qualities of wood. If there is a metal table, it will have qualities of metal. So that we can understand, these are all material qualities based on the material of which the object is made. Now what about a person of this world? What are his qualities like? So we can understand there are qualities of a person, which are different than the qualities of different material objects, when we consider a person. So person means he has feelings. He has got affection. He has got anger. He has got some compassion. So these are all personal qualities, which are not to be found in any material object, in any dead thing, material thing. So these are qualities or attributes of a person.

**Key Quote:** "So, the qualities a person displays, or appears to have, are not spiritual qualities. They are all material qualities."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how personal qualities are impermanent and influenced by material nature, emphasizing that they are not spiritual qualities of the soul.

But our experience in this world also is that, the personal qualities are not permanent qualities. A person's qualities keep changing. Just like a child may display some playful behaviour, or playful qualities. The same child grows up, and becomes a mature person. Then the playful qualities are not there. So we see these qualities of a person can change. So even though we understand, person's qualities are different than the qualities of this material objects. Still, because the qualities are changing, we do not attribute those qualities to the soul, to the eternal soul within the body, to the real person. And Bhagavad Gita also describes, every person who takes birth in this world, has got what is called as an acquired nature. At the beginning of creation, every person has got, a certain acquired quality, due to association, with the gunas, with material nature. Everybody takes birth, according to the association with the gunas, and accordingly they have different qualities. So, the qualities a person displays, or appears to have, are not spiritual qualities. They are all material qualities. Even though they are not like the qualities of matter, still, they are material qualities. Which means to say, that if the absolute truth is without material qualities, nirguna, then the absolute truth will not have any of the qualities that we have,

**Key Quote:** "So then, how do we understand, that the Supreme Lord, appears in His form as Narasimha, and He displays anger?"
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the apparent contradiction of the absolute truth being without material qualities while the Lord displays anger as Narasimha, presenting the impersonalist viewpoint.

or we display. So if we display anger, then the scriptures also say, you should control anger. Anger is not good for you. Anger may lead to so many, dangerous things. Just like, somebody becomes very angry, then, they lose their discrimination. They lose their intelligence. One becomes bewildered, and one's intelligence is lost, and memory is completely bewildered. So, anger should be controlled. Anger is not a good quality. One should conquer anger. So naturally, the conclusion will be, this anger is actually, a material quality, which is not a desirable quality. And certainly we don't expect, that the absolute truth will have anger. Because the absolute truth is nirguna, without any material qualities. So then, how do we understand, that the Supreme Lord, appears in His form as Narasimha, and He displays anger? So, the impersonalists will say, oh, that, incarnation of Narasimha, is a material incarnation. A material form. Material form, naturally, there will be, anger. And that anger has to be controlled. And that is why, the impersonalists will say, oh, Bhagavatam is described, the Lord was very angry, Narasimha was very angry, then Prahlad Maharaj went and pacified the Lord, and then the Lord became, free from anger, and then very lovingly, He placed His lotus hand on Prahlad, and blessed him. Sometimes, even God becomes angry, when He comes in the, material form. And then, His anger has to, come down, just like, a human being of this world, he becomes angry, then he has to pacify himself, or somebody has to pacify him, he has to give up his anger. Like that,

**Key Quote:** "But, the Bhagavatam describes, that absolute truth, is a transcendental person, and absolute truth has got, transcendental qualities."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to contrast the impersonalist view with the Bhagavatam's description of the absolute truth as a transcendental person with transcendental qualities.

God also. So, they say, that absolute truth, actually doesn't have any form. But when the absolute truth, incarnates, then, they may, the absolute truth may accept some, material form. And that material form, may display sometimes anger, sometimes display compassion, even compassion. Compassion also, the impersonalists think, if a person has compassion, that compassion sometimes we see, is misplaced. Just like a mother is very, very compassionate with her child. But we also know, when the mother, does not, strictly, correct the child, and the child grows up, with some, pampering by the mother, then everybody will say, mother has spoiled the child. So, she, should not have shown compassion, to the child, when it was, not, properly, placed, improperly, placed compassion, unto compassion. So, even this compassion, this materialistic, this impersonalist will say, that's also a material quality. That quality also, should be absent in the law, or in the absolute truth, it should not be there. This is material quality. So, impersonalists will argue, that all these qualities, we see in a person, of this world, are all material qualities. So, there is no question of, absolute truth having compassion, absolute truth having, anger, absolute truth having any personal qualities. So, it goes on to, prove their point, apparently, that absolute truth is impersonal, does not have personality. Because, person means, having some material qualities. But, the Bhagavatam describes, that absolute truth, is a transcendental person, and absolute truth has got, transcendental qualities.

**Key Quote:** "Bhagavad Gita describes, ah, in the verse of Arjuna, Arjuna describes Krishna, ah, param brahma paramdhama avitram paramam bhavan purusham shashwatam divyam."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that transcendental qualities cannot be understood through material conceptions and quotes Arjuna's description of Krishna as the eternal, transcendental person.

Now, what are these transcendental qualities? What is this transcendental personality? This cannot be understood, if we try to, understand, through, our, material conception, of a person. In this world, we only have experience of, what is, a material conception of a person. We know, of people who take birth, and, they may be, having a good birth, they will be having a very, good education, they may be having so many, good qualities. But, we also know, that ultimately, even such persons, with good qualities, good birth, good education, good upbringing, they also, ultimately, die. They also, become old. They also, lose their, all their qualities. The qualities, they may display for some time, but, it's all, ultimately lost. So, the experience we have, of a person, in this world, however great the person may be, however, ah, however, nice qualities, the person may display, still, our experience is, a temporary personality. A temporary personality. But, the Bhagavatam goes on to describe, there is another kind of personality. An eternal person. Purusham Shashwatam Divyam. Bhagavad Gita describes, ah, in the verse of Arjuna, Arjuna describes Krishna, ah, param brahma paramdhama pavitram paramam bhavan purusham shashwatam divyam. Eternally, the supreme person, the transcendental person. Param Brahma, the supreme Brahman. Paramdhama, the supreme resting place, for everyone and everything. Right? Param Brahma, Paramdhama, Pavitram Paramam, supreme pure. Pavitram Paramam Bhavan, you, Krishna, you are the supreme Brahman, you are the supreme abode, you are the supreme pure. You are eternally a person. Purusham Shashwatam, Purusham means person, Shashwatam means eternal person. Divyam,

**Summary:** The speaker describes Krishna as the origin of all devatas and explains that Krishna's birth is a transcendental activity described in scriptures.

you are a transcendental person. Adidevam, you are the origin of all devatas. Now, devatas have so many good qualities in this world. Compared to humans, compared to other created beings, devatas have so many good qualities. They have beautiful form, they have long lifespan, ah, they have noble qualities. So, even those devatas, they have an origin, Adidevam, that is Krishna. Adidevam, ajam, Krishna is unborn. But, ajopisan avyayatma, even though Krishna is actually unborn, he appears to take birth. Ajopisan avyayatma, bhutana vi shuro pisan, prakatim svam nishthaya, sambhavami, Krishna appears in this world. Krishna takes birth, appears to take birth. That birth is described as janma karma jame divyam, that is, transcendental appears, transcendental birth. That birth is part of his past times, nila, transcendental activity, part of his transcendental activity, taking birth. So, there is a different kind of personality, not within our experience normally, but which is described in the scriptures like Bhagavatam and Bhagavad Gita. And, those type of qualities or appearance or activities or transcendental form or transcendental name, all these are described in the confidential portions of the Vedic literature.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the need to abandon material conceptions when understanding the personality of God and introduces the concept of transcendental attributes.

So, when we hear about the personality of God in front of the scriptures, it is clearly stated in the scriptures that we should give up all our material conceptions of form, person, qualities, or activities. We have to give up all those conceptions. To help us give up those conceptions, the Vedanta philosophy says the absolute truth is nirguna, nirakara, nirmishesha, nirmikalpa. So, all the negation is negation of material qualities, material form, material personality, material attributes. And, at the same time, there are transcendental attributes, sacchidananda, vikraha. janma karma chame dhinyam sambhavami atma vayaya All these are transcendental attributes, spiritual qualities, spiritual names, spiritual forms, spiritual qualities. So, these are entirely different from material qualities.

**Key Quote:** "So when Lord appears as, Absolute Truth appears as Narasimha, he displays anger that is not a result of rajoguna, because he is completely transcendental to the modes."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's qualities are not products of material modes and that the anger displayed by Narasimha is a transcendental reciprocation with devotees, setting up the story of Prahlad and Hiranyakashipu.

Now, in the Bhagavad Gita, we can clearly understand from the Bhagavad Gita that if a person becomes angry, kama esha, krodha esha, rajo guna samut bhava. It is a product of rajo guna. So, kama is a product of rajo guna. Whereas, please put your mobiles on silent mode, it disturbs the class. Whereas, yeah, the material qualities a person displays, like kama, krodha, are the product of rajo guna. Krishna's qualities are not a product of any of the good qualities. his gunas, his gunatita, he is above the material modes. So when Lord appears as, Absolute Truth appears as Narasimha, he displays anger that is not a result of rajoguna, because he is completely transcendental to the modes. Then what is that anger? That anger is actually one of the transcendental reciprocation of the Lord with his devotees. Transcendental reciprocation. Just like Hiranyakashipu, he was giving so much trouble to Pradhan, even though Pradhan was his own son. And the only fault of this boy was that he was chanting the holy names of the Supreme Lord, Vishnu, Narayana.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Hiranyakashipu's persecution of Prahlad and the Lord's anger, emphasizing the Lord's affection for his unalloyed devotee.

And Hiranyakashipu, with some misunderstanding, thought that Vishnu or Narayana is his enemy. So Hiranyakashipu was telling his son, Why are you glorifying or chanting the name of my enemy? So Pradhan tried to explain very gently, very patiently, very nicely, Vishnu is not your enemy. Vishnu is nobody's enemy. Vishnu is everybody's best friend, topmost well-wisher, surudam sarva bhutana. But Hiranyakashipu, who would not try to understand, would not agree, he only became more and more angry and more and more inimical to Pradhan. So out of his anger, inimical attitude, he began to give trouble to Pradhan. So much so that the boy was tortured. He was tortured mercilessly. And that made the Lord very angry against Hiranyakashipu. Why did you torture my son, my devotee? Why did you torture your son, my devotee? So when the Lord displays anger, it is transcendental anger, out of his affection for his devotees. So Prabhupada mentions here in this Papal, the Lord has unlimited numbers of transcendental qualities and one of them is his affection for his unalloyed devotee.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the impersonalist view of oneness and refutes it by highlighting the difference between the creator (Vishnu) and the created (Brahma).

So very long, but forth we will go through this parvo, which we will go through. So every one time we will discuss that in the afternoon and speak of it in the afternoon. Thank you very much. Parvo, we should note very carefully that the personality of Godhead is addressing Lord Brahma and specifying with great emphasis himself, pointing out that it is he, the personality of Godhead, who existed before the creation. It is he only who maintains the creation and it is he only who remains after annihilation of the creation. Brahma is also a creation. Brahma is the creation of the Supreme God. The impersonalist puts forth a theory of oneness in the sense that Brahma, also being the same principle of I, because he is an emanation from the I, the Absolute Truth, is identical with the Lord, the principle of I. And that is, does nothing more than the principle of I as explained in these words. Accepting the argument of the impersonalist, it is to be admitted that the Lord is the Creator I and that the Brahma is the Created I. Therefore, there is a difference between the two Is, namely the Predominator I and the Predominated I. Therefore, there are still two Is. Even accepting the argument of the impersonalist, the impersonalist, but we must note carefully that these two Is are accepted in the Vedic literature, the Kadopanishad, in the sense of quality. The Kadopanishad says, nithyo nityanam cetanas cetavanam ego vahunam yog vidhati karmanam.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the four questions asked by Brahma and explains that these questions are answered in the four verses of the Yatushloki Bhagavatam.

Lord Vishnu is answering Brahma. Brahma has asked four questions. What are the four questions Brahma has answered? Anathapuram Chitência, King of Pandavas and King of Pandavas. Anathapuram Chitência, King of Pandavas and King of Pandavas and King of Pandavas. The first question we are asked is, what are the forms of the Lord in matter and in transience? Rupa. Form. What are the forms of the Lord in matter and in transience? Second question is, how are the different energies of the Lord working? So remember these four questions because that will give a lot of clarity as to what is it that Vishnu is trying to answer. He is trying to answer specific questions asked by Brahma. So the answers will make a lot of sense if you know the questions. So the first question is, what are the forms of the Lord in matter and in transience? Second is, how are the energies of the Lord working? Third is, how does the Lord play with these different energies? You see in the interaction of the energies, there is a certain control exercised by somebody or something above and beyond these energies. So Brahma's question is, how does the Lord play with these energies? And fourth question of Brahma is, how may Brahma be instructed? Discharge the duty and respect between the two. How should be the duty given? A certain duty that is given to Brahma. And how should it be discharged? So these four questions will be systematically answered in the four verses called the Yatushloki Bhagavatam.

**Key Quote:** "The essence of the Bhagavatam was spoken by Vishnu to Brahma in these four verses."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the essence of the Bhagavatam was spoken by Vishnu to Brahma in four verses, emphasizing the importance of hearing to realize the Absolute Truth.

According to the Acharyas, the entire Bhagavatam can be summarized in four verses. In four verses. Now those four verses are the verses beginning with this present verse. Second canto, ninth chapter, thirty-third, thirty-fourth, thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth verses. Four verses, four Yatushloki Bhagavatam. And it is said by the Acharyas that Lord Vishnu spoke the Bhagavatam to Brahma in these four verses. The essence of the Bhagavatam was spoken by Vishnu to Brahma in these four verses. Specifically answered in Brahma's four verses. So the answer begins with Lord Vishnu telling Brahma that all of me, my transcendental existence, my form, my colors, my qualities, my activities, everything let it be awakened in you by factual realization of my causeless mercy. That was the thirty-second verse. And in the thirty-third verse that realization is being given by the Lord's grace. This is the philosophy of the Bhagavatam. Simply if you hear Bhagavatam, you realize the Absolute Truth. Especially Bhagavatam's presence, the Absolute Truth as the personality of God. So you realize the highest aspect of the Absolute Truth simply by hearing. Just like Brahma realized simply by hearing from Vishnu.

**Key Quote:** "Our false ego is the filter that is actually coming in the way of our proper hearing."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of hearing properly from the right source, emphasizing the role of Sadhana Bhakti in purifying consciousness and clearing false ego.

The important thing is that there is a certain way of hearing and also the hearer has to select the proper source. So two things for realization. One is you hear properly. And second is you hear from the right source. So Brahma had prepared himself to hear by performing Tapasya. That way Brahma prepared himself. Secondly Brahma was hearing from, directly from the personality of God, Vishnu himself. So we should also prepare ourselves to hear the Bhagavatam by undergoing the process of Sadhana Bhakti. What does Sadhana Bhakti do? It purifies our consciousness of all the misconceptions we may have. When we hear, we hear from a filter. What is that filter? What is the filter that comes between our hearing and what is actually being discovered in our heart? Huh? False ego. Our false ego is the filter that is actually coming in the way of our proper hearing. False ego is a set of misconceptions that we have about the Self, about God, about this world, about anything. So these misconceptions in the form of false ego have to be cleared. So when you practice Sadhana Bhakti and practice Yoga Yuktena, then your false ego is cleared.

**Verse References:** SB 1.2.6
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Hear about Krishna from the Bhagavatam."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how the hearing process, when properly applied, purifies consciousness, breaks the knot of material existence, and terminates the chain of action and reaction.

In the beginning of the Bhagavatam this process is described. The process begins with hearing. And this hearing process, if it is properly applied, it results in purification of the consciousness to the extent that this knot of material existence, ahankara, is cut to pieces. All doubts about who you are, who is God, who is your relationship, what is this world, everything is cleared. Chid yate sarvasam shayah. Chi yate jah si karvani. Then the chain of rooting action is completely terminated. We are caught up in this chain of action and reaction. We have performed some actions in the past of which we are experiencing reactions. These reactions prompt us to do further actions. And that gives rise to further reactions. So we have got up in this network of actions and reactions. So to get us out of this network, Bhagavatam says, srimad-am svaratham krsnama Hear about Krishna from the Bhagavatam. So this sadhana bhakti process is the preparation for hearing for the sake of and the souls, what are the souls? The Lord or the Lord's bona fide representation. So we have to select carefully the souls from which we hear. So in this case we are hearing from Prabhupada who is coming in parampara. From Krishna. So when we hear from Prabhupada then we can actually realize. So here Krishna is explaining to Brahman. Vishnu is explaining to Brahman.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Vishnu's existence before creation, even before material nature, highlighting that He exists beyond cause and effect.

He is telling one fundamental truth that it is the person in Godhead, Vishnu himself who was existing before the creation when there was nothing but himself. So before the creation there was no material world. There were no created beings. Only the Lord existed. The personality of Krishna. He existed. Nor was there the material nature the cause of this creation. The material nature was nothing. The material nature was not there. Sad asat param. Sad in this case refers to the effect. Effect is what we see around us. The material world. It is an effect of the cause. Cause is asat. What is that? Material nature. This is the difficulty in understanding this world. That the cause and effect both are material nature itself. So how can one understand that the cause and effect are the same? Very difficult to understand. Actually even though the cause of this material creation is material nature still material nature is not independently the cause for this creation. That we explain in detail. Anyway. So here Vishnu is telling Sad asat param He existed before the creation. He also existed when there was no cause of the creation. Even material nature which is the cause was not existing. Sad asat param. Cause and effect beyond cause and effect.

**Key Quote:** "That which you see now is also I the personality of God."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Vishnu remains present during and after creation, addressing the Mayavadi argument that Brahma is the same identical 'I' as the Absolute Truth.

He exists beyond cause and effect. That which you see now is also I the personality of God. Now the creation is already come into existence and Vishnu is very much there. He was existing before the creation. What happens to him during the existence of the creation? He remains. He does not disappear. He does not transform. He does not become affected. He does not change. So he remains even after the creation has taken place. And after annihilation the whole creation will disappear. After that what remains will also be I the personality of God. Vishnu only will remain after the creation of this world. So in particular Prabhupada is explaining one point in this first paragraph that we understand that what he is saying carefully. That in person they say with respect to these words they are arguing this that Brahma is an emanation is coming out of Vishnu. Right? Brahma is gone from Vishnu and again into the creation. So that Brahma is the same principle of I, Aham. Here the word used is Aham evaasam evaadhe paschal aham naanyat yatsarasat param paschal aham so vashi shreka so asmi aham So this word Aham is emphasized I Vishnu is speaking and he is saying I I exist in this world I am present now I will remain after the destruction So the mayavadi argument is that the I is the same I which is the absolute truth which exists before the creation which remains during the creation and which remains after the whole creation and destroyed Brahma is also that same identical I the same I

**Summary:** The speaker refutes the idea that Brahma and Vishnu are identical, emphasizing the distinction between the creator and the created, the predominator and the predominated.

So our Acharyas explain Yes, even if he accepts the mayavadi argument Brahma is also the same I because an emanation from that original I original Vishnu Brahma is emanation Brahma is coming from Vishnu So even assuming that the mayavadi argument that Brahma is an emanation therefore the same I we have to note that Brahma is a created I a created entity and Vishnu is the creator So there are two distinct I's here the creator and the creator itself the creator and the created So that is explained here as the difference between the two I's is the predominator and the predominated Brahma is subordinate Vishnu is the master Brahma is the subordinate created Vishnu is the creator Vishnu is the controller Brahma is the controlled This difference exists and therefore we cannot accept that both are identical in all respects 100% No Brahma and Vishnu are not identical in all respects

So in the Vedas it is said in the Kathopanishad the similarity between the creation and the creator is described as Nithyo Nithyana Between Brahma and Vishnu the similarity is Nithyo Nithyana Both are Nithya Both are Chetanas Chetanas Chetanana But the difference is there are two categories of Nithya and two categories of Chetana Nithya means eternal Chetana means conscious Two categories of eternals and two categories of conscious beings What is the difference? The next line says Eko bahunam yodhya dhyanti kamaan The one singular eternal conscious being is the maintainer of the many Conscious eternal means Eko bahunam Eka the one Nithya Chetana Distinction is made very clearly One and many Singular and plural Nithyo Nithyana Chetanas Chetanana Eko bahunam Very clear Singular and plural So plural are the many living entities and singular is Vishnu Singular is Vishnu So Vishnu is the maintainer of all the created beings the many living entities So Vishnu is the maintainer All others are maintained Even though both are eternal and conscious beings So the difference is clearly brought out in the domination And that difference will be pointed out by Vishnu to Brahma also in these four places

Prema Bhakti Chandrika and Prarthana. These are two books written by Harathamdas Thakur. It is a collection of songs written by Harathamdas Thakur. Now in these two books. The entire philosophy of Krishna Consciousness is very nicely explained. Harathamdas Thakur has written a simple bengali. He has written a lot of songs. And in these songs he explains the philosophy of Krishna Consciousness. Which is there in Sanskrit. In so many Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavatam, Bhagavad Gita. All that philosophy. He has explained in very simple bengali language through these songs. So Gaurav Vishwanath Babaji Maharaj would always be carried with him these two books. Apart from these two books. He had on his body one Nandi Mala made of Tulsi. And another Japa Mala made of Tulsi beads. And the cloth he was using to wrap his body. That's all he was carrying with him. So he was very very renowned. Even though he was not literate. Still all the conclusions of the Shastras. Of the Krishna Consciousness philosophy. Was always illuminated in his heart. When somebody would approach him. And ask some philosophical doubt. He would give the answer with such clarity. All the conclusions he made. So he used to guide those who used to approach him. Asking for philosophical clarity. On the Gauria Vaishnava. On the Vaishnava Siddhanta.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Gaurav Vishwanath Babaji Maharaj's disinterest in material benefits and recounts the story of Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur seeking Diksha from God Kishodad Babaji Maharaj.

And sometimes when some materialistic people would try to get his blessings. For some material benefit. He would not so much be interested. In giving such benediction for material advancement. So he would go away from clean places. And he would sit next to a toilet. Or a drink. That drink means specifically where somebody passes through. It could be very smelly. It could be dirty. It could be bad. So he would sit next to that place and chant. So that nobody would disturb him. So he did not so much say. So he did not so much like. People coming to him for some material benefit. And he never liked to accept service from other devotees. Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur. When he wanted to take Diksha. His father came to know Thakur. He approached his father and said I want Diksha. So his father directed him to God Kishodad Babaji Maharaj. He said go to God Kishodad Babaji Maharaj and take Diksha. So accordingly Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur came to God Kishodad Babaji Maharaj and requested. Please give me Diksha. So God Kishodad Babaji Maharaj. In the beginning. He would not respond to this request. So but repeatedly. Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur approached God Kishodad Babaji Maharaj. Then one day. God Kishodad Babaji Maharaj said. I will ask my Lord. And. Depending on. His reply. I shall tell you. Whether I can initiate you or not. So after telling this. Again. Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur was waiting. For a reply. So one day he asked. What did your Lord say? So then. God Kishodad Babaji Maharaj said. That. He would not be interested. In giving Diksha. He would not accept service. From anyone. So if he has to give Diksha. He has to accept service from the disciple. So since he did not want to accept service from anybody. He wanted to be only engaged in serving. Not in accepting service. Therefore he did not want to give Diksha.

**Key Quote:** "Then the Lord enlightens the devotee from within."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Gaurav Krishna and Bhavani Maharaj was enlightened from within and could easily recognize imposter devotees.

Satatayuttana. So this is particularly. Applicable for. Guru Ekshitarayo Bhajan. Krishna. Who. Seated as. Paratma. In the heart. Of the devotee. He enlightens. The devotee. From within. If the devotee. Is engaged. devotional service to the Lord. He is constantly engaged with love and devotion in serving the Lord. Then the Lord enlightens the devotee from within. There is no need for the devotee to study externally anything. So, Gaurav Krishna and Bhavani Maharaj was enlightened from within by the Lord. So, that was his position. He was fully enlightened. And he was fully renounced. So, it is said in the Bhagavatam that these two factors are very important for self-realization. What is that? Jnana and Vairantya. Jnana is enlightenment and Vairantya is renunciation. Both of them were seen in the personality of Gaurav Krishna and Bhavani Maharaj to the highest degree. He was fully enlightened and he was fully renounced. And therefore, many, many great saintly persons actually took shelter of Gaurav Krishna and Bhavani Maharaj by actually enquiring from Gaurav Krishna. By getting clarification and so many doubts. Also, Gaurav Krishna and Bhavani Maharaj could easily recognize an imposter devotee. Sometimes people pose as if they are great devotees. Though within their heart, they are not purified of material meditation. They pose externally as if they are renounced. But actually in their heart, they have so open desire for enjoyment daily. So, when such imposters would approach Gaurav Krishna and Bhavani Maharaj, he would immediately expose them. So, it was well known in the holy dham that any imposter will get exposed if he goes to Gaurav Krishna and Bhavani Maharaj. So, nobody could cheat him. Nobody could display false renunciation in front of Gaurav Krishna and Bhavani Maharaj. So, he was very, very, very advanced Paramahansa.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes the discussion of Gaurav Krishna and Bhavani Maharaj, highlighting his renunciation and the mood of separation from Krishna (Vipralambara Sampode).

But he led a very, very simple life. He was renunciation personified. And today is the disappearance day, anniversary of his divine birth. So, we pray to him that by his mercy, we may develop renunciation and we may get enlightenment in Krishna consciousness. By his mercy. So, these Acharyas like him are very, very merciful to those who sincerely seek their blessings, seek their mercy. So, such important days we observe, especially remembering the great qualities. So, that Prana Mantra, first line I explained. Namo Govrisho Raya Saksham Vairagam Uttayam The next two lines are Vipralambara Sampode He was situated, Gaurav Krishna and Bhavani Maharaj were situated in service, in the mood of separation from Krishna. It's called Vipralambara Sampode. Krishna is served by those who are advanced devotees, who have developed their relationship with Krishna. They serve Krishna in two ways. One is in association with Krishna they serve Krishna. And other one is in separation from Krishna they serve Krishna. Just like Krishna when he appeared in Vrindavan. So, when he was, as long as he was in Vrindavan, the Prajavasis were serving him in association. And when he left Vrindavan and went to Mathura and Dwarka, he was away from Vrindavan. All the Prajavasis were serving Krishna in separation from Krishna. So, these are two ways of serving the Lord. So, Gaurav Krishna and Bhavani Maharaj was always serving Krishna. In separation from him. Vipralambara Sampode. So, there is a certain mellow taste to be experienced by a devotee in such service. Vipralambara Sampode. So, he is the expert Acharya who served Krishna in Vipralambara Sampode. So, Vipralambara Sampode, Bada Pujariya Dena Maharaj who wrote a speech of such an exalted Paramahansa, Devotee, I offer my respect to all the Sages. Let's start.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the Chatur Shloki Bhagavatam, emphasizing its importance as a summary of the entire Bhagavatam and highlighting Srila Prabhupada's elaborate purports on these verses.

The 18,000 verses, Bhagavatam has 18,000 verses. Padhunetta aayira, correct? In Tamil you say that. Like naala aayira devya prabandham, padhunetta aayira Bhagavatam. That has been summarized in 4 verses, just 4 verses. So these 4 verses are very, very, very, very, very important. You can understand the whole of Bhagavatam just by studying these 4 verses. So for these verses, Srila Prabhupada has written very, very elaborate purports. And these 4 verses bring out the essence of the philosophy of the Bhagavatam. Bhagavatam is presenting the philosophy of God. So that philosophy has been very nicely explained in these 4 verses. So which are those 4 verses? They are the verses beginning with the 2nd canto 9th chapter 33rd verse up to 36th verse: 33, 34, 35, and 36. So these 4 verses we'll spend more time on than on the other verses. We have already begun this verse in the last class. So I will continue with this same verse this class, and probably it will go on for a few more classes. So we are reciting the 33rd verse of the 2nd canto 9th chapter.

#### Vyasa Deva, Vedic Literature Compilation, Oral Tradition

**Key Quote:** "Understanding, learning, understanding and realizing through hearing."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the background of Srimad Bhagavatam as the last work of Vyasa Deva, who compiled the Vedic literature and transitioned it from oral tradition (Shruti) to written form.

Now a certain background for this verse is that the Srimad Bhagavatam is the last work of Vyasa Deva. Vyasa Deva compiled the Vedic literature as we have it today. Because before Vyasa Deva compiled the Vedic literature, what was available was only in the form of Shruti. The Vedas were available as that which was heard and passed on through oral tradition. Oral tradition means the Guru will speak, the disciple will hear, and as soon as the disciple hears, he will commit to memory. Just he hears once and he commits to memory and he is able to remember the rest of the verse. And after hearing from the Guru and committing to memory, the disciple will try to understand the meaning of what is heard from the Guru, and then he will deliberate on the meaning and ask questions from the Guru and try to understand and realize this subject matter of the Vedas. This is called Shrutapantha: understanding, learning, understanding, and realizing through hearing.

**Key Quote:** "In Kali Yuga, people's duration of life, memory and so many other such good qualities are reduced."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the characteristics of Kali Yuga, including the reduction in lifespan and memory, which prompted Vyasa Deva to put the Vedas in writing.

Now in the beginning of Kali Yuga, Vyasa Deva appeared for a very specific reason. He could see that in Kali Yuga, people's memory will be very short-lived. Their lifespan also will be reduced. In Kali Yuga, people's duration of life is shortened. So the Bhagavatam explains, in Sakya Yuga, the duration of life was 100,000 years, 1 lakh years. And that duration of life reduced in Treta Yuga, the next Yuga, to 10,000 years. Further reduced in the next Yuga, called Dwapar Yuga, to 1,000 years. And in Kali Yuga, the last of the four Yugas, in the cycle of four Yugas, the last Yuga, Kali Yuga, it is further reduced to 100 years. So the duration of life being reduced, the time available for studying the Vedas is also very less. Not only that, people's memory has also become less. In Kali Yuga, duration of life, memory, and so many other such good qualities are reduced.

**Key Quote:** "He divided the one Veda into four."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Vyasa Deva put the Vedas into writing and divided the single Veda into four parts: Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, and Atharva Veda.

So Vyasa Deva, foreseeing this condition of human beings in Kali Yuga, he first of all decided to put the Vedas in writing. So Vedas were put into writing at the end of Dwapar Yuga, just before the beginning of Kali Yuga, by Vyasa Deva. The name Vyasa is actually a title. It is a title which indicates that one who records, one who puts down in writing and creates a record, Vyasa is a title. Actually, the Vyasa title is given to the incarnation of the Lord who appeared at the end of Dwapar Yuga, Krishna Dwaipaayana Vyasa. His full name is Krishna Dwaipaayana Vyasa. He is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord who has appeared for a very special purpose. The first of the reasons is that he put down the Vedas in writing. He put down the Vedas in writing. Then also, he saw that the Vedas are very, very vast. Even if the written Vedas are available for people, still he decided to divide the one Veda into four. What did he do? He divided the one Veda into four. And that is how we have the four divisions of the Vedas called Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, and Atharva Veda.

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "The Upanishad portion of each of the Vedas contains the essence of the philosophy of the Vedic knowledge."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how Vyasa Deva further summarized the four Vedas into Upanishads, which contain the essence of Vedic philosophy, noting that there are 108 principal Upanishads.

Why did he do this division? He saw that in the Vedas, there are different portions which describe different things. So he logically divided the one Veda into four. Thereby, people can take up only the portion that is relevant for them and learn and study only that portion. So Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, and Atharva Veda, he divided the one Veda into four. But even that, one fourth of the entire Vedas that he divided was also very, very big. It was not small. So he further summarized each of those four divisions of Vedas into what is called as Upanishads. Vedas contain many different details called Brahmana, Aranyaka, Samhita, and Upanishads. All these different sections of the Vedas, for each of the Vedas, Rig Veda has its own Brahmana, Aranyaka, Samhita, and Upanishads. Yajur Veda has its own Brahmana, Aranyaka, Samhita, and Upanishads. Similarly, Sama Veda and Atharva Veda. So the Upanishad portion of each of the Vedas contains the essence of the philosophy of the Vedic knowledge. The Upanishad portion contains the philosophy, and it is also in the form of the essence of the philosophy. So the Upanishads also are many. There are 108 principal Upanishads. How many?

**Verse References:** —

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "That cream of the cream is called Vedanta Sutra."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Vyasa Deva further condensed the Upanishads into the Vedanta Sutra, which is described as the 'cream of the cream' and the ultimate summary of Vedic knowledge.

108 important or principal Upanishads. So Upanishads also are very, very big in number. So even those 108 Upanishads, in Kali Yuga, people will not be able to study. 108 Upanishads. Very big number. So what did Vyasa Deva do? He further summarized all the Upanishads into what is called as Vedanta Sutra. The summary of the summary. The cream of the cream. Just like you boil milk, you get cream. But that cream, if you further condense, cream of the cream, further you condense, you get the real, real, real essence. That cream of the cream is called Vedanta Sutra. Upanishads are also called Vedanta. Vedanta means the conclusion of the Vedas, of the essence of the Vedas. Now essence of the Vedas as Upanishads or Vedanta is very big. Even though it is distant and made small, but still that is also not sufficiently summarized. That's what Vyasa Deva could foresee. So he further condensed the Vedanta or Upanishads into Vedanta Sutra. And that Vedanta Sutra is just some thousand short sutras, aphorisms. Sutra means like a formula. These aphorisms are very, very short and very terse. Athako brahma jinyasa is one Vedanta Sutra. Like this there are 1055 short sutras. That's what entire Vedic knowledge is summarized into this Vedanta Sutra. It's one small book. That's all. The whole Vedas, entirety of Vedas in one small book Vyasa Deva has summarized. This is the genius of Vyasa Deva.

#### Itihasas and Puranas, Vedic Message, Historical Narrations

**Key Quote:** "Explain the Vedic message in an easily understandable way for the common people."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Vyasa Deva compiled the Itihasas (historical narrations like Ramayana and Mahabharata) and Puranas to explain the Vedic message in an easily understandable way for the common people.

Very, very, very brave work. Now in summarizing the entire Vedas into this Vedanta Sutra, Vyasa Deva could also see that this summarization will not be understood properly by majority of the people. Most people cannot understand because it's very much condensed, very terse, very difficult to understand. So what he did, he first of all compiled the itihasas and puranas in order to explain the Vedic message in an easily understandable way for the common people. So itihasas and puranas. Itihasas are historical narrations, which contain some important historical incidents, but which explain through the historical incidents the Vedic message. For example, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata. These are two important itihasas. Ramayana explains or describes the life of Lord Rama. Mahabharata explains the life of the Kauravas and the Pandavas. So these two itihasas are explaining the Vedic message in the form, but presented in the form of a nice story,

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "They are real stories, real incidents, historical incidents."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the stories in the Itihasas and Puranas are not imaginary but real historical incidents, distinguishing them from fictional tales.

historical narration. Now this is story, the story of Lord Rama, the story of the Pandavas. Now these stories are not imaginary, fictitious stories, just like you have Jataka tales, Aesop's fables, fairy tales. These are not like that. These itihasas, even though they are presented as stories, they are not fictitious, imaginary, concocted stories. No. They are real stories, real incidents, historical incidents. Valmiki, a great sage, he wrote the Ramayana and Vyasadeva himself, who compiled the Vedic literature, he wrote the Mahabharata. So these are two important itihasas. Now in addition to the itihasas, there are other historical narrations called the Puranas. Now Puranas are very, very, very, very ancient historical narrations. In the itihasas, it's a definite narration of a particular set of incidents in the history. There's a time of Lord Rama, Treta Yuga, Rama appeared. So that life of Lord Rama is described in the Ramayana. Or the Pandavas and Kauravas, they were living in the Dvapara Yuga, before this Kali Yuga began. So that narration is concerning that period of time, Pandavas and Kauravas. But the Puranas are little different than the itihasas. What do the Puranas contain? The Puranas contain very, very, very ancient historical narrations that go back even to the beginning of creation, or even before the creation. And Puranas also contain stories, historical narrations, but these stories are real. They are again not fabricated stories. They are real incidents, historical incidents, but they could be very, very, very old.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "In the Puranas there are definite topics which are described concerning the philosophy of the Vedas."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the Puranas as very ancient historical narrations containing definite topics related to Vedic philosophy, differentiating them from the Itihasas.

And one more characteristic of the Puranas is that in the Puranas there are definite topics which are described concerning the philosophy of the Vedas. Just like Bhagavata Purana, it has ten topics. It describes the creation, the secondary creation, the planetary systems, the science of God, the maintenance of this material world, the destruction. All these topics are discussed systematically in the Bhagavata Purana. There are other categories of Puranas in which there are only five topics discussed. They are called Upapuranas. So there are Puranas which discuss, which describe ten topics and the Upapuranas describe five topics. So Puranas are in this sense different from the Itihasis. Puranas are different in what sense? That they are very ancient, historical narrations may be there in the Puranas and they contain definite topics, either ten or five. So these Itihasis and Puranas are also accepted as Vedic literature though there are some transcendentalists, some Vedic scholars, don't accept the Itihasis and Puranas as Vedic literature. But actually because they are presenting the same Vedic message in the form of historical narrations they are also accepted as Vedas. So Vyasadeva particularly compiled the Itihasis and Puranas for the sake of explaining the Vedic message in an easily understandable way for the common people.

#### Welfare Activity, Atmarama, Self-Satisfaction

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Atmarama means one who can be self-satisfied, does not require anything outside for his satisfaction."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Vyasa Deva's motivation for welfare activity, explaining the concept of 'Atmarama' (self-satisfied) and how even self-realized souls work for the benefit of others out of compassion.

So if you study the life of the Pandavas or study the life of Lord Rama or study the Puranas which describe different historical incidents Vishnu Purana, Garuda Purana, Bhagavata Purana, you will get the Vedic message explained in a very easily understandable way for the common people because so many stories are there, so many historical narrations are there. But in addition to these Itihasis and Puranas Vyasadeva was also not very happy or satisfied that he has done enough welfare activity. A Rishi or a Sadhu his life is dedicated for the welfare of the people in general. Because these Rishis or Sadhus as far as they are concerned because of their spiritual realization they are satisfied and happy and contented within themselves. They are Atmarama. Atmarama means one who can be self-satisfied does not require anything outside for his satisfaction. It is like all of us we require so many things externally for our satisfaction or for our happiness. Right? We are dependent on so many external things. Whereas a self-realized soul or an Atmarama a person who is Atmarama is satisfied within himself he does not require anything external for his satisfaction or happiness or contentment.

**Key Quote:** "A Sadhu or a Rishi is one who lives for the welfare of the others."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the compassionate nature of Sadhus and Rishis, highlighting Vyasa Deva's dedication to the welfare of others and his initial dissatisfaction despite his extensive work.

So what is the life of such Atmaramas? What would they do if they are self-satisfied? They have nothing to do for the sake of their satisfaction or happiness or contentment. They have nothing to do. So does it mean that they don't do anything? No. While they are themselves satisfied within themselves and they are not dependent externally on anything or any person for their satisfaction they also out of compassion for the others who are not able to actually be self-satisfied, for the welfare of the others they keep working. There are so many activities. There are so many different things they do. So a Sadhu or a Rishi is one who lives for the welfare of the others. So Vyasa Deva is a Rishi is a Sadhu whose life is only dedicated for the welfare of others. So how did he decide to do welfare activity for others? He put down the Vedas in writing. He compiled the Vedas. He did divided the Vedas into four parts. He summarized the Vedas. Further summarized and also wrote down Itihasas and Puranas. But in spite of doing all this he was not satisfied. He thought still is there something more I can do? This thought Vyasa Deva got from God before he wrote this last work or compiled the last book the Bhagavata Purana.

**Key Quote:** "You are not satisfied or you are feeling insufficient because you are not actually properly glorified Krishna in all your Vedic literature."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Narada Muni pointed out to Vyasa Deva that he had not properly glorified Krishna in his previous works, leading to the compilation of the Bhagavata Purana.

Before the Bhagavatam was compiled Vyasa Deva felt in his heart some vacuum some insufficiency some incompleteness. So when he felt that he thought that even though I have done so much of work for the welfare of the people I am still not satisfied that I have done enough. Something is lacking something is missing in what I have done. What is that I have not done? That was pointed out to him by his Guru Narada Muni. Narada Muni pointed out to Vyasa Deva that even though you have done so much of work even though you have compiled all the Vedas you have done all that you have done still and that's very big work it's not small work very big work still Vyasa Deva was experiencing dissatisfaction and Narada Muni noticed that and he told Vyasa Deva you are not satisfied or you are feeling insufficient because you are not actually properly glorified Krishna in all your Vedic literature. In all the literature you have not properly or sufficiently glorified Krishna. So Narada Muni directed Vyasa Deva to write the Bhagavatam this final contribution of Vyasa Deva the final work of Vyasa Deva the last work of Vyasa Deva in which Krishna is exclusively glorified. So Bhagavata is also called Krishna Samhita Samhita generally means Vedic literature. So Bhagavata is that Vedic literature which exclusively glorifies Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Paramahamsas are the topmost transcendentalists who have reached the perfection of spiritual realization by being able to distinguish spirit from matter."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the Bhagavata Purana as 'Paramahamsa Samhita,' suitable for the topmost transcendentalists (Paramahamsas) who can distinguish spirit from matter.

Also Bhagavata is called Paramahamsa Samhita. It is the very literature which can be best appreciated by Paramahamsas. Who are Paramahamsas? Paramahamsas are the topmost transcendentalists who have reached the perfection of spiritual realization by being able to distinguish spirit from matter. There are two things in this world. There is matter that we all know and there is something which normally people do not know and that is called spirit. So one should know in addition to what is matter one should also know what is spirit. And one should be able to distinguish or separate spirit from matter. Spirit is important matter is not important. Spirit is the essence which is of value to us and matter is not essential not of value to us. Our life generally is simply centered around matter. We are leading what is called as a material life concerned only with matter, including our body which we think is our self this body also is made up of matter. And everything around us we see we deal with is made up of matter. So this matter is not the essence is not important is not essential. So spirit is important. And one who is able to distinguish spirit from matter and not only do that but also extract effectively the spiritual essence of everything in this world.

**Key Quote:** "How to extract the spiritual essence from everything material. That is only known to a Paramahamsa."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that a Paramahamsa can extract the spiritual essence from the mixture of spirit and matter, highlighting their ability to find value beyond the material world.

Like whatever we see in existence including this body which we think is our self how to extract the spiritual essence from everything material. That is only known to a Paramahamsa. The real topmost transcendentalist. He knows why in this world how to extract the spiritual essence of everything. There is a mixture of matter and spirit. So from this mixture just like Hamsa why they are called Paramahamsa? Another reason is Hamsa swam is a very very special bird. What is the special quality of the Hamsa? It can separate milk from a mixture of milk and water. Just like generally the milkman when he brings milk to your house he will generally if you take from a person who milks a cow generally they add milk to the water and give you. Water mixed with milk. Now if you present that water mixed with milk to a swam it will definitely drink that milk but it will only drink the milk portion. It will leave behind water. The swam has got this special quality. Means it is able to take the essence of the mixture of the milk and water. What is the essence? The milk. So it is able to take the nectar the amrita and leave behind the water. Similarly a Paramahamsa is a person who can extract the spiritual essence from a mixture of spirit and matter. So not only he can separate spirit from matter but he can also take the spiritual essence from a mixture of spirit and matter. So such a Paramahamsa specially for a Paramahamsa Vyasa Deva has compiled this Sriman Bhagavatam. So therefore this Bhagavatam is also called

**Key Quote:** "The author who has compiled the Vedanta Sutra himself has explained the Vedanta Sutra in the form of Sriman Bhagavatam."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the Bhagavatam is the author's own commentary on the Vedanta Sutra, making it crucial for understanding the correct meaning of the sutras.

Paramahamsa Samhita. It is also the literature which is the commentary or the explanation of the Vedanta Sutra by the author himself. As I said Vedanta Sutra is the cream of the cream. So it is very difficult to understand. For most people this Vedanta Sutra is difficult to understand. And even those who try to study the Vedanta Sutra after studying Sanskrit after studying the other Vedic literature they may misunderstand the meaning of the Sutras. There is a possibility that somebody even if they study in a scholarly way the Vedic literature and try to understand the meaning of the Vedanta Sutra they may misunderstand the meaning. In order to explain correctly the meaning of the Vedanta Sutra the author who has compiled the Vedanta Sutra himself has explained the Vedanta Sutra in the form of Sriman Bhagavatam. Therefore the Bhagavatam is so important in the literature. It is the ultimate Vedic book book of the Vedas book of the Vedic knowledge because it contains the cream of the cream of the Vedas and it also is presented in the form of a Purana Purana means historical narration so there are many Vedic books that contain the cream of the Vedanta Sutra so there are nice historical incidents described which make it very interesting. In the Vedanta Sutra there is no historical narration so it is very dry no stories no historical incidents it is very dry. So this Bhagavatam which explains the Vedanta Sutra is presented in a very unique format of a Purana. Also it explains the Vedanta Sutra which may be misunderstood by even some great scholars. So the author himself is explaining the Vedanta Sutra what is the meaning of the sutras in this Bhagavatam. Therefore this Bhagavatam is the most important Vedic literature.

**Summary:** The speaker recommends studying the Bhagavad Gita as a preliminary step before studying the Bhagavatam, highlighting the Gita's importance as the essence of all Upanishads.

But the Bhagavatam is also not recommended to be studied directly or as the first book because it explains the Vedanta Sutra it is not again to be studied as the first book. So preliminary study of the Bhagavatam it is recommended to study the Bhagavad Gita. It is very impressive literature. What is the special position of the Bhagavad Gita? Just like Bhagavatam has got a very special position from all various literatures the Bhagavad Gita also has got a very special position. What is that? The Bhagavad Gita is the essence of all the Upanishads. So just like the Vedanta Sutra is the essence of all the Upanishads the Bhagavad Gita also is an essence of all the Upanishads. And Bhagavad Gita is presented as a conversation or a dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna and it is also the essence of all the Upanishads. The Bhagavad Gita also is a very important Vedic literature. So the study of Bhagavad Gita as the preliminary study of the Bhagavatam and the actual study of the Bhagavatam itself are the Vedas these two books which are the Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam. If you study the Bhagavad Gita and you study the Bhagavatam you know the Vedas entirely what they are actually communicating. The entire Vedic message Vedic philosophy

One lakh verses are there in the Mahabharata. So Vyasa Deva also wanted to summarize the Mahabharata and give the essence of the Vedic philosophy in the Mahabharata and in the Vedic philosophy. So Vyasa Deva also wanted to summarize the essence of the teachings of the Vedas which is explained elaborately in the Mahabharata in the form of Bhagavad Gita. Therefore what did Vyasa Deva do?

in the Bhagavad Gita but even that Bhagavad Gita is actually interpreted in so many ways Krishna's words are interpreted not taken directly into interpretation because of which Krishna is not understood properly but the Bhagavad Gita is exclusively glorifying Krishna exclusively describing who is Krishna so therefore Bhagavad Gita is very very important now that Krishna who he is is explained in the Bhagavad Gita also in four verses called the Jatashloki Bhagavatam now Krishna is speaking to Brahma and Krishna is telling who he is in these four verses so that is explained in the four verses and that is the essence of the entire Bhagavatam and the Bhagavatam is specially glorifying or describing or explaining who is Krishna and according to the Bhagavatam and according to the Bhagavad Gita Krishna is the absolute truth he is the supreme person he is a transcendental personality he is not an ordinary person he is the ultimate source of everything described in the Bhagavad Gita as Aam Sarvasya Prabhavo described in the Vedanta Sutra described in the Bhagavatam as Aham eva Sam eva Gre in this verse so he is the supreme person he is the transcendental personality he is the absolute truth he is the source of everything

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a mango fruit and its juice to explain 'Rasa,' comparing it to the nectarian essence that is even more relishable than the fruit itself.

Rasa means the nectarian essence of a fruit just like you got a mango fruit you relish eating the mango fruit but you can even go relish drinking the mango juice correct mango juice right even in a fruit fruit is relishable but what is the most relishable part of the fruit the nectarian juice Amruta so what Shukadeva Goswami has done is the Bhagavatam which is like the ripened fruit of the Vedic tree of knowledge right the best part of the tree is the fruit the essence of the tree is there in the seed right if you take a banyan tree inside the banyan seed is a whole tree right so the seed can be considered to be the essence of the tree so the entire tree you can say is there in the seed so the essence of the tree is the seed but seed is not necessarily the most relishable part of a tree what is the most relishable part of a tree the fruit now the fruit it is the most relishable part of a tree even more better than the seed because not only contains the essence of the tree but it also contains the most relishable part of the tree

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Shukadeva Goswami made the Bhagavatam more relishable, like the ripened fruit of the Vedic tree of knowledge, by speaking it to Parikshit Maharaja.

if you take a mango fruit you can nicely relish it also contains the most relishable part of the tree but even more valuable is the nectarine juice of the fruit the rasam rasam is even more valuable than the fruit if you have fruit you take the juice that is even more relishable even the fruit right so that rasam is presented by yasadeva and that rasam has become more relishable by coming out of the lips of shukadeva swami what has shukadeva swami done this is to make more relishable more material by making it easily palatable for all classes of men otherwise bhagavatam could have been relished only by some people typically bhagavatam is only relished by the paramahamsas that's why everyone can relish the bhagavatam if they hear from the lips of shukadeva swami so that is the special contribution of shukadeva swami

**Key Quote:** "Just like a parrot makes the mango very, very, very, very relishable, more nectarean, Shukadeva Goswami made this Bhagavatam more relishable."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why Shukadeva Goswami is called 'Shuka' (parrot), drawing a parallel between a parrot making a mango more relishable and Shukadeva Goswami making the Bhagavatam more relishable through his narration.

now why his name is shuka because it is said that people in the past you must take care of his name which is his name shukadeva swami for his body and life the lion and the fennec and the tiger that is promised then it is seen in his head before the it is a monkey it is a snake and he is a few birds of the then the fruit becomes even more sweeter. A mango fruit touched by the beak of a parrot becomes even more relishable. Fruit by itself is relishable. A ripened mango fruit by itself is relishable. But if a parrot touches it, parrot's beak touches it, parrot's mouth touches it, then it becomes even more relishable. Similarly, Bhagavatam, because it contains the rasa, bhakti rasa, it is relishable. It is very relishable. But it became more so when it came out of the mouth of Shukadeva Goswami. Just like a mango fruit when touched by the beak of a parrot becomes very relishable. Therefore, the name of the son of Vyasadeva who presented the Bhagavatam is called Shuka, compared to a parrot. Just like a parrot makes the mango very, very, very, very relishable, more nectarean, Shukadeva Goswami made this Bhagavatam more relishable by speaking the Bhagavatam to Parishad Mahabharata. So that conversation we are studying. In that conversation, this important aspect of who is Krishna is explained, the philosophy of who is Krishna, who is Krishna is explained in these four verses. So we will go through this little slowly and try to understand. I will stop here.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the Paramahamsa stage, emphasizing pure devotion to Krishna and explaining how the essence of sannyasa is adapted for preaching in Kali Yuga.

As the Paramahamsa is above all varnas and all ashramas, he's a pure devotee. Devotees who are fully devoted to serving Krishna without caring for any personal comforts, they are actually paramahamsas. So these strict rules of sannyas are not possible to be followed in Kali Yuga. Therefore, in Kali Yuga it is said sannyas is forbidden, but even the followers of Chaitanya, they accept the essence of this principle of sannyas, which is traveling and preaching, and some minimum rules of sannyas are accepted, but not all the rules, so that the preaching can be done without much difficulty, and that's our main business.

**Summary:** Srivas Thakur, considered an incarnation of Narada Muni, emphasizes the importance of devotion over mere scholarship, advising a young Nimai Pandit to worship Krishna.

Sri Srivas Pandit is described as the incarnation of Narada Muni. Through Srivas Thakur, Lord Chaitanya taught that he is conquered by the love of his devotees and how anyone who is dear to his devotee also conquers his heart. Srivas Pandit appeared at Biyani Bazar in Shilha district as the second son of Sri Jaladhar Pandit. It is mentioned in Chaitanya Charita Amrita that Srivas had three brothers: Sri Rama, Sri Pati, and Sri Nidhi. But Jaladhar Pandit had an older son named Nalina Pandita who disappeared when the family lived in Biyani Bazar. When Srivas was 12 years old, Jaladhar took his family to Navadvipa and remained there. Because young Nimai Pandit seemed to have grown arrogant by his scholarship, one day Srivas told him, "Why do you people undertake study so that they might understand what is devotion to Sri Krishna? If by scholarship one does not gain such devotion, then how will that learning help him? It simply becomes a tedious endeavour which in the end is nothing but a waste of time. If you have actually learned something, then begin your worship of Sri Krishna now." Nimai laughed and replied, "By your mercy certainly that will come to be. If you are all kind enough to me,"

One night while Lord Gauranga was engaged in Kirtan, the son of Srivas Thakur who was suffering from fever left his body. The lady started weeping very loudly. Srivas Thakur on hearing the news, quickly ran into the room and found his son's dead body. He told the ladies to give up this crime, that there should be no grief, that even a most sinful person who dies while hearing the holy name and glories of Krishna will be liberated. He told them, "My son is so fortunate to have left his body hearing the harinam and kirtan of Lord Chaitanya and his devotees. Now if you wish to cry, do it silently in your own heart. But do not tell anyone what has happened because if you disturb the ecstatic dancing of my Lord Gauranga, then I will tie a pot around my neck and drown myself in the Ganges today." After speaking all these words, Srivas Thakur went back into the kirtan and with a big smile on his face began dancing with Lord Chaitanya and Vaishnavas. The kirtan went on throughout the entire night. When Mahaprabhu came to know of the passing of Srivas' son, he cried tears of love and said, "How could I ever leave the association of such a pure devotee as Srivas Thakur? He loves me so much that he does not even express his gratitude. He does not even express his grief over the death of his own son." Mahaprabhu gave this benediction to Srivas: "There will never be poverty in your house. If you simply remain indoors,"

**Summary:** The speaker explains that there is no safe place in the material world and we should strive to return to the spiritual world.

If we carefully study the scriptures, we understand there is no safe place which is free from all dangers in this material existence. Material existence means anytime there can be death. So, therefore, it is only because of the influence of the illusory energy that we think that sometimes I am safe, sometimes there is danger for my life. Actually, dangers are always existing. But where is absolute safety in this material world? There is no place which is absolutely safe. So, unless we come out of illusion, we are unable to realize that we should not stay in this material world even one moment more. We should immediately get out of material existence and go to our original position.

**Summary:** Explanation of Durga Devi's role in the pastime of Rukmini's marriage to Krishna, where Rukmini worshipped Durga before her marriage.

She is Durga Devi, and who Durga Devi is, is very nicely explained by Prabhupad in the Krishnabook. This is the instance where Rukmini, who was kidnapped by Krishna on the request of Rukmini. So she was arranged to be married to Shishupala, but she wrote to Krishna that I don't want to marry him, I want to marry you. Of course, Rukmini is eternally the consort of Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Ordinary people pray to Durga for material wealth, fame, profit, strength and so on. Rukmini, however, desired to have Krishna for her husband."
**Summary:** Discussion of Durga's children (Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha, Kartikeya) and the difference between praying to Durga for material benefits versus pure devotion to Krishna, as exemplified by Rukmini.

So Srila Prabhupada says, Goddess Durga has four famous children. If you carefully observe the deity here, Dateshwari, Durga Devi, you can see her four children there with her. Who are the four children? Two daughters, the goddess of fortune Lakshmi and the goddess of learning Saraswati. Where we had the Guru Puja, you can more clearly see that. Extreme ends are Ganesha to your left and Kartikeya to your right, extreme right. And then Lakshmi to the left, Saraswati to the right, to your right. And, so here Prabhupada says, she has two daughters, Lakshmi and Saraswati, and she has two sons, Ganesha and Kartikeya. They are all considered demigods and demigoddesses. Since goddess Durga is always worshipped with her famous children, Rukmini specifically offered her prayers to the deity in that way. However, her prayers were very special. Ordinary people pray to Durga for material wealth, fame, profit, strength and so on. Rukmini, however, desired to have Krishna for her husband. And therefore, she prayed that the deity be pleased with her and bless her with that benediction. Since she desired only Krishna, her worship of the demigods is not condemned. Then, Srila Prabhupada also says in the same chapter,

the Gopis worshipped goddess Katyaini to get Krishna as their husband. Similarly, Rukmini was thinking of the various types of demigods, not for material benefit, but in respect to Krishna. Praying to the demigods to achieve the favour of Krishna is not irregular. And Rukmini was fully absorbed in thoughts of Krishna. In the Chaitanya Charita Amrita, Srila Prabhupada says about this mention of the demigods in the Brahma Samhita. Srila Prabhupada says, In the Brahma Samhita, there are mantras offering obeisances to Lord Shiva, Lord Brahma, the Sun God, Lord Ganesha, as well as Lord Vishnu, all of whom are worshipped by the impersonalists as Panchopasana. Vaishnavas can also worship all these demigods, but only on the principles of the Brahma Samhita, which is recommended by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. We may note in this connection, the mantras for worshipping Lord Shiva, Lord Brahma, Lord Durga, Sun God, and Ganesha,

he very nicely explains the details about Durga Devi. Very concisely he explains, the world in which Brahma takes his stand and hymns the Lord of Goloka. Brahma is worshipping Krishna by chanting these prayers. But here, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur explains, this world is called Devi Dhama, consisting of 14 worlds, 14 planetary systems. And Durga is its creator. She is the siding deity of the entire material universe. She is ten-armed. If you closely look here, there also you can see. She is having ten hands, representing the ten-fold fructive activities. Generally people worship Durga Devi with some material desires. And those desires that she can fulfil for this fructive people are ten kinds of different divisions of these benefits she can bestow. She rides on the lion, representing her heroic prowess. She is always riding a lion, that you can clearly see also. She tramples down Mahishasura, representing the subduer of all vices. Even though Durga is worshipped by so many asuras and so many sinful people. But she never is kind to them. She always deals with them very very sternly. So she subdues all vices by her power. She is the mother of two sons, Kartikeya and Ganesha, representing beauty and success. So people always worship materialistic people, Ganesha. For what? For success. So Ganesha represents success in this material world. And Kartikeya, you clearly see there, he is dressed like a very handsome prince. Correct? So he represents mundane beauty. So materialistic persons worship Kartikeya for bodily beauty. She is placed between Lakshmi and Saraswati, representing mundane opulence and mundane knowledge.

**Summary:** Comparison of material and spiritual opulence (Lakshmi) and knowledge (Saraswati), and the symbolism of Durga holding a snake representing destructive time (Kala).

In the material world, Lakshmi as the daughter of Durga Devi, she represents material opulence. Whereas Lakshmi in the spiritual world is actually the personification of spiritual opulence. Spiritual wealth. And similarly, Saraswati in the material world represents material knowledge. That's why in school, when we were studying at least, they used to tell us, worship Saraswati, pray to Saraswati, then you can do well in your exams of this mundane education system. So that Saraswati, whom they were referring to, ordinary people refer to, is the goddess of material knowledge. But Saraswati in the spiritual world is actually representing transcendental knowledge, not material knowledge. She is armed with twenty weapons. Of course, in this form of Durga, ten hands, she is having ten weapons. But, she is actually armed with twenty weapons, representing the various pious activities enjoined by the Vedas for suppression of the vices, suppression of all sins. Twenty different pious activities are given in the Vedas and her twenty weapons represent those twenty pious activities. She holds the snake, representing the beauty of destructive time. Snake is also called Kala Sattva. Means, Kala is always destroying. Krishna says this in the Bhagavad Gita, 11th chapter. Kalosmi Lokakshayakrut. Shaya means destroy, destruction. So, Kala simply destroys, destroys, destroys, destroys, destroys. So, that is the symbol which she is holding. Symbolically, she is holding the snake, representing destructive time.

Such is Durga, possessing all these manifold forms. Durga is possessed of Durga. Durga means the prison house. When Jeevas, begotten of the marginal potency, Tatastha Shakti, forget the service of Krishna, they are confined in this mundane prison house, the citadel of Durga. As soon as we forget Krishna, we are imprisoned in this material world. The wheel of Karma is the incident of the material world. The wheel of Karma is the instrument of punishment at this place. Kala Chakra is also called sometimes the wheel of Karma. The work of purifying these penalized Jeevas is the duty devolved upon Durga. Even though Durga appears to be very cruel, but actually she is serving Krishna in a very peculiar way. So, she is purifying the Jeevas by giving them suitable punishment for their reformation. She is incessantly, incessantly means continuously, engaged in discharging the same by the will of Govinda. Ichchanu roopam appears as the one who carries out all her activities exactly in accordance with the will of Govinda.

Durga Devi actually puts everybody under illusion because of which they think they are the Lords. Krishna is not the Lord. There is no separate Lord. Everyone thinks I am the Lord. Under the control of Durga Devi. But because of the illusory energy, the illusion that Durga Devi puts them under, they think that they are independent.

only. Therefore, for devotees in the material world, when we become devotees or when we surrender to Durga Devi, the same Durga Devi who is responsible for putting all the conditioned souls under the illusion, all the forgetful souls under the illusion, she becomes the agency for delivering the devotees. Sometimes devotees think that Durga Devi is anyway meant for putting all the obstacles or she puts obstacles on the path of their progress when they want to lord over or they want to enjoy. She creates all kinds of burdens. So, devotees sometimes think that when I am trying to do devotional service, if there is any obstacle, they think the cause is Krishna who has taken charge of the devotees, who gives a token reaction just to remind you that these desires which you are seeking fulfillment of even after becoming devotees is actually an obstacle for your path of progress in your life. You have to give up these material desires. Krishna gives a very very small reaction, a token reaction as Prabhupada says. It is very much reduced. That little reaction is to remind us that we should give up all our material desires and simply act as a master and prepare ourselves to quickly get out of this place and go to the spiritual

As devotees we can expect the mercy of Durga by worshipping Krishna. And Prabhupada says whenever devotees visit the temples of either Durga or Shiva they are servants of Krishna. They are not equal with Krishna. Therefore even if one goes to a temple of the demigods one should not accept the deities as they are accepted by the impersonalists. All of them are to be accepted as personal demigods but they all serve the order of the deities. So if one can offer respect even to an ant why not to the demigods? Prabhupada is telling you that if one can offer respect even to an immortal being then one must always know however that no demigod is equal to or above the Supreme Lord. Only Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and all others including the demigods such as Lord Shiva Lord Brahma Goddess Durga are surely eternal servants of the Lord. Never consider demigods equal to or greater than Krishna but at the same time we should not fail to show proper respect to the demigods and what is that showing proper respect? We bow down to them as personalities who are devotees of Krishna and demigods in this material world. For they are placed in that position only by Krishna control us subordinate control us to

What is done is an old cow or an old bull is offered in sacrifice, but after that sacrifice the animal is revived. The soul in the animal's body is getting a new body.

We are unable to. Yet the fact remains that something is flowing into us. Another example I have given several times is about if you wear rubber gloves on your hand and you keep it on a hot plate, you won't feel the heat. But if you hold it for some time, slowly you will feel the heat. Why? Because the heat goes through the rubber gloves and then you start feeling it. In the same way, even though Shakti Avesha Nama is on my tongue, if I chant and hear, I am not getting the full taste. Please understand, because still the rubber gloves is there. My mind is contaminated. My Chittam is contaminated. Through the contaminated, through the gloves only I am touching. My attention is coming through that and touching. So I will definitely not feel the full. Somebody asked if I have Satchidananda, why immediately I am not enlightened. So limitation is us.

**Key Quote:** "And then we touch the Nama of the Lord on the tongue. That is called the hearing embrace or the attention embrace."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the process of chanting and hearing as an 'embrace' that gradually melts away the contamination (rubber gloves) of our false ego, allowing us to experience the warmth and transformative power of the holy name.

Limitation is our Chitta. And then we touch the Nama of the Lord on the tongue. That is called the hearing embrace or the attention embrace. And bead after bead we will feel this warmth. I don't want to mislead you by saying that okay you will become ecstatic, bead after bead if you chant and hear that very sound. No, it will take time, but heat will come. Some heat will come. And you go on. What is that called? Embrace. Continue the attention embrace. What will happen? More and more heat as it comes, more duration you hold, more heat reaches your head. Slowly it will also melt the rubber. This exact action of the Shakti Ayesha Nama. It will melt. It will dissolve our false ego. Dissolve our illusions.

**Key Quote:** "Finally real ego is there. Real ego is there. Then real mind is there."
**Summary:** This segment explains that as the false ego dissolves, the pure ego manifests, awakening our spiritual senses and allowing us to chant and hear the Shuddha Nama (pure name) of the Lord, leading to spiritual realization through connection with pure devotees and the Dhamma.

And then our pure ego will manifest. When the pure ego touches with its attention, now real ego. Real ego is through false ego we are touching the Nama. So what is the result? This false ego is like the rubber gloves, going to go on melting. Finally real ego is there. Real ego is there. Then real mind is there. Spiritual mind is there. It awakens. Then spiritual tongue awakens. Spiritual mind, senses, ears awaken. You can chant and hear the Shuddha Nama of the Lord, unmodified. Un是啊. Only the Shuddhas can do it. You can do it. It doesn't really matter. When you connect to the Shuddhas it doesn't matter. Any spiritual environment is the same. As long as you connect to them it is the same. Everything is in harmony. And sudden spiritual realization takes place. When you connect to the Dhamma you feel all things. As long as you connect to the Dhamma you feel all things. When you connect to the Dhamma you feel all things as well.

**Key Quote:** "That change of body is called death and rebirth, punar janma."
**Summary:** The soul is immutable and undergoes transmigration, accepting new bodies upon the death of the old one, a process known as death and rebirth.

It is immutable; it does not undergo any change. Whatever changes we see are changes of the body, or even the changes that we perceive in a person are the changes in the mind. But the soul is different from the body and the mind, so the soul is unchanging; it is immutable. As a person puts on new garments, giving up old and useless ones, the soul similarly accepts new bodies, material bodies, giving up old and useless ones. So Krishna explains that when the body becomes old and useless, that is when we give up this body and we accept another new material body.

In the people, other than the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna Himself, comes and delivers the people. So, for this reason, he began to worship Krishna, particularly he chose to worship Krishna in the form of Saligram Shila. Why? There are several reasons, but two important reasons I'll mention. Saligram Shila is self-manifest, self-manifest Deity in this world. Saligram Shila is Krishna appearing in the form of a stone with certain markings, and you directly take the Saligram Shila and begin worshipping. You don't have to do what is called as Prana Pratishta. You don't have to install this Deity. This is a very, very special Deity of Krishna. Eight forms and eight different substances, we can make the Deity according to Shastra. And then after making the Deity according to scriptural directions, we have to install. Saligram Shila, no installation. Directly you take and start worshipping. So Saligram Shila is Sakshat Krishna.

Of all the Deities that you can worship, all types of Deity worship you can do, the easiest is to worship the Saligram Shila. Of course, as Krishna says, the only requirement for doing any service, devotional service of worshipping the Supreme Lord is our Bhakti. But with devotion, the Saligram Shila is to be worshipped with two items. Tudasi, I will tell you a prayer which Ajay Dacharya offered to Krishna. All of you repeat this prayer. Tudasi, dada, matrena, jalasya, chulakenava, vikrinete, swamatmanam, bhaktebhyo, bhaktavatsalaham. Now this verse was chanted by Advaita Acharya to worship Krishna in the form of Saligram Shila. Saligram Shila is very easy to please by just offering two items. Tudasi, dada, matrena. Just one leaf of Tudasi. One leaf of Tudasi. As Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, patram, pushpam, phalam, toyam, yome, bhaktya prayatchati. One can offer Krishna with devotion either a leaf or a flower or one fruit or a little water. So these two items, patram and toyam, are particularly mentioned in this prayer to Krishna. Tudasi, dada, matrena, particularly Tudasi leaf. And jalasya, chulakenava, one palmful of water. One palmful of water. Of course, the water should be Ganga Jal. But you can invoke Ganga

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna values devotion so much that He considers Himself sold to a devotee who offers even a simple Tulasi leaf and water with love.

just by chanting the name of Ganga. Okay? And just these two items, Krishna says, if it is offered with devotion, particularly to the Saligram Shila, Krishna thinks that there is nothing in my possession that is equivalent to one Tudasi leaf and a palmful of water offered with devotion by my devotee. So how does, how can Krishna reciprocate? He can't just receive whatever the devotee is offering with love and devotion and be, you know, just be just neutral about it. He has to give back something. He has to reciprocate. So Krishna considers, what can I give my devotee? My devotee will never accept anything that I give which is actually in my possession. My devotee doesn't want anything. In exchange for what the devotees offer, they don't want anything. So what can I give? And then Krishna thinks, also Krishna thinks, I have nothing in my possession which is equivalent to any of these two items. So, He Himself, vikrinete svamatmanam He sells Himself completely to His devotee. He offers Himself to His devotee. In exchange for just one Tudasi leaf and a palmful of water offered with devotion.

This is the way Krishna reciprocates. So this prayer from the Gautamiya Tantra came to the mind of Advaita Acharya. How to actually make sure that Krishna comes down for this purpose of delivering the whole world. So he decided to worship the Saligram Shila and based on this prayer he was sure that Krishna will definitely come down and answer my prayer if I offer the Saligram Shila with devotion just one Tudasi leaf and a palmful of water. vikrinete svamatmanam bhaktebhyo bhakta vatsalah Because Krishna is very very very very very affectionate to His devotees. Krishna is very affectionate to His devotees. So in exchange for the devotees offering one Tudasi leaf and a palmful of water, Krishna sells Himself to His devotee. When Durvasamani approached Krishna in Vaikuntha so he was seeking protection against the attack of the Sudarshan Chakra. So Vishnu said of course he approached Vishnu in Vaikuntha, Narayana. So Narayana said I am not independent I have sold myself to my devotees I am the property of my devotees. So if at all you want anything from me you have to go to my devotee. I can't give you because I am not independent I am not free. So like that actually this prayer also says Krishna sells Himself to His devotee. So therefore Krishna is the property of His pure devotees. They have got pure devotion to Him. Krishna is the property of His pure devotees.

**Key Quote:** "Desiring to understand the glory of Radharani's love."
**Summary:** The speaker begins to explain the three internal reasons for Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's appearance, starting with Krishna's desire to understand the glory of Radharani's love.

This describes the three internal reasons for Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's appearing in this world. So the prayer itself contains the reasons directly. Desiring to understand the glory of Radharani's love the wonderful Okay, that's the first reason. Desiring to understand the glory of Radharani's love. Now what is special about Radharani's love that even Krishna is so attracted by it and he desires to understand what is the kind of love that Radharani has for me. What is the significance of this? See, Krishna loves Radharani Radharani loves Krishna. Okay, it's mutual, reciprocal. Okay. But Krishna is actually seeing that the pleasure I experience by loving Radharani the happiness I get by loving Radharani Krishna is unlimited Lord. Everything about him is unlimited. Obviously he experiences unlimited pleasure in loving his devotees, particularly Radharani. Okay. But still Krishna feels that Radharani experiences more happiness in her devotional service to me offering her love to me her loving service than I experience in actually loving Radharani or serving Radharani or offering my reciprocation to Radharani. So he is very curious how is it that Radharani is experiencing more happiness more pleasure than me in her devotional service to me. So Krishna is unable to figure this out fathom this understand this. So in order to understand this he takes the position of Radharani as a devotee and he himself worships Krishna he himself serves Krishna he himself offers his love to Krishna. Okay.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The wonderful qualities in him that she alone relishes through her love."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the second internal reason: Krishna wants to understand the special qualities of Radharani that allow her to relish His wonderful qualities in a unique way.

So the first reason is desiring to understand the glory of Radharani's love. The second one is the wonderful qualities in him that she alone relishes through her love. Krishna is full of unlimited wonderful qualities. But who is able to relish those wonderful qualities the best devotees relish those qualities of course of Krishna. They are full of appreciation and they treasure that Krishna's wonderful qualities. And there is a verse in the Bhagavatam first canto with Chaitanya Mahaprabhu explained in sixty one ways Atma Rama verse. What does that verse say? Atma Ramasya Munayo nirgranta api urukrame kurvanti ahetuteem bhakti ittham bhuta guno harihi Okay, this is a very big explanation is there. Ittham bhuta guno harihi Krishna is able to attract everybody in the whole creation, existence by his unlimited qualities. And because each jiva, each devotee has got something unique in their constitution. So if you are attracted by one particular quality of Krishna I will be attracted by some other quality of Krishna. Somebody else will be attracted by some other quality of Krishna. So there are no qualities which is lacking in Krishna which will attract every single jiva, every single devotee to Krishna. Therefore Krishna is the only one who is all attracted. Krishna is the only one who is all attracted. But in spite of Krishna having all the wonderful qualities by which he attracts everyone still he is wondering what are the special things about Radharani that she alone relishes through her love all those wonderful qualities in Krishna. So he wants to know that. So that is the second reason why he appears as taken in half with him. He takes the position of Radharani and tries to relish those qualities in him in Krishna which he has taken in half with him. He has taken the position of Radharani and tries to relish those qualities in him in Krishna with Radharani which Radharani otherwise alone relishes.

**Key Quote:** "The happiness she feels when she realizes the sweetness of his love that is the third reason."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes the explanation of the three internal reasons, focusing on Krishna's desire to experience the happiness Radharani feels when she realizes the sweetness of His love.

And the third one is the happiness she feels when she realizes the sweetness of his love. There is a happiness in all kinds of reciprocation of Krishna. When a devotee prays to Krishna for anything Krishna is very pleased to actually award that whatever the devotee asks of course provided you ask with devotion. Even otherwise if somebody doesn't ask with devotion still Krishna will award whatever anybody asks because he is situated as Paramatma in everyone's heart in the material world. And people don't have devotion in this material world. When they go to God or even go to a demigod or even perform some pious activities it's ultimately Krishna only who awards the result of somebody's pious activities or the result of worshipping demigods or the result of even doing Atheists doing hard work. Atheists doing whatever they do to get some fulfillment of desire including the Asuras. It is Krishna alone as Paramatma who satisfies all his desires. Okay. So Krishna actually satisfies everyone's desires and particularly he is very pleased to satisfy his devotees who never ask him anything who never ask him anything. So Krishna is looking for what does my devotee want what will satisfy him. The devotees don't ask pure devotees don't ask anything from Krishna. So what will Krishna do? Krishna is always looking for an opportunity to serve his devotees in any way he can. Just like devotees are always looking for opportunity to serve Krishna in all possible ways to please him. Same thing. So now Radharani she relishes delicious Okay. Now last last reason the happiness she feels when she realizes the sweetness of his love that is the third reason. Now Krishna says I'll complete this translation the Supreme Lord Hari richly endowed with her emotions appeared from the womb of Srimati and the Lord and the Lord of the world and the universe as I said in the book of Srimati and the universe and the universe in this
