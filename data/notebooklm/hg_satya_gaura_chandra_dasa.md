**Key Quote:** "When any Vedic statement is made, that itself is an evidence. There is no need of any proof."
**Summary:** The speaker argues that Vedic knowledge, originating from Vyasadeva, doesn't require external scientific proof because it is inherently complete and consistent, unlike fields like mathematics.

The modern mind is so diseased, when we hear something, we immediately try to find a proof for it from the scientific field or some other field. We try to bring some arguments to prove this Vedic statement. No, that is not the proper way of understanding this Vedic knowledge. So, Vyasadeva, who is an incarnation of Krishna, he himself has given this knowledge. I came across one theorem in mathematics. It is called Godel's theorem of incompleteness. One mathematician proved that mathematics is not complete and consistent. So, mathematicians themselves proved that mathematics is incomplete. So, by holding on to the incomplete field, how can you learn conclusive truths? That's why such fields of approach to knowledge, they are compared to holding on to the dog's tail to cross the ocean of science, whereas Prabhupada's books and knowledge are complete and consistent. Now, you can see the value. Prabhupada says, "These are not my books. These are written by Vyasadeva. This knowledge is coming from Vyasadeva." When any Vedic statement is made, that itself is an evidence. There is no need of any proof.

**Key Quote:** "Thus, we also expect the Lord to protect us from this dangerous condition."
**Summary:** HG Satya Gaura Chandra Dasa reads from Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining how the Lord has protected devotees in the past and expressing hope for similar protection in the present.

OM NAMO BHAGAVATE VASUDEVAYA Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 6, Chapter 9, and Texts 23, 24 and 25. I will read the first two verses myself. Text 23: The Manu, named King Satyavrata, formally saved himself by tying the small boat of the entire world to the horn of the Masya Avatara, the Fish Incarnation. By the grace of the Masya Avatara, Manu saved himself from the great danger of the flood. May that same Fish Incarnation save us from the great danger. May that same Fish Incarnation save us from the great and fearful danger caused by the son of Tvasta. Text 24: In the beginning of creation, a tremendous wind caused fierce waves of inundating water. Text 25: In the beginning of creation, a tremendous wind caused fierce waves of inundating water. The great waves made such a horrible sound that Lord Brahma almost fell from his seat and the lotus into the water of devastation. But he was saved with the help of the Lord.

### illusion, perception of God, conditioned soul

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This is why we cannot understand who God is or see Him face to face."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why conditioned souls cannot see God, even when He appears before them, because they falsely believe themselves to be independent controllers.

Thus, we also expect the Lord to protect us from this dangerous condition. Text 25: Ya Eka Eesho Nijamaya Ya Naham Sasarjaya Nanu Shujama Vishvam Vayamnaya Syaapipurah Sameeha Taha Pashyamalingam Prudhagisham Anina Pashyamalingam Prudhagisham Anina Translation and purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swamishya Prabhupada Translation: The Supreme Personality of Godhead who created us by His external potency, and by whose mercy we expand the creation of the universe, is always situated before us as the Supersoul, but we cannot see His form. We are unable to see Him because all of us think that we are separate and independent gods. Purport by Shri Prabhupada: Here is an explanation of why the conditioned soul cannot see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, face to face. Even though the Lord appears before us as Lord Krishna or Lord Ramachandra and lives in human society as a leader or king, the conditioned soul cannot understand Him. Abhajananti Mamudha Manushim Tanumashritam Rascals, mudhas, deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, thinking Him an ordinary human being. However, insignificantly, the Lord appears before us as Lord Krishna, and we think that we are also God, that we can create a universe, that we can create, or that we can create another God. This is why we cannot see or understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this regard, Shri Madhvacharya says, Lingam eva pashyamaha kadachit abhimanastu. Devanam apisanyava prayaha kaleshu nastya va taratam yena sopitu We are all conditioned to various degrees, but we think we are God. This is why we cannot understand who God is or see Him face to face.

**Key Quote:** "Because we think that we are also an independent controller."
**Summary:** The speaker provides the context of the verses, explaining that the demigods are offering prayers to the Lord because they are bewildered by the power of a demon.

The sense of the Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada. So we are reading from the chapter title, The Appearance of Godhead, The Appearance of the Demon Vrutrasura. And in this chapter, we have seen a few shlokas back that Demon Vrutrasura indeed makes His appearance. And so the demigods, looking at His power, they become bewildered, and in a helpless situation, they are offering their prayers to the Supreme Lord. So here, they are mentioning some examples of how Krishna or the Lord has protected His devotees previously. So they are appealing to the Lord to protect them similarly this time. And so, here, in the last shloka, they are mentioning, although the Lord is before us in the form of the Supersoul, we are not able to see Him. We are not able to understand or not able to see Him because pashyama lingam prudha-eeshamanina because we think that we are also an independent controller.

### intelligence, universal intelligence, ants

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "How is it that the smallest, the living entity that we see, is exhibiting such a powerful intelligence, and skill?"
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of ants, highlighting their complex behaviors like seed preservation and surgery, to illustrate the presence of a universal intelligence.

So that is the context. Actually, nowadays, it looks like there is a lot of research going on about ants. You know, the scientists are interested to understand what the ants are doing. And, you know, generally, ants, I quoted this example in one of the classes also, the ants, they save the grains for the rainy day, you know, for this season. So, when the scientists are analyzing, they understood that whenever an ant gets a grain, it divides that into two and keeps them into their godown. Ants have godowns, storekeepers, everything is there. So then they were very curious, why is the ant breaking the grain into two? Then they figured out that if the grain is broken, then it will not, you know, germinate. It will not become a seedling, a small plant. So, that's why the ants break the seeds, so that it won't grow into some plant or something and they miss the food. So that's going on. And meanwhile, they saw there is one coriander seed. And this time, the ant has broken the coriander seed into four parts. And they were surprised. Why is this? Other seeds are only two. Now it is broken into four. So they started analyzing. They found that coriander seed, if you break them into two, still seedling is possible. It can germinate and become small seedlings. So that's why the ant knows that this is a coriander seed. And if I break only into two, then, you know, it will not, this, it is not okay. So it breaks them into four. And then the story, in a rehearsal, the scientists are blown off. How is it that they are so intelligent? We also don't know that coriander seed. Ants have such an intelligence. Even scientists are bewildered. Then, the story goes one step further. Then they found, one day they saw one of the ants, fellow ants, got injured. In the day-to-day existence, they have very fragile legs. And, you know, whole body is very small. So then, one of the fellow ants came to this ant and found that, that fragile leg. Something gone wrong. And then, in front of the eyes of the scientists, that ant has performed a surgery and amputated that leg of the fellow ant, which got injured. So now the scientists are blown off. They are thinking, only human society has surgeons. Here is a much more skilled surgeon. In fact, they found that the fellow ant doesn't do operations every time. First it analyzes whether it can be cured by some medicine. If not, then it does a skilled operation and removes that little portion. They found that 90% success rate in the surgery. Other cases, probably they wouldn't have seen. 100%. Nowadays, I mean, not all doctors, but some doctors, you go with any problem, they immediately say, surgery. Cut it. But ant is not saying, first it will analyze whether medicine is okay. And then, if not, then do the surgery. How is it that the smallest living entity that we see, is exhibiting such a powerful intelligence and skill? This is a big mystery for the scientists.

### intelligence, universal intelligence, Krishna

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So, one has to understand that there is an energy which is actually working in this world."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the intelligence observed in nature, like in the ant society, points to a universal intelligence ultimately coming from Krishna.

Because, in human society, if somebody has to become a surgeon, first five years of MBBS, and before that you have to cross NEET, that examination, and then five years of MBBS, and then after that, there is a specialization. You know, you get, you become a surgeon. That is the, so, just to develop such a talent and skill, in the human society we see, it takes so many years, but here we are seeing, in the ant society, very, that kind of skilled operations they are able to do, and getting a 90% success rate. They were shocked. So, there is this universal intelligence. They don't want to accept, but that indicates to the presence of a universal intelligence. So, here, the demigods are appealing to that universal intelligence, Krishna, in the form of the super soul. The Lord, who is giving the intelligence to that ant, is the Lord in the heart, and he is the super soul, and he knows how to guide that living entity. So, that's why here, they are saying, . Actually, is creating, is maintaining, and is destroying, and, . , we are also creating but, means, following the direction of the original creator, we are also creating, and expanding the creation, but we are actually completely dependent on the supreme creator, that is Krishna.

### intelligence, protection, squirrel

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "One should see this tremendous intelligence which is all pervading in this universe."
**Summary:** The speaker shares a personal anecdote about observing a squirrel's quick escape from a predator bird, highlighting the all-pervading intelligence in the universe.

So, one has to understand that there is an energy which is actually working in this world. And through that energy we see creation, maintenance and destruction is going on, like in this ant society. So, we see the maintenance is there and very intelligently it happens. Similarly, once I was coming from Vijayawada to Hyderabad and then slowly I saw that the driver is doing like this, so I got scared. So I offered to him, you know, if you want you can take coffee tea or something, basically if he feels inhibited. So I offered to him, you know, if you want you can take coffee tea or something. He was inhibited, hesitant because Swamiji is seated behind and how can I ask coffee tea? No problem, you please ask, otherwise you will ask my life. Coffee tea is okay, much better. So he went there and then our car was parked next to some bushes and then it is just close to my window, so just I happened to see there is one interesting bird, not bird, there is a small animal, maybe squirrel type and you know it is moving around and it is doing something and at one point suddenly the squirrel became very, what do you say, alert, stunned and all that. I thought probably it has found me or something like that but actually one big bird just zoomed into the bush to catch this squirrel. Tuck! the squirrel disappeared. It just disappeared into the bushes and then there is some commotion and finally the bird went away, unsuccessful. How does the squirrel know that this bird is my enemy? Even sometimes we human beings don't know who is our enemy. How did this little squirrel know and that bird looked very unusual to me, not seen ordinarily. We see, you know, regular birds. Peacocks, parrots and all those things. This looks a little medium sized, some colors, very unusual bird and when that came, it understood that yes, this is my enemy. Immediately defense mechanisms, protection, everything came into picture and then it has protected itself.

### material energy, seer, Supersoul

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "It's possible only by that energy. There is a different energy which is controlling these hands and legs and all my senses and sense objects. It's not me. I'm only seeing."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that our bodies are made of material energy, and we are merely seers within, with movements controlled by Krishna's external energy and directed by the Supersoul.

One should see this tremendous intelligence which is all pervading in this universe and which is actually controlling this energy. What is this energy? We all know our bodies are made up of material energy or the external potency. And inside this body, a living entity is situated as Kshetrajna, as a seer. So we see actually our own body also. We see the senses and we also see many objects. You know, for our senses, we need some objects to be seen. Those objects are also there and they are also made up of this material energy. So one important point is that since we are seers only, that means we are only knowers of the field. How is it that the hands are moving, legs are moving, my eyes are working? I'm only a seer inside. I'm simply sitting and I'm just coming to know what is happening in this field. And you know, all those things are happening. It's exactly like you are sitting inside a car and the tires are running and the brake is happening and so many things are going on. You're just sitting as a passenger behind. How a seer can move something that he's seeing? Let us say I want to move this camera. I cannot move because I'm a seer and that is seen. So when the seer is able to move, say I'm moving my hands, how is this possible? It's possible only by that energy. There is a different energy which is controlling these hands and legs and all my senses and sense objects. It's not me. I'm only seeing. But the movements are happening by some other agency and that is Nijamaya, Krishna's energy, external energy. And then this energy is not moving irrationally. Statically or without any discipline, a facade way, no. We are seeing there is a global intelligence. There is a massive intelligence behind the actions of this Jada energy. The energy which is otherwise inert. That is working wonderfully because of an intelligent personality. Actually, Shukadeva Goswami gives this logic. In the second canto, to prove that, you know, of course we are seer and the scene, the scene is animated. You know, we are seeing so many things. They are all getting animated. So that means there is an animating energy and that is the external energy. And the director for this animation is the Supreme Lord who is present as the Supersoul.

### bad thoughts, seer, identification

**Key Quote:** "If you understand that all these things are i'm able to see means i'm separate from all this."
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the issue of unwanted thoughts, emphasizing that we are separate from them as seers, and that identifying with the body leads to unnecessary struggle.

So, Nijamaya naha sa sarja. Sometimes some devotees, they get worried about some bad thoughts or some envious thoughts or lusty thoughts in the mind. They may also become very emotional about some bad habits which are pulling them. So if you understand that all these things are, I'm able to see, means I'm separate from all this. Say envious thought comes, you're able to see, you're a seer and you're seeing an envious thought, that means you're separate from it. It is not mine. It is coming up in the field. Why it is coming up in the field? Because previously I have put something there. It's only my own, my own previous actions. But currently I am able to see that thought separate from me. It is actually not mine. Only because we identify with our body, with what is happening in this body, we unnecessarily assume that all these things are mine and then struggle

**Key Quote:** "Always remain fascinated by these fundamentals."
**Summary:** The speaker stresses the importance of remaining fascinated by fundamental spiritual truths and recognizing Krishna's direction behind all energy.

and with emotions we make it complicated. So this knowledge that I'm a knower, a Kshetrajna, I am not this body, I'm a spirit soul, it may appear to be very routine and you know, we have heard many times, like yesterday also I was mentioning to some devotees, if we want to progress in Krishna consciousness, always remain fascinated by these fundamentals. You should remain fascinated. You see Prabhupada, what is his position? A Mahabhagavata Acharya and somebody analyzed what are the slokas that he quoted. Yeah, of course he is quoting for us, but he is ever fascinated by quoting those same slokas again and again. They, you know, they, he tells this in Paris, then goes to London, they know as many of the, he's not tired. He's ever fascinated by those fundamentals and he wants to give that knowledge to all of us. So these are the secret. This energy where we see a systematic tremendous intelligence and that is coming from Krishna. This energy cannot move, Jatakam. This energy, for example, this table cannot move on its own. These are all fundamentals. Somebody has to move it. Similarly, the entire external energy is a Jada, but how it is moving?

### demigods, supreme, conditioned souls

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Every conditioned soul thinks that he is God."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that even demigods acknowledge Krishna as the supreme controller, while conditioned souls often falsely believe themselves to be God.

That is because Krishna's direction is. So the demigods, they're aware of this. They're saying there is only one Isha and demigods are all also, they're also, they're like two Ishas. They're saying festival, but they are saying you are the supreme Isha. See this knowledge, demigods self and then they are saying we are also post-bild intelligence creating. We are also creating situations in this world. We're expanding the creation, but that is, only because you are giving intelligence. Unless Krishna gives intelligence, we cannot do anything. These hands cannot move, this tongue cannot work, the eyes cannot see. A living entity is completely dependent like that, but why is it that it is not able to see all this? Because Eesha Maanina, the whole problem starts with this Maanina, your thinking. And what is that thinking? Every conditioned soul thinks that he is God. He may not really, some of the people, they may not really think that I am God, but as soon as one identifies himself with the body and he thinks that some creation he makes, and he thinks this is my creation, I did it, my creation, that means he is saying I am God. Only God is the only creator. Even demigods, they know that we are only secondary creators that too following the direction of the Supreme Lord, we are able to create something. So if the demigods are agreeing to Krishna's position as the sole doer of everything, now what about the conditioned souls?

### doership, devotees, conditioned soul

**Key Quote:** "If we want to come out of the doership, then this is the secret. We should always recognize that Anusrujama Vishwam, my Lord, I am able to create this only because, you know, because of your direction or your intelligence."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that to overcome the illusion of being the doer, one must recognize that all creation is due to Krishna's direction, and that conditioned souls believe the world revolves around them.

So if we want to come out of the doership, then this is the secret. We should always recognize that Anusrujama Vishwam, my Lord, I am able to create this only because, you know, because of your direction or your intelligence. So devotees, they understand this, they depend completely on Krishna. And as Krishna permits, as Krishna directs, the devotees, they keep executing their duties. And while doing their duties, they get a lot of intelligence, insights, and those insights will enhance their performance, and then devotees become successful, even with little endeavors. Hmm. This is an experience of all of us, you know, we may be doing the smallest service or whatever, you are absorbed, you are dependent on Krishna, then you will see, you know, some insights, some little light, some flash, whatever you call it, and then suddenly our work gets completed quickly. Whereas outsiders, they take so much of time to do that. So, okay, now if somebody thinks that I am also a creator, I am also a doer, then what happens? The demigods are saying, we will not be able to see your form, my Lord. Now, this is the danger. Although Krishna, Lord is there in the heart, and when he appears, physically, he may be there in front of us, but the conditioned soul will not be able to recognize him, because we are absorbed in ourselves as the Isha. Every conditioned soul thinks that the whole world, whole Vishwa is centered around him. You know, when he gets into a community or gets into some kind of a group also, that self-prominence will be very strongly present in the mind. Things should happen the way I want. Things should be for my comfort. Things should be, you know, centered around me. I should get the attention. This is the thinking of a conditioned soul. He wants to become the cynosure of the eyes of the whole community. As soon as he enters, everybody should see him. Everybody should. And if they don't see him, he becomes dependent. He becomes depressed. He becomes very neglected. He thinks, oh, you know, nobody's recognizing me and gets neglected. So, that's because of his thinking, Isha Manana. So, the only

**Key Quote:** "The only counteraction to this Isha Manana is one single word that is called Seva on Mokha."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the antidote to thinking oneself as God (Isha Manana) is selfless service (Seva) to Krishna, which leads to understanding and revelations.

counteraction to this Isha Manana is one single word that is called Seva on Mokha. That's why, there's an farther meaning here. Does anybody know even that? Yeah. With the same senses, we are not able to see Krishna. How is it that, you know, just by Seva on Mokha, now we are able to see. So that is the power of this Seva on Mokhehi Jivahado Swayameva. No, this is a secret. The senses are same apparently but as soon as your attitude changes... ... And you become Sevun Mukha, inclined to render service. Then you will be able to see and pursue Krishna. This is a secret. That's why devotees, as soon as we meet someone, we try to engage him in some service. LLP preachers or whoever is in the field, they know, as soon as we go, we put some two Kaja pieces in his hand, and then the natural tendency in tuck he will put. Immediately things have started working. He is simultaneously rendering service to Krishna. And so you will see a complete difference in that. This is the way he deals with us. Before eating Kaja, after eating Kaja, you can see a stark difference. And we make them chant, chanting his service, hearing his service. So like that, when a conditioned soul is induced to do devotional service to Krishna, then he will start understanding about Krishna. He gets revelations.

### conditioning, degrees, Satva Guna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "We are subjected to follow innumerable conditions in our life."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the various degrees of conditioning that living entities experience, highlighting how those in Satva Guna have fewer conditions and greater clarity.

And then on his own, he will take steps to advance, if he is fortunate. So, our particular situation is that, here Madhvacharya has mentioned that we are all conditioned to various degrees. Now, in each of the living entities, there are various degrees of conditioning. But everybody is conditioned. What is this conditioning? We are subjected to follow innumerable conditions in our life. And each person has his own set of conditions to follow. Like, we were discussing, I was discussing with one devotee, how, you know, when, for example, some devotees, when they eat, they have to wait for six to seven hours to eat. For seven hours to again eat something. But some devotees, within three hours or three and a half hours, completely digested and hungry. Where is the next person? He is very hungry. The condition for him is three hours, three and a half hours. And condition for him is six hours or seven hours. But both of them are having conditions. One may feel like eating whole day. Go on eating. But actually, no, there is a condition. So, like that, there are innumerable conditions. If somebody sits down and tries to list down the conditions that he has to follow, Oh my God, so many conditions are there. But these conditions are not same. Somebody who is in Satva Guna, his conditions are less. He feels more freedom. Free from diseases, free from all these things. He can also see things as they are. His knowledge is bright. And so, he doesn't get implicated in conditions, breaking conditions unnecessarily. He can see. Why misery comes? Because we break these conditions. We don't follow the conditions. As soon as we break, then the reaction is... The reaction is ready. So, that's why Satva Guna means you should see, Oh, these are the conditions. Let me adhere to it so that it's all clean.

### devotees, Satva Guna, discipline

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "More discipline, more happy."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotees strive to rise to the level of Satva Guna through disciplined practice, which ultimately leads to happiness by avoiding future misery.

Now, devotees, after we became devotees, whatever condition we may be, we are trying to rise to the level of Satva Guna. When we take shelter of a bonafide spiritual master, Prabhupada, first of all, he gives the sadhana process. A regiment he gives where you have to discipline your mind and body and everything. Day after day, day after day, day after day, automatically the devotee comes to the Satvic platform. But this process is, coming to Satva Guna process is not easy. It is full of tapasya. Not easy. Generally not easy. Like Vishwamitra, to get rid of his passion and come to Satva Guna, what and all he had to do? But in our case, that process has been made joyful by Lord Chaitanya, by this process of Sanketan, Prasadam, you know, chanting and all those things. So, devotees, if they can apply themselves to this process, which is given by Prabhupada, gradually they come to this Satva Guna. They can see how this world works. And so that, you know, we don't break any of the rules of this world also. And then there are rules, conditions of the, even the spiritual life. So, a devotee slowly develops his knowledge, and tries to discipline himself by those injunctions. Shastric injunctions are Guru's instructions. So, this is the key point. If we want to become disciple, we have to be disciplined. We have to, you know, happily accept discipline. More discipline, more happy. Why? Because I am saved from the future misery. The future misery. Because, you know, unknowingly if I break something, misery will come. And so, that's why they want to be, they want to be very careful. Now, this big misery has come to these demigods. Why? Because Indra has killed a brahmana priest, Vishwaroopa, out of anger, in a fit of anger.

**Key Quote:** "We should offer our services to Krishna in Sattva Guna."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Indra's actions and their consequences to emphasize the importance of offering services to Krishna in Sattva Guna, avoiding harm and adhering to rules.

Just killed him off. Now, he is facing the result. What is the result? The consequence is that Vishwaroopa's father, Tvasta, he becomes angry. See, you have to see all this. Consequences means. Now, he does a Homa, a Yajna, and he says, he prays to the Yajna Purusha, that please give me a son, who can kill Indra. Then comes Uttarasura. And then to face Uttarasura, now again they are approaching the Supreme Lord. Let us say, Indra did not do that, killing of Vishwaroopa. No problem, no. They won't be in this miserable condition. Right? Now, this is one more important point. We should offer our services to Krishna in Sattva Guna. We offer our foodstuff in Sattva Guna. Highest, best quality. Similarly, we should also offer our services in Sattva Guna. That means what? When I am doing my service, I am not hurting, disturbing any of the stakeholders. I am not breaking any rules. I am not being cruel or destructive in my thinking. I am not, you know, this is the kind of thinking. Dvesha is not there. This is the Sattvic offering means. We cannot think, no, it's Krishna's service, I will do whatever way I want. And, you know, because it is Krishna's service, doesn't matter. No. Yes, that is Krishna's service, but we have to offer the best quality service to Krishna. Whatever is the best quality that we can offer. And that is the service in Sattva Guna. So, here, although demigods are in Sattva Guna generally, they committed some mistake and then we are seeing the consequences. And the consequences have to be addressed. Similarly, when we also do anything, particularly representing the organization, we should be very careful about the future bondage or consequences. And so, do a lot of deliberation. Do a lot of consultation before we do anything. So, by consulting, by taking all the help, still something goes wrong. Okay? We tried our best. It is the wish of the Supreme Lord. We can, you know, we can take it like that. So, that's the

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "As soon as we don't have any work, or we don't do any service, then comes Maya, knocks the door."
**Summary:** The speaker answers a question about the relationship between divine consciousness and detachment, explaining that a devotee absorbed in service is liberated, but Maya attacks when one is idle.

Any questions? Yeah. . A person in the Divine Consciousness, although engaged in seeing, hearing, touching, moving about, sleeping and breathing, always knows within himself that he actually does nothing at all. Because while speaking, evacuating, receiving, opening or closing his eyes, he always knows that only the material senses are engaged with their objects and that he is aloof from them. So this and what you told in the beginning, are they related to? Yeah, they are related. Somebody, a pure devotee who is completely absorbed in the service, the service of the Lord, he gets liberated from this bodily encasement. That liberation is explained as like a coconut inside the shell. Actually it gets disconnected, although it is within the shell. A dried coconut like that. So similarly, a devotee who is absorbed in the service of the Lord, gradually he becomes liberated. Actually as soon as he is absorbed, he is in a liberated platform. But as soon as we don't have any work, or we don't do any service, then comes Maya, knocks the door. Are you free? Are you free? I am free. Maya will say, I am always waiting for you to be free. So then, we immediately identify ourselves as enjoyer. I am the Isha. I am the enjoyer. All these feelings, ego will come. Then that's all. That's a miserable life.

**Key Quote:** "Bewilderment comes only because when you think, I am this body."
**Summary:** The speaker answers a question about bewilderment, explaining that it arises from identifying with the body and that the counteraction is to focus on being a spirit soul and servant of Guru and Krishna.

Yeah. Any other? Prabhu, one more question. And in 27th Sloka in 3rd Chapter, the bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to be the doer of activities which are actually carried out by nature. That and 5.8, both are related. Actually, although the soul by nature is a seer inside, but we feel that we are doing, and we also feel that we are knowing. You know, I am the knower, I am the doer. That's because he identifies with the body. So that is called bewilderment at the level of ego. See, one should know, mind is not all. Above mind, there is intelligence. Above intelligence, there is ego. And all these guys are bringing their own demands, bringing their own confusions into our system. One should know this. So in the mind, something comes. That's not the end of it. And don't identify with those thoughts and become very depressed. Oh, I am like this. You are not that. So bewilderment comes only because when you think, I am this body. Eshamanina. When you get that feeling. So the only counteraction is, focus on this fundamental. What is that? I am not this body. I am a spirit soul. I am an eternal servant of Guru and Krishna. Go on repeating, I am eternal servant of Guru and Krishna. Try to act on that platform. So when you can develop that personality, then we will be freed from this mental harassment. Otherwise, it is not possible.

### artificial intelligence, Krishna, detachment

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Devotees, we become fascinated and we become detached."
**Summary:** The speaker answers a question about artificial intelligence, explaining that devotees should be fascinated by it as an expression of Krishna's intelligence but detached in the sense of using it for Krishna's service under proper guidance.

Okay, last question. Hare Krishna, Prabhu. You were mentioning about universal intelligence. So because of that, every living entity is getting intelligence. Just like the scientists are like blown away about how the ants and other living entities are getting this intelligence. Yeah. So now, today, modern scientists or these people, they have created artificial intelligence, AI. Yeah. And they say that this is now everything, the world, the whole world is fascinated by this artificial intelligence and every gadget, every software is powered by this AI. So as devotees, like how much we should be fascinated by this artificial intelligence. Actually outsiders, they get fascinated and they get attached. Devotees, we become fascinated and we become detached. What is this fascination and detachment? We become fascinated and what is our detachment? Yukta Vairagya detachment. Not, you know, I will not use it, this is not me, this is not, no, that is not the process. Our detachment is, how can I use it for Krishna? Let them work very hard, produce AI, BI, CI, whatever, whatever they want, let them produce, we will simply take and use it for Krishna. The Prabhupada says, rats, they work very hard, dig big, big this thing and build their houses and meanwhile comes one snake, goes inside, eats the rat and lives comfortably. So we are like that. Let them work very hard, increase them and then, when they produce something, we should use it for Krishna. But then, Yukta Vairagya has to be done under guidance, careful guidance. Yukta Vairagya is like going to a pond for fishing. So you are thinking, oh, I will get you know, nice fish, I can catch, using this technology, I can catch somebody. Using this, I can catch somebody, you know, we are going and trying to catch the fish. The problem is, when you put this bite and you are waiting, something has come. Let us say, it is not fish but it is a Timingula. You will be pulled in and you will be swallowed. So when we are doing this Yukta Vairagya of this technology and we are trying to catch somebody, but Maya comes to catch you. Yes, yes, yes, come. So that is why we should be very careful. Under the direction of older devotees and seniors, we should utilize this. So we are also fascinated because this is intelligence of the Lord. Our body is nothing but a robot. Inside the body we are there as seers. So they will come to robotic technology, they will come to all this, but they can never manufacture a soul. They cannot manufacture consciousness. Now they are doing innumerable researches on what is this consciousness. They are also now talking. They are thinking consciousness is a brain phenomena and they are going in that direction. So, we should be very careful about this. So, anyway, that's, so, yes, we are also excited because we see Krishna's intelligence and, but, our thinking is how can I use it for Krishna? Anu, Anusrjama, Anu means following, following the direction of the authorities, Guru and Krishna, we can engage anything in this world in the service of the Lord. And, I am saying universal intelligence because the ant knows that the grain is an eatable. A snake also knows. If you pour a little milk, snake comes or a cat can come or any other Jeeva, they all know this is my food. It's a uniform intelligence. Everybody knows that these are all my eatables. So, universal intelligence, that is, that's why we see there is a, some understanding of what is my food, what is my enemy, everything. So, it's not a, what to say, somehow, by chance, you know, it has developed some intelligence like that. We see there is all pervading intelligence. A uniform, commonly understood intelligence is also there. We can see that. So, that's why it is coming from one single personality and that is Supersoul or the Krishna.

## How Can I Identify Which Mode of Nature (Guna) Is Influencing Me? | Sri Satya Gaura Chandra Dasa
**Speaker:** HG Satya Gaura Chandra Dasa

### modes of nature, self-awareness, body as a yantra

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "We are not this body, but we cannot be ignorant of this body."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding the influence of the modes of nature on our body and mind, referring to the body as a 'yantra' that needs to be trained.

But in a devotee's life, how do we know that we are in which mode? How do we reflect that I am being conducted by which mode, whether I am too much passionate, or I am under ignorance, or I am in sattva guna, or like, how do we reflect, how do we know our standing, which mode we are conducted? Actually, it is very important to understand that we are in which mode. To understand our own body and mind, our own, you know, this yantra, very important. We are not this body, but we cannot be ignorant of this body because this yantra influences us every moment, every, all the places, this yantra is continuously influencing us. And because the yantra was trained up for millions of years towards sense gratification, towards supremacy, towards possessing many things, it is important that we have to know what is this sadhana bhakti, nothing but training this yantra. You have to matter of duty means you're training this yantra, yes, you have to attend sadhana, you have to do your duty. It creates a lot of illusions. So that's why we should not be in ignorance about our own body.

### eating habits, Krishna consciousness, prasadam, sense control
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/tdSqa9p5P2o?t=122
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** practical
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "If your vision is that you are seeing chillis and tamarind and this and that, you should eat."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how to understand the modes of nature through our eating habits, emphasizing the importance of Krishna consciousness while eating prasadam and understanding how different foods affect our senses.

We have to gradually understand where I stand. And so I would say that education about understanding ourselves, I would say it begins with our eating habits. It begins with the tongue, our devotional service. So it is good. It is good to understand our eating habits, whether I am this food, whether it is suiting me or it is not suiting me, what disturbs my, you know, consciousness. See actually, prashadam, if we properly honor with Krishna consciousness, there's no question of, you know, any trouble. But the problem with us is there is no Krishna consciousness while eating. We just eat like a normal, you know, normal eating and there is no consciousness maintained that this is Krishna's mercy and it's a transcendental food. There is no such either thinking, there is no realization like that. So that's why we have to be careful to understand. Like Prabhupada was asked by that Bob in the book. He says, let us say, if there is a chili, Prabhupada was explaining that whatever is there in the plate you should eat. Everything is prashad. Then he is asking, if there is a chili then if it is, you know, for me it is. Then Prabhupada says, if your vision is that you are seeing chillis and tamarind and this and that, you should eat. You cannot artificially imitate a higher platform that it's all Brahman, it's a transcendent, it's Krishna's mercy. These things are not there. So then yes, you have to be careful. You have to understand what suits you and what doesn't suit you. What agitates your senses and what doesn't. And let us say if I eat many sweets in the night or if I overeat in the night, it has certain repercussions, we should understand. If you eat too much of paneer, then you may get sexually agitated, that you have to understand.

### health, eating habits, sattvic diet, self-awareness

**Key Quote:** "By carefully understanding our body, what suits and what not suits, we can keep our bodily thing little on a sattvic platform."
**Summary:** The speaker continues discussing the importance of understanding our body and its reactions to food, emphasizing the need for a sattvic diet to maintain health and facilitate devotional service.

And also let us say we are falling sick too many times and we have to see whether it has any correlation with the food that I am eating. I am taking my food habits. For example, it is said that we should eat only when we are very hungry. That means the previous food is already digested. Here, you cannot walk into the Ashram Prasadam hall just like that and then, okay, agaya. You can go inside and so take one more plate of food and then your previously morning breakfast is not digested and you are not still feeling hungry and then you load another one more plate. So this, of course, this is called overeating and it has its own serious implications. So gradually devotee, because he is chanting and performing devotional service, he is able to see, you know. All these implications on his consciousness, how the body is trying to pull him down, he understands. And so gradually he rectifies all those things. So, coming to some kind of a sattvic level in our eating habits is very important. Very, very important. Of course, in the beginning days we can eat well and it gets digested also. But as we grow older, you have to reduce the quantities, number of times and what type of items. Let us say somebody is not very careful about eating sweets, for example. As we grow older, it can lead to many other complications. Of course, nowadays diabetes, not only by sweets, by many other reasons it is coming into the... Now so many diseases are coming. Even youngsters, they are also having a lot of diseases. So very unfortunate. So by carefully understanding our body, what suits and what not suits, we can keep our bodily thing little on a sattvic platform.

**Key Quote:** "Any time when you want to do some work, immediately mind says, No, not now. Later, later, later."
**Summary:** The speaker shares an anecdote about a young man with multiple health issues and then discusses how the modes of nature influence our work ethic, particularly procrastination (ignorance) and the desire for recognition (passion).

One boy joined in Hyderabad. He was, he is just 18 years. And in the application, joining form, we ask, you know, you mention if you have any health issues. And so, you know, he came for interview. And then I was going through his form. And then I came to this page where he has mentioned all his health issues. And I counted those health issues. He is having 18. 18 years and 18. I said, if you become 25, what will happen to you? What will happen to you? Will it become 25 or is it going to be something less? Very unfortunate in the outside world because they have no idea of managing their eating habits, sleeping habits and all this. So we have to start as basic as that. And then gradually improve our... For example, with respect to work. You can see. When I have to do, let us say the immediate tendency is to postpone the work. That means ignorance is acting. Ignorant person only postpones. He has got a procrastination. Any time when you want to do some work, immediately mind says, No, not now. Later, later, later. So then you know, okay, ignorance is trying to influence me. Or... Or you have a lot of energy to do. But in the end, you are expecting that somebody should recognize me. Somebody should say, yes. Very good. Or at the end of some few years, Yes, I need some designation. No expectation. It may come on its own. You take that as prasadam and go on. But... You are not building up any hankering for it. Like that. This is one more important. So like that gradually you will see.

So regular reading, regular association with Vaishnavas. That is the only remedy. Nicely read and analyze and analyze and how I can take out all the wrong understandings so that I can become a better devotee. This is the goal of our life. And particularly for missionaries, such a wonderful opportunity. We can read. We can spend time. Sometimes, okay, our services may be there. We are very busy. Even then, we should not neglect our reading at least. Every day something should go inside. And that is the... What do you call...

## How Did Mother Sita Nurture Luv and Kush? | Sri Sampati Dasa

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Sita prepared love and kush to go and sing the greatness of Ram's character."
**Summary:** The speaker argues that Sita's upbringing of Luv and Kush, teaching them to glorify Rama, demonstrates her unwavering devotion and understanding of Dharma, contrasting it with modern examples of parental alienation.

If Sita was angry and upset with Shri Ram, asking why Ram abandoned me to the forest, she would have made Lava and Kush feel against Shri Ram. This is not the truth. If Sita was unhappy that Ram abandoned her to the forest just because some common people were making some allegations against her, this is not the truth. She was not angry and upset with Shri Ram's decision. It is visible in the way she brought up Lava and Kush. Lava and Kush are the first Katha Vachaks. They are the first people to speak Ramayana, Valmiki Ramayana. They were going everywhere, every village, nook and corner of Ayodhya, and they were singing the glories of Lord Shri. If Sita was angry and upset with Shri Ram, with his decision, obviously she must have poisoned the children of Shri Ram. She would have made Lava and Kush feel against Shri Ram. Rather, she made them learn the glories of Shri Ram. That shows that Sita always carried love for Shri Ram. She understood the Dharma Sankat of Shri Ram. She was completely okay with Ram's decision because she did not poison the minds of Lava and Kush. Today we see when there is a fight between husband and wife, and there is some kind of injustice and there is divorce, sometimes the father tries to poison the minds of children against the mother, or the mother tries to poison the children's mind against the father. But that's not the case in Ramayana. Sita prepared Lava and Kush to go and sing the greatness of Ram's character. That is Ramayana. So Lava and Kush, they never carried any grudge against their father Shri Ram. They were very happy. They always felt that Ram is the greatest father. So that...

Their idea is that eating means God will eat the way I eat. We eat, we complete the whole plate, but God's eating is not that. His eating is very fine. It is said that even if the Lord glances on the food, that turns into Prasadam, and on that Prasadam we eat, remembering.

We cannot think of a leader who does not keep up his own words, who breaks the promises, right? We do not definitely like to choose such a leader. Ram is the greatest leader for the followers. He is the greatest leader for the entire human civilization because he took immense trouble, he went through tribulation just to keep up his promise, his family promise, his father's promise by giving away Ayodhya to his stepmother Kaikeyi and making Bharat as a king of Ayodhya. Ram could have easily become the king of Ayodhya, but he wanted to honor the words of his father, Dasharatha Maharaj. For that, he happily gave up Ayodhya and went to forest. Lord Ram teaches the importance of being truthful and honoring the promise and being respectful towards our own words.

**Key Quote:** "You must always, always walk the talk."
**Summary:** Lord Rama teaches that leaders must keep their promises, maintain integrity, and align their actions with their words to maintain credibility and inspire followers.

The moment the leader makes a promise, he must make all efforts to keep up his promise. Otherwise, the followers will question the credibility of your leadership. They may lose faith in your leadership because, oh, you say something, but you are not intending to follow your own promise. So Lord Ram is teaching a very important lesson to all the leaders, saying that no matter how difficult it is, no matter how troublesome in your own personal life, you must keep up your words. You must have a virtue, a value called integrity. There must be absolutely no gap between your action and your words. You must always, always walk the talk. And Lord Ram is an example for somebody who always walked what he talked. So that is the lesson Lord Ram teaches as a hero.

Because being powerful, he never misused his power in any manner. We see an example of Wali, a very powerful person, king of Kishkindha. What did he do with his power and position? He attacked his own younger brother Sugreeva. He threw him out of Kishkindha. Sugreeva was a loyal citizen of Kishkindha. He was a contributing citizen of Kishkindha. But Wali, being angry and out of a certain misunderstanding, he attacked his own younger brother. And he used his power and position to make an effort to murder, kill Sugreeva.

Lord Ram uses his power always to help the weaker section of society. Those who are being attacked, they will take shelter of Lord Shri Ram. Lord Shri Ram helped Sugreeva by killing Wali. He made Sugreeva the king of Kishkindha. Lord Ram is not thinking, "I'm very powerful. I will defeat Wali and I will become the king of Kishkindha." Even though he killed Wali, he defeated Wali. Lord Ram did not become the king of Kishkindha.

**Summary:** Lord Rama is presented as a leader who empowers others and uses his power to protect the vulnerable, serving as an inspiration for all leaders.

He made Sugreeva the king of Kishkindha. So here we see Lord Ram as somebody who is not greedy for power. He is somebody who makes his followers leaders. He is somebody who creates more leaders. He is not somebody who says that I should be the only one who is the greatest. I should be the only one who is the king. I should be the only one who is powerful. He likes creating more powerful, more leaders under him and especially uses his power to help those who are the weaker section of society, like Sugreeva, who was in trouble because of somebody like Wali who was abusing power. That's why Lord Shri Ram is an inspirational figure for all the leaders to learn the lesson of how to use power, for what purpose we use power in our life. That's why Lord Shri Ram is an inspirational figure for all the leaders to learn the lesson of how to use power in our life.

## The Duties & Qualities of a Brahmana | Sri Vigraha Dasa | SB 1.18.34 | 11.08.2024

### Shringi's curse, Brahmana's role, False prestige

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "He compared the king to a watchdog and so it was wrong for the king to enter the home of a brahmana and ask for water from the same pot."
**Summary:** The speaker reads and explains a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam about Shringi cursing King Parikshit, highlighting Shringi's inappropriate comparison of the king to a dog and the false prestige associated with being a Brahmana.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 1, Creation, Chapter 18, Entitled Parikshit Cursed by a Brahmana Boy, Text 34 Translation and purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada Translation and purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada Translation Shringi continued to say The descendants of the kingly orders are definitely designated as watchdogs and they must keep themselves at the door. On what grounds can dogs enter the house and claim to dine with the master on the same plate? Purport by Srila Prabhupada Parikshit Cursed by a Brahmana Boy, Text 34 Translation and purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada Certainly knew that the king asked for water from his father and the father did not respond. He tried to explain away his father's inhospitality in an impertinent manner, befitting an uncultured boy. He was not at all sorry for the king's not being well received. On the contrary, he justified the wrong act in a way characteristically, of the brahmanas of Kali Yuga. He compared the king to a watchdog and so it was wrong for the king to enter the home of a brahmana and ask for water from the same pot. The dog is certainly reared by its master but that does not mean that the dog shall claim to dine and drink from the same pot. This mentality of false prestige, is the cause of downfall of the perfect social order. And we can see that, in the beginning it was started by the inexperienced son of a brahmana. As the dog is never allowed to enter within the room and hearth, although it is reared by the master, similarly, according to Shringi, the king had no right to enter the house of Shamika Rishi. The king was not allowed to enter the house of Shamika Rishi. According to the boy's opinion, the king was on the wrong side and not his father and thus, he justified his silent father.

**Key Quote:** "And without asking, Krishna gives unlimited wealth, to Sudama."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts a play about friendship, contrasting the material friendship of Drona and Drupada with the spiritual friendship of Krishna and Sudama, emphasizing Krishna's unconditional generosity.

So, just last week, in folk, we had an event called, Friendship Unlimited. On the occasion of Friendship Day. And on that occasion, we had a wonderful theatre play, put up by the folk members. And that play involved, showing the distinction between, material friendship, which is ordinary, and spiritual friendship with Krishna, which is extraordinary. So, we had two parts in the play. The first part, talked about the friendship between, Drona and Drupada. And, we know how Drona and Drupada, promise each other, that we will help. Drupada says that, I will help you when it is needed. But Drona, when he is in need, when he comes, Drupada denies to even agree, that he is my friend. He says, we are not equals, how can we be friends? And he sends him away. And that leads to, lot of many other terrible things happening, which take shape, as the story of Mahabharata proceeds. But then we have, another great friendship, described in the Bhagavatam, the friendship between, Lord Krishna and Sudama. And here also, Sudama happened to be, a poor Brahmana. But when he comes to, Krishna's palace in Dwaraka, and as soon as, Krishna hears the name of Sudama, he runs out of great affection, personally, and he goes and hugs Sudama, in front of everybody, much to the astonishment, of all the residents of Dwaraka. And without asking, Krishna gives unlimited wealth, to Sudama. So we were doing this play, and since I was involved in the play, back in the green room, I was just, before the drama, we were doing final touch up, make up and, you know, costumes of the different roles,

**Key Quote:** "Simply by wearing a five paisa thread, one cannot become a brahmana."
**Summary:** The speaker reflects on the ease of creating a 'Brahmana' for a play by simply adding a sacred thread, contrasting it with the true qualifications of a Brahmana and the superficiality prevalent in Kali Yuga.

different characters. So, the first scene was, Drona Drupada, childhood scene. So in few minutes, they were supposed to go, on the stage, small boys, childhood scene. So, I was seeing, something is missing. Something is missing. Okay, we have dressed them very nicely, they are looking like, young, gurukul students, gurukul boys, but something is missing. What is that? Then I thought, oh, the sacred thread is missing. And, since they were small boys, they were only wearing dhoti, and, sacred thread, if it is not there, it will, it will not suit their character, their roles. So immediately, I asked somebody, get a spool of thread, and instantly made three, you know, layers, three layers, and put the sacred thread, on the two children, and send them on the stage. Making a brahmana, is so easy, you see. So, I was just reflecting this, after the drama, so easily, you know, brahmana, thread was not there, immediately, I brought a white thread, and sent them on the stage, with the sacred thread. Is becoming a brahmana, so cheap, in real life? Okay, on the stage, it is understandable, it is a drama, but then, in real life, so I just remember, one of the, purports, that Srila Prabhupada writes, I think in the seventh canto, Bhagavatam, there Prabhupada says, simply by wearing, a five paisa thread, one cannot become, a brahmana. Five paisa thread. In fact, Srimad Bhagavatam, predicts that, in the Kali Yuga, vipratve sutramevahi, somebody will be called, a vipra, a brahmana, merely by showing his, sutra, thread. You see, unfortunate situation. So a brahmana, is not just a person, who is wearing thread, and flaunts it everywhere. See, I have this, I have this thread, so I am a brahmana.

### Brahmana qualifications, Knowledge of Absolute Truth, ISKCON's mission, Varnashrama, Division of Labor

**Key Quote:** "Brahma janati, iti brahmana - he must have knowledge about the absolute truth, then he is a brahmana."
**Summary:** The speaker defines a Brahmana as one who knows the Absolute Truth, emphasizing that birth alone is insufficient, and highlights ISKCON's mission to create first-class Brahmanas, explaining the Varnashrama system as a division of labor centered on Krishna.

No! What is the qualification, of a brahmana? Who is a brahmana? The Vedic scriptures, tell us. Brahma janati, iti brahmana. Brahma janati, he must have knowledge, about the absolute truth. Then, he is a brahmana. Merely by taking birth, in a particular family, one cannot claim, that he has become, a qualified brahmana. This is a very important thing, that Srila Prabhupada, brought about, many times, when he was, talking about, the importance of, brahmanas. In fact, Srila Prabhupada says, that our movement, the Krishna consciousness movement, the ISKCON society, is meant for creating, first class brahmanas, in the society. It is meant for creating, first class brahmanas. And, what is the meaning of, first class brahmanas? Simply wearing a thread? No, not at all. One must actually be, acquainted with, the knowledge of, the absolute truth. And one must also be, busy in engaging, activities connected with, the absolute truth. Then he is a brahmana. So, brahma janati iti brahmana. So there are various qualifications, of a brahmana, that are listed by Lord Krishna himself, in the Bhagavad Gita. If you study, towards the end of the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna is giving, what are the four different, social orders. He had already mentioned that, in the fourth chapter of the Gita. Lord Krishna says, So Lord Krishna says, I have divided, the entire human society, into four divisions. And, what is that four divisions? The brahmanas, the kshatriyas, vaishyas, and the shudras.

### Varnashrama, Division of Labor, Qualities and Duties, Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras

**Key Quote:** "Intellectual people are Brahmanas, who are supposed to share knowledge to the society."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the four divisions of the Varnashrama system - Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras - explaining their respective qualities and duties as a natural division of labor within society.

Now is this some caste system? That is talked about, in modern terms. No, this is merely, division of labor, in the society. To keep, Krishna in the center, based on one's, qualities, one's, interest of work, one can be whatever he is. But, we keep Krishna in the center, and work. That is called the, Daivi Varanashrama system. Since this system is created by, none other than, the Supreme Lord himself. This is a universal thing. It's not that only in India it exists. It's a universal thing. Srila Prabhupada points out this. When he went to the America, he asked, don't you see in your society, you have intellectual people, you have administrative class of people, you have business class of people, you also have labor class of people. Everywhere you go, four classes of people exist. So this is Varanashrama system. Intellectual people are Brahmanas, who are supposed to, share knowledge to the society. They are like the brain of the body. In the body, they are the brain. Right? Brain is very important, to give us directions. What to do, what not to do. It gives us, directions, well thought decisions. Right? That is Brahmanas. And then, Kshatriyas are those, who are into administration. Who are into, taking care of the, citizens. Protecting them. Kshatrayate iti kshatriya. This is the definition of Kshatriya. One who, protects others from getting hurt. He is called a Kshatriya. Not like modern day, administrative class leaders, who sit in a nice bulletproof, you know, nice room, and they allow the poor soldiers, to go and die on the battlefields. That is not a Kshatriya. Kshatriya must, help others, from getting hurt, by himself exposing, his body. Using weapons. That is Kshatriya. And then, Vaishyas, are the business class of people. Krishi, Vaanijyam, Vaishya Karma Swabhavajam. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita. So, what are the business, what are the, what are the activities, designated for the Vaishyas? Krishi, agriculture. Goraksha, cow protection. Vaanijyam, trade and commerce. These are the things, which are designated as duties, for the Vaishyas. The business class of people. And then, Paricharyatmakam Karyam, Shudra Karma Swabhavajam. So, for the, Shudras, the labor class of people, Paricharyatmakam, serving, service, physical labor, is actually the designated work.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the qualities of a Brahmana, including truthfulness, simplicity, and sense control, referencing the Sanat Sujata and emphasizing the importance of understanding these qualities in light of ISKCON's mission to create first-class Brahmanas.

So, if everybody is doing their part, in the society, then, there can be peace and tranquility, in the society. No one has to bother, oh now, the enemy king, country is attacking, what to do? You don't have to bother. You go on with your work. There are Kshatriyas, who are well trained and qualified, who will guard the country. Right? So, that is the idea, in the Varanashrama system. So, what are the qualities of a Brahmana? Satyam, first of all. A Brah, to be called as a Brahmana, one must be truthful. Kshatram, Satyam. And then, Arjavam. Arjavam means, simplicity. Simple living, and high thinking, should be, the philosophy of life. Not that we live in high rise buildings, but our thinking is in the Patala. It should not be like that. High thinking should be there. Simple living should be there. So, that is one of the important qualities of a Brahmana. Shamaha, one must be, Shamaha, Damaha. Damaha means, actually, have full control over his senses. One must not let loose his senses and mind. Then he can't be a Brahmana. Right? So, these are all the qualifications. In fact, in a book called, Sanat Sujata, there are 12 qualities of a Brahmana, that are listed. And Prabhupada quotes that. So, what are the qualifications of a real Brahmana? It's very important for us to know. Why it is important for us to know? Because, Prabhupada said, that our organization, our movement, is meant for creating first class Brahmanas. So, therefore, we must know, who is truly, truly, a qualified Brahmana.

### Prahlada Maharaj, Brahmana qualifications, Activities of a Brahmana, Yajana, Pathana, Dana, Parigraha

**Key Quote:** "Yajana means, worshipping the Supreme Personality of Godhead and helping others to engage in worshipping the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces Prahlada Maharaj's prayers and discusses the activities of a Brahmana: Yajana (worship), Pathana (study), Dana (giving charity), and Parigraha (accepting charity), emphasizing the importance of helping others in spiritual advancement.

So, this is an interesting verse. We will read, the purport, also, Srimad Bhagavatam, 7th canto, chapter 9, verse number 10. So, Prahalad Maharaj is offering prayers to Lord Narasimha Deva, and he is saying, if a Brahmana, has all 12 of the Brahmanical qualifications, but is, okay, we will come to that later. So, what are the qualifications of a Brahmana? So, Prabhupada says, in the Sanat Sujata, there are qualifications of the Brahmana, explained. The work, the activities of a Brahmana, what are the activities of a Brahmana? First, let us understand that. Then, we will be able to appreciate the qualities corresponding to that. So, Yajana, Yajana, right, Yajana, Yajana, Pathana, Pathana, and Dana, Parigraha. These are the six activities of a Brahmana. Yajana means, worshipping the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yajana means, helping others to engage in worshipping the Lord. A Brahmana should not think, I will worship and I will become perfect. No, he must help others, that is part of his duty, assigned service. So, Yajana, Yajana, worship the Lord, and help others to worship the Lord. And then, Pathana, Pathana, I study the Vedic scriptures, and I help others to study the Vedic scriptures, and understanding the real meaning. Pathana means to study, Pathana means to help others to study. So, a Brahmana is supposed to, spread spiritual knowledge in the society, help others to become spiritually advanced. And then, Dana, Parigraha. Dana means to give charity, Parigraha means to accept charity. Brahmana is not simply supposed to accept charity. Whatever charity he gets, from others, he engages it, only as much as it is required, he keeps it with him, and the rest he has to give it back, as charity,

**Key Quote:** "Simple living, and high thinking."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that a Brahmana's role is not simply to accumulate charity, but to use it for serving the Lord and giving back to society, citing Chanakya Pandit as an example, and contrasts this with the character of Shringi.

for the right cause. It's not that he just collects charity. Many times we keep hearing, Daan Dakshina is a very common word. So, whenever we see in some movies, Brahmanas are generally portrayed, you know, sometimes in a funny way, as a greedy Brahmana. He will always keep asking, Daan Dakshina Dijiye. Right? So, quality of Brahmana, work of Brahmana, is not simply to keep accepting Daan Dakshina. It's not that I'll show my sacred thread, and keep accepting as much as possible. No, that is not the idea. The idea is, one accepts as much as required for him, for his purpose of serving the Lord, and the rest, he actually gives it back to the society. Srila Prabhupada, gives the example of Chanakya Pandit, who was also a qualified Brahmana. And, even though he was playing a very important role, in the kingdom of Chandragupta Maurya, in the Mauryan kingdom, and even though the king offered him, a big palatial building for him to stay, Chanakya denied. He said, I don't want to stay in the palace. So, he preferred to stay in a, humble cottage, outside the palace. But he was, guiding Chandragupta Maurya. He was guiding him on the principles of Vedic understanding. So, a Brahmana, will never actually, a real Brahmana, will never actually, think that I should usurp more and more wealth. No. Arjavam. Arjavam. Simplicity. Simple living, and high thinking. But here you see, but here you see, in this verse we see, this Brahmana boy, what are the different words used by, Srila Prabhupada in the purport, to describe this Brahmana boy, Shringi. Shringi was the son of Shamika Rishi. Perhaps we all know the story, we have been discussing this verse from many weeks.

**Key Quote:** "Even though he was Brahmana, he was instructed in several mantras by his father, so he was very powerful, but since he was inexperienced, he was immature, he did not know what is the right usage of these Brahmanical powers."
**Summary:** The speaker revisits the story of Parikshit Maharaj and Shringi, emphasizing Shringi's inexperience and misuse of Brahmanical powers, leading him to curse a pure devotee.

Parikshit Maharaj, when he was tired, thirsty, hungry, he approaches the, cottage of, Shamika Rishi. Shamika Rishi was in meditation. He did not actually, give a good hospitality. He did not receive the King Parikshit. So Parikshit, jokingly, he took a, dead snake, and, put it around his neck, around the, sages neck, and he went away. So when this was known to Shringi, so what did Shringi, do, is what we are reading these verses. What did he think? So Prabhupada uses specific words, to describe Shringi. First of all he says, inexperienced boy. You know he is an inexperienced boy. Sometimes, when powers are given to us, when we are still inexperienced and immature, more than good, doing good to others, we end up, harming others. That is depicted here in Shringi. Even though he was Brahmana, he was instructed in several mantras by his father. So he was very powerful. He was following all the rules and regulations of a Brahmana. So he had that Brahmanical strength. But, since he was inexperienced, he was immature, he did not know what is the right usage of these Brahmanical powers. Therefore, he dared to curse the pure devotee, King Pariksit.

**Key Quote:** "Smartphone is supposed to make us smart, isn't it? But it is not making us smart, it is actually making us dull, dumb."
**Summary:** The speaker draws a parallel between Shringi's misuse of power and the modern misuse of technology, particularly smartphone addiction, which can lead to dullness and harm.

Now in our situation today, if you see, all of us, we have access to the most advanced technology. Technology is the power today. Like Shringi had some powers back then, now all of us also have technology. The best technology is at the tip of our fingers. Right? We can access any content. We can, we can do anything. We can sit at our place and order food, order groceries, everything is. No doubt it has made our life very very comfortable. But, there are also the other side of this. Lot of people are becoming victims of so much of addiction to internet usage. Right? So there is power, but since we are not qualified to use the power properly, we are not trained, see, we misuse it and bring harm to ourselves. So just like Shringi had powers and he misused it to curse a pure devotee, what we are doing, this power is there, but we are not qualified to use it properly. So, lot of people becoming victims of the smartphone addiction. Smartphone is supposed to make us smart, isn't it? But it is not making us smart, it is actually making us dull, dumb. It's a fact. Of course, it's not that we should not use smartphone. We should use as much as it is required. Regulated usage will give us real benefit. But if we use it more than required, every now and then seeing the smartphone, every now and then want to check what is the notification, every now and then...

**Key Quote:** "It is also offensive to be inattentive while chanting."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the offense of inattentiveness while chanting, using the example of simultaneously chanting and chatting on a smartphone, and connects it back to Shringi's immaturity and offense.

So, in fact, even while chanting, on one hand we have the bead bag, beads. On the other hand, some of the devotees have smartphone. So chanting is going on on one hand, chatting is going on on other hand. Chatting and chanting simultaneously going on. Krishna is confused. Is he talking to me or is he talking to somebody? Chanting means we are talking to Krishna. It is our private time with Krishna, with the holy name. We are supposed to spend quality time with Krishna. But instead of doing that, we are interrupting in between. Every day we chant the ten offences to be avoided against chanting the holy names of the Lord. And the last offence, it is also offensive to be inattentive while chanting. That's an offence. It is listed in the Padma Purana. Ten offences against chanting. So if we want to make quick progress towards the desired goal of chanting, which is to attain pure love for Krishna, we must stay away from these offences. Right? So here also, Shrunge committed a great blunder because of his immaturity. So he was given powers, but he didn't know how to use it. So therefore, he committed an offence.

### Varnashrama, Personal Prestige, Cooperation, Krishna Prema, False Prestige, Kali Yuga

**Key Quote:** "This mentality has led to degradation of such a wonderful Varnashrama system which exists, which was existing in the Vedic period."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Varnashrama system is meant for cooperation, not personal prestige, and that Shringi's mentality reflects the degradation of the system in Kali Yuga, characterized by justifying wrong actions due to false prestige.

Right? So Prabhupada says, this particular thinking of Shrunge, that I am born in Brahmana family and this person Pariksit Maharaj is after all a Kshatriya, who is a Gruhapala, who is a watchdog. Therefore, I can command him. I can curse him. This mentality has led to degradation of such a wonderful Varanashrama system which exists, which was existing in the Vedic period. This is the beginning of downfall of the Vedic culture, Prabhupada says. Right? So these positions, Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra, these positions are not meant for taking it as a personal prestige. It's not meant for that. It's meant for cooperation, helping everybody together to achieve the goal of life, which is to attain Krishna Prema, which is to attain devotional service to Krishna. That purpose is forgotten and people think that, oh now I am this Brahmana, now I am this, I am that. Merely going by designations. So that has led to the downfall of, unfortunately, downfall of such a wonderful system created by the Lord Himself. And we can see that, that is very, very rampant in the Kali Yuga. So Prabhupada says in the purport, Shringi, on the contrary, he, he means Shringi, justified the wrong act in a way characteristic of the Brahmanas of Kali Yuga. What is the characteristic feature of the so-called Brahmanas of Kali Yuga? They try to justify anything and everything they do. Because we are qualified, we can do anything. So this is the characteristic feature of Kali Yuga Brahmanas. Right? So that is arising out of false prestige, as Prabhupada says in the purport.

**Key Quote:** "Because I am the king, when I am walking on the street, everybody should fall flat on me, on the ground. Expecting this kind of an honour because of one's position, that is due to false ego."
**Summary:** The speaker defines false prestige and ego, using the analogy of puffed rice, and explains that true leadership is not about demanding honor but about serving others.

Now what is this false prestige? Okay, now for a king to think that I am the king of this kingdom and I have to rule this kingdom, is it wrong? No, the king can think like that. I am the king. There is no problem. But if he thinks, I can do anything and everything just because I am the king, then that is the problem. Because I am the king, when everyone, when I am walking on the street, everybody should fall flat on me, on the ground. Expecting this kind of an honour because of one's position. That is due to false ego. There is a nice word that Prabhupada uses many times, puffed up. You know, if you actually research Prabhupada books and lectures, conversations, you will find this word many times, puffed up. Puffed up, being puffed up of false ego. Prabhupada uses this word. Whenever I hear this word puffed up, I remember puffed rice. So there is flat rice and there is puffed rice. Flat rice or chipped rice, Chidadahi we use for, we offer during Chidadahi Mahotsava, chipped rice. And then there is puffed rice. So what is the difference between the two if you see? Chipped rice, if you soak it in water or if you soak it in mango juice or whatever, it absorbs that essence, mango juice and becomes very tasty. Right? Whereas puffed rice, you just have to open it and keep. It will just fly away because of air. It can't, it does not have sattva. So those who are puffed up, see I am so great. I can do so much. Because of my abilities, I am doing so many things. If somebody is thinking like that, they are like puffed rice. Right? One violent, one wind comes, blows away. They are nowhere to be seen. So this Shringi was puffed up. He was thinking too much about himself. Right? Many times this kind of a mentality

### Devotee's Pride, Humility, Servant, Prabhupada's Mercy, Dasa

**Key Quote:** "One should always understand that whatever I am practicing, it is due to the causeless mercy of Srila Prabhupada."
**Summary:** The speaker cautions against pride creeping into devotees, emphasizing that all accomplishments are due to Prabhupada's mercy and that the true identity is that of a servant (Dasa) of the Lord.

can creep into the devotees also. Right? What is that? See I am practicing Krishna Chakra, this consciousness. I have practiced the consciousness from so many years. And Prabhupada has said, one who is a devotee, by default, he is a Brahmana. One who is a Vaishnava, by default, he is a Brahmana also, because he is following a Brahminical way of life. So we start thinking, see I am so great. All these Kali Yuga brahmanas, ah they don't know, they don't chant Hare Krishna Mantra. They will be wearing a sacred thread. But I am so great. You know, this kind of a pride leads to fall down. One should never be proud. One should always understand that whatever I am practicing, it is due to the causeless mercy of Srila Prabhupada. One should always pass all respects to Prabhupada. Many times, you know, in the community of devotees, we address each other as Prabhu. Prabhu means master. And if we are not in the right consciousness, we may think, Oh, I am the master. All these people are coming to me and saying, I am master. But within the community of devotees, Prabhupada had made sure that you don't only be addressed as Prabhu, but you should also address others as Prabhu. Not that only I will be called as master. Right? We are Prabhu as long as we are sincerely serving Prabhupada. Without Prabhupada, no Prabhu. Prabhupada means what? He at whose feet all Prabhus sit. All Prabhus have to be situated at the feet of Prabhupada. Then you are Prabhu. As long as you are serving Prabhupada, you are Prabhu. And that too, when somebody addresses you as Prabhu, you know, you should immediately remind yourself, I am Dasa. I am servant of the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "The main part of your initiated name is Dasa. Focus on that. Dasa means your servant of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker shares an anecdote about Prabhupada emphasizing the importance of 'Dasa' (servant) in the initiated name and highlights Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's prayer expressing himself as the servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord.

You know, one occasion, Prabhupada had given initiation. And, you know, in the West, in the US, and the devotees after initiation, they were all very excited about their new names. After initiation, you get new name. Right? They were all excited. They were discussing about their names with each other. And some of them were saying, See, my name is very ordinary. Some Paramatma Das. Not so. But your name, Radha Madhav Das. You know, your name is directly connected with Radhakrishna. Your name is so special, very intimate to the Lord. My name is Paramatma Das. You know. So, like, I don't know. People think, there are gradations in names also. But, Prabhupada heard, overheard this. Devotees thinking like this. Oh, my name is Paramatma Das. My name is so special. Your name is... Prabhupada immediately came and said, The main part of your initiated name is Dasa. Focus on that. Dasa means your servant of the Lord. That is the main part of your name, spiritual name. Focus on that. Right? So, when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was offering prayers to Lord Jagannath, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu prayed very nicely. What did he pray? He said, My dear Lord, I am neither a Brahmana, nor a sanyasi, nor a very learned person. I am none of these things. He said, Gopi Bhartu Pada Kamalayor Dasa Dasa Anudasa I am servant of the servant of the servant of the servant of your Lord. I am the servant of your Lordship, the maintainer of the Gopis. Right?

### Material vs. Spiritual, Lording Over, Humility, Dasa Dasa Anudasa, False Prestige, Holier Than Thou

**Key Quote:** "Actual spiritual humility is, I am Dasa Dasa Anudasa. I am servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the material mentality of lording over others with the spiritual humility of being a servant of the servant, and warns against the 'holier than thou' attitude.

That is the mood Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is trying to teach us. On the contrary, material thinking is what? I want to lord over everything. I want to become boss, bossaadi boss. Right? I want to become boss of the boss. Right? One person to lord over is not enough. I want a big group of people. I want to create more followers. I want to become their boss and rule them. That is the material mentality. But actual spiritual humility is, I am Dasa Dasa Anudasa. I am servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu did not say, I am servant of Krishna. He can say at least, right? Krishna himself who came to teach us by his own example, how to be a servant. He could have said, I am servant of Radha Krishna. He didn't say that. He said, I am servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord. You see, that is the mood which is very very important that all devotees should maintain. So, this false prestige is also called holier than thou attitude. Holier than thou. It's an expression in English. Holier than thou means, I am great than you. Why? Because every day, I am chanting Hare Krishna Mantra 16 rounds. These Karmis, you know, they are useless people. I am great. You know, this kind. So, it may appear that, I am a devotee. What is wrong in saying like this? No. But the underlying principle is what? To show that others are inferior to me. I am great. See, it is because of this mentality that the Varanashrama system degraded in Kali Yuga. Instead of having a cooperative mentality among the four orders of life, when each person tried to exert his influence and assert his position superior to others, then it started degrading.

### False Prestige, Daksha Prajapati, Actions vs. Positions, Competition

**Key Quote:** "Our actions are more important, not our positions."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Daksha Prajapati to illustrate how false prestige can lead to a loss of discrimination and a focus on competition rather than genuine spiritual progress.

So, among the devotees, we should not have this kind of a thinking. Right? So, there are various examples of how false prestige can actually bring us down. Daksha, Daksha Prajapati, perhaps we know about Daksha Prajapati. About him, it is described in the fourth cant of Srimad Bhagavatam. And Daksha Prajapati, he was Prajapati, means he was appointed by Lord Brahma as the progenitor of creatures in this world. So, he was having a very big position. But, in an assembly, he was too much disturbed when all, everybody rose up as he entered and Lord Shiva did not rise from his position. Right? He was puffed up. Right? Puffed up. Everybody should respect me. Why? Because I am Prajapati. Right? So, one, we should understand our actions are more important, not our positions. In the material world, more importance is given to positions, power. After getting all that position, name, fame, what are you actually doing in your daily life? That is more important. Isn't it? See, Daksha Prajapati was, definitely had a big position. But, look at his mentality. Lord Shiva, who is worshipable to all the Devatas, just because he is his son-in-law, he is expecting Lord Shiva should also rise. So, when we are too much conscious about my position, how others will perceive me, you know, we lose the basic discrimination. We lose the spiritual knowledge and everything appears to be, you know, competition. Who is great here? Right?

**Key Quote:** "First, let me use my might. Might is right. That is demon's thinking."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts the story of Ravana attempting to lift Mount Kailasa, highlighting his demonic mentality of relying on might rather than devotion.

Another example, with same Lord Shiva, another demoniac personality, Ravana. Ravana had ten arms. Right? Or ten heads? I was just testing, if you are listening carefully. Yeah. Ravana had ten heads. So, he was a heavy head person. Right? So, once he went to Kailasa, and he said, who is this Lord Shiva? Let us see. Many people say that Ravana was a great devotee of Lord Shiva. But, let us examine this situation. After that, your perspective about Ravana will change. So, Ravana said, who is this Shiva? Let us see. And, I will show my might to Shiva. So, what did he do? He wanted to lift Lord Shiva along with his Kailasa. Not as a Vahana Seva. He did not want to do Vahana Seva, Brahmotsava Seva for Lord Shiva. That was not the idea. He wanted to show his might. So, he was lifting, trying to lift. So, then what happened? Lord Shiva said, some fellow has come. He is thinking, he is too much about himself. Let me teach a lesson. So, he just pressed with his thumb, he just pressed the Kailasa. And, it fell down. The Kailasa and his hand got stuck there. He is trying his best to remove the hand. He is not able to do that. Right? And then, he thought, now my might is not helping me. See, this is the thinking of demons. First, let me use my might. Might is right. That is demon's thinking. And, when might doesn't work, okay, I will fall at your feet. But, that is not with true devotion.

**Key Quote:** "Pride goes before a fall."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of Ravana, emphasizing his pride and ultimate downfall at the hands of Lord Ramachandra, who appeared in human form.

So, there also, Ravana wanted to exhibit his Sanskrit scholarly ability. So, he composed one song to glorify Lord Shiva. There also, it was not out of devotion. If you read the song, you know, it is too much of showing his hold on Sanskrit language, Sanskrit poetry and grammar. And then, Lord Shiva said, okay, this fellow, at least he came to his senses. And, he forgave him. He forgave Ravana. See how, Ravana's prestige, you know, there is a prestige cooker. So, prestige is like too much thinking about yourself. You know, bhavlena, they say, right? Too much, I am thinking about myself. So, Ravana was like that. He was, he was, finally by his faults, he didn't learn a lesson even after that. He didn't know that, okay, Lord Shiva, out of his mercy, he has forgiven me. But, later on, he went on to challenge the supreme personality of Godhead, Ramachandra himself. He was thinking too much about himself. And finally, you know, Lord Ramachandra taught him a very big lesson, which he can never forget. And, no one should forget also. Right? So, that's why there is a saying, pride goes before a fall. Pride goes before a fall. So, now human beings are also doing the same thing today in Kali Yuga. Prabhupada points out this. Humans think that we are the superior species. All other species, you know, they are all useless people. Like Ravana, we are also thinking. Ravana, when he did tapasya to Lord Brahma, he gave a list of all kinds of personalities who should not kill him. Yakshas, Gandharvas, Rakshasas, Kinnaras, Kimpurushas, Devatas, Danavas. He gave a big list. But he didn't add humans into that list. Because he was saying, humans are like mosquitoes. How can I even think that somebody will, human being will come and challenge me? That was his thinking, you know. That's why the Lord appeared as a human being, Lord Ramachandra. And then he taught a big lesson to Ravana. Isn't it?

**Key Quote:** "As long as there are slaughterhouses, there will be battlefields."
**Summary:** The speaker criticizes the human belief in superiority over other species, leading to violence and slaughterhouses, and argues that this violence prevents peace and happiness.

So, human beings today are thinking like that about other species of life. By opening slaughterhouses. In fact, some people who are so called religious also think that all animals are meant for my satisfaction of my tongue and my belly. So they have big big slaughterhouses, mechanized slaughterhouses. Per hour, they kill lakhs and lakhs of innocent animals. And they think, yes, because I am the most advanced species, I have control over all. I am so great. But Mother Nature boomerangs. Mother Nature gives it back. How? As long as there are slaughterhouses, there will be battlefields. Every now and then we have battles, wars. Isn't it? So many innocent people are dying in the wars. Why? Because we are killing innocent animals. As long as we don't stop violence against animals, it is not possible that we live a peaceful, happy life. So Prabhupada would always say this. So therefore, we should never think that, you know, we are so great, we are so advanced. No, that is not the thinking. Right?

### Vedic Culture, Atithi Devo Bhava, Hospitality, Parikshit Maharaj, Shami Karushi, Shringi

**Key Quote:** "Atithi Devo Bhava, a guest, when he comes to your house, you are supposed to give him treatment as good as God."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the Vedic principle of 'Atithi Devo Bhava' (treating guests as God) and argues that Shami Karushi and Shringi failed to provide proper hospitality to Parikshit Maharaj.

So, in the Vedic culture, Atithi Devo Bhava, a guest, when he comes to your house, you are supposed to give him treatment as good as God. Atithi means one who comes without Tithi. One who comes without prior notice. Not that you send a WhatsApp message and say, I am going to come to your house. Then, actually speaking, it is not Atithi. In the strict usage of the term, Atithi. So Parikshit Maharaj was an Atithi. At the house of Shami Karushi. So even according to moral Vedic standards, it was the duty of Shami Karushi to give a good hospitality to Parikshit Maharaj. See, from various angles you can see. From moral standards also it was important for Shami Karushi to give a good hospitality. Good hospitality doesn't mean you have to give chappan bhog. You can just speak a few good words. Offer a sitting place. Offer a glass of water. That's all. That is a minimum reception that any person deserves. One who comes to your place. Shami Karushi did not do that. From spiritual point of view, Parikshit Maharaj was Vishnuratha. Right? He was personally protected by the Lord himself when he was in the womb of his mother. He was a sent person. Pure devotee. And he definitely deserves all respect and honour. Which, Shami Karushi did not offer. And then, as a citizen, King is supposed to be the representative of the Lord. Naradeva. The King is described as Naradeva. The representative of the Lord. From that angle also, Parikshit Maharaj should have been respected by Shami Karushi. See, there is so much lapse on the side of Shami Karushi and Shringi. But still Shringi is justifying the acts of his father. This is wrong. This is wrong.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of giving respect to others without expecting it in return and introduces an anecdote about Western devotees in Vrindavan.

So, we must have the understanding. I will just take 5 more minutes. So, We must have the understanding. We must be ready to give respect. This is what Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said. Amanina Manadena. You don't expect respect from anybody. But be ready to offer all respects to others. This is very very important. So, Just to sum up, You know the essence of this verse. How Prabhupada wanted us to be real Brahmanas, not just namesake Brahmanas. There is one interesting anecdote from Shila Prabhupada's pastimes. Once, Prabhupada along with his devotees, western devotees, they had come to Vrindavan. And few devotees, they were sanyasis, American sanyasis, American devotees. So, They had gone to one of the local temples in Vrindavan to have darshan of the Lord. So, when they were having darshan of the Lord, the priest of that temple was quite appreciative. Oh, white skin people with saffron dress, sanyasis, wearing Tilak, chanting Hare Krishna Mantra. He was very appreciative. So, he came and spoke to them. And he said, You are so good. Oh, westerners, you are so good. Very nice.

**Key Quote:** "A Vaishnava who is cent percent devoted to the Lord, following the rules and regulations given by the spiritual master, is actually more than a Brahmana."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes with an anecdote about an old lady blessing a magistrate, illustrating that a Vaishnava is more advanced than a Brahmana, and encourages listeners to commit to Prabhupada's instructions for spiritual progress.

And then, he said, the priest said, Very nicely you are doing bhakti. I bless you that in the next life, you will take birth in a Brahmana family and you will make advancement. This is what the priest said. So, these devotees, they heard this and they came back to Prabhupada and narrated the whole thing. And when Prabhupada heard this, Prabhupada smiled. And Prabhupada narrated another story. So, Prabhupada said, once there was an old lady, this is in the British India, in some remote village she was living. And she had some quarrel with respect to property issue with her relatives. So, to that village, once magistrate visited that village. So, that lady, that old woman was very happy. So, magistrate will come and help me to sort out this quarrel with my family members and I will get my due share of my property. She was thinking. And she approached the magistrate. And the magistrate helped her also, made sure that whatever is her due share of the property, she got it. And she was so happy, since she was an old woman, she wanted to offer some blessings. To this magistrate. So, she said, she was thinking, you know, being a, you know, magistrate is not a very big thing. Right? Being a police constable is a very big thing. You have lot of power and you can do this danda, you can have, you know. So, he said, she blessed, I bless you that in the next life you will become a police constable. Poor lady, she didn't know that he is already magistrate. But, you know, police constable, she is blessing. So, Prabhupada narrated this story and said, it is something like that. What has happened to you in the temple in Vrindavan is something like that. So, actually, a Vaishnava who is cent percent devoted to the Lord, following the rules and regulations given by the spiritual master, is actually more than a Brahmana. Actually, that is the conclusion. So, if we follow the instructions given by Srila Prabhupada nicely, chanting minimum 16 rounds of Hare Krishna Maha Mantra attentively and following strictly the four regulative principles, then, by the mercy of Prabhupada, we can acquire all the Brahmanical qualifications and we can make progress more than that. Prabhupada said, a Vaishnava is an advanced Brahmana. More than that, we are not supposed to stay in the Brahma Jnana level, Brahmana level. We are supposed to become a devotee, lover of Krishna. That is Vaishnava. So, let us all pray to Srila Prabhupada that let us all commit to Prabhupada, rather, we should commit to Prabhupada that I will strictly adhere to the instructions given by your divine grace and help me become truly qualified, not just for namesake. Let me become truly qualified and let me serve your glorious mission and make my life successful. So, we will stop here. Granth Raj Srimad Bhagavatam Ki Jai

## What Is the Difference Between Being Educated and Wise | Sri Sampati Dasa

**Key Quote:** "Ramayana teaches us mere education is not enough we have to make people wise and they become wise when they develop character like lord shri ram not like ravan."
**Summary:** The lecture contrasts the educated but unwise Ravana with the educated and wise Lord Rama, highlighting the importance of character and self-control over mere education, using examples from the Ramayana to illustrate the difference.

How to educate people, how to earn property in the rightful manner. Ravan was also called brahmin, he was educated. What did he do when he heard about the beauty of mother Sita? He became lusty. Difference between being educated, being wise. Ramayan teaches an important lesson for all of us, especially in the modern day, the difference between being educated, being wise. We find the example of Ravan, who was highly educated, who was called Pandit Ravan. Ravan was called Pandit. He is a son of a great sage called Vishravas, a brahmana sage Vishravas, and Ravan was also called brahmin, right? People say that he is brahmin. The brahmin is the one who knows the Vedas, who has got a lot of knowledge, but unfortunately, even though he was a Pandit, he was son of a brahmana sage Vishravas, he was not a wise person. He had so much of arrogance, he was lusty, he was greedy, he was arrogant. When he heard about the beauty of mother Sita, he became lusty and he went to kidnap mother Sita, who was married, was happily living with her husband Shri Ram, but he went and kidnapped her. His education didn't help him. And he was educated, what did he do? He went and snatched Lanka from his half brother Kubera. So he was power hungry, he wanted property of Lanka and he was hungry, so he was not satisfied. His education didn't teach him how to be satisfied. His education didn't teach him how to earn property in the rightful manner. In a wrong way, he snatched property from his own brother Kubera. He went and kidnapped a married woman because he was lusty. So but he was highly educated. On the other hand, we see the great personality Lord Shri Ram, who was also educated, but more than educated, he was a wise person. The moment he was asked to choose between Ayodhya and going to forest, he happily chose to go to forest and gave up Ayodhya to his own brother Bharat. In fact, in Ramayana we see when Bharat was ready to offer Ayodhya back to Ram, Ram was very happy being in the forest. He wanted Bharat to continue to be the king and take care of Ayodhya till he returns. So Ram was very satisfied with what was there in his life. He was not an ambitious, over ambitious person like Ravan, who was ready to snatch property from his own brother. Here Ram is happily handing over Ayodhya to his own brother Bharat. And Ram, even though Shurpanaka came and offered herself, Ram did not become lusty. He had control over himself. He used his wisdom, he used his power, his knowledge to have control over himself, to follow the promise given to his own wife that ekapatni vratasta. When a woman, a beautiful woman coming and offering herself with her own consent, let's have fun, Ram said no, I cannot, I would like to follow my promise and I'm not interested in this. But Ravan became lusty. Ram exhibited self-control. So we need wise people, not just knowledge of the world, but knowledge of the world and knowledge of the people, not educated people. In today's society, we are all talking about how to educate people, but Ramayana teaches us mere education is not enough. We have to make people wise and they become wise when they develop character like Lord Shri Ram, not like Ravan. If you are only concerned about education, not character building, then we will have a lot of educated characterless people like Ravan. Like we hear many times when the police arrest some of the terrorists, some of the terrorists happen to be highly educated, like double degree, like medical, they have done their MBBS, they have done their masters in some engineering field and they have become terrorists. So we need people like Lord Shri Ram and Shri Ram teaches us the importance of wisdom, importance of knowledge.

This is the quality of those who are powerful. A power is always used in the service of the weak people. In that way, Hanuman was in the side of Sugriv. When Hanuman came to know about Lord Shriram, whose wife was kidnapped, that means there was injustice done to Lord Shriram by Ravana. Immediately Hanuman came to do saviour.

Sita was put into a very, very distressful condition by Ravana and Hanuman fought with great valour to give justice to Mother Sita. So Hanuman is popular and worshipped because throughout his life, he used his power, his intelligence, his courage in the service of Dharma, in the service of Nyaya,

He became the servant of a glorious leader like Shriram. In Ramayana, we also see Ravana, who is also powerful. Ravan also had many powerful, intelligent servants but nobody is remembered today. They all gave up their lives serving Ravan but nobody is worshipped and nobody, we don't even know their names because they were all on the side of adharma and the side of anyai. Anybody who takes the side of adharma and anyai, they will be dead and they will be forgotten. Even in the modern history, there are many so-called powerful people like Napoleon, like Hitler. Do we even remember them or their followers? No, we don't even know who are their followers. But Hanuman, from thousands of years, people remember, glorify, worship him

**Key Quote:** "Hanuman received nothing in return. He received the love of Shri Ram."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes Hanuman's selfless service and the love he received from Lord Shriram as his reward, highlighting his example as a servant leader who inspires others to follow dharma and nyaya without expecting personal gain.

because he stood for nyaya and dharma and that is why he has become an inspiration for everyone to follow. Even though Hanuman did so much service to Lord Shri Ram, did he ever ask anything in return? When I become servant of somebody, I am always thinking what is the profit of doing so much of service? What did I get in return? What is the reward that Hanuman received? Hanuman received nothing in return. He received the love of Shri Ram. So here is a selfless person. For whom, the service to dharma, service to nyaya itself is a reward. So I think we all have an inherent attraction to such people who stand up for dharma, who stand up for nyaya selflessly, not for any reward. So Hanuman is that example who selflessly fought for nyaya and dharma for Shri Ram and he remained very happy and satisfied, servant of Shri Ram. So he teaches an example how to become a servant leader. He is a good servant of Shri Ram and he is a good leader for all of us to follow.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the question of why Lord Ram banished Sita, emphasizing the importance of a leader's spotless character and public perception.

Did Lord Shri Ram doubt his beloved wife, Mother Sita, especially after she gave Agni Pariksha? Today, we all demand that our leaders should be corruption free. If there are any allegations of corruption, we ask them, resign from your post. Just because an ordinary citizen passed in your comments, they had this doubt that whether she is fit. Oh, look how Ram has become so blindly attached to his wife. He is so lusty. It is very important to have spotless character to continue

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Lord Ram and Sita, as king and queen, needed to maintain a spotless character to inspire citizens to follow dharma, drawing a parallel to modern expectations of corruption-free leaders.

to be king and queen. Did Lord Shri Ram doubt his beloved wife, Mother Sita, especially after she gave Agni Pariksha? Just because an ordinary citizen passed in your comments on Sita's character? No, never. Lord Shri Ram never doubted his wife, Sita. Then how do we understand? Then why did he send Mother Sita to forest just because of somebody doubting the character of Sita? It is because we need to understand Lord Shri Ram and Sita, they are not just husband and wife. They are also the king and queen of Ayodhya. As a king and queen of Ayodhya, it is very important to have spotless character to continue to be king and queen. So when the citizens had this doubt that their queen was with some other man for one year, they had this doubt that whether she is fit to continue to be queen of Ayodhya. Like today, we all demand that our leaders should be corruption free. If we come to know or if we get a doubt that this leader is involved in some gotala, there is some corruption charges, we many times we see people asking them to step down. We ask them resign from your post because you know you have to prove that you are corruption free. If there are any allegations of corruption, you cannot continue to occupy the post of a minister. Similarly, in those days, it is not just corruption, it was also character which was more important, right. So it was very important for king and queen to have spotless character and that inspires the citizen also to follow the dharma marga, the righteous path. If the king and queen themselves have a dubious character, compromised character, immoral, unethical, that will encourage the citizens also to follow

In their life, so it is not just enough for the king and queen to do economic development and give all the facilities in the citizen, there also should be inspiring figures to follow dharma, to follow morality, to follow ethical good behavior, conduct. So Lord Ram and Mother Sita were teaching that to their citizens by themselves having spotless character. So Mother Sita, as a queen, her character was doubted. That is why Lord Sri Ram, till her character was proven again, asked Mother Sita to be away from the politics of Ayodhya or away from the palace, away from the king's life. As a king, he distanced himself from the queen. As husband, he always

### Rajasuya Yagna, Sita's Position, Ram's Faith, Public Doubt vs. Husband's Belief

**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Rajasuya Yagna to illustrate that Lord Ram never doubted Sita's character as his wife, even though he distanced himself from her as queen due to public doubt, highlighting the golden statue of Sita used in the Yagna.

maintained his highest relationship with Mother Sita. He never doubted Mother Sita's character. When Ram did Rajasuya Yagna, Rajasuya Yagna or any Yagna can always be done by a married person with his wife, because wife has equal rights to participate in Yagna. At that time, Sita was at the forest. As a ideal king, Lord Sri Ram, distanced himself from Queen Sita, whose character was under question. But, as a loving husband he never doubted his beloved wife Sita. Rajasuya is an example for this. Rajasuya Yajna was done by kings and when Lord Shri Ram was about to do Rajasuya Yajna, the priest in Ayodhya questioned Lord Shri Ram, where is the wife? Because without wife, you cannot perform Rajasuya Yajna alone. At that time, Lord Shri Ram as loving husband got golden statue of Sita, his beloved wife and along with that golden statue Sita, he completed Rajasuya Yajna. If Lord Ram had any doubt about Sita's character, why would he do golden statue of his wife Sita? He gave that glorious position of his wife. In the Rajasuya Yajna, he said that only Sita is eligible to be part of Rajasuya Yajna as my wife. He never rejected Sita as his beloved wife. Yes, queen whose character was under doubt, the public had the doubt, not the king Ram, husband Ram especially. So Rajasuya Yajna episode tells us Rama gave the glorious position of wife to mother Sita only,

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Lord Ram with modern leaders who prioritize their families, emphasizing that Ram chose the nation and its citizens' welfare over his personal life.

not to Sita. Not to anyone else, not that he rejected Sita. And another very important lesson that many people miss out is the topic of Parivarvaat, today we hear. Today we hear how leaders, powerful people and those occupy the leadership and powerful position in our country do everything for their own family, for their family members, right? At the cost of their own family members, they do everything for their own family members. At the cost of citizens at the cost of the growth of the country. They're very happy to see their family growing, the family property growing, and being with family, being together family, they say, no, no, no, I can't be in the jail. I want to be with my wife. I want to be with my children. But what about country's growth? Nobody cares. But Lord Sri Ram is very different leader. He chose nation. He chose the growth of the country first. He chose the citizens' comfort first, not his personal life. He kept his personal life away from the country. Where do we find such great leaders today? Ram is an inspiration for all the leaders.

### Freedom of Speech, Monarchy, Justice, Detachment, Public Opinion

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "He said in his kingdom, citizens can without any fear even question the credibility of the king and queen."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights Lord Ram's tolerance of criticism, contrasting it with authoritarian regimes, and explains that Ram distanced himself from Sita as queen to allow an impartial judgment of her character.

Today, it is very hard to find people who keep their family away and country first. Today, sometimes we hear like in the example of Bangkok in Thailand, there is a monarch dynasty. If you pass any comments, negative comments on the king or that dynasty, you will be jailed. You will be sent to jail. In fact, you may be sentenced. The life sentence be given for those who talk against the royal family. Lord Ram was a monarch. He had all the power in his hand. He could have immediately won. He could have immediately executed those who commented on mother Sita. But he didn't punish those who passed comments on the Sita. He said in his kingdom, citizens can without any fear even question the credibility of the king and queen. He did not threaten the citizen. He did not scare the citizen. I am the powerful person. How dare you talk on my family members? He was okay to be questioned. A king also can be questioned, he said. For that, he could have easily taken the side of Sita. And he said, no, I know the character of my wife Sita. He did not appear to be Parivarwadi. He said, let other authorities justify the Sita's character. Like today, we go to Supreme Court. If there is any corruption charge, the government themselves cannot say we are clean. We are clean. If there is any allegation. A third party like Supreme Court should hear and give verdict. And once the Supreme Court gives verdict, everybody will accept it. If Ram himself speaks in favour of Sita, then people will say, Oh, look how Ram has become so blindly attached to his wife. He obviously speaks in favour of his wife. He is so lusty. He is attached to his wife. So Ram did not take the side of mother Sita. So he distanced himself from the queen.

### Valmiki's Verdict, Authority, Trust, Reacceptance, Supreme Court Analogy

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Valmiki gave his verdict that Sita is, she has spotless character."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Valmiki, a respected sage, vouched for Sita's character, similar to a Supreme Court verdict, leading to her reacceptance as queen.

But as husband, he always gave the position of a great wife to mother Sita. Later, in another authority in the society, in Treta Yuga, the great sages were given the great authority. Like the kings, they were also authorities. When Valmiki comes and he says with his tapas shakti of 60,000 years of tapasya, he says, I vouch for the character of Sita. And everybody now accepts. He accepts the statement of Valmiki because Valmiki does not have any favouritism, right? Because Sita is no way connected to Valmiki. And Valmiki, who was so pure with his tapas shakti, who has that faith and trust in the public, the public was ready to accept the statement of Valmiki. And when he said that Sita is clean, Sita's character is pure, then Ram said she can come back as the queen of Ayodhya. So, like Supreme Court gave verdict, Valmiki gave his verdict that Sita is, she has spotless character.

### Sita's Acceptance, Dharma Sankat, Dual Roles, Sacrifice, Nationalism

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Ram has dual roles to play. He has a role of a king, role of a husband."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing Sita's acceptance of Ram's actions, understanding his dual roles as king and husband, and highlighting Ram's sacrifice and nationalistic leadership.

At that time, Ram was ready to welcome mother Sita. If at all Ram mistreated his wife Sita, he doubted the character of Sita, he has hurt the feelings and emotions of Sita, then what was Sita's response to this? The Sita's response itself will tell us, that how she was happy with Sri Ram's action of sending her to forest. At the end, mother Sita asked that life after life, I want Sri Ram as my husband. If Sri Ram mistreated her, why she wants Sri Ram again as her husband? That itself will tell us, clarify all the doubts, as a responsible, mature queen, Sita understood the Dharma Sankat of Ram. Ram has dual roles to play. He has a role of a king, role of a husband. So, the family of Lord Sri Ram always stood by country, stood by the welfare of the citizen, not the personal happiness, personal benefit. When it was about to do Pattabhisheka, become king, at that time also Ram chose Ayodhya first, his personal happiness later. He went to forest in order to demonstrate the entire citizen, here is a government that always keeps up the promise. It never goes away from the words, the promises that we have made, Raghukula Reethi Sada Chaliyai. Even at the cost of being in the forest and going through so much tribulation, even at this case, Lord Sri Ram is being away from such loving wife, just to show to the people, the whole world that how a leader always chooses his duty first, country first, welfare of the citizen first, and family is last. He is never a Parivarwadi, in fact he is a Rashtravadi. He is a great, true, inspiring, nationalistic leader
