**Summary:** Devotion requires patience; one cannot expect immediate conversion to Krishna consciousness through logic and arguments.

So, one has to be extremely determined. It requires patience, lots of patience to make even one soul a devotee. Don't think that immediately I will tell, I will meet my friend and I will explain all logic and arguments, everything, and now he will understand Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "She is simply distributing Krishna Bhakti to one and all."
**Summary:** Chaitanya Mahaprabhu desires to give Krishna Bhakti to everyone, regardless of their material position, and wants devotees to distribute it.

So taking up devotional service to Krishna is not at all easy. And Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's desire is to give this Bhakti, Krishna Bhakti or Krishna Prema to one and all irrespective of their present material position, whatever they may be. She is not saying, "Are you Brahmana, are you, you have enough Punya or not." She is not checking and giving. She is simply distributing Krishna Bhakti to one and all. And Lord Chaitanya is telling, "I alone cannot distribute. I mean, I want all of you to take up this task and simply distribute these fruits of Krishna consciousness. This Hare Krishna mantra is the fruit which we have to distribute to everyone. You taste it and you distribute."

### success, service, illusion
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/n9250sNN0nE?t=112
**Verse References:** BG 2.47
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Do not try to understand the good deeds of the Lord, but simply understand the service of the Lord."
**Summary:** Inducing even one person to become Krishna conscious is a success, and one should focus on serving the Lord rather than understanding His deeds.

So somehow or other, if we can induce even one person to become Krishna conscious, then that is success. Srila Prabhupada also writes in Bhagavad Gita, if you see the preface of Bhagavad Gita, Prabhupada writes in the last paragraph, I'll just read this. A living entity is happily the part and parcel of the Lord and thus is not a part and parcel of the Lord. A living entity is pleased with the good deeds of the Lord. A living entity is pleased with the good deeds of the Lord and thus is not a part and parcel of the Lord. It is all the good deeds of the Lord that are called as good deeds. Do not try to understand the good deeds of the Lord, but simply understand the service.

### sense gratification, satisfaction, Bhagavad Gita

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Instead of satisfying our own senses independently, we have to satisfy the senses of the Lord."
**Summary:** True happiness comes from satisfying the senses of the Lord, which is the central point of the Bhagavad Gita.

By the spell of illusion, one tries to be happy by serving his personal sense gratification in different forms, which will never make him happy. Instead of satisfying his own personal material senses, he has to satisfy the senses of the Lord. That is the highest perfection of life. The Lord wants this and he demands it. One has to understand this central point of Bhagavad Gita. This is a central point. What is that? Instead of satisfying our own senses independently, we have to satisfy the senses of the Lord. This is central point

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "If even one man becomes a pure devotee of the Lord, we shall consider our attempt a success."
**Summary:** The Krishna consciousness movement teaches the central point of the Bhagavad Gita, and even one person becoming a pure devotee is considered a success, highlighting the difficulty of achieving pure devotion.

of Bhagavad Gita. Our Krishna consciousness movement is teaching the whole world this central point and because we are not polluting the theme of Bhagavad Gita as it is, anyone seriously interested in deriving benefit by studying the Bhagavad Gita must take help from the Krishna consciousness movement for practical understanding of Bhagavad Gita under the direct guidance of the Lord. We hope, therefore, that people will derive the greatest benefit by studying Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavad Gita as it is, as we have presented it here, and if even one man becomes a pure devotee of the Lord, we shall consider our attempt a success. So Prabhupada is writing, if even one man becomes a pure devotee by studying this Bhagavad Gita as it is, then Srila Prabhupada says, he considers it as a success. So that means we can see how difficult

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Any good soul who approaches me once for spiritual enlightenment is supposed to be depending on my responsibility to get him back, back to Krishna, back to home."
**Summary:** The first step is to induce pure devotion, and a spiritual master feels responsible for guiding a disciple back to Krishna, even if the disciple misunderstands.

The first step is to induce a conditioned soul to take up pure devotion to Krishna. In one letter, Prabhupada writes to his disciple, in 1967, some senior disciples of Prabhupada had left the movement, Kirtananda, Hayagriva, like that some disciples had left and Prabhupada has written one letter about how a spiritual master feels when a disciple leaves and goes. So Prabhupada writes, "When you left us, I simply prayed to Krishna for your return to Krishna consciousness because that was my duty. Any good soul who approaches me once for spiritual enlightenment is supposed to be depending on my responsibility to get him back, back to Krishna, back to home. The disciple may misunderstand me. a bona fide spiritual master being obliged to do so under pressure of Maya's influence."

### spiritual master, disciple, Maya, lamentation

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The master regrets for his inability to protect the disciple and sometimes he cries with tears in his eyes."
**Summary:** A spiritual master regrets when a disciple leaves due to Maya's influence, sometimes even crying, as illustrated by an anecdote about Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur.

But what Guru feels, Prabhupada is writing, when a disciple misunderstands a bona fide spiritual master, the master regrets for his inability to protect the disciple and sometimes he cries with tears in his eyes. So spiritual master cries, when a disciple leaves him and goes away, he cries helplessly. We had an experience while my Guru Maharaj was alive. One of his disciples who accepted sanyasa was one day forcibly dragged by his wife. My Guru Maharaj lamented with tears in his eyes saying that he could not save the soul. So Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur, he had one disciple who was a sanyasi and wife came again. Generally after taking sanyasa, sanyasi should not meet the wife. But somehow this wife was very powerful, Maya. She went and dragged him back and Guru started crying that he could not save that soul.

### Maya, chanting, offenses, spiritual master

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The greatest offence is to defy the spiritual master and to act sinfully, thinking in the strength of chanting."
**Summary:** The only guarantee against Maya's attack is chanting Hare Krishna offenselessly, but defying the spiritual master and deliberately sinning while relying on chanting are the greatest offenses.

So we should always therefore be careful in the matter of being attacked by Maya's influence. And the only means of guarantee is to chant Hare Krishna offenselessly: Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. So if we chant Hare Krishna mantra offenselessly, only then we are guaranteed of Maya's attack, protection of Maya's attack. So this is the only way Prabhupada is writing. But still we should be careful of the offences against chanting the holy name. Prabhupada writes, "The greatest offence is to defy the spiritual master and to act sinfully, thinking in the strength of chanting. If a man thinks that chanting will save him from all kinds of sinful reaction and deliberately commit sin, then he becomes greatest offender."

## Deity of Krishna vs deities of the demigods | Soulful Japa
**Speaker:** HH Stoka Krishna Maharaj

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Because the Devatas are living beings. They cannot be at multiple places at the same time while Krishna does not have such limits."
**Summary:** This segment explains the fundamental difference between the Deity of Krishna and deities of demigods, highlighting Krishna's unlimited nature and ability to be present in the Deity form.

How are the Deities or Demigods different from the Deity of Krishna? Because the Devatas are living beings. They cannot be at multiple places at the same time, while Krishna does not have such limits. Yes. One thing, when it is Krishna, Krishna Deity body is Krishna's energy only. So for him, you know, to be in a Deity body is not an issue at all. He is present there and he can receive everything through the Deity, all these things.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna says that one who, anybody who has faith in anybody, I am seated in their heart and I make that faith steady."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how the Lord facilitates demigod worship by empowering them and how demigod deities are images, unlike Krishna's deity which is non-different from Him.

When it comes to the Demigods, the Lord Paramatma has given this special facility to them. Krishna says that one who, anybody who has faith in anybody, I am seated in their heart and I make that faith steady. So to facilitate this kind of even Demigod worship in this material world, the Demigods are given this power to know that there is a Deity of Ganesha being worshipped here. And then that doesn't mean that that Deity body is his. It is an image only. He knows it is an image. Image is different. Just like, you know, ordinary people, you take their photo. Photo is different. I am different. My photo is different. I am different.

**Key Quote:** "But one who has got a spiritual body, there is no difference between him and his photo."
**Summary:** This segment explains that those with spiritual bodies, like Prabhupada, are non-different from their images, which is why their photos are worshipable, similar to how Krishna manifests in the Deity.

But one who has got a spiritual body, there is no difference between him and his photo. That is why even now we keep Prabhupada's photo in the altar. Bhaktisiddhant's photo is in the altar. They are not photos. Because they have a spiritual body, they are non-different from that. They manifest in the substance itself. Just like Krishna manifests in the substance of the body. That is the Deity.

But the Demigods cannot do that. Demigods will just know. Just like, you know, an ordinary man goes. He sees all his factory workers have kept one picture and they are worshipping. He is very pleased. Oh, you are worshipping me. Okay, I will give you a bonus. Devatas are like that. Devatas know that they are being worshipped in this temple, that temple, that temple. They know that their image is being worshipped. And therefore they are pleased with them.

## Delightfully welcome Krishna on your tongue | Soulful Japa

### welcoming Krishna, chanting, relationship with God
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/1dbeA1UaCbk?t=0
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "So in the same way, the Holy name is the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that chanting the Holy Name is like welcoming the Supreme Personality of Godhead as a VIP, emphasizing the importance of delight, relishing association, and enthusiastic service.

We already said that chanting is like welcoming the Lord. So there's a feeling in welcoming. You delightfully welcome, is it not? If you invite somebody to your house, you delightfully welcome them. Not that you're, you know, like a very, somehow okay, I have to invite them. Not like that. You delightfully invite them. Two ways you can do. Delightfully you can invite them, or some social obligation is there. We have to call them, let them come. No, it's not like that. You have to delightfully call them. So in the same way, the Holy name is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Supreme Personality is no supreme. There's no person superior to Him. So that Supreme Personality of Godhead, we also used another important word which brings out a kind of, we can relate with that feeling. What is that? Like a V-I-P. So infinite V's, I-P. So Krishna is like a I-I-P, most important person, infinitely important person. Suppose in your house someone comes. Let's say somebody whom you admire so much and he is a role model for you. He comes to your house. You will be delighted, not a. You will be delighted to receive him, and you will relish his association. You will want to relish his association. You want to hear from him or you want to relish his association. And then you are going to be very enthusiastic till he leaves, you want to be enthusiastic to serve him. So that, you know, there is a relationship built, there is a pleasure of serving him. So take this, understand these three things: One is delight, delightfully welcoming, relishing the association, enthusiastically serving.

## Glories of Sudarshana Chakra Weapon of Krishna | Sri Madhava Hari Dasa | SB 1.18.30 | 14.07.2024
**Speaker:** HH Stoka Krishna Maharaj

### insult, anger, divine will
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/7V7ocwrEu6k?t=0
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "It so happened by the will of the lord."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of Parikshit Maharaj's actions and attributes them to the will of the Lord.

OM NAMO BHAGAVATE VASUDEVAYA Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 1, Chapter 18, Text No. 30 SATU BRAMHARSHE RAMSHE GATHASUM URAGAM RUSHA VINIRGACCHAN DHANUSHKOTYA NIDHAYAPURA MAGATAHA Translation and purport by Sriban Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada Translation While leaving, the king, being so insulted, picked up a lifeless snake with his bow and angrily placed it on the shoulder of the sage. Then he returned to his palace. The king thus treated the sage tit-for-tat. Although he was never accustomed to such silly actions, by the will of the lord, the king, while going away, found a dead snake in front of him. And he thought that the sage, who had coldly received him, thus might be coldly rewarded by being offered a garland of a dead snake. In the ordinary course of dealing, this was not very unsightly. It was unnatural. But in the case of Maharaja Pariksit dealing with a brahmana sage, this was certainly unprecedented. It so happened by the will of the lord.

### reception, hospitality, duty
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/7V7ocwrEu6k?t=103
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "This is the law of reception."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the importance of proper reception, even to enemies, contrasting it with the cold treatment Parikshit Maharaj received.

Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta Parabrahma. So, we have seen in the last few verses that when Pariksit Maharaj entered the ashram of Samika Rishi, who was carrying a knife and bone on his shoulder, who was deeply meditating, who was in complete silence and he was not aware of the externals as to what is happening. In the last verse, we saw that Pariksit Maharaj was hungry and thirsty. And so, he went into the ashram so that he may be received well and he may be offered with water. But here we see that the Shamika Rishi was in deep meditation, was in complete silence and there was no one to receive him. It is said, according to the law of reception, even if an enemy comes to the house, he should be received. He should be offered a good seat. And he should offer him water. Just like we see in the case of, in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, when the Pandavas and Kauravas were fighting like enemies, and soon after the sun set, they were all one. They were all very friendly. In one such instance, Arjuna happened to visit Duryodhana. And Duryodhana considered Arjuna as an enemy. But when he went to his palace, when he meets Duryodhana, Duryodhana welcomes him with all good reception. He offers him good seating. And in fact he says, please tell me what is your desire. I shall fulfill all your desire. This is the law of reception.

### anger, divine will, consequences
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/7V7ocwrEu6k?t=244
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Eventually, we will see that the Parikshit was cursed by a sage."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Parikshit Maharaj's anger and its consequences, linking it to the will of the Lord and setting the stage for the recitation of Srimad Bhagavatam.

But here we see in the case of Parikshit Maharaj, who is the emperor of the entire planet, there was no one to receive him. And this is called cold treatment. We also come across people whom we meet, they treat coldly. Is it not? Sometimes we meet people, you know, they treat us very coldly. They don't give a warm reception. No smile on their face. No such pleasantries. So this is called cold treatment. And Parikshit, when he entered, this was his expectation that somebody would receive him. He would offer him some water. And the sage was in complete meditation, in deep meditation. And he was indifferent to what is happening. Therefore this is considered as cold treatment. And Parikshit was upset. It is said in this verse, he became angry. And in anger, he took a lifeless snake which was on the ground and garlanded him on his shoulder. Actually, if this stage was not set up, we would have not sat here and heard Srimad Bhagavatam. Eventually, we will see that Parikshit was cursed by a sage, that he was cursed by a Brahmana boy, that he would die in seven days. And Parikshit, after hearing the curse, he could have contracted, but he did not. And then he gave up his kingdom, goes to Sukadeva Goswami, hears the Bhagavatam. That's why we are all sitting here and hearing Srimad Bhagavatam, because the act of Parikshit was because of the will of the Lord. Prabhupada says in today's Parapat, it happened so because of the will of the Lord.

### free will, desire, anger, Krishna consciousness
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/7V7ocwrEu6k?t=387
**Verse References:** BG 2.62-63
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "When his desire is not fulfilled, immediately there is anger."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of free will, its misuse, and how unfulfilled desires lead to anger, connecting it to Krishna's teachings in the Bhagavad Gita.

Now, after hearing so much of philosophy in Krishna conscious, we know that every living entity has free will. Is it not? Every living entity has free will. And using this free will, we may use our will, we may misuse our free will. And this misuse of free will is leading us to different destinations of life. Sometimes as human beings, sometimes as animals, sometimes as reptiles, birds, etc. It is very crucial that how we use this free will. Now in the case of Parikshit, he acted according to the will of the Lord. What does it mean? Will of the Lord, what does it mean? It is actually Lord's desire. His will was controlled by the Lord. The pure devotees act according to the will of the Lord, according to the desire of the Lord, according to the mission of the Lord. Whereas our free will, this free will, we are free. We freely act according to our whims, according to our desires. What pleases us, we act. And that's why we are taking birth after birth, in the wheel of material nature. But here, Parikshit acted according to the will of the Lord. His expectation was not fulfilled when he entered the ashram of the sage. And therefore, he becomes angry. In this context, even Krishna also says in the Bhagavad Gita, that how one can become angry? What leads one to become angry? He says in the Bhagavad Gita, when one is contemplating on something material, he becomes attached to it. He wants to fulfill his desire. When his desire is not fulfilled, immediately there is anger. In this context, on the occasion of Sudarshana Jayanti, a similar instance is being described in Srimad Bhagavatam. How, if one's desire is not fulfilled,

he becomes angry. Once, what happened was, it is given in Srimad Bhagavatam 9th canto, Amrish Maharaj, he was a great devotee of Lord Krishna. He was blessed with all opulence, unlimited opulence. And he was the king of the entire planet. He had good name, fame, position, and everything was under his control. But, he was not attached to anything material, to any of these opulences he was not attached. In fact, he compared this opulence to an insignificant piece of a stone. It is said, Amrish Maharaj, a great devotee of Lord Vasudeva, engaged in the service of the devotees of the Lord, tadbhakteshu ca sadhusu. And he compared this Vishwam, prapto bhavam param vishwam, he compared this entire universe, entire Vishwam, enidam lostravat smrtham. He compared to an inauspicious, insignificant piece of a stone. In other words, although he was ruling the entire universe, entire planet, he was not at all attached. He was completely detached to all his opulences. Imagine, if we get that opportunity of material opulence, lot of wealth, name, fame, position, what will happen to us? What will happen to us, if we get all these opulences? Hmm? We become attached to it. And because of which, we will not be able to remember the Lord. We will not be able to remember Krishna. Because of opulence, we become pride. We become immersed in sense gratification.

**Key Quote:** "No time."
**Summary:** The speaker shares a personal anecdote about someone who forgot God after being blessed with opulence, illustrating the dangers of attachment and sense gratification.

I remember, when I was travelling to Hyderabad, there was a co-passenger. He was telling that he used to visit temples every day and praying to the Lord, that he be blessed with good wealth, good family, children, position. He was praying for it. And when he was blessed with all opulence, all wealth, good business, good family, he was completely absorbed in it. And he was not visiting temple. He was not thanking the Lord. I asked him, why are you not going to the temple now? He said, no time. He was completely attached. He was immersed in sense gratification. That's why Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, bhogaishwariya prasaktanam. Anyone who is attached to bhoga and aishwarya, what happens? daya pratachetasaam vyavasayatmika buddhihi samadhaunavidiyate The determination to worship the Lord, to please the Lord, does not take place, because he is completely absorbed in sense gratification. Whereas devotees feel, the opulence is an obstacle, because it tends to forget the Lord. It makes us forget the Lord. The opulence makes us forget the Lord. Just like we see in the case of Sudhama, was a poor brahmana. He was in poverty stricken, but he was always remembering the Lord. In all circumstances, he was remembering the Lord.

Even the Pandavas, who were the rightful owners of the property, but they were deprived of their own property. Prosperity, they were completely deprived. But still they were remembering the Lord in all circumstances. They had so many difficulties, so many challenges, but still they were remembering the Lord. They became exalted devotees of Lord Krishna. So although, Amrish Maharaj had all these opulences, he never forgot the Lord. He was always engaging his senses in the service of the Lord. He was completely absorbed in the service of the Lord. 24 hours, he was remembering the Lord. Now one may question, how is it possible to remember the Lord always? 24 hours always, engaging our senses in the service of the Lord 24 hours.

His eyes in seeing the beauty of the Lord. His senses, he engaged his sense of touch in touching the bodies of pure devotees.

And his lips and legs in walking to the holy places of the Lord. His head in bowing before the Lord. Like this he engaged his senses in the service of the Lord, 24 hours. All his desires he engaged in the service of the Lord. It is said, indeed Amrish Maharaj was completely absorbed in the service of the Lord, 24 hours.

But eventually, Japa is a relationship with Krishna. In two hours you're sitting and chanting, it's a relationship with Krishna, just like you go and sit near your loved ones and spend time. The same way we spend time talking to Krishna because today, spiritually, we do not know any other spiritual vocabulary. We are not awakened, so only one vocabulary we know today, which the Guru has given us. What is it? Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. This is our talk with Krishna, sound incarnation. God says that's good enough. Just go on chanting.

**Summary:** The pure name (Shuddha Nama) and the incarnations of the Lord take forms that resemble what we can access through our senses, particularly the sound we produce when chanting, because our attention is focused there.

What is the sound that I can access through my senses, which I can access through my attention, through my mind? What is the sound that I can access? The sound that I chant. So the Shuddha nama also, nama avatar of any incarnates. Just like the Lord and the deity incarnation takes a form which resembles the deity in the same way. There is a reason for that also. The nama avatar also resembles the sound that you produce. Why? Why does it be like that? Because your attention is on the Shaktiavashya nama. So it has to be similar when you are following the same sound features of the sound features.

**Summary:** While we may not be able to directly experience the pure name (Shuddha Nama) or touch the Lord with our material senses, we can connect with Him through our attention.

In other words, today I am unable to chant and hear the Shuddha Nama which Rupa Goswami says, if one is able to do, then one will desire a million tongues and a million ears. But at the same time, I am also aware that the Lord is present. He is present but I cannot touch him. Lord is present before me, but I cannot touch him because I do not. I can only touch him with my attention. But otherwise I cannot, with my present senses, I cannot.

So, please see the merciful nature of the Lord, Nama. He knows that we can give attention only to the Shakti O Vesha Nama. Therefore he takes a sound feature which is identical to Shakti O Vesha Nama. Just like the deity, the Lord's spiritual form takes on a deity form which is identical to the deity so that when you see the deity, you are seeing the transcendental form also. When you offer anything, you are offering to the Lord.

For the Lord, there is no difference. For us, there is a difference. Today, I can touch Shakti Avasya Nama with my tongue, but with my tongue, I cannot chant Shuddha Nama because this material tongue cannot chant Satchidananda Nama. I need Satchidananda tongue. But only attention I can touch, which is great because touching the Aprakrita Nama, touching the Shakti Avasya Nama. All energies flow into us as we are experiencing. Even in our simple starting kindergarten of soulful japa is mindful japa and we are seeing.

**Summary:** The speaker summarizes the previous episode, highlighting Arjuna's visit to Dwaraka and a Brahmana's accusations against the Yadavas.

Welcome back to today's episode of the Mahabharata. In the last episode, we had seen how Arjuna had come to Dwaraka, and when he was sitting along with the Yadavas in the palace, it so happened that one Brahmana came there and he was very distressed, and he started accusing the Yadavas of misrule in Dwaraka, and he went on to use very uncharitable words against the Yadavas.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the historical context of Kamsa's rule, his imprisonment of Devaki and Vasudeva, Krishna's victory over Kamsa, and the subsequent establishment of Ugrasena as ruler, leading to the Yadavas' shift to Dwaraka.

We will learn about the reason behind this. When Kamsa became the king, he deposed his own father, Ugrasena. At that time, Kamsa put Devaki and Vasudeva behind bars because there was a prediction that the child of Vasudeva and Devaki will become the... will become the source, will become the reason for Kamsa's death. And so Kamsa, he impressed not only Devaki and Vasudeva, he also impressed Ugrasena and many other people of the Yadava dynasty. After Krishna came to Mathura and he vanquished Kamsa, Krishna released Vasudeva, Devaki, Ugrasena and all the others, and they established Ugrasena as the ruler. And then later, due to the various attacks by Jarasandha and others, Krishna shifted to Dwaraka.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of a qualified Brahmana in Dwaraka whose newborn son dies immediately after birth, leading him to accuse the Yadava kings of misrule.

From Mathura to Dwaraka, he shifted the entire kingdom and Ugrasena was the ruler. Now, when the Kyatavas were ruling over Dwaraka, one time it so happened that a poor Brahmana, who was a qualified Brahmana, his wife was pregnant and in due course of time, she delivered a boy. But as soon as the boy was delivered, the boy was fine. He was alive and he was fine. He was quite healthy. But a few minutes after the boy was born, suddenly the boy died. And when this happened, the Brahmana, because he was a qualified Brahmana, qualified Brahmana means they would not take up any sort of employment. They would dedicate their life for learning the Vedas. They would always walk the path of truth and austerity. And they would have controlled all their senses. They would not engage in sense gratification. And these were all the good qualities of a Brahmana. So this Brahmana was also a qualified person. And when his child died immediately, he went to the assembly of the Yadavas and he spoke to the king, Ugrasena, as well as all the other Yadava members present in that assembly.

**Key Quote:** "Actually, as per the Vedic civilization, the king is responsible for ensuring that Dharma is followed in the country."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the Vedic concept of a king's responsibility to uphold Dharma, the consequences of Adharma, and the concept of a ghostly body as a result of sinful actions.

He said, how is it that when the father is alive, the son can die? Actually, as per the Vedic civilization, the king is responsible for ensuring that Dharma is followed in the country. If the ruler is Dharmic, then it is expected that the citizens will also follow the codes of Dharma very properly. And by this, the whole civilization would be very peaceful and things would be very stable in the society. There would be no extremes in climate. The winters will be pleasing. The summers will also be pleasing. There would be no natural calamities like earthquakes and floods and drought and such other. Natural calamities would not occur. It was only when the king would become Adharmic, when he would become sinful, then all these kind of disturbance in the society would happen. Not only that, even it was expected that in the Vedic civilization, a father, when he would die, his son would perform the last rites and he would do all the rituals of cremation. And by so doing, the father will get delivered from any sinful activities which will not allow him to take a next birth. So those who are extremely sinful, when they die, they don't get a next birth immediately. They will get a ghostly body. And so such people will have to suffer for some time in those ghostly bodies until their karma gets burnt out and then they will get another body.

**Key Quote:** "Because we have to understand that this body that we have consists of a subtle and a gross body. The gross body consists of the hands, eyes, ears, legs etc. Subtle body consists of mind, intelligence and false ego."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the suffering of a ghostly body, explaining how the unfulfilled desires of the subtle body (mind, intelligence, and false ego) cause distress when there is no gross body to act upon them.

So why is a ghostly body a suffering? Because we have to understand that this body that we have consists of a subtle and a gross body. The gross body consists of the hands, eyes, ears, legs etc. Subtle body consists of mind, intelligence and false ego. So when a person becomes a ghost, what happens is he does not have a gross body, but he has a subtle body consisting of mind, intelligence and false ego. Now, with the subtle body, there are so many desires that are stored in the subtle body. The desire to eat, taste some nice food, desire to hear some good music, desire to see some beautiful object, desire to touch some soft object etc. So now, when a person does not have a gross body, those desires, there is no way that those desires can get fulfilled. So imagine, you are chained up completely, your hands, legs, everything is tied up and you cannot see, you cannot hear, you cannot do anything. What kind of situation it will be? It will be very, very torturous situation. So when a person becomes a ghost, that's what happens with him. All his desires are there, but he does not have a gross body through which he can fulfill those desires. So it is a very distressful condition. Nobody wants to be in that condition.

**Summary:** The speaker describes how performing last rites, Pindadana, and Shraddha ceremonies can help ancestors avoid a ghostly existence, highlighting the anomaly of a son dying before his father in Vedic society.

So if a person has committed some sinful activity by which he is going to get a ghostly body, if he has a son and the son performs the last rites, and also the son performs the Pindadana, from every year, the Shraddha ceremony that is done, if annually that is done for the forefather, then the father and the mother will get saved from any sort of that kind of ghostly situation they might get into. So naturally, according to the Vedic civilization, it was expected that a person would get old and when his lifespan is got over, he would give up his body and his next generation, the son would come and perform the last rites. Now here was a situation, before the father is done, the son is dying, which was completely unheard of in the Vedic civilization. Nowadays it might be a very common affair, but in those days it was not so.

**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of the Brahmana repeatedly accusing the Yadava kings of Adharma after the death of each of his sons, culminating in Arjuna's intervention.

It was considered an anomaly that a person dies young. Everybody was expected to grow old and finish all his duties and then he had to die. So this Brahmana came to the assembly of the kings, Yadava kings, and he started accusing them of not following the principles of Dharma. He accused them saying that you are all simply in the dress of kings you are sitting here, but you are not performing your duties, you have become sense gratifiers and that is how such adharmic things are happening. Like this, he expressed his anger and the Yadava kings, they were all quiet and he walked back. After some time, his wife gave birth to a second son and when the second son took birth, the same incident repeated. The boy was born, healthy baby, live and a few minutes after he takes birth, he dies. Again, the Brahmana came to the assembly and he accused the kings and he alleged that because of their dereliction of the principles of Dharma, these kind of mishappenings were taking place. His intention was at least now the kings should rectify themselves so that these things do not happen. And he went back. Now like this, it went on. Once, twice, thrice, four times, five times. Ninth time, when the ninth son also died like this, the Brahmana again came to the assembly and he accused the Yadava kings. And it was the ninth time when he came to the assembly to accuse the Yadavas that Arjuna also happened to be there. And when Arjuna heard the Brahmana accusing like this, he went to the Brahmana and asked him, What has happened? Why are you accusing the kings like this?

**Summary:** Arjuna promises the Brahmana protection for his tenth child, boasting of his prowess and even mentioning his victory over Lord Shiva to obtain the Pashupatastra, despite the Brahmana's skepticism.

And then the Brahmana narrated his whole ordeal to Arjuna. So then Arjuna told him, Please don't worry. I am neither Krishna nor Sankarsana. I am Arjuna. I am Arjuna, the holder of the Gandiva. So it looks like there are no Kshatriyas in this assembly. There is not even somebody who can at least put on a show of being a Kshatriya. At least somebody who can hold up a bow and arrow in their hand and stand next to you. Looks like there is nobody like that. But don't worry. I am Arjuna. I am there with you and I will come and I will give you all protection. So this Brahmana looked at Arjuna and he laughed at him and said, Arjuna, what are you talking? Krishna and Balarama themselves are there. They are not able to do anything. What can you do? Then Arjuna said, No, no, no. Don't think, you know, I am... What you said is right. I am neither Krishna nor I am Sankarsana nor am I Aniruddha, Pradyumna. I am not any of them. I am Arjuna. I have defeated Lord Shiva and I have got the Pashupatastra from him. So Shiva is Mahadeva and he is the Lord of all the Devatas and I have fought with him. So please come. I will protect you. And I assure you, if I am not able to protect your tenth child, then I will enter flame and give up my body. So the Brahmana said, Okay, if you are so confident. Anyway, let us go. Anyway, let us see. And so the Brahmana went back.

**Summary:** Arjuna prepares to protect the Brahmana's tenth child, but despite his efforts, the child disappears immediately after birth, leading to the Brahmana's disappointment and Arjuna's determination not to give up.

Now Arjuna, because he had given this kind of promise to the Brahmana, he also did not move out of Dwaraka. He stayed in Dwaraka only. So after about nine, ten months or whatever time it takes, the Brahmana again came to the assembly and he informed Arjuna, Oh Arjuna, my wife is pregnant and she is about to deliver a child. So I want to remind you of your promise. Please come and protect my child. My child who is going to be born. So then immediately Arjuna equipped himself with his Gandiva bow and with his arrows and fully put on his armor, coat of mail and all those kind of things. And he went with the Brahmana to his house. And there he invoked this Pashupatastra and with that arrow he covered the entire house from all directions. And then he fixed one more arrow and stood there waiting to see who is going to come into the house and tried to take away this child of the Brahmana. And now the time came for the lady to deliver the child. And the tenth child was born. And this was also a son. And the son was born very healthy, crying and all that. And everybody was so happy. The father also lifted the child. He saw the child. A minute later, suddenly that wall of, that fortress of arrows that Arjuna had built, had made around the house. Suddenly they all disappeared. And along with that the tenth child was born. That child also disappeared. Now the Brahmana came to Arjuna and he told, What a fool I was. I went and believed you. What Krishna and Balaram could not achieve, what you can achieve. I could not, I did not have the brains to think of this, to think this much. Everything is gone. So he became very disheartened.

**Summary:** Arjuna searches for the missing child in various realms, including Yama Loka, Indra Loka, and Brahma Loka, but fails to find him, leading him to accept defeat and prepare to fulfill his promise to enter fire.

But Arjuna was not going to give up. He immediately told the Brahmana, No, no, wait. I am not going to give up so easily. He took up his bow and arrow and using the mystic powers that he had, he travelled to Yama Loka. And he approached Yama Raj and demanded, I want the son of the Brahmana who has been, who has just now disappeared. I want him back. Yama Raj informed him, You know, I am not aware of this. Although I am the lord of death, I keep track of everybody who is dying. But I don't have any record of this individual you are telling. This person has not been brought here. So Arjuna was astonished. He thought, okay, he is not in Yama Loka. Let me go to Indra Loka and try. He went to Indra Loka. He searched there. He could not find him. So he thought maybe some Asura has taken him away. And he went to the Patala Loka, Rasa Tala, Tala Tala. All those places he went. Even there he could not find. So then he thought, let me try on the higher planets. He went all the way up to Brahma Loka, which is the topmost planet in this universe. Even there he could not find. So practically from Brahma Loka down to Rasa Tala and all those lowermost planets, Arjuna went to every planet and he could not find the son of the Brahmana. Now what to do? Finally Arjuna was, he had to accept defeat. So he came back to Dwaraka and he informed the Brahmana, I am sorry. I have failed.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna immediately came forward and he told, Arjuna, wait, wait, wait, wait. Why are you giving up your body? I am still there. No, don't worry. We will find the sons of the Brahmana."
**Summary:** Krishna intervenes to stop Arjuna from giving up his life and takes him on a transcendental chariot journey beyond the universe, using the Sudarsana Chakra to illuminate the path.

And as per my promise, I am going to enter a fire and I am going to give up my body. Now this whole while Krishna was watching whatever was happening. Because when Arjuna, you know, took that confident step and he said, No, forget Krishna, Balarama and all that. I will come. Like that when he went. Krishna thought, okay, let him try. And Krishna was watching the whole fun. But now when the situation became such that Arjuna is going to die, then Krishna immediately came forward and he told, Arjuna, wait, wait, wait, wait. Why are you giving up your body? I am still there. No, don't worry. We will find the sons of the Brahmana. So like that Krishna called for his transcendental chariot. Krishna's chariot was drawn by four horses. So these four horses, Shaibya, Sugriva, Meghapushpa and Balahaka. One of them was greenish in color. One was grayish. Another was white. And another was like the dark red. Like the dark rain bearing cloud. So these four horses, they are all transcendental horses. Anything associated with Krishna is not of this material world. So Krishna brought forth his chariot and he seated Arjuna. And then Krishna took the chariot. And they went in the chariot. Where did they go? They crossed all the planetary systems. They went even beyond Brahmaloka. And they came to the edge of the universe. And when they came to the edge of the universe, it was completely dark. And so the horses stopped a little bit. They hesitated to go further to cross over the covering of the universe. So then what Krishna did? Krishna sent the Sudarsana Chakra. And the Sudarsana immediately illuminated the whole path. And Sudarsana went ahead. And behind them Krishna's chariot carrying Krishna and Arjuna. So if a horse has to travel in outer space, it is not possible. But these horses were not ordinary horses. They were transcendental horses. So they were not dependent on material conditions that they need oxygen. They cannot survive in vacuum. They cannot survive the radiation in outer space. The Van Allen belt they cannot cross. None of those problems were there. They were completely transcendental. And so they crossed over.

**Key Quote:** "And when you cross the covering of the universe, we have the one huge water body, which is known as the river which separates the material universe from the spiritual universe. This river is called the Viraja river."
**Summary:** Krishna and Arjuna cross the Viraja river, which separates the material and spiritual universes, and arrive at an opulent palace made of precious gems.

And they pierced the covering of the universe and crossed that also. And when you cross the covering of the universe, we have the one huge water body, which is known as the river which separates the material universe from the spiritual universe. This river is called the Viraja river. It is also known as Karana Udaka. It is also known as the causal ocean, because that ocean is the source from where all the universes emanate from Mahavishnu. So it is also called an ocean because even though it is a river, it is so vast it is practically like an ocean. Now Arjuna saw that in the middle of that ocean, there was a wonderful palace, huge palace. And Krishna took his chariot closer towards the palace. And when they came to the palace, Arjuna saw that this palace was not an ordinary one. In this world, we see palaces made of sandstone or they may be made of granite or maximum they may be made of wax. They may be made of valuable marble. But this palace, all its columns, ornate columns, were all made up of valuable diamonds, valuable gems like topaz and all such very very emerald and all those kind of valuable gems it was made up of. You can imagine. They are using for the columns and the walls and the flooring all emerald and topaz and diamonds and all that. What kind of opulence must be there? So Arjuna was completely taken aback. He was really struck by the opulence of this place. And everywhere there were very beautiful servants, male and female servants running here and there, carrying many things, carrying out various tasks. And all of them were decorated with very valuable gold ornaments.

**Summary:** Inside the palace, Arjuna sees Ananta Shesha with Mahavishnu lying on him and Lakshmi Devi at his feet, becoming awestruck and following Krishna's example in offering obeisances.

So it was really opulent. And then Krishna took Arjuna and went, entered inside the palace. And when they entered inside the palace, Arjuna saw suddenly, there was this huge serpent. And this serpent, his whole, his neck was bluish and the rest of his body was white like milk. And on the top of his, he had about a more than a thousand hoods. And on each of the hood, there was a valuable diamond glittering and it was spreading. It was spreading an effulgence all around. And now that snake in its coils, it was standing upright with its hood spread out. And on the coils of that serpent, Arjuna saw Mahavishnu lying down and with Lakshmi Devi at his lotus feet. So the moment Arjuna saw this magnificent, this one, magnificent scene of Ananta Shesha, that serpent was Ananta Shesha and Mahavishnu lying on him, he was completely awestruck. And generally what happens when we approach for the first time some very elevated personality, some very eminent personality, sometimes what happens is, we lose the presence of our mind. We don't know what to do. So Arjuna became like that. He did not know what to do. He was standing awestruck. And he was blinking like this. Now Krishna saw, Arjuna does not know what to do. So Krishna thought, okay, instead of telling him what to do, because in that instance, if you tell somebody something, it will not register in their mind also. So Krishna thought, let me do something by which he will also follow. So immediately Krishna offered his obeisances to Mahavishnu. And Arjuna saw, Krishna is offering obeisances, then Arjuna also offered obeisances.

**Key Quote:** "O Krishna and Arjuna, I only took away all the ten sons of the Brahmana. I took away the sons of the Brahmana. Now why? Because I wanted to see both of you. I wanted to have a darshan of both of you."
**Summary:** Mahavishnu reveals that he took the Brahmana's sons to have darshan of Krishna and Arjuna, acknowledging their incarnations to protect Dharma and destroy demonic principles, and instructs them to return to the spiritual world after completing their mission.

And then Krishna got up. And when Krishna and Arjuna got up, then Mahavishnu started speaking. So Mahavishnu told Krishna and Arjuna, what did he tell? So he said, O Krishna and Arjuna, I only took away all the ten sons of the Brahmana. I took away the sons of the Brahmana. Now why? Because I wanted to see both of you. I wanted to have a darshan of both of you. And who are you two? So you both in Kali Yuga, you have taken incarnation along with all your plenary portions. You have taken incarnation along with all your plenary portions. Why you have taken incarnation? To protect the principles of Dharma. And not only that, not only protection of the principles of Dharma, Bharasuran, you are also going to destroy all the asuras, the demoniac principles, the atheistic principles. So all the people who do not surrender to Vishnu, you have descended to vanquish them, to annihilate them. So and then Lord Vishnu said, So please finish your business and very quickly go back to the spiritual world.

### Krishna, superiority, Mahavishnu, desire, permission

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So actually Srila Prabhupada explains that this shows that Krishna is superior even to Maha Vishnu. So much so that without Krishna's desire, even Maha Vishnu could not have darshan of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that this story illustrates Krishna's superiority to Mahavishnu, as Mahavishnu had to orchestrate the situation to have Krishna's darshan, implying that even Vishnu needs Krishna's permission.

So this incident is very illustrative. So now if Vishnu wanted to see Krishna and Arjuna, he could have simply gone to, he went to Dwaraka all the way to take away the ten sons of the Brahmana. So he could have just gone to the assembly and seen Krishna, no? Why he had to take away the sons of the Brahmana and force Krishna and Arjuna to come and meet him in the Viraja river? Why did he have to do that? So actually Srila Prabhupada explains that this shows that Krishna is superior even to Maha Vishnu. So much so that without Krishna's desire, even Maha Vishnu could not have darshan of Krishna. You were your Dhritarakshana. Maha Vishnu was desirous of having darshan of Krishna but he did not have Krishna's permission. So what to do now? He, you know, when in Hindi there is a saying, When you are not able to take ghee with your straight finger, then you have to twist your finger and take out. Meaning, when a straightforward way fails to achieve some objective, then you have to think of some convoluted plan. So when in a straightforward way, when Lord Vishnu could not have darshan of Krishna, so he thought, let me do something by which Krishna will be forced to come to me. And so he took away the sons of the Brahmana. And then, even then Krishna did not grant his audience to Maha Vishnu. Finally, when Arjuna's life came into question, then Krishna said, okay, I will go and give darshan to Vishnu. That is how Krishna directly, he took Arjuna to Maha Vishnu.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So the reason for that is number one, because Arjuna did not know what to do. He was standing dumbstruck. So Krishna set an example for him."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why Krishna offered obeisances to Mahavishnu, stating that it was to set an example for Arjuna and because Krishna and Mahavishnu are not ultimately different, with Krishna being the source of all Vishnu incarnations.

So then the question arises, if Krishna is superior to Maha Vishnu, then why did Krishna offer his obeisances to Maha Vishnu? So the reason for that is number one, because Arjuna did not know what to do. He was standing dumbstruck. So Krishna set an example for him. Just like sometimes children, when they are studying ABCD in the classroom, the children don't know how to write ABCD. They are just learning. So the teacher takes a chalk, and she turns the chalk and writes A like this. That does not mean teacher is learning how to write ABCD. No, teacher knows much more than ABCD. She knows words, she knows sentences, she knows grammar. So many things the teacher knows. But for teaching, the teacher may take the role of a student. Similarly, Krishna wanted to demonstrate to Arjuna what he has to do. And so he personally did it. And so like this, Krishna, and not only that, Krishna and Maha Vishnu in one sense are not different. So Krishna offers his obeisances to Maha Vishnu also. So it is Krishna offering obeisances to himself. So that way also if you see, it is not incongruous. So even the shastras also mention that the Vishnu's incarnations, they are all incarnations, and Krishna is the source of all those incarnations. You have, this is explained in the in the Vishnu Purana, as well as in the Srimad Bhagavatam, even in the Bhagavad Gita, everywhere this is clearly described that Vishnu is an incarnation of Lord Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "So Maha Vishnu, when having got pleased with having darshan of Lord Krishna, he returned the ten sons of the Brahmanas."
**Summary:** Mahavishnu, pleased with having darshan of Krishna, returns the Brahmana's sons, and Krishna and Arjuna return them to their father, concluding the story and setting up the next episode by questioning how Arjuna fought with Lord Shiva.

And so like this, the Maha Vishnu was very satisfied to have darshan of Lord Krishna because to have darshan of Lord Krishna is so rare. Even Vishnu doesn't get that opportunity very frequently. So Maha Vishnu, when having got pleased with having darshan of Lord Krishna, he returned the ten sons of the Brahmanas. Now the first son was already grown up to ten years. The next was nine years like that. Some of them were grown up and the most recent was still a baby. So carrying all of them, Krishna and Arjuna came back and handed over all the sons back to the Brahmana. And so this was how the incident was, this incident took place in Varaka and Krishna showed his supreme position to even Arjuna. And so Arjuna understood that, understood the glories of Krishna like this. And so now it is interesting to note that how Arjuna informed the Brahmana that he had fought with even Lord Shiva and he had won the Pashupatastra from him. So how did this happen? Please join us in our next episode to learn about this. Thank you for joining us today. Hare Krishna Jagat Guru Shri Ila Prabhupada Ki Jai Netai Gor Premanande

How the holy name has been, you know, Nama Avatara is guiding, doing so many wonderful things. Just like always, I cannot forget that it is Nama Prabhu's Leela, this Hare Krishna temple came up. It was His Leela. Materially incalculable that we could have ever done all these things. We were all young, hardly 35 years old when we started this construction. I was the oldest. What experience we had? We had no experience at all in the material world. Straight out of the college, we walked into the temple. We have no idea of what is fundraising, nothing. It's all miraculously the holy name manifested and here, an unbelievable iconic temple stood up in the matter of just nine years. This is Nama Prabhu's Leela.

Because I used to make everybody chant 16 rounds, including I used to sit in that shed, temporary temple on the Hare Krishna hill. Before 10 o'clock, before Prasadam, you have to finish your rounds. They all finished their rounds. It is the Japa Yajna that built this temple. Build this temple means what? We are not talking about structure. We are talking about a center for spreading Krishna consciousness, which is attracting today, you know, 10, 10, 15, 20,000 people, you know, weekends. Every day, 7, 8,000 people. So it is not a small thing. It's a center for spreading Krishna consciousness, center for spreading Prasadam distribution, holy name.

**Summary:** The speaker recounts the story of creating 108 steps for chanting and how, despite initial doubts, it became a successful Harinam distribution initiative.

Nama Prabhu's another Leela. I had made those steps in front of those who have come to Hare Krishna hill in front of Narasimha temple. I had made 108 steps where people have to go through those 108 steps, stand on each step and Prabhupada's Hare Krishna chanting will be loudly played and they should chant. They follow Prabhupada's chanting. That's not the Japa one. Little slower chanting is there in Prabhupada's. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare. That speed only chanting is there. The new people, they come, they hear Prabhupada chant 108 times and they come inside. So when I just made those steps, those stones, those steps, then somehow or the other I told some devotees, why don't you let us start that? Nobody was inclined to start that. Nobody said, no, nobody will go, Prabhu. Nobody will go through that. Everybody wants to have quick darshan. Nobody will go, nobody will go. So I was very depressed. I said, how can we, you know, so much nice, nice granite steps was made, enclosure was made and it's a failure, not happening. Then somehow or the other, this is our mental blocks we have. Then I said, just, just, just do it. Just do it. And today you see, every day out of 8000 people, at least 2000 people are chanting one round Hare Krishna Mahamantra and walking into Narasimha temple. Big Harinam distribution in this area.

**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Maharaj explains that the root of suffering is forgetfulness of Krishna and identifying with the material body, which is a form of punishment, while true happiness lies in loving God.

You mentioned about punishment and pleasure. In our normal understanding, punishment is involved with some pain. How do we recognize the pain involved in this punishment? Good question. The living entity in this material world, the soul of the living entity, actually is in pain. He's suffering. He's thinking that he's not suffering, but actually he's suffering, so it is a punishment. What is that? Forgetfulness of Krishna. He thinks he's a body. If I think I am the body, it's a punishment. This body is limited in so many ways: birth, death, old age, disease. Isn't it the punishment to misidentify yourself? You're divine. The soul is divine, beautiful ego, servant of Krishna, capable of loving Krishna. So is this not a punishment, forgetfulness of? Yes, so this is a punishment. Pleasure to keep you okay, keep you going here, little little pleasure, sense pleasures. This is not what your entitlement. You're a miser. You know what you're entitled to? Your soul, soul is entitled for the happiness of love of God, and you're missing that.

**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the two key elements of effective chanting: undiluted attention and undiluted intention, focusing on associating with the Lord.

With two things in mind. One is, I should give uninterrupted attention. That means attention should not go anywhere. Attention should not get diluted. Undiluted attention. That means attention is uninterrupted. His chant starts from bead one, starts from bead two, starts from bead three, starts from bead four, starts from bead five, starts from bead six, starts from bead seven, goes on, without breaking attention. And attention breakers are, what is the famous attention breaker? Thinking. Thinking is attention breaker. So without thinking, if you can hear Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, that alone is not enough. You should have undiluted intention. Why you should have undiluted intention? Why are you chanting? Forgetting mystic power? Or forgetting association of the Lord as well as mystic power? Then dilution will happen. Undiluted in intention. What is undiluted in intention? What is your intention? Association of the Nama who has

You have an intention. What is that intention? Something for you. You have an intention, isn't it? Similarly, tendency of the mind is to actually when you are chanting Hare Krishna, something I have to get. Instead, we should simply think, I just want to associate with this Sachidananda Vigraha who is, Shabdavigraha who is before me. Just want to associate. So that consciousness, undiluted attention and undiluted intention. Undiluted attention is a negative thing. We are saying it should not be diluted, but where should the attention be?

**Summary:** This section emphasizes the importance of practicing undiluted attention and intention in chanting, highlighting it as a foundation for soulful japa and comparing it to Dhruva Maharaj's gradual process.

Nama. The intention to associate and please the Lord. That should be the intention of the Nama, the positive intention. It should not be undiluted by, it should not be diluted by intention for this one, that one, so many other things. It should not be diluted. So if we can chant, this is what we should practice. This is soulful japa. This is the foundation of soulful japa. Then bhavanas are there. That is a different thing. Bhavanas have to naturally come. Or bhavanas have, bhavana should not, our feelings or bhavana in the background, it should only be in the background. Foreground should be completely absorbed in chanting uninterruptedly with undiluted intention for the association of the Lord. So we also have got a big deal. Dhruva Maharaj is taking a lot of tapasya. It didn't happen overnight. Not that he decided and said, I am going to do this. Suddenly he went into this state. No! Six months standing, then he attained that perfection. Similarly, simply today, if you decide, I want to do uninterrupted, undiluted japa. It's not an instant decision. Okay, today's round, undiluted. You should do everyday's japa, you should try to do uninterrupted and undiluted intention. We should do, but you should know it is a process.

**Summary:** The lecture concludes by explaining that associating with the Lord gives a higher taste, diminishing lower desires, and that this process, aided by the mercy of the guru and Krishna, purifies consciousness.

I'll go on like this. More and more we associate with the Lord, the Lord gives us the attraction for uninterrupted. Lord gives us the higher taste by which all the lower taste intentions are, all lower taste different intentions, so you lose all your lower taste by the association of the Lord. So it's a process, continuous process and this is what the tapasya that the devotee has to do. Earlier also one paragraph talked about how the bhakti yogi, a small boy, could achieve this because he was meditating and the Lord helped him. He is not like an impersonalist meditation. He got a guru. Dhruva Maharaj got a guru. Naradarshi gave him the mantra and all those things. So there is a guru and Krishna's help is there. Therefore he became, very quickly attained this tapasya. Similarly, we also have Prabhupada's mercy and Namaprabhu's mercy. By their mercy, this tapasya of uninterrupted giving uninterrupted attention to the Lord with undiluted attention, our intention, our japa will keep progressing and progressing and progressing with the help of Namaprabhu and Srila Prabhupada, guru and Krishna's mercy. So our consciousness becomes, our chitta becomes completely pure, that contaminated consciousness becomes.

**Summary:** The Lord is the only shelter, and seeking protection elsewhere is foolish, like holding a dog's tail to cross the ocean.

om namo bhagavate vasudevaya reading from Srimad Bhagavatam canto 6 chapter 9, the appearance of demon Vritrasura, text number 22: avismitam tam paripurnakamam sve nai valabhena samam prashantam translation and purport by his divine grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada translation: Free from all materialism, translation of the existence of existence and never one destructs by anything, the Lord is always jubilant and fully satisfied by his own spiritual perfection. He has no material designations and therefore he is steady and unattached. That Supreme Personality of Godhead is the only shelter of everyone. Anyone desiring to be protected by others is certainly a great fool who desires to cross the sea by holding the tail of a dog. A dog can swim in the water, but if a dog dives in the ocean and someone wants to cross the ocean by holding the dog's tail, he is certainly fool number one. A dog cannot cross the ocean nor can a person cross the ocean by catching a dog's tail. Similarly, one who desires to cross the ocean of nisscience should not seek the shelter of any demigod or anyone else,

but the fearless shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Srimad Bhagavatam 10th canto, 14th chapter, 58th verse therefore says, "The Lord's lotus feet are an indestructible boat." Anyone takes shelter of that boat, he can easily cross the ocean of nisscience. Consequently, there are no dangers for a devotee although he lives within this material world which is full of dangers at every step. One should seek the shelter of the all-powerful in the Lord, instead of trying to be protected by one's own concocted ideas. Thus ends the bhaktivinanda purport.

**Key Quote:** "Among the topmost sinful action is killing a Brahmana."
**Summary:** The story of Indra offending his spiritual master, taking Vishwaroopa as a priest, Vishwaroopa secretly offering oblations to demons, and Indra killing him, incurring the sin of Brahma Hatya.

This material world is a very strange place. Some really funny things happen just like it is described in this chapter. What happened? Indra offended his spiritual master Brahaspati. So Brahaspati silently walked out, walked away and Indra is without his guru. So then he searched for his guru. He could not find him. Then he went to Brahma and said what do I do now? Brahma said you foolish fellow, why did you offend your spiritual master? Anyway, now take another Brahmana, Vishwaroopa, for performing your sacrifices. The demigods constantly have to keep performing sacrifices. Otherwise, they can lose their position. They have to maintain their position by doing their duty of offering sacrifices constantly to the Supreme Lord. So Indra requested Vishwaroopa, another Brahmana, to help him perform his sacrifices. And Vishwaroopa was doing the duty very nicely. But, Vishwaroopa happened to be related to the demigods from his father's side and to the demons from his mother's side. And therefore, he had some affection for both the demigods and the demons. So while performing sacrifice on behalf of Indra, Vishwaroopa, he would offer ablations, idam indraya svaha, idam agnaya svaha. Loudly he would chant the mantras, offering ablations to the devatas, giving them their share. But secretly, he would offer ablations to the demons also, because he had some affection for the demons. One day Indra came to know about it and suddenly, Indra became very very angry. He is appointed by me, by the devatas, and he is secretly offering ablations to the demons, our enemies. So being afraid that the demons may anytime overpower the devatas and even lose their position, Indra in a fit of anger, he cut off Vishwaroopa's head. He killed him. Instantly killed him. And then, the sinful reaction of killing a Brahmana, Brahma Hatya, of all the kinds of sinful activities anybody can commit, among the topmost sinful action is killing a Brahmana, Brahma Hatya. So this Brahma Hatya reaction, even though Indra could have counteracted,

**Key Quote:** "Some mistake in the chanting, the meaning can be completely opposite."
**Summary:** Vishwaroopa's father, Tvashta, performs a sacrifice to create someone to kill Indra, but a mistake in chanting the mantra empowers Indra instead, leading to the birth of the demon Vritrasura.

he decided he is going to accept the reaction. So he did severe tapasya to actually become free from that reaction. And meantime, this Vishwaroopa's father, Tvashta, he became very angry against Indra. My son was doing some service and some misunderstanding and this Indra has killed my son. So he performed another sacrifice in order to create some being who will be able, competent to kill Indra, because Indra is no ordinary person. It's not easy to kill Indra like that. So he performed one sacrifice. And in that sacrifice, he was chanting mantras intended to generate a person powerful enough to kill Indra. So Indra Shatro Viverdhasva, O enemy of Indra, may you become powerful enough to be able to kill Indra. But in chanting the mantra, he made a mistake and the mantra's meaning became enemy of Indra. No. Do that. Indra who is an enemy. Instead of enemy of Indra, it became Indra who is an enemy. This is Sanskrit language. It's very very, you know, precisely it has to be chanted. Some mistake in the chanting, the meaning can be completely opposite. And enemy of Indra changed to Indra who is an enemy. May he become powerful. So all the mantras he was offering, so instead of empowering the creature who is going to be born powerful enough to kill Indra, he was empowering Indra whom he intended to kill. So this, this sacrifice, from this sacrifice was born one demon, Vritrasura. And this Vritrasura was such a fearful demon, and everybody was afraid of this demon. And Indra decided that this demon has to be killed immediately. Otherwise he will do so much of harm. But Indra's weapons were totally useless. They were not adequate for killing this Vritrasura. And then all the demigods sought shelter of Vishnu, and they offered nice prayers. So one of the prayers is here in this 22nd verse.

**Key Quote:** "Free from all material conceptions of existence."
**Summary:** The demigods glorify the Lord as free from material conceptions, contrasting Vaishnava and Mayavadi interpretations of scriptures regarding the Lord's qualities.

So what is the prayer the demigods are offering? Free from all material conceptions of existence. They are glorifying the Lord. What is the Lord's position? That the Lord is free from all material conceptions of existence. That the Lord is free from all material concepts. Paripurnakaamam avismitam tam paripurnakaamam svenaivalaabhena samamprasantam. So, even though in the Upanishads, many places, the Lord is described also as a person, and the living entity is also a person. Both are spirit. But still, there are so many differences between the Supreme Lord and the living entity under all circumstances in all conditions. So the differences are also pointed out in the scriptures, in the original Vedas, in the Upanishads but the Mayavadis interpret those portions conveniently to support their Mayavada theory or philosophy. But the Vaishnavas, they don't interpret. So they take it as it is and consequently the Vaishnava's understanding is the living entity has got similar qualities as that of the Lord but still there are differences, similarities and differences and that's how Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has presented the Achintya Bheda Abheda Tattva, the philosophy of oneness and difference between the Lord and his energies or between the Lord and the living entities, like that.

**Key Quote:** "Material existence begins when the living entity is bewildered by the contact with material energy, by being placed in the material energy."
**Summary:** Material existence causes bewilderment and illusion, leading to a distorted perception of reality, unlike the unbewildered state of the Lord and the pure spirit soul in spiritual existence.

So here clearly the demigods are helping us understand the position of the Lord as Avismitam. He's always. He's never wonderstruck by anything because on the other hand we are subject to becoming bewildered. Material existence begins when the living entity is bewildered by the contact with material energy, by being placed in the material energy. So, due to our material conception, we are always in a bewildered state of existence in this material world. That's why if we practice spiritual life, we become free from this bewilderment gradually. We become sober. Otherwise, in a bewildered state of existence, we are unable to understand what is what in truth, in reality. Just like under the influence of illusion, being bewildered by this illusory energy, influence of illusory energy, we are considering matter to be spirit and spirit to be matter. Just the opposite. So that is the influence of illusion and that is the bewilderment caused by our coming in contact with this illusory energy. Otherwise in our original position as pure spirit soul, in spiritual existence, we are always able to be in an unbewildered state, in a sober state, like the Lord. But the Lord is always unbewildered, always, Avismitam. And our condition is, as long as we are in spiritual existence, we are also avismitam. But when we come in contact with this material world, or material nature, we are placed in material existence. Why? of our desire to enjoy independently. Krishna bhulia ji bhoga vanchakari. So this bhoga vancha, desire for independent enjoyment is the cause of our being put into this material existence and the immediate effect is vismitam. We become bewildered.

**Key Quote:** "He is spiritually perfect and he is fully satisfied within himself."
**Summary:** The Lord is always fully satisfied, while living entities in material existence constantly seek satisfaction and happiness, which can only be found through devotional service.

And Lord is paripurna kama. He is always fully satisfied by his own spiritual perfection. He is spiritually perfect and he is fully satisfied within himself. So he doesn't seek satisfaction at any time, in any condition. And our condition at least in material existence is that we are always seeking two things. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna describes his pure devotees, tushyanti ca ramanthi ca. Fully satisfied and fully joyful, blissful, happy. Because material existence characteristic is we are not satisfied and we are not happy. So Lord is fully satisfied and fully joyful. And our position in spiritual existence in our original constitutional position in relationship with the Lord as His eternal servant, is that we are also satisfied and happy completely, like the Lord. Paripurna kama. He is paripurna kama. That is completely, perfectly, always satisfied and happy, but we can be purna kama, we can be fully satisfied and fully happy in our position. But if we are forgetful of the Lord or we are desiring independent enjoyment, we are placed in the material world, then we are always seeking that satisfaction and happiness which we lose when we come to material existence. Therefore Krishna says you take to devotional service and engaged in devotional service even in the material world, you become unbewildered. And you will be fully satisfied and happy in devotional service.

**Key Quote:** "In devotional service one becomes completely happy and satisfied."
**Summary:** Devotional service leads to complete happiness and satisfaction, as the Lord is fully satisfied with his own spiritual perfection, while conditioned souls are subject to external influences.

macchitta madgata prana bodhayanta parasparam katayantasya mam nityam tuśyanti ca ramanthi ca. Śrīla Prabhupāda says in one discourse explaining this verse, he says everyone is seeking some satisfaction, some happiness in all their endeavors. But they can never find the happiness they are seeking or the satisfaction they are seeking in material activities. They take to devotional service. And in devotional service one becomes completely happy and satisfied. So that is the Lord's position, Paripurna kāma. Sveṇai valābhena. He is, sveṇai valābhena. He is fully satisfied with his own spiritual perfection. Sveṇai valābhena. His own spiritual perfection. Samam praśāntam. He is always very steady and equipoised. Whereas as tiny spirit soul we are subject to influence. That's our position. We cannot be unaffected by the external atmosphere. See if you are in the spiritual realm, you are not affected by the external atmosphere. So when you are in the spiritual atmosphere, then that atmosphere's influence is conducive for our well-being, for our happiness, for our satisfaction, for our fearlessness, for our being sobered etc., and when we are placed in the material existence, in the material atmosphere, the three gunas actually act on us and first thing that happens is we become bewildered, become unwholesome, become bewildered, we are not equipoised, we are always affected in different ways by

**Summary:** Material existence is characterized by the influence of the three gunas, while devotional service elevates one to the spiritual platform, where pure devotees remain unaffected by material conditions.

the three gunas and it's always a combination of the gunas that's acting. So sometimes in sattva guna, sometimes in raja guna, sometimes in tamo guna, different kinds of influence and bewilderment, confusion. So material existence is always, there is no prashantam, there is no steadiness, always ups and downs are there in material existence. So when we take to devotionalist service, we are immediately uplifted above the gunas, we come to the spiritual platform. And on the spiritual platform we become steady in our spiritual position. So the lord is always on the spiritual platform, he never descends to the material platform even though he comes to the material world. He comes to the material world but he remains on the spiritual plane in spiritual existence eternally. Devotees like pure devotees even if they come to this material world since they are always Krishna conscious, they are always in contact with Krishna, they are also always on the spiritual platform. Therefore, such pure devotees, whatever they speak, whatever they do, all their actions, all their words, all their thoughts, everything is 100% spiritual. They are always perfect in their behavior, in their character, they are unaffected by any materialistic activity, any material condition, any situation.

### shelter, Supreme Personality of Godhead, surrendered souls

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Supreme Personality of God is the only shelter of everyone."
**Summary:** The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the only shelter for everyone, as described by Sridhar Swami, with Krishna being the ultimate source and shelter of all surrendered souls.

Then after describing these wonderful qualities of the Lord, the demigods are telling that Supreme Personality of God is the only shelter of everyone. Okay? He is the only shelter for everyone. So Prabhupada explains in one place, he is quoting Sridhar Swami, the original commentator of the Bhagavatam. Sridhar Swami, before he begins writing the commentary on the 10th canto of the Bhagavatam, he says about the 10th canto itself that, the 10th canto of Srimad Bhagavatam reveals the 10th object, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the shelter of all surrendered souls. There are 10 subjects in the Srimad Bhagavatam. The 10th subject is Krishna himself, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And he is described as the shelter of all surrendered souls. He is known as Sri Krishna and he is the ultimate source of all the universes. Let me offer my obeisances unto him. So Prabhupada says, this is a quotation from the Bhavarth Deepika, Sridhar Swami's commentary on Srimad Bhagavatam. In the 10th canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, there is a description of Ashraya Tattva, Sri Krishna and Ashrita Tattva. There are two Tattvas, Ashraya Tattva and Ashrita Tattva. So Ashraya Tattva is the objective, and Ashrita Tattva is the subjective. Since the lotus feet of Sri Krishna are the shelter of all devotees, Sri Krishna is also called Paramdhama. Bhagavad Gita, Arjuna addressing Krishna says, Parambrahma Paramdhama. Paramdhama means Krishna's lotus feet is the shelter of everyone. Krishna is the shelter of everyone, supreme shelter. Everything is resting under the lotus feet of Krishna and that is described in the words that Prabhupada quotes here, how Krishna is the shelter of everyone from the Bhagavatam. Samāśrīta ye padapallavaplavaṁ mahāt-padaṁ puṇya-yeśoa marāya dtih. Lord Krishna is the shelter of everyone and the whole material existence, the bliss of all is the shelter of everyone.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is called Ashraya Tattva. Means He is the only one who can give protection, who can give shelter. Nobody else can give shelter to anybody else."
**Summary:** Everything rests under Krishna's lotus feet, making Him the only true shelter (Ashraya Tattva), while seeking protection from demigods is foolish.

is resting under the lotus feet of Krishna, whole material existence. So here it is said, under the lotus feet of Shree Krishna, the entire Mahat Tattva is existing. Mahat Tattva is existing under the lotus feet of Krishna. And that Mahat Tattva is the starting point for this creation. From Mahat Tattva the elements get differentiated and the elements are later on combined to form this whole material world. So since everything is under Krishna's protection, Krishna is called Ashraya Tattva. Means He is the only one who can give protection, who can give shelter. Nobody else can give shelter to anybody else. Nobody else can do that. Because we are all sheltered. We belong to a different category, Ashrita Tattva, we are sheltered and Krishna is the shelter. So if somebody thinks that they can take shelter of some devatas because they are also relatively more powerful than us or they have misconception that among the devatas, different devatas have different degrees of power or different kinds of powers so they approach different demigods for different benefits or different kinds of relief. So sometimes people worship devatas seeking their protection but the example given here is anyone desiring to be protected by others especially demigods is certainly a great fool. He is described as Balishaha is a fool, one who seeks a shelter or protection by taking protection, by taking shelter of someone else especially demigods because it's like trying to cross the sea by holding the tail of a dog.

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "One should seek shelter only of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** Seeking shelter from demigods is like trying to cross the ocean by holding a dog's tail, only the Supreme Lord can save us from all dangers.

Now why this analogy is given is Prabhupada explains that dog can swim in the water, dogs don't have to learn swimming. They naturally swim when you put them in water. Even if they have never gone into water, you just throw a dog into the water, it can swim. But even if the dog can swim, it can never, if it's thrown into the middle of an ocean, it cannot swim across an ocean. That is not possible. Neither if a dog can swim, can somebody hold the tail of the dog and expect that because the dog can swim across a small, even a small, what do you say, a small body of water. But somebody thinks that, oh, it can swim, it can save me. No. By holding the tail of a dog to cross some body of water, speak of crossing the ocean. It's not possible. It's not possible for anybody to cross the ocean like that. So taking shelter or protection of the demigods is like that. So one should seek shelter only of the Supreme Lord. And only the Supreme Lord can actually save us from all dangers in life. Only the Supreme Lord can actually save us from all dangers in life. We shouldn't take shelter from this material existence. So this is one of Brahma's prayer that petite samashrita ye pada pallava plavam he compares the Lord's lotus feet. Udadi 제일 naa Habit Becky He compares the Lord's lotus feet to an indestructible boat.

**Key Quote:** "If we are drowning in the middle of an ocean, then by ourselves we cannot cross the ocean, neither by help of anybody else other than the Supreme Lord can we cross the ocean."
**Summary:** Taking shelter of the Lord's lotus feet is like boarding an indestructible boat that shrinks the ocean of material existence, allowing devotees to easily cross over to the spiritual world.

If we are drowning in the middle of an ocean, then by ourselves we cannot cross the ocean, neither by help of anybody else other than the Supreme Lord can we cross the ocean. So we take shelter of the Lord's lotus feet, which are like an indestructible boat. And what happens if you take shelter of the Lord's lotus feet, which is like an indestructible boat? That Bhavambuddhir Vatsapadam, this ocean of material existence shrinks and becomes like the quantity of water contained in the footprint of a calf. Vatsa means calf. The whole material existence which is like an unlimited ocean, it shrinks to become the water contained in the footprint of a calf. And consequently, devotees, when they take shelter of the Lord's lotus feet to the Lord, they are able to cross over this ocean of material existence. They don't have to wait for the boat to take them across the ocean, they simply step across, that small quantity of water. And they step across the ocean of material existence, which has become shrunk into the water contained in the footprint of a calf. And they go to the other side. On one side, this material world or material existence is separated from the surface of the ocean. This material world or material existence is separated from the surface of the ocean. It is separated from the spiritual world by a body of water, by a river called Viraja. So that Viraja river, one side is this material world, other side is the spiritual world. So when the devotees cross over across this ocean of material existence, they go to the other side of the Viraja river. They enter the spiritual world.

**Summary:** The material world is characterized by constant danger and suffering caused by the three modes of nature, symbolized by Durga Devi's trident.

So, crossing over, parampadam, they attain the spiritual kingdom of the Supreme Lord, Parampadam. And Brahma is telling, the devotees are not meant to live in the material world, which is characterized by padampadam yad vipadam. There is danger in every step. Padampadam yad vipadam. Our material existence under the influence of illusion, we think, yes, material world there are dangers, we know that. And we think sometimes there are dangers. At other times, there are moments or there are times when we are safe. There are times when we are not able to move. There are times when we go to the other side. There are times when there is danger and we make plans to counteract those dangers by our own methods in ignorance under the influence of illusion. But actually the scriptures and the acharyas they warn us material world is not such a place that there are dangers sometimes. This material world is conducted by the three modes and these three modes the sattva guna, rajya guna, tamo guna are constantly harassing the living entities who are in this material world. And symbolically Durga Devi she has got ten hands and she is holding in one of the hands the trishul, trident. That trident represents these three gunas by which we are bound up to this material world. And these three gunas are like the three prongs of the trident with which sometimes there is a picture shown of Durga Devi killing one demon with her trident. Right? So, the demon is being pierced by the three prongs of the trident. Actually that's not just the demon along who is in that condition, but every living entity, every conditioned soul is being affected with afflicted with three-fold miseries, Tapatraya. The three prongs of the trident held by Durga Devi represents the three kinds of kleshas which are constantly bothering us, Adibhautika, Adhyatmika, Adidaivika.

**Summary:** Living entities in the material world are constantly suffering from miseries, but under the influence of illusion, they sometimes mistake misery for enjoyment.

Constantly there are miseries and the foolishness of the living entity is under the influence of illusion sometimes the living entity thinks some misery to be actually enjoyment. There is always misery. There is always miseries and we are always suffering from these miseries but under illusion one may think some misery to be actually enjoyment. The shastras give one example. Just like even if a small thorn pricks your foot when you are walking barefoot, let us say, a thorn pricks your foot, immediately you feel some pain and then you want to walk barefoot. You want to remove that thorn. Right? It will get rid of the pain. Okay. Now this is something which is very common reaction. Being, you know, pierced by some needle or thorn or something like that. But what about people, in order to decorate themselves, let us say with an earring, they will voluntarily go and get their ear pierced. Voluntarily go and get their ears pierced. And when that piercing is happening, oh, very nice. Actually it is paining. Even though you may not have experience, everybody may not have experience of getting pierced by a thorn, but at least sometime when you have taken an injection, when they prick that syringe into your arm, at that time, momentarily you feel the pain. Correct? So like that, even though this is painful, but this is considered painful, or the pricking of a thorn is considered painful, this is considered very nice, very pleasing. So this is foolishness actually.

**Key Quote:** "Death itself is hanging like a sword on our neck."
**Summary:** The fear of death is always present, and relief from misery is often misinterpreted as happiness, while the factual position in material existence is constant unhappiness and distress.

This is foolishness. This is the influence of illusion. Even though we are constantly suffering from miseries, and even dangers, we think sometimes there is some danger to your life. But actually, the scriptures describe, death itself is hanging like a sword on our neck. Any moment death can come, and we have to die. Hmm? And that fear of death is always there. But sometimes when there is some relief from some misery, that is wrongly interpreted as happiness. Relief from misery is interpreted as happiness. Because when there is some miserable condition, we try to counteract that misery, and that counteracting effort may give us some relief. And that relief is thought of as something very nice, very enjoyable. Just like you have stomach pain, and then you seek relief from it. And when there is, let's say some indigestion, and that indigestion is cured by some simple digestive pill. So then, you get some relief, you feel very nice. Oh, I got relief from that pain, just bothering me. But how long can you rejoice that freedom from pain, that relief? For a little time. Afterwards, again you are back to the business of seeking happiness. Because your actual position in material existence is to be always in a miserable condition, to be always unhappy, to be always distressed. That is our factual position in the material world. But under the influence of illusion and due to the influence of the gunas, effect of the gunas, we think sometimes we are happy, sometimes we are unhappy, and sometimes there is a neutral state where we are not exactly unhappy, but we are seeking happiness. So therefore, in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains that three conditions of material existence, there is happiness, there is distress, and there is mixed happiness and distress. You see, these are the three factual conditions. And that happiness is illusory happiness. It is not real happiness. Illusory happiness. And that mixed happiness and distress is, even that illusory happiness is not exclusively that happiness, material happiness. There is no exclusive material happiness. It is always mixed happiness and distress.

**Key Quote:** "It is only the spiritual world which is suitable for us."
**Summary:** The material world is not the right atmosphere for the spirit soul, and only devotional service can transfer us to our original position of eternal happiness in the spiritual world.

So, in that way, this material world is described here as every step there is danger. We are always in a miserable condition. Because we make an adjustment. Being spirit soul, we are meant to be in the spiritual atmosphere where naturally we are always happy. We are always leading an eternal life full of bliss and knowledge. But material existence, actually it is not the right atmosphere for the spirit soul, this material atmosphere. So we are always uncomfortable, just like a fish out of water. And always we are seeking to get rid of this discomfort by changing our position. But this constant changing of position, as long as we are in material world, no other place in the material world is actually a suitable place for us. It is only the spiritual world which is suitable for us. So that we learn from the authoritative or confidential scriptures. We belong to the spiritual world and that is the only place where we can be properly situated eternally in happiness, complete satisfaction. So therefore, to transfer ourselves to our original position, get out of this material existence, is only possible by devotional service. And by devotional service it becomes easy and it is very effective, very powerful. And that is the only way to actually get eternal happiness.

So, through these senses and our mind also, if you are able to perceive, we can see forms through these eyes, we can hear sounds through these ears, we can smell different fragrances through the nose, we can perceive subtle things through the mind or even the intelligence we can perceive, but that is not knowledge. That is not knowledge. Merely perceiving a form doesn't mean you know what that is. It's like I am seeing your form, and even if I understand what this form is, but I am thinking I am seeing you, but actually I am not seeing you. I am seeing your external covering. You are within that form called the body. Even if I perceive your mind, still I am not perceiving you. I am perceiving your mind, different from you, different from me. Even if I perceive your intelligence, I am able to, you know, figure out something about your intelligence, oh, you are an intelligent person, you are learned in such and such a subject or whatever, you are a mature adult, but still that is not you. Those are all the characteristics of your subtle body called intelligence, mind, intelligence, ego, body. So the body is different, the body is different, the person is different, but not in the case of Krishna. Krishna has appeared in the specific form, 400 form, Narayana form, but that is not the external form of Krishna. No, Krishna is nothing external and internal. Shukadeva Gosvami describing Mother Yashoda is trying to catch Krishna and Krishna is running away after stealing butter, not stealing, after breaking a butter pot and taking the butter.

So I have to bind him and now I have to punish him some way, so let me just tie him. Let me just tie him, but at least he will stop for the time being, he'll stop his naughty activities. So she decided to tie him to that grinding mortar and then she brought rope and then she's trying to tie him with some rope and the rope is not sufficient. Why? Why is that rope not sufficient? Shukadeva Goswami explains that Krishna, Supreme Lord, has no inside, has no outside, is no inside, no outside. After all, when she's trying to tie him, she is trying to tie him external measurement of his body, right? With the grinding mortar. Grinding mortar also got an external form, certain shape, certain size. Krishna is a small boy, so together she has to bind. So first time she tried binding, the length of the rope was not enough. He bought some more rope. Now she's bringing more and more rope and it is not enough to tie him. Why?

We are होता है विश्व से 3-4 वरी एमनी important रिएडे हो मिलेशक एंड पॉइंट फैन एंड हेलो इस गेर एंड एंड गुड़ी विकल्व अनलिमिटिट लॉड अनलिमिटिट बट इन एन एंड एस let alone the measurement you can't even measure neither you can measure the soul nor you can measure Krishna because there is no physical form. There is nothing there to measure. What will you measure? Where is the form to measure something? So therefore that which is within this material world made of matter that you can measure or you may try to measure it okay you can try to grasp it but Krishna's form is beyond this material world. So therefore to understand Krishna to know Krishna to see Krishna to perceive Krishna is possible only by transcendental knowledge. What is this transcendental knowledge? This is explained by Krishna himself in the Bhagavad Gita.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the four kinds of pious people who surrender to Krishna, emphasizing that the ज्ञानी (one situated in knowledge) is the best because they are constantly devoted to worshipping Krishna.

says four kinds of pious people they surrender to me. Now this word Prabhupada translates, note the translation of Prabhupada, it is called parampara understanding of Bhagavad Gita, what does he translate it as surrender to me? Is it not? What is the word for meaning chaturvida bhajanthema bhajanthi the translation it is surrender the translation it is surrender but in the word for meaning 7.16 okay Prabhupada's in the word for meaning is given rendered service bhaja means devotional service okay in the translation also it's notive satsang surroundosen i am a god and have monde whose and four kinds of people surrender. Of course the sense in which this bhajante is in the sense of the word prapadyate. It's in the sense of surrender. Okay, it comes in the 19th verse, prapadyate. बहुनाम जन्मनामंते ज्ञानमान्माम् प्रपद्यते Anyway, the point I want to make is that in the 19th verse, in this 16th verse, 7th chapter, Krishna says four kinds of people begin to render devotional service to Him. बजन्ते आर्त जिग्ञासु अर्थार्थी ज्ञानी Of these four categories, Krishna says ज्ञानी is the best. Why? Because he says तेशाम ज्ञानी नित्य युक्ता ज्ञानी means one who is situated in knowledge. Knowledge of what? Knowledge of the Supreme Lord. बितितोसि भवान साक्षात पुरुषह प्रकृते परहा This knowledge. Here ज्ञानी refers to one who knows कृष्णा as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "Real bhakti is we worship that transcendent form of God from the beginning and even in the end always we only worship God real God."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts deity worship with the Mayavadi philosophy, explaining that true bhakti involves worshipping the transcendental form of God from the beginning, which can only be perceived through transcendental knowledge.

concoction some imaginary form which is not God. Therefore, when the atheists say that these worshippers of God, especially in the form of deity, are some particular form which they think is material, and even the Mayavadis or the impersonal, they think that this form is material form and it's imaginary form because God is formless, so you cannot worship formless. So therefore, but shastra says one should worship God. So the Mayavadis think, yeah, we have to worship the impersonal Brahman, we have to worship the impersonal Brahman. That's an understanding of the absolute truth. So how do you worship impersonal Brahman? The method of worshiping the impersonal Brahman of the impersonalists is you imagine some form in the beginning, you imagine some form. Later on, when you realize God, then you forget all this imaginary form because that's not God anyway, so you forget that, you stop that. But our process of devotional service, bhakti, is not like that. Real bhakti is we worship that transcendent form of God from the beginning and even in the end, always we only worship God, real God, and that form is prakriti, that form is the form of the transcendental personality who is transcendental to this material creation and that form can be perceived only by...

**Key Quote:** "The science of Krishna Consciousness helps us understand that God has appeared in a form which we can see or perceive sound form or material metal form."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while God cannot be perceived simply through material senses, the science of Krishna Consciousness helps us understand that God appears in forms we can perceive, but these forms are transcendental, not material.

transcendental knowledge, only by transcendental knowledge. So in the beginning, even if we are not able to perceive God because we are not yet conversant with transcendental knowledge, then we are told you just chant Hare Krishna. हरे कृष्ण हरे कृष्ण कृष्ण कृष्ण हरे हरे हरे राम हरे राम राम राम हरे हरे that is the way to perceive God in the beginning. These are the ways, but you also understand that actually God cannot be perceived simply by with these eyes seeing one deity form, you cannot perceive God like that because he is not having any material form. His form is not material, yet the deity is made up of what? Either wood or stone or metal. That is very much material, but the science of Krishna Consciousness helps us understand that God has appeared in a form which we can see or perceive sound form or material metal form or a form of a description in the scriptures. Here description is there. Krishna appeared in this 400 form, the description is there which we can understand, we can, we can get some idea what he looks like or what form he appeared, not in a form, but this is not a material form. This is not a ordinary form, neither the form the deity nor the sound of Hare Krishna nor the form which appeared in front of Vasudeva is a material form. It's a transcendental form. So that transcendental form is perceived only by...

**Key Quote:** "Krishna can be seen or understood or known or worshiped only by bhakti."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing that transcendental knowledge, necessary to perceive Krishna, is realized through devotional service, highlighting Vasudeva's pure devotion and the importance of Sadhana Bhakti in awakening this knowledge.

transcendental knowledge. What is a transcendental knowledge? The knowledge that the Supreme Lord is the Supreme person is completely spiritual personality who is realized only by bhakti. Bhakti abhijanati abhijanati so many verses in the Bhagavad Gita they explain it is explained in the Bhagavat Gita Krishna can be seen or understood or known or worshiped only by bhakti equivocal cells. So this Transcendental knowledge also is realize or understood or obtained by devotional service and Vasudeva is actually a pure devotee. Vasudeva is a pure devotee and therefore Krishna chose to appear as his son for his Leela in this material world. He chose to appear as his son. So he is participating in Krishna Leela and part of that Leela is that Vasudeva is praying to the Lord I want to have a son like you. This is Leela. He is already a devotee. There is no need for him to ask Krishna you appear as my son or I want to have a son like you. There is no need. There is no need for a devotee to even ask because already he is he is always Nityayukta Ekabhaktyar Nityayukta Upasate he is always worshipping the Lord constantly. So therefore it is part of the Leela the birth pastime of Krishna Janma Karma Chame Divyam and as far as we are concerned we can see or we can understand or we can realize or we can perceive Krishna only through Transcendental Knowledge that is the understanding your form can be perceived by Transcendental Knowledge therefore this Transcendental Knowledge is awakened in our heart it is already there but it is awakened by the process of Sadhana Bhakti.
