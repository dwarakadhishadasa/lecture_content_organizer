This is Bhaktivinoda Thakur's Sharanagati, quoted from Adi Purana. It's called, chant anyway. It starts like this: Your mind is wandering all over the universe when you chant. Chant anyway. Your mind is wandering to the past and future when you chant. Chant anyway. You are not able to concentrate on Krishna's names while you chant. Chant anyway. You have no taste for chanting. Chant anyway. You have lusty desires. Chant anyway. You are making offenses in chanting. Chant anyway.

**Key Quote:** "There is no vow like chanting the Holy Name. There's no knowledge superior to it."
**Summary:** This segment explains the unparalleled benefits of chanting the holy name, highlighting its superiority to vows, knowledge, meditation, and penance, and its power to grant liberation and joy.

You are not praying to Krishna to help you chant better. Chant anyway. You often chant late at night. Chant anyway. And why, why should you chant despite all the above obstacles? That is why. What is that? There is no vow like chanting the Holy Name. There's no knowledge superior to it. There is no meditation which comes anywhere near it, and it gives the highest result. No penance is equal to it, and nothing is as potent or powerful as the holy name. Chanting is the greatest act of piety and the supreme refuge. Even the words of Vedas do not possess sufficient power to describe its magnitude. It's continuing. Chanting is the highest path to liberation, peace, and eternal life. It's a pinnacle of devotion, heart's joyous proclivity and attraction. See, it's a heart's joyous proclivity and attraction and the best form of remembrance of the Supreme Lord.

**Summary:** Soulful japa is described as natural to the soul and requiring no special education, the lecture aims to simplify the process by addressing complications and encouraging awareness of one's desires and offering them to Krishna.

As far as soulful japa is concerned, all the atma shaktis that we are talking about, sankalpa vikalpa, preiti, shratha, sharanagati, all these things are natural to the soul. It also does not need any education. So to do soulful japa, you have to be a human being, that's all. You don't need very big education. So much we need to discuss today to do soulful japa, because we have become very complicated. To reduce the complication, we have to tell all these things that might go the way anywhere, at least you catch, know where is your Asha, where is your Ichcha, you identify it's going on, and you have to offer all those things here.

## Can We Serve Krishna in Our Own Way? | HDG Srila Prabhupada | Bg 1.45-46 | 03.08.2024

### Arjuna's dilemma, rules of war, surrender

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Arjuna, having thus spoken on the battlefield, cast aside his bow and arrows and sat down on the chariot, his mind overwhelmed with grief."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada reads and translates verses from the Bhagavad Gita describing Arjuna's reluctance to fight and his internal conflict on the battlefield.

OM NAMO BHAGAVATE VASUDEVAYA. Reading from Srimad Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 1, Entitled, Observing the Army on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, Verse No. 45: YADIMAM APRATITARAM ASASTRAM SASTRA PANAYAH DATARASTRA RANIHANYOS TANME SHEMATARAM BHAVET. Translation and Purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swamishila Prabhupada: I would consider it better for the sons of Dhritarashtra to kill me unarmed and unresisting rather than fight with them. Purport by His Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swamishila Prabhupada: It is a custom according to kṣatriya fighting principles that an unarmed and unwilling foe should not be attacked. Arjuna, however, in such an enigmatic position, decided he would not fight if he were attacked. He did not consider how much the other party was bent upon fighting. All these symptoms are due to soft-heartedness resulting from his being a great devotee of the Lord. Verse No. 46 I will read myself. Sanjaya uvacha evam uttvarjunasankhe rathopastupa visat visrajya sasaramchapam sotra samvitnam anasah. Translation: Sanjaya said, Arjuna, having thus spoken on the battlefield, tossed aside his bow and arrows and sat down on the chariot, his mind overwhelmed with grief. Perfect. While observing the situation of his enemy, Arjuna stood up on the chariot, but he was so afflicted, he pleaded with lamentation that he sat down again, setting aside his bow and arrows. Such a trained and soft-hearted person in the devotional service of the Lord is fit to receive self-knowledge. I would consider it better for the sons of Dhritarashtra to kill me unarmed and unresisting rather than fight with them. Sanjaya said, Arjuna, having thus spoken on the battlefield, cast aside his bow and arrows and sat down on the chariot, his mind overwhelmed with grief.

### rules of war, surrender, Krishna's order
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/h8hMfQp6ZFs?t=192
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "You can violate the laws on the order of Kṛṣṇa."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains the rules of war for Kshatriyas and discusses the concept of surrendering to Krishna's orders, even if they seem to violate mundane rules.

yadimam apratikaram asastram sastra-pāṇaya. It is the custom between the kṣatriyas, that in the fighting, if the other party hasn't got a weapon to fight, this party will supply him a weapon. Note that the other party without a weapon, and this party will take the opportunity to kill him. This is not the rules and regulation of fighting. There are many rules and regulations of the fighting. Not that because he's my enemy, I shall kill him anyway. No. There are rules and regulations. If the enemy has broken his chariot, he's fallen down on the ground, he's been killed. The other party also will immediately get down from the chariot. Suppose he is fleeing, then if one is on foot and another on the chariot, so he will be in a superior position. Therefore the opposite party must also get down from the chariot and walk with him. That means the defeated enemy should be given all opportunities. So he may not think that unnecessarily, in a weak position, he has been killed. No. So Arjuna says… Arjuna, of course, did later on. When he killed Karna, Karna was without a weapon, and he fell down from the chariot. Karna, after falling down from the chariot, and he was trying to raise the wheel of the chariot from the mud. So Kṛṣṇa asked Arjuna that this is the opportunity to kill him. You kill him immediately. So at that time he had no weapons, and he was trying to kill Karna, and he fell down from the chariot. And in that position he was killed by Arjuna, by the order of Kṛṣṇa. This is violating the laws. So you can violate the laws on the order of Kṛṣṇa. You cannot do this. This is surrender. When Kṛṣṇa says that you do this, although it is wrong, you have to surrender. You cannot do that.

### surrender, truthfulness, Krishna's order

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "For this reason, he had to see hell."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada narrates the story of Yudhisthira Maharaja and his hesitation to lie on Krishna's order, highlighting the importance of surrendering to Krishna's will even when it conflicts with mundane morality.

You cannot do it. There is no consideration. Just like in a fight the commander says to the soldiers, do this. His duty is to do that. He should not think at that time what is right or wrong. Just like Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja… He was advised by Kṛṣṇa that Yudhiṣṭhira… Excuse me. Yudhiṣṭhira, Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, you go to Dronācārya and inform him that your son is dead. It was a false information. Because Dronācārya will not die if he is not affected with some lamentation. So Kṛṣṇa asked Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira that you go, because you were recognized truthful, dharma-rāja. So when he will say this is also false, he will believe. But Yudhiṣṭhira hesitated. How can I tell a lie? He disobeyed the order of Kṛṣṇa. And he wanted to become very truthful. For this reason, he had to see hell.

### spiritual platform, Krishna's pleasure, absolute truth
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/h8hMfQp6ZFs?t=482
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Their only consideration is whether Kṛṣṇa is pleased. That's all."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that on the spiritual platform, the only consideration is pleasing Krishna, as He is above mundane duality and His orders are absolute good.

So in the mundane consideration, there are so many things, right and wrong. So long you are on the mundane platform, you have to obey all these right and wrong. But in the spiritual platform, when it is ordered by Kṛṣṇa, He is above all these duality. He is absolute. So even if He says to do something wrong, because He cannot say anything which is wrong, God is all good. If you discriminate God's order from the mundane platform, then you will be misguided. Anyone who has got formed and fixed up faith that whatever God does, whatever God orders, even from mundane calculation it may be wrong, that is right. That is absolute understanding. So those who are... In the spiritual platform, for them, there is no such consideration which is right and which is wrong. Their only consideration is whether Kṛṣṇa is pleased. That's all. If Kṛṣṇa is pleased, by inducing me to do something wrong, I will not hesitate to do it. I shall do it. Because it's Kṛṣṇa.

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "You have to get it confirmed from the transparent medium, spiritual master."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada emphasizes that while on the mundane platform, one must follow rules and regulations and not concoct ideas about pleasing Krishna, but instead seek guidance from a spiritual master.

It's Kṛṣṇa's order. My principle should be, if Kṛṣṇa is satisfied, then everything is all right. But while we are in the mundane platform, we should not concoct the idea that Kṛṣṇa is pleased. Let me do that. No. That you cannot do. You have to follow the rules and regulations. But if you think that it is... You cannot think. Neither you can manufacture. So either you should hear from directly, from Kṛṣṇa directly, or that is not possible because we are not in touch with Kṛṣṇa at the present moment. We are trying to see Kṛṣṇa through the transparent medium of spirituality. So we cannot manufacture that this is Kṛṣṇa's desire. No. You have to get it confirmed from the transparent medium, spiritual master.

### Arjuna's dilemma, counteraction, surrender
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/h8hMfQp6ZFs?t=664
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "But I am not going to fight."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada returns to the verses, explaining Arjuna's reasoning for not wanting to fight, even if it means being killed, and highlighting his internal struggle.

These are the principles. So Arjuna says, yadimāṁ apratikāraṁ. Pratikāraṁ apratikāraṁ. Pratikāraṁ means counteraction. And apratikāraṁ means without any counteraction. So he is informing Kṛṣṇa, that if the other party, dhārta-rāśrā, the sons of Dhrtarāśrā, other party, they kill me while I am not prepared, but that is not the regulation of fighting. So therefore he says, apratikāraṁ. If I am not prepared and they kill me, all of a sudden. This is wrong. So I accept, even they kill me, apratikāraṁ, without I am fully equipped. Asastraṁ. In the fight, one must be equipped with all, all weapons. But while I am not equipped with weapons, or I am not willing to fight, because I am not willing to fight, this has been decided. I cannot kill my kinsmen. Therefore, I am not going to take the step of pratikāraṁ, counteraction. So even in this condition, they come and kill me. Yadimāṁ apratikāraṁ asastraṁ. I am not fully equipped with asa-sastra, weapons. Asastraṁ and sastra-pāṇayaṁ, they are fully equipped with weapons. Rās-rās-rās, rane, hanyu. So in this condition, the other party, my cousin brothers, sons of the rās-rās, if they kill me, rane, hanyu, I shall prefer them. I am not going to fight. If you think that if you don't fight, then they will take the opportunity. He is talking with Kṛṣṇa. He is already giving the counter-argument. Kṛṣṇa, if you think that I don't fight, that they will take the opportunity and kill me immediately, that also I shall prefer. But I am not going to fight.

### Arjuna's dilemma, battlefield, unhappiness

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Arjuna, he is very unhappy because he was beaten by r 가족as, because he first swore that he was a sin."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada describes Arjuna's state on the battlefield, highlighting his unhappiness and the reasons behind it.

This is my decision. Sanjaya-upāca. Sanjaya is the secretary of Dhritarāṣṭra. They were sitting in a room. Ema-muktā, just saying, Arjuna, the person, Arjuna is nominative case. Arjuna, sankhe in the battlefield, rathū-pasta, on the chariot, upāviṣā. You have seen the picture when Kṛṣṇa blew his concert from the backside. Arjuna is just trying to take his arrow and fight. But in the sense of fighting, they are now captured by Arjuna. That is war. And Arjuna is, he is suitable. But Arjuna, he is very unhappy because he was beaten by…

### counteraction, material world, struggle for existence
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/h8hMfQp6ZFs?t=917
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Material world means step by step, simply danger."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains the concept of 'pratikaram' (counteraction) in the material world, where life is a constant struggle against dangers.

It is not traditional money. So apratikāraṁ pratikāraṁ. There are two things. Pratikāraṁ means counteraction. Here in this material world, for everything there is counteraction. Just like if you are diseased, so you have to take the medicine. Pratikāraṁ. That is pratikāraṁ. The disease is caused by some, what is called, disarrangement within the body. So we have to arrange, we have to set up the disarrangement within the body. That is pratikāraṁ, medicine, counteraction. Similarly, if somebody is diseased, he has to take the medicine. If somebody is coming to kill you, so you also become prepared to kill him. This is pratikāraṁ. If somebody is drowning in the sea, then you have to give him some help, send some boat or some lifebuoy so that he can be saved. So we have got so many. This material world is going on. It is full of dangers. Yes. Padam padam yad vipadam. Material world means step by step, simply danger. That is material world. So you have to find out pratikāraṁ, counteraction, how to save yourself from danger. Just like when we walk, we see in so many doors, danger. So that you may be, you are warned. Sometimes the doors are, beware of the door. So you have to take care. No, I shall not enter. So everything, there is danger and there is pratikāraṁ, counter, counteraction, how to save yourself from this. This is called struggle for existence.

### danger and counteraction, Krishna's purity, rascals

**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "The rascals, they do not know this."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada continues discussing danger and counteraction, then transitions to emphasizing Krishna's purity and criticizing those who misunderstand Him.

In this material world... There is only this danger and counteraction. I am unhappy, so just to become happy, I have to work. I have to get money, whatever I want. So this is going on, pratikāraṁ, danger, vipadam. Padam padam yad vipadam. Padam padam yad vipadam, natesāṁ. So samāsthita ye pada-pallavam plavam. Anyone who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. Samāsthita ye pada-pallavam plavam. Mahat-padam kurna-jaso murāre. Murāre, murāre means Kṛṣṇa. So purna-jaso is simply glorified by pious activities. There is no impious activities in Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is the purest. So whatever he does, that is pure. The rascals, they do not know this. They think Kṛṣṇa is immoral, and he has become a professor, teacher. He does not know, he does not understand Kṛṣṇa. So many big, big professor, learners, scholars, they do not understand what is Kṛṣṇa. And they're talking about Kṛṣṇa. They're taking the position of instructing about Kṛṣṇa. Just see how rascals are.

### knowing Krishna, yoga-siddhi, rascals
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/h8hMfQp6ZFs?t=1176
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Both of them are animals."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada discusses the difficulty of knowing Krishna, the concept of 'siddha' (perfection), and criticizes those who falsely claim to be God without any qualifications.

You do not know something. Perfectly, and still you are talking about it. This is going on. Purna-jaso murāre. What is Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa says, bholam janmalā mante jñānavāṁ mām kṛpady. We have to know Kṛṣṇa. Because as soon as you know Kṛṣṇa, you become immediately independent. So knowing Kṛṣṇa is not so easy thing. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, manuṣyānāṁ śahaśreṣu kaścid yatati siddhayaḥ. First of all, you become siddha, perfect. Perfect means perfect knowledge. That is called siddha. And another siddha means very powerful, master of all yogic perfection. That is also siddha. Yogi is perfection, eight kinds of perfection. Manimā, lagimā, siddhi, prapti, yasitā, bhashitā, prāpaṁ mam. So they update eight kinds of siddhis. They are also called siddhas. From material point of view, a perfect yogi can counteract anything, and whatever he likes, he can do. That is called siddhi, astra-siddhi. But still, he is not as siddha as Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa's name is yogi-śara. He is the master of all the yogis. Yogi-śara, yatta-yogi-śara-kṛṣṇa. The yogis also, they are deficient with Kṛṣṇa's power. Still, some rascals, without any yoga-siddhi, they claim that I have become God. What is your qualification? Have you got all the yoga-siddha? Then how you claim that you are? But rascals, they claim to become God, and other rascals, they also believe that here is God.

### understanding Krishna, power of Krishna, animalism
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/h8hMfQp6ZFs?t=1324
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "As good as Kṛṣṇa, this is craziness, animalism."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada continues to emphasize the importance of understanding Krishna's power and criticizes those who claim to be equal to Him, calling it animalistic.

Both of them are animals. Sabai. One who does not know actually what is Kṛṣṇa, if you accept somebody, some rascal as God, then he is also animal. That is also animal. One who is claiming that I am as good as Kṛṣṇa, he is certainly animal, crazy. He does not know what is the power of Kṛṣṇa, how much he is yogi-śara. Still, he is not. He is falsely claiming to become Kṛṣṇa, and one who accepts him as Kṛṣṇa, what is this? So Kṛṣṇa, one should understand first of all Kṛṣṇa. Without understanding Kṛṣṇa, if somebody remarks, if he thinks Kṛṣṇa as ordinary, human being, avajānanti māna-mūḍhā, mānuṣeṁ tanum āśritam, that is the mūḍhā's business, rascal's business. Kṛṣṇa, because He comes as ordinary human being, manuṣya-līlā, if we take Him, Kṛṣṇa, as like me, like ordinary, then I am a mūḍhā. How a human child, at the age of six or seven, seven years, one can lift the whole mountain, Govardhana. Then, first of all, try to understand Kṛṣṇa, how much powerful He is. How a three months old child can kill a big demon, kūtanā. These things are there in the Bhāgavatam about Kṛṣṇa's life. How do you claim to become? As good as Kṛṣṇa, this is craziness, animalism.

### Krishna's order, Arjuna's role, Bhagavad-gita
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/h8hMfQp6ZFs?t=1456
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So what is spiritual knowledge?"
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that Krishna's order is final and discusses Arjuna's role in the Bhagavad-gita, suggesting that he is playing a part to facilitate the delivery of spiritual knowledge.

So Kṛṣṇa's order must be final. If He says, then everything is all right. So here Arjuna's position is, Kṛṣṇa has already arranged the battle, and He knows that Kṛṣṇa wants this battle. Still He says, that yadīvāṁ apratīkāraḥ, He decides in His own way, this is karmāyāṁa. He knows what is Kṛṣṇa's desire, and still He is speaking His own philosophy. That means Arjuna is placing himself on the position of ordinary man. Ordinary man does not know what is Kṛṣṇa. And what is Kṛṣṇa's desire. And he manufactures his own philosophy and thoughts. That is ordinary man. But Arjuna, he is always friend of Kṛṣṇa, constant friend. His name is Gurā-keśa, above all darkness. Certainly he must be one who is Kṛṣṇa's friend, directly. How there can be ignorance? There cannot be. Then why Arjuna is playing that part? He knows Kṛṣṇa's desire. Still He says, that yadīvāṁ apratīkāraḥ, asastraṁ śastra-pāṇayaṁ, and nūṁ tan-veṣeṁ ata-raṁ. He is playing like that. Because without playing, Arjuna is playing like that, how this Bhagavad-gītā will come? This is just like, just like playing on the stage. One very rich man, he is in a drama, he is playing the part of a very poor man. But actually he is not a poor man. But in the stage he is playing the part of a poor man. Similarly, Arjuna is not bewildered. But for the time being he appears to be bewildered by Kṛṣṇa's māyā. Because Kṛṣṇa wants to speak Bhagavad-gītā for the benefit of the whole world. So what is spiritual knowledge?

### counteraction, Krishna's sanction, Prahlada Maharaja

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "If Kṛṣṇa wants to kill you, nobody can save you. And if Kṛṣṇa wants to save you, nobody can kill you."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that all counteractions are ultimately futile without Krishna's sanction, using the example of Prahlada Maharaja to illustrate this point.

Therefore this is a stage arrangement. So, prati-kāraṁ and aprati-kāraṁ. This whatever we have manufactured, prati-kāraṁ, counteraction, that will be also failure if Kṛṣṇa does not sanction it. That is realized by Prahlāda Mahārāja. He says, my dear Lord, Hīraṇyakāršipu, that people have manufactured so many prati-kāraṁ, counteraction. But tanu-vṛtāṁ those who have accepted this material body they are simply manufacturing things to counteract dangers. But even though they have all these counteracting machines or counteracting agents, still without your sanction these counteracting machine or agent will not be fruitful. Similarly Arjuna is being protected by Kṛṣṇa. So even though Arjuna is not well equipped of prati-kāra, still he will be saved. Because Kṛṣṇa is there. tāvat vibhūtaṁ vṛtāṁ tad-peksitāṇā And even one is well equipped and if Kṛṣṇa does not like to save him, he will not be saved. Always mind this. rāke kṛṣṇa māreke māre kṛṣṇa rākeke This is ordinary. If Kṛṣṇa wants to kill you, nobody can save you. And if Kṛṣṇa wants to save you, nobody can kill you.

### Prahlada Maharaja, protection, Krishna's will

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The parents of children, they are not actually protector of the children."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada continues with the example of Prahlada Maharaja, explaining that even parents cannot ultimately protect their children if Krishna wills otherwise.

This is the position. So the examples I have given by Prahlāda Mahārāja. bāla-śaṇīha-saranaṁ pitarau nṛsiṁha My Lord, Nṛsiṁha-deva, the parents of children, they are not actually protector of the children. Because generally we think that this child, this boy has got his father. Father and mother, he is well protected. No. Their father and mother, every father and mother wants to protect the child, but still the child has to meet some danger and dies. There are so many experiences. Similarly, bāla-śaṇīha-saranaṁ pitarau nṛsiṁha The father and mother is a counteraction for the dangers of the child. But Prahlāda Mahārāja said, no, they are not counteraction. It is not that if a child is in danger, because the father and mother is very strong, very rich, he will be able to give protection to the child. No, that is not possible.

### medicine, surrender, Krishna's protection

**Verse References:** BG 18.66
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Real pratikāraṁ is Kṛṣṇa."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada concludes by emphasizing that even the best medicine cannot guarantee safety if Krishna wills otherwise, and that the ultimate protection comes from surrendering to Krishna.

Then, nārtyasya-cāgadha The medicine, a person is suffering from some disease, some fatal disease. If you think, I shall engage first class physician and I shall supply first class medicine, if you think then it will be, the patient will be safe. No, that is not possible. That is not possible. We have got many experiences like that. Then, no rich man, would have died. Because he has got money, he can employ first class physician, first class medicine, and simply by engaging such things, counteracting, pratikāraṁ. He cannot be safe. There are many examples like that. So the conclusion is, tāvat vibhūtaṁ vṛtāṁ tada pe kṣitānāṁ If you neglect, if you have decided, that this person, this child cannot be safe, then any amount of pratikāraṁ will not help. Will not help. Therefore, real pratikāraṁ is Kṛṣṇa. Real pratikāraṁ is Kṛṣṇa. Counter it. So, better we take shelter of Kṛṣṇa. As Kṛṣṇa says, sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vrajaḥ. You must always know that no counteraction will be beneficial for us unless we are protected by Kṛṣṇa. So therefore, our business is fully surrender to Kṛṣṇa and seek His protection. Kṛṣṇa says, yes, ahaṁ tvā sarva-pāpebhaṁ mokṣayiṣyāmi, I shall give you protection. This is Bhagavān's Bhagavad-gītā philosophy. We have to believe on the assertion of Kṛṣṇa that He is prepared to give me all protection provided I have fully surrendered unto His lotus feet.

You cannot achieve the platform of devotional service by karma-kāṇḍa and jñāna-kāṇḍa processes. Devotional service should not be contaminated by jñāna-kāṇḍa, karma-kāṇḍa, by fruitive activities or mental speculation. Devotional service should be taken exactly in the line of the great authorities. We have to follow the principles of these six Gosvāmīs. That will make us happy. Otherwise, if we take devotional service as one of the pious activities, subha-kriya, that is offense. We should not take devotional service of chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra equal to some Vedic pious activities, ritualistic ceremony. We should simply follow the path chalked out by the... Devotional service is not dependent on subhā-subha-karmā.

## How to Overcome Weakness of the Heart? | HDG Srila Prabhupada | Bg 2.3 | 17.08.2024

**Key Quote:** "we become in touch with Krishna by chanting his name Hare Krishna that is the beginning of our connection with Krishna"
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains how Krishna induces Arjuna to fight and emphasizes the importance of chanting Hare Krishna as the beginning of our connection with Krishna.

especially for you, you are my friend. What people will say? So give up this weakness of the heart and stand up, take courage. You just see how Krishna is inducing Arjuna to fight. People are very much ignorant and they sometimes criticize that Krishna is exciting Arjuna. He is very gentleman, non-violent, and Krishna is exciting him to fight. This is called jara-darsana. Jara-darsana means material vision. Therefore, shastra says atasri-krsna-namadi namaved graiham indriyai sri-krsna namadi. We become in touch with Krishna by chanting his name, Hare Krishna. That is the beginning of our connection with Krishna, namadi. The shastra says atasri-krsna-namadi. Adi means beginning. We have no connection with Krishna, but if you chant Hare Krishna maha-mantra, immediately our first chance to contact Krishna begins.

**Key Quote:** "simply chanting that will help also it will take time but if we avoid the offenses then it will be very quickly purified"
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada elaborates on Krishna's name, form, and activities, highlighting the importance of avoiding offenses while chanting to accelerate purification.

So it has to be practiced, not that immediately idealize Krishna. That is not, of course, if one is advanced, it is possible immediately. So shri-krsna-namadi, nam means name. So Krishna, he is not only name, adi, that is the beginning, but form, activities, just like shravanam kirtanam. Shravanam kirtanam, glorifying or describing about Krishna. So he has got his form. So nam means name, and then root means form, lila means pastimes, goma means quality, entourage, his associates. All this adasya shri-krsna-namadi na bhavet na bhavet grāhyam indre. By ordinary senses, we cannot understand either shri-krsna's name. We are hearing that our through the oral reception Krishna's name, but if we keep our ear without purification, of course, by hearing it will be purified. We have to help, help means to avoid the offenses, ten kinds of offenses. So in this way, we shall help the purificatory process. Just like if I want to ignite fire, so I must help the igniting process by drying the wood, it will very soon get fire. Similarly, simply chanting that will help also, it will take time, but if we avoid the offenses, then it will be very quickly purified, the action will be very quickly.

**Key Quote:** "whatever he is doing is God is good he is all good we should have to do it whatever he is doing there is all good"
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada discusses how ordinary people misunderstand Krishna's behavior and stresses the importance of following the orders of higher authorities rather than imitating them, emphasizing that everything Krishna does is perfect.

There. So this behavior of Krishna, how ordinary man can understand? Because they have got their ordinary senses. Therefore, they mistake why Krishna, in Krishna's devotee, Vaisna, that is also stated, Vaisnaver Kriyam mudra vijyana bujhaya. Even Vaisna Acharya, what he is doing, even the most expert intelligent man cannot understand why he is doing this. Therefore, we should not try to imitate the higher authorities, but we have to follow the order, injunction given by the higher authorities. It is not possible. Krishna is exciting Arjuna to fight, that does not mean we can also do that, excite. No, that will be immoral. For Krishna, it is not immoral. Whatever he is doing is God is good, he is all good. We should have to do it. Whatever he is doing, there is all good. This is one side, and whatever I am doing without authorities order, this is all bad. He does not require any order from anyone else. He is the supreme controller. He does not require anyone's instruction. Whatever he does, it is perfect. This is Krishna.

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "your business is to chastise the mischief mongers that is your business you cannot excuse the mischief monger"
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that those without transcendental vision misunderstand Krishna and discusses the duty of a Kshatriya to chastise mischief-mongers, advocating for strict capital punishment.

Understanding, and not that I have to study Krishna in my own way. Krishna is not subjected to your examination or your test. He is above all, he is transcendent. Therefore, those who have not the transcendental vision, they misunderstand Krishna. Here he is directly enticing parantapa. Parantapa is this word, very word is used, that you are a kshatriya, you are a king, your business is to chastise the mischief mongers. That is your business. You cannot excuse the mischief monger. Formerly, the kings were so, the king himself used to judge. A criminal was brought before the king, and if the king thought it wise, he would take his own sword, immediately cut his head. That was the duty of king. Even 100 years ago in Kashmir, the king as soon as a thief was caught, he would be brought before the king, and if he is proved that he was a thief, he is stolen, immediately the king will cut off his hands, personally chopped up even 100 years ago. He was a thief even 100 years ago. So all other thieves warned, this is your punishment. If there was no thieving, there is no stealing, no burglary in Kashmir. Even somebody lost something on the road, it will lie down, nobody will touch it. The order and care for you cannot touch it. The man who has left it, he would come, he would collect, you cannot touch it even 100 years ago. So this capital punishment is required. Nowadays, the capital punishment is excused, murderers are not harmed. This is all mistake, no mercy. Why a human killer, even an animal killer should be immediately hanged? That is the kingdom, the king should be so strict.

So this sympathy is like Arjuna's sympathy. This sympathy now the state is sympathizing with the murderer not to be killed. This is Arjuna's, that is that is not duty. One has to discharge the duty ordered by the superior authority very strictly without any consideration. So these are weakness of the heart, this kind of sympathy. But ordinary person will not be able to do anything special senses, special senses, not ordinary senses, special senses means you have to pluck your eyes and you have to put another eyes. No, you do the work, you have to put other eyes on this body, you have to put other eyes on this body, and this body is the center of the soul.

And this rascals, they say, no, you can eat whatever you like, it has nothing to do with religion. बद बेदिक शास्त्यों बहुत बहुत तुम्हारे पर राशिक हो. तो आप जितना कहांगे कौन भी भी भी गुड़ है। अगर आप आपको प्रधान करते हैं, तो आप आपको प्रधान करेंगे। बेली को प्रधान करेंगे। रुपगुष्यामी gives instruction बाचवेगं क्रोधवेगं मुदरवपस्तवेगं मरसवेगं एतानवेगान जविषवेत धीरच प्रिसिरिंग सशिष्यात this is instruction that anyone who has become competent to control the tongue, to control the mind, to control the anger, to control the belly and control the genital if six kind of control is there, he is fit for becoming spiritual master. He can make disciples all over the world. And if you cannot control your tongue, if you control your anger, control your mental concoction, then how you can become even spiritual master? That is not possible. प्रितिविंश सशिष्यात ओ आन्व देश, that is called गोश्यामी. गोश्यामी or शामी. Master of the senses.

You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, always glorify बाचांशि वैकुन्ठ कुनानु वर्णने. बाचांशि, means talking. Talking is the business of tongue. And tasting is the business of tongue. So you engage the tongue in the service of the Lord by glorifying. Whenever you take a vow that whenever I shall speak, I shall simply speak glorifying Kṛṣṇa, nothing more. That is tongue control. If you don't allow your tongue to speak anything nonsense, ग्राम्म कथा. We sometimes sit together, we talk so many nonsense. And that should be controlled. Now I have engaged my tongue for the service of the Lord, so we shall not talk anything of sense gratification. This is controlling the tongue. I cannot eat anything which is not

### compassion, ignorance, self-realization, duty

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Compassion for the eternal soul is real self-realization."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains the first verse of the second chapter of Bhagavad-gita, focusing on Arjuna's compassion and Krishna's role in dispelling ignorance.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya. In Shri Ramasuramad Bhagavate Gita, Chapter 2, Contained Bhagavate Gita, Summarized, Verse 1: Sanjayo Vacha Tam Tathakrupaya Vishtam Ashrupurna Kulekshanam Vishidantam Hidam Vakyam Vacha Madhusudana. Translation in Perpetual Bhai's Divangresh Translation: Sanjayo said, seeing Arjuna full of compassion and very sorrowful, his eyes brimming with tears, Madhusudana, Krishna, spoke the following words. Perpetual compassion, lamentation, and tears are all signs of ignorance of the real self. Compassion for the eternal soul is real self-realization. The word Madhusudana is significant in this verse. Lord Krishna killed the demon Madhu, and now Arjuna wanted Krishna to kill the demon of misunderstanding that had overtaken him in the discharge of his duty. No one knows where compassion should be applied. Compassion for the dress of a drowning man is senseless. A man fallen in the ocean of nescience cannot be saved simply by rescuing his outward dress, the gross material body. One who does not know this and laments for the outward dress is called a Shudra, or one who laments unnecessarily. Arjuna was a Kshatriya, and this conduct was not expected from him. Lord Krishna, however, can dissipate the lamentation of the ignorant man, and for this purpose the Bhagavad Gita was sung by him. This chapter instructs us in self-realization by an analytical study of the material body and the spirit soul. As explained by the supreme authority, Lord Shri Krishna, this realization is made possible by working with the fruity being situated in the fixed conception of the real self.

### devotional service, liberation, Krishna's position

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "That position is greater than to become one with Kṛṣṇa."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada describes the setup of the Bhagavad-gita and contrasts the desire to merge with Krishna with the devotee's desire to serve Krishna, highlighting the superior position of devotional service.

Now, in the first chapter of the Bhagavad-gītā, it is the setup. Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, according to the order of Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa placed the chariot in between the two soldiers, two flanks of soldiers. Śreṇāya-rūbhāya-maddhe rata-sthāpaya me acyuta. So Arjuna was respectful to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa has accepted to be charioteer, inferior position than Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is on the chariot, sitting on the throne, and Arjuna is sitting on the throne, and Kṛṣṇa has taken the inferior position, driving the chariot. So this is very nice position for devotional service. Those who are not devotee, they aspire to become Kṛṣṇa. Their aspiration is to merge into the existence of the Supreme, or to become one with Kṛṣṇa. But in devotional service, it is not the desire of the devotee to become one with Kṛṣṇa, but sometimes to make Kṛṣṇa as the order-carrier of the devotee. To become one with Kṛṣṇa, it may be a very great position, but to become the commander of Kṛṣṇa, that is another thing.

**Key Quote:** "The devotee does not approach the Supreme for any material gain."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada discusses the five kinds of liberation and emphasizes pure devotion, which is devoid of any material or spiritual gain.

That position is greater than to become one with Kṛṣṇa. So there are five kinds of liberation, sājūrya. The first liberation is supposed to be sājūrya, means to become one with the Supreme. The Māyāvāda philosopher, monist, they aspire after sājūrya-mukti. But the devotees, Vaiṣṇavas, they do not aspire to become one with Kṛṣṇa. They aspire to become one with Kṛṣṇa. They aspire to become one with Kṛṣṇa. And at that time after sājūrya-mukti, there, for them, there are other four kinds of mukti: Sa rūpaḥ salakkaḥ sāsthiḥ sa mipyaḥ. And those who are still further advanced, they do not want any kind of mukti, neither of these five points of mukta is… Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He prays, na dhanam na janam na sundariṁ kavitāṁ vā jagad-dīśa-kāmāyam. This is pure devotional prayer. The devotee does not approach the Supreme for any material gain. Just pure devotion means without any aspiration of any kind of material gain or even spiritual gain. Anyāvilāśitā sunyam jñāna-karmāda-anāvṛtaṁ ānukulyena kṛṣṇaṇu-śrīlanam bhakti-uttamāṁ. Uttamāṁ bhakti, first-class bhakti. What is that? Anyāvilāśitā sunyam, without any kind of desire than to serve the Lord.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Nārāyaṇa is not anything of this material world."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that Krishna, Vishnu, and Narayana are beyond the material world and that the term 'nirakara' means that God's form is not material.

And in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam also it is said, sabhi-puṁśāṁ paro dharmaḥ. Paro means transcendental. Beyond this material conception, Kṛṣṇa or the Absolute, Nārāyaṇa, that is paro, Nārāyaṇa-paro of bhakti-āyam. Nārāyaṇa is not anything of this material world. Nārāyaṇa, Kṛṣṇa, Viṣṇu, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, He is not anything of this material world. When we use this word nirākā, that means He is not anything of this material world. But He has got His form, that is transcendental form, sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ. Nirākār means He has no such form as we have got this material form. This material form is neither of the three transcendental bliss, sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ, this is asat, acit, and nirānanda-vigrahaḥ. This body, this material body is asat, acit, and nirānanda-vigrahaḥ. Therefore when in the Vedic literature on an authorized statement we find nirākār, that means His form does not belong to this asat, acit, or nirānanda-vigrahaḥ.

**Key Quote:** "When we become envious of Kṛṣṇa and we want to enjoy this material world, then we come to this material creation."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that the material world is a result of envy towards Krishna and the desire to enjoy separately, leading to the cycle of karma and different forms of life.

Cūta means those who are fallen in the material world. They are cūta. We are fallen in the material world. Therefore, we have accepted this material body. Napāpuraṁ rellenů Institute on the integral consciousness, purpose and sense body. Īcchā. Īcchā means desire, and deśa means envy, enviousness. ícchā deśa samad-tena. When we become envious of Kṛṣṇa and we want to enjoy the good of the average Muslims, we cannot en possession of radiance. enjoy this material world, then we come to this material creation. Icchād deśa-samuttena sarve jānti paraṇṭhaḥ. So any one of us who is in this material world, having a material body, beginning from Brahmā, down to the ant, a small ant, any one of them, in the Brahma-saṅgīta it is said that yastindra-gopo matavendra-maho sakarma bandhāna-rūpa-phala-bhājana-māta-noti. Indra-gopa, there is an insect which is called in Sanskrit language as indra-gropa. It is microbe. You cannot see with this naked eyes. So this microbe is called indra, and there is another indra, the king of him. So the Brahma-saṅgīta is just through indra-gopo and mahendra, this king of him. So the Brahma-saṅgīta is just through indra-gopo and mahendra, this king of him. Beginning from this indra-gopo up to the king of heaven, everyone is subjected to enjoy or suffer the resultant action of this karma. By karma, by resultant action of karma, one has become the king of heaven, and by similarly… This, by karma, resultant action of karma, one has become the microbial insect.

**Key Quote:** "He identified himself as the body."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada describes how everyone in the material world is attached to their body and identifies with it, which is what happened to Arjuna on the battlefield.

This is the material body. There are 8,400,000 types or forms of this material body, and we are wandering, sarva-gata, in different planets, in different forms. This is material world. And in the material world, whatever form we may have, we have got attachment for this body. Not only attachment, we are under the impression that I am this body, everyone. That is material conception of life. So that thing happened to Arjuna in the battlefield. He identified himself as the body. He thought himself that he belongs to the Kuru family, and his family relatives, his other side, his brother, nephews, or his grandfather. So he refused to fight. My dear Kṛṣṇa, after placing the chariot between the two parties, senaya rubhayor madhye rata-sthāpaya meyocchuta, and then he became very much disturbed. He thought, I have to kill. The other side, my brother and my nephews, my grandfather. No, no. Kṛṣṇa, I cannot. This is not possible. I shall not fight.

### body identification, animal life, family affection

**Key Quote:** "Anyone who is identifying himself with this material body, he is animal, go-kharā."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that identifying oneself with the material body is animalistic and discusses how family affection drives economic development.

That is animal life. In the śāstra it is said, anyone who is identifying himself with this material body, he is animal, go-kharā. Go-kharā. Sa eva go-kharam. Go means cow, and kharo means ass. Yaśyātma-buddhi-kunapeti-dhātoke sadhik-kalatra-disubhau maiyyadhi Ya tīrtha-buddhi-salilena karhiśe janesu abhignesu sa eva go-kharam Yaśyātma-buddhi-kunapeti-dhātoke sadhik-kalatra-disubhau maiyyadhi Anyone who is identifying himself with this body, which is made of tri-dhātu. According to Ayurvedic medical system, this body is production of kapha-pitta-vāyu. Or in our modern medical science, anatomy, physiology, this body is a combination of bones, muscles, skin, blood, urine, stool, that's all. So śāstra says, if anyone thinks that he is this lump of bones, flesh, blood, urine and stool, yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇapetri-dhātu, and śadhiḥ kalatrādiḥ śūraḥ, and the production of these bones and flesh, kalatrādiḥ śūraḥ, because we have got relationship here in this material world with wife, kalatrā means wife, kalatrā, kalatrādiḥ śūraḥ, beginning from wife. Wife produces so many children, therefore adiḥ, the beginning is wife. So śadhiḥ kalatrādiḥ śūraḥ. Kalatrādiḥ śūraḥ, the wife and my children, they are mine. Kīt and kin, śadhiḥ kalatrā, śadhiḥ, they are my own.

### material attachment, transcendental knowledge, Arjuna's position, Bhagavad-gita setup

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So Arjuna played the part of a gokhar."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada continues to describe the material attachments and explains that Arjuna played the part of someone identifying with the body, thus needing instruction.

Everyone is working. Even a great economist, Mr. Marshall, he says that economic development begins from family affection. So unless one thinks that he has to maintain his wife, children, family, there is no question of economic development, impetus. So yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇapetri-dhātuke śadhiḥ kalatrādiḥ śūraḥ, and bhoma yadhiḥ, bhoma, this earth, as worshipping. Bhoma yadhiḥ, yat tīrtha-buddhiḥ śalile, and for pilgrimage, the one who thinks that the water is tīrtha. Tīrtha means where one can get transcendental knowledge. Śadhiḥ kalatrādiḥ śūraḥ, bhoma yadhiḥ, yat tīrtha-buddhiḥ śalile, na kariśe janeṣu abhijñeṣu, but has no interest to associate with persons who is expert in transcendental knowledge. Such these persons, they are called gokharas. Gokhara means cows and asses. So Arjuna played the part of a gokhar. In the battlefield of Kuruksetra, he played the part. He played the part of an ordinary person, gokharo, who is identifying this body as self. Therefore he required instruction. Not only he becomes so much overwhelmed that he gave up his arrows and bows and sat down tightly. My dear Kṛṣṇa, I am not, I cannot fight. And he was crying. Not only he gave up his duty, he was kṣatriya, and he was crying. Oh, I will have to kill my kinsmen. No, no, no, I cannot kill. So this is the setup in the first chapter of the Bhagavad-gītā.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada emphasizes presenting the Bhagavad-gita as it is, without misinterpretations, and asserts that the Mahabharata is a historical account of greater India.

arrangement in the battlefield, and then he's speaking. Now, sometimes Bhagavad-gītā is misinterpreted that these battle, I mean to say, dharma-kṣetre, kurukṣetre, or means this body. We do not misinterpret in that way. There is no question of misinterpretation. We are presenting Bhagavad-gītā as it is. We do not change by our whimsical imagination, concoction. We do not interpret the words of the Bhagavad-gītā according to our own desire. No. Actually, from literary point of view, interpretation is required when things are not understood very clearly. Then interpretation required. In the dog-hope, when the lawyers try to interpret before the judge, when the terms are not very clear. That is the same way in, among the associations, society of learned scholars. Interpretation is not required when the things are very clear. Just like the sunshine, sunlight. There is no need of a lamp to show the sun. The sun is self-reflection. It is already there. Light is there. Why one should take a lamp to show the sun? This misinterpretation has killed the spirit, the real essence of Bhagavad-gītā. So there are so many additions and so many misinterpretations. Our, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, our proposition is that we are, I mean to say, presenting Bhagavad-gītā as it is. We do not misinterpret. So dharma-kṣetra, kuru-kṣetra. Kuru-kṣetra is dharma-kṣetra, the place where religious, ritualistic performances are done. So kuru-kṣetra, dharma-mācare, that is the Vedic version. So kuru-kṣetra is always, still people go for pilgrimage in kuru-kṣetra, and the station is there, kuru-kṣetra, and the place is there. People go there, kuru-kṣetra. Why one should interpret that kuru-kṣetra means this body, and Pāṇḍava means this pañca, indriya, so many? There is no question of interpretation. And this Mahābhārata, Mahābhārata means the history of greater India. That is Mahābhārata, history. It is history. It is not a fiction. It is history.

Mahābhārata. This planet was formerly known as Bhārata-varṣa. This is Mahābhārata. This planet, the whole planet, not that the piece of land, as we are calling now Bhārata-varṣa, no. Before that, this planet was known as Ilābhati-varṣa. And after the reign of Mahārāja Bharata, the son of Viśavadeva, this planet became Bhārata-varṣa. So Bhārata-varṣa means the whole planet. But we have laws. Just like we have lost a portion of the present Bhārata-varṣa as Pakistan. Everyone knows. Twenty years before, there was no such thing as Pakistan. But circumstantially, we have lost. So the whole Bhārata-varṣa has been partitioned as this portion is called America, this portion is called Europe, this portion is called... This is called Asia. These are modern names. Actually, the whole planet was Bhārata-varṣa, and the whole planet was being controlled by Vedic culture. So as we have lost our Vedic culture, as we could not control the others, other people in other part of the world, by our culture, by our political manual,

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains Dhritarashtra's anxiety and his desire for his sons to win the Kurukshetra battle, fearing a compromise.

then, what happened next? Dhrtarāṣṭhava was very much anxious. He said, dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre sama-vītā yuduṣyavaḥ. Now these two parties, yuduṣyavaḥ, both of them were desirous of fighting, yuduṣyavaḥ. So one party is māmaka, my sons, and the other party is Pāṇḍava. These two parties were desirous of fighting. So one party is māmaka, my sons, and the other party is Pāṇḍava. These two parties were desirous of fighting. So one party is māmaka, my sons, and the other party is Pāṇḍava, the sons of my brother, Pāṇḍava. Māmakā Pāṇḍavāśyaiva. Now the word is used, yuduṣyavaḥ. They assembled for fighting. Then what is the use of asking? King Akurvata. Then what did they do? It is natural to conclude that when they assemble for fighting, there must be fighting. But why he was asking King Akurvata? The suspect was that because the parties assembled in the dharma-kṣetra, so they might have changed their ideas. Still in India, if there is two fighting parties, they go to a temple and ask that, You say the right thing. So in the temple, still in the villages, they do not dare to say, dare to speak lies. Yes, they are fighting, and the misunderstanding has become settled up. So Dhrtarāṣṭhā was thinking whether the two parties, they have settled up. He did not like that. He wanted that these Pāṇḍavas should be killed, and my sons, Kauravas, they should come out victorious, so that there will be no enemy. He was very much anxious to place his sons on the throne. Because he was blind, he could not acquire the throne. His younger brother was situated on the throne. Now, after the death of his younger brother, he thought that I missed the opportunity of sitting on the throne. Why not my sons? They have got... That is actually right. That is the background of this Kuruksetra battle. He was always devising some means, how the sons of Pāṇḍu, his nephews, could be separated, and his sons would sit on the throne. That was his idea. Therefore he inquired, King Akhūrvata. Otherwise there is no question of inquiring King Akhūrvata.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that the effect of the dharmakṣetra (holy place) was visible in Arjuna because he was a devotee, leading to his compassion and reluctance to fight.

So they went there to fight. They would fight there. But he was suspecting, if they have made any compromise, that he did not like, that he did not like. Therefore he asked, he wanted that there must be fight. And there are five brothers. My sons are one hundred in number. So they would be killed, and my sons will be without any rivalry. This is the background of Kuruksetra. Another thing, the dharmakṣetra, effect of dharmakṣetra, was visible in Arjuna. Dharmakṣetra. He, because he is devotee of Kṛṣṇa, yasyāsthi bhakti bhagavati akañcanaḥ sarvai guṇaitatra samāsati siddhā. Because he is devotee of Kṛṣṇa, therefore he felt, oh, what is this? Why is there a fight? Why is there a fight? Why is there a fight? Why is there a fight? Why is there a fight? Why is there a fight? Why is there a fight? I killed this, my brothers. Because he was devotee. This sentiment came into the mind of Arjuna, not on the other side, Duryodhana. He never thought. Although they were placed, both of them placed at dharmakṣetra, the effect of dharmakṣetra was manifest in the body of Arjuna, not Duryodhana.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada describes the devotee's compassion for others' suffering and contrasts it with the envy prevalent in the material world.

Devotees, they are para-duḥkha-duḥkhi. The symptom of a devotee is they are unhappy by seeing others unhappy. That is the symptom of devotee. Generally, person, if he sees somebody happy, he becomes unhappy, matsarata. That is the world situation. If I see my brother, he is very happy. He has improved in his material condition. Then I become unhappy. He has advanced so much, and I could not do so. This is material situation. Materials are envious, griha-medhi. Everyone is envious. Either you take person to person or neighbor to neighbor, their sympathy is lip-sympathy. Actually, everyone is envious. Businessman to businessman, nation to nation, this is material world. Therefore spiritual advancement means for person who is not envious, not envious. Parama nirma-sarāṁ satāṁ vāstyava-vaṣṭu-vedyaṁ. In the Sema-bhāgavatam it is said that if you want to know the real truth, vāstyava-vaṣṭu, then one must become parama nirma-sarāṁ, nirma-sarāṁ.

It is not for the persons who are entangled in cheating religious system. Cheating, dharma-kaitava. Kaitava means cheating. So cheating type of religious system are kicked out from this book, Sema-bhāgavatam. But it is meant for persons who are not envious. Parama nirma-sarāṁ satāṁ. Vāstava-bhāstu, one who wants to learn real reality, not false reality. Here in this material world, everything is false reality. Just like we are trying to find our water in the desert. That is the example, my race. False, there is no water. But the animal, he sees that there is water, fast water, and he runs after it and dies. So here in this material also world, every one of us running after the false mirage. There is happiness, there is happiness, there is happiness. This is called material condition. And we are envious. Yes, this is the position. And therefore Kṛṣṇa begins the Bhagavad-gītā, to get out of this ignorance and enviousness.

### Bhakti-rasa-amrita-sindhu, Ocean of spiritual bliss, Material vs. Spiritual

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, this ocean is increasing."
**Summary:** This segment introduces the Nectar of Devotion as an ocean of spiritual bliss, contrasting it with the limited nature of material enjoyment.

Today we have a class by Sthivayangreshwara Prabhupada on Nectar of Devotion. It's divided into four parts, just as the ocean is sometimes divided into four parts. And there are different sections within each of these four divisions. Originally, in Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu, the ocean is divided like the watery ocean, to east, west, north and south, while the subsections within these different divisions are called waves. As in the ocean, there are always different waves, either on the eastern side, the western side, the northern side or the southern side. Most similarly, Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu… That Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu, the Sanskrit word, we have shortcut the translation, Nectar of Devotion, but Rupa Gosvami's purpose is to present the ocean of Bhakti Rasamrita. Rasamrita means mellow, the juice. It is like an ocean. This ocean has limitation, but that is unlimited. Ānandā-buddhi-vardhanam.

**Key Quote:** "Spiritual bliss is different. That is simply increasing."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the difference between limited material enjoyment and the unlimited, ever-increasing nature of spiritual bliss experienced by yogis.

Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, this ocean is increasing. Now, this material… This material ocean, it has got limit. It cannot increase unlimitedly. That is not possible. Otherwise, how we could build? This house is on the beach. No. It is ordered not to come forward beyond this line. But the spiritual bliss, that ocean, is increasing. Ānandā-buddhi-vardhanam. That is the difference between spiritual bliss and material enjoyment. Material enjoyment is limited. You cannot enjoy unlimitedly. That is not possible. Just for few seconds, for few minutes, or for few hours, then it becomes disgusting. That is the material enjoyment. Okay? Spiritual enjoyment. Spiritual bliss is different. That is simply increasing. So, therefore, in the śāstras it is said, Those who are yogis, bhakta-yogīs, they enjoy unlimitedly. Unlimited. Unlimited. Yama, anantè, yogīna ánante. And that is satya-ânande. That ānanda bliss is real bliss.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the eternal and factual nature of the love between Krishna and Radha, and Krishna's relationships with other devotees, highlighting the eternal nature of spiritual relationships.

This is artificial. This is McMurtry reflection. I have several times explained that the love affairs between Kṛṣṇa and Rādhārāṇī, that is fact. There is no end. It all ends. They are enjoying. Rādhārāṇī… TV is cut off. Rādhārāṇī TV is cut off city inside. Telegraph. It is not found to be a drawback, and he is enjoying the company of Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa is enjoying. Rādhā-kṛṣṇa-pranaya-vikṣitī-allādini-śakti. That is Kṛṣṇa's pleasure potency. As Kṛṣṇa is eternal, Kṛṣṇa's pleasure potency is also eternal. So real love, Rādhā-kṛṣṇa, or Kṛṣṇa and the gopīs, or Kṛṣṇa and the cowherd boys, Kṛṣṇa and Yaśodāma, Nanda Mahārāja, Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's servants, Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's trees, Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's water, Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's flower, Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's cow, everything eternal. That is eternal.

**Key Quote:** "So the blissful enjoyment with Kṛṣṇa, it is unlimited."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Krishna's expansions and the unlimited blissful enjoyment derived from devotional service, contrasting the enthusiasm of spiritual work with the fatigue of material labor.

ānanya-cinvaya-rasa-pradibhāvitābhi stābhir ya yeva-nija-rūpa-tayākalābhi Kṛṣṇa's enjoyment. It means Kṛṣṇa's expansion. Just like in Bhāgavata, you know, when Kṛṣṇa's cowherd boys, calves and cows were stolen by Brahmā, Kṛṣṇa again expanded Himself in the similar forms, so that the mother of the cowherd boys, the mother of the calves, they may not feel there is separation. Kṛṣṇa immediately replaced. That is Kṛṣṇa. So the blissful enjoyment with Kṛṣṇa, it is unlimited. That is called bhakti-rasa-amṛta-sindhu. Rasa and amṛta. Amṛta, that is not dying. That is not possible. Formation of material enjoyment. It is not possible. But because we are preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is still a persistence. Yes. This is the difference. You will feel more and more enthusiasm. In material world, the more you work, you feel tired. And the spiritual world, the more you work, you will feel enthused. That is called ānandāmbudhi-vaddhanam. That is the test. If our workers are feeling tired, then that means he is working material. And if he is feeling enthused more and more, that is, he is working spiritually.

**Summary:** This segment contrasts material and spiritual enjoyment, emphasizing that true happiness comes from understanding Krishna's sac-cit-ananda nature.

That is called ānandāmbudhi-vaddhanam. That is the spiritual test. Vara-mante yogina anante satyānande cidātmane. That is cidātmane. That is spiritual, not material. So here we are trying to enjoy materially. So how we can be happy? That is not possible. Materially we cannot be happy. Therefore Bhagavad-gītā gives us indication, sukhaṁ ātyantikam yat tat atindriyat grāhyam. If we want happiness, happiness is our priority, every individual soul, happiness. Because Kṛṣṇa is sac-cit-ānanda-vigrahaḥ, eternal, blissful ānanda, ānanda-blissful, citta, knowledge, and sac-icārya. That is Kṛṣṇa. Sac-cit-ānanda-vigrahaḥ.

**Summary:** This segment addresses the misconceptions of Mayavadi philosophers regarding Krishna's form, emphasizing the importance of understanding Krishna's chit-potency.

Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇa sac-cit-ānanda-vigrahaḥ. Vigrahaḥ means four, but not this four. Those who have no knowledge about Kṛṣṇa, they are thinking Kṛṣṇa is māyā. These bhaktas, they are worshiping the māyā form. Their philosophy is when Kṛṣṇa comes, when God comes, He takes a material form. No, that's not true. Kṛṣṇa said, sambhavāmi ātma-māyayāṁ, sambhavāmi ātma-māyayāṁ, the ātma-māyayāṁ means chit-potency. These Māyāvādī philosophers, they have no information that chit-potency. That is Allādhina-śakti. That is Rādhā-nāyā. They have got experience of this material potency, external energy, durgā. But they have no information of the chit-potency.

### Material Body, Modes of Nature, Voidism, Suicide, Atma-ha

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Killing this body does not mean killing yourself."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the nature of the material body and the consequences of suicide, explaining that killing the body does not end suffering.

Therefore they think that Kṛṣṇa appears in the form of māyā. Just like we have got this body, material body, this is gift by the māyā. Prakṛteḥ kriyamānāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarva-śaḥ. Ahamkāra-vimūrātmā-kartāḥ miti-manyate. Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgaḥ aśyaḥ sada-sada janma-yotiṣaḥ. Kāraṇa. We are getting this body according to our association with the different modes of material nature. But Kṛṣṇa has nothing to do with this material nature. Material nature is controlled by Him, and we are controlled by the material nature. That is the difference. He is controller, and we are controlled. They do not understand. They think that if I make null and void these conditions of controlling, then I become uncontrolled. That's like the philosophy, voidism. Or suicideism. I am feeling some pain in my body. If I think that let me commit suicide, then the pain will go away automatically. That is void philosophy. They're killing oneself, ātmahā, but because they have no understanding that killing this body does not mean killing yourself.

### Suicide, Ghostly Body, Subtle Sciences, Sraddha Ceremony

**Verse References:** BG 2.20
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Killing this body does not mean killing yourself."
**Summary:** This segment continues the discussion on suicide, explaining the concept of the ghostly body and the purpose of the sraddha ceremony.

That is the philosophy. That is their ignorance. In the Bhagavad-gītā it is clearly said, na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre. So these rascals think that if I commit suicide and just have a knife on my throat, then all my pains and pleasure are finished. No. That is not. You will be put into more pain and pleasure. Sometimes we'll have to accept. Why accept? It is certain. The ghosli body. Because Kṛṣṇa has given it, or māyā has given. Māyā has given, under the direction of Kṛṣṇa, a certain type of body for enjoying for a certain span of life. You cannot finish it. If you disregard it, then if you commit suicide, the result will be that you'll not be allowed to accept another material body. You'll have to remain in the subtle body. That is ghosṭi. Ghosṭi life means one who has misused this life, this body, and by his whim he has killed this body. He becomes ghosṭi. That means he'll have to suffer for so many days. Then he'll get another material body. Therefore there is śraddha-ceremonia. This śraddha-ceremonia means supposing my father or my relative has not got yet again gross body, this śraddha-ceremonia will help him to get another gross body. Because without this gross body, the ghosṭi body is very troublesome because he wants to enjoy something, but he has no instrument to enjoy. Therefore he creates, the ghosṭi creates trouble, sometimes captures somebody to fulfill his desires, and the man becomes ghosṭi, haunted. There are so many subtle sciences. What do they know, these so-called scientists?

**Key Quote:** "Everyone is anda, blind. They have no gain, no knowledge, and misleading, always."
**Summary:** This segment criticizes blind leaders and the pursuit of material enjoyment, emphasizing that true enjoyment comes from the spirit soul.

They're simply falsely proud, taking account of the small duration of life for ten to twenty years, fifty years, or at most a decade. That's all. They do not know. Andāya-dhān dhairupaniya mānāḥ. And still they're becoming kaita, they're becoming sāmīs, they're becoming gurus, they're becoming fathers, they're becoming government. How people can be happy? Everyone is anda, blind. They have no gain, no knowledge, and misleading, always. Yes. So the ānanda-āmbudhi-vardhaṁ. You can have unlimited ānanda, but because you are falsely trying to enjoy through this material body, therefore you are becoming confused and frustrated. That they do not know. They think, I have got this material body. I have got some senses. Let me enjoy these senses to the best possibility. But you cannot do it, because it is false. It is not real. Real senses, unless you feel sensation, that sensation, consciousness, is there because the spirit soul is there. Otherwise there is no sensation. And unless you feel sensation, there is no enjoyment. So this bodily enjoyment is false. Real enjoyment of the spirit.

**Summary:** This segment describes the different relationships devotees can have with Krishna and the importance of understanding the Vrindavana Lila.

Therefore it is said, ramante yoginā anante. They want to enjoy life with ananta, Kṛṣṇa. They want to become friend of Kṛṣṇa. They want to become lover of Kṛṣṇa. They want to become servant of Kṛṣṇa. They want to become father of Kṛṣṇa. They want to become mother of Kṛṣṇa. The same thing, as we are pervertedly enjoying in this material, the same thing is there, spiritual life. That is Kṛṣṇa exhibiting. When He appears on this earth, He practically shows how He can enjoy also with Him. That is Vṛndāvana living. Practical manifestation. But we are not taking to that. We are taking this Vṛndāvana lila of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is māyā. Vṛndāvana is lāyā. Now simply press your nose and think of something impersonal. That is for living. No? That is not. This is fact. Ramante, unless you are many varieties, there cannot be enjoyment. Ramante, yoginā anante. Ramante, this very word, one who is engaged, he is called, iti rāma-pade nāso para-brahma-hitya-vidhiya.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the nature of the spiritual soul and the contrast between spiritual and material existence, criticizing the Mayavadi philosophers' understanding of Krishna.

This is the meaning of Rāma, Rāma, Kṛṣṇa, Rādhā-Ramana, Rādhā-Mālā. So this science has to be understood. We are, everyone is after happiness. Ānanda-mayabhyāsā. We are spiritual soul, spiritual spark. Our life is ānanda, sac-cid-ānanda, eternal life, blissful life, life of knowledge. But we are put into this material condition, which is ignorance, miserable, and temporary. Just opposite. Instead of having eternal, blissful, knowledgeable life, we have got this body, which is non-eternal, non-permanent, and always miserable, in condition, and not blissful. Always miserable, and we are always in ignorance. That's the opposite. So Kṛṣṇa is not like this. If we think of Kṛṣṇa like that, then it is a mistake. The Māyāvādī philosophers, they are thinking of Kṛṣṇa like that, that Kṛṣṇa is like me. Abha-jānanti māṁ mūḍhaḥ. They are rascals, mūḍhaḥ. They are thinking there is something above Kṛṣṇa. Therefore they are mūḍhās. Abha-jānanti māṁ mūḍhaḥ. Because they have no knowledge. Parambhāva-bhajānanta. They do not know the parambhāva, the bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.

**Summary:** This segment explains the purpose of the Krishna consciousness movement in providing real knowledge about Krishna and refutes the idea of an impersonal God.

They have no idea. They have no knowledge. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is therefore giving them the real knowledge. Kṛṣṇa, how He is enjoying. He is, how He is joyful. Ānanda-cinemaya. Ānanda-cinemaya-rasa-putibhāhu tāpi. Āṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛttimanti paśyanti pānti kalayanti ciram jaganti. Ānanda-cinemaya sad ujjala-vigrahasya. Ānanda-sat ujjala-vigraha. It's not ordinary vigraha like this. They have got bitter experience of this vigraha, of this form. Therefore they want to make God impersonal. Must be opposite. They have got this bitter knowledge that getting this body, we are suffering so much. Therefore the God must be without body. Just opposite. This is also material thinking. Thinking in a negative way. But they have no knowledge. There is a God as body, but that is completely spiritual. It has nothing to do with the material body. They cannot think of spiritual body.

So the Bhakti-raha-sāmṛta-sindhu is teaching people how you can enjoy in the ocean of blissfulness. That is Bhakti-raha-sāmṛta. So Rupa Gosvāmī is dividing. Just like the sea has got east, west, north, south, similarly he is dividing the ocean of nectaring in four divisions. And as there are waves in the ocean, so there are different chapters. That means he is dividing the Bhakti-raha-sāmṛta book in four parts.

Then when you become expert in devotional service, then you come to the spiritual platform. You will feel ecstasy. Ānanda-mudhi-vardhanam. Otherwise how you get enthusiasm? That is the test.

Then the material platform, you are going, working, you will feel tired, and you will try to retire from it.

As you prolong, execute devotional service, bhagavata-bhakti-yoga, prasannam anaso, you become jolly, because that is your nature. At the present moment, although I am spirit soul, my nature is to become jolly, ānanda, but because I am covered by this material nature, my joyfulness has practically disappeared. I am here. Or I am trying to enjoy life through this material body. That is my position. So if you engage yourself in devotional service, the first engagement is the śravaṇa, hearing. It is not difficult. You don't have to go anywhere. Śrīmatān sakataḥ kṛṣṇaḥ. Kṛṣṇa is within you. If you kindly hear about Kṛṣṇa, that is the first business, śravaṇa.

**Summary:** This segment explains that even if literature describing Krishna has grammatical errors, it is still valuable if it glorifies the Supreme Lord.

Those who are sādhu, those who are devotees, they hear that literature. They hear that literature. Otherwise, another, the next verse, I forget now, that vāyaśatīrthaṁ. That it is being described as vāyaśatīrthaṁ, uśanti mānasā. So this kind of literature, even it is not properly grammatically correct. tad-vāga-viśabhakaḥ janatāṁ viplaṭhaḥ yasmīṁ pratiḥ ślokam avadhyaḥ That, in writing Sanskrit slow, it requires very high education. It is not like, whatever I write, three lines, one line, and two lines, not. There is some metric system, caṇḍa. So śaita, śukadeva Gosvāmī says, even it is not properly composed, but because there is anantasya, anantasya guṇāne, the glorification of ananta, the Supreme, śrīṇanti gāyanti gṛṇanti sādhavaḥ, those who are sādhus, actually, they accept it. It doesn't matter if there is little grammatical mistake or some poetical discrepancies. There are literary rules and regulations. So śāstra says it doesn't matter even there is not perfectly. Śaṅkarāyāsā also says, nāhi nāhir aṣṭhati duḥkīṁ karaḥ . You cannot be saved by simply grammatical efficiency. The grammatical efficiency is secondary.

Just like milk touched by the lips of a serpent is poison. You cannot say, it is milk, very nice. No. Because it is touched by the lips of the serpent, it is useless. Similarly, as soon as a professional reciter or a avaiṣṇava reciter, without any realization, without being a devotee of the Lord, cites, recites, that should not be heard. That is restricted by śrīnātana-guṣa. avaiṣṇava mukha-gīrṇā-pūta-harī-kathā-mṛtaṁ śravaṇaṁ na kaśvatam. Because you will not derive any benefit. You go on hearing for thousands of years, thousands of years. You still will remain where you are in the beginning. But śrīnātana-guṣa-kṣiṣṭo pāyo yathā. But śrīnātana-guṣa-kṣiṣṭo pāyo yathā. But śrīnātana-guṣa-kṣiṣṭo pāyo yathā.

**Summary:** This segment discusses how one can conquer Krishna by remaining in their position and hearing from the proper source, using the example of Yasoda Maharaja.

You will understand. So it requires little willingness. sthāne sthitā śrutigatāṁ tanavāṁ na nobhīḥ . prāśo ajitopi jitaḥ paśi ta istila kyaṁ. This statement was given by Brahmā, and when it was quoted by Rāmānanda Rāya before Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he accepted that sthāne sthitā śrutigatāṁ tanavāṁ na nobhīḥ . You can remain your position. You don't require to change your position. Not that you have to give up your household life, you have to accept sannyāsa, or you have to do this, the other. No. Remain in your position. But try to hear from the proper source and try to understand. That will make you so strong that Kṛṣṇa is ajitaḥ, unconquerable, but you'll conquer Him. You'll conquer Him. Ajitopi, jitaḥ paśi, he becomes conquered. Because Kṛṣṇa cannot be conquered by anyone, by the demons, but He can be conquered by a devotee. Just like Yaśodā Mahārāja, he has conquered Kṛṣṇa. The whole world is trembled by Kṛṣṇa's prowess, but Kṛṣṇa is trembling before Yaśodā Mahārāja.

**Summary:** This segment concludes by emphasizing that devotees can become the mother or father of Krishna, highlighting Krishna's desire to be controlled by His devotees and the essence of Krishna's life in Vrindavana.

On the stick. So he wants to be controlled. Because everyone is praying. My dear Lord, oh, You are so great. Everyone prays like that. But no one shows his stick. But he wants, because that is also enjoyment. So sometimes he is disappointed that nobody wants me to show his stick. Therefore he finds out there is such a devotee who can show him stick. Kṛṣṇa is so kind. Kṛṣṇa is so kind. So you can become mother of Kṛṣṇa, you can become father of Kṛṣṇa. What is to become one with Kṛṣṇa? You become father of Kṛṣṇa. The Māyāvādīs, they want to march into the Supreme. But we want to become father of Kṛṣṇa. Why march? More than Kṛṣṇa. The devotee can beget Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa accepts that. Yes, I shall become your child. I shall be controlled by your stick. So they are, they are not ordinary. We should not think like that. That is ānanda-cinmaye rasa-pradibhā. That is Kṛṣṇa's expansion of pleasure potency. Kṛṣṇa wants to be controlled by Yaśodā Mahārāja. Kṛṣṇa wants to be defeated by His friends. Kṛṣṇa wants to be refused. Rādhārāṇī is darsana. Yes. Rādhārāṇī is angry. She has refused. He has ordered. They are so guilty. Don't allow Kṛṣṇa to come here. Yes. Kṛṣṇa is flattering, kindly let me go. No, sorry, cannot go. This is Kṛṣṇa, you see. But at the same time, gopī-jana-vallava. Yayasi rādhā mādhava gopī-jana-vallava. Kṛṣṇa is, that is Kṛṣṇa's actual life. He is gopī-jana-vallava. He is rādhā mādhava. He is Giri-varadhāra. As soon as the gopīs and the cowards march in distress, He'll uplift this hill, govardhana, Giri-varadhā. That is Kṛṣṇa's life. As the gopīs and the cowards march, and the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana, they have sacrificed everything, they do not know anything but Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa also does not know anything beyond Vṛndāvana. That is Kṛṣṇa. That is bhakti-tasvāmṛta-sindhu.

Just like Kṛṣṇa Himself is expanding Himself as gopas, as cowherds, boys, as cubs and cows and trees in Vṛndāvana, आनंद्र चिन्मय रस अप्रतिभाविताबिता जयोगी। They are all आनंद्र चिन्मय रस.

**Key Quote:** "To understand कृष्णा is not very easy thing, मनुषानाम सहास्तेशु."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the difficulty in understanding Krishna, highlighting Krishna's kindness in providing instructions through the Bhagavad Gita and emphasizing the importance of understanding Krishna through the paramparā (disciplic succession).

So we have to realize these things, what is कृष्णा, that मनुषानाम सहास्तेशु कच्चि जतति सिद्धाम, जतताम भी सिद्धानाम कच्चि वित्ति मांततु. To understand Kṛṣṇa is not very easy thing, मनुषानाम सहास्तेशु. Out of many, many millions who are trying to become successful in the mission of life, मनुषानाम सहास्तेशु कच्चि जतति सिद्धाये, सिद्धाये, सिद्धाये means to become, सिद्धा, means to become ब्रह्म भूत, to understand that I am not this material body, I am ब्रह्मास्तेशु, that is सिद्धि. And जतताम भी सिद्धानाम कच्चि वित्ति मांततु. So out of many शास्तेशु, सिद्धास्तेशु, we have realized पर्मात्मा or ब्रह्मा, out of many such millions of people, one can understand Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is so difficult subject matter. But he is so kind also that he is giving us instruction personally in the form of भगवत गीता, what he is, what he is. He says, मत्तः परतरः नान्या किंचि जस्ति धनन्या। My dear Arjuna, don't labor hard simply that there is something beyond me. Sometimes they say that there is still more beyond कृष्णा, but कृष्णा says, no, there is nothing beyond, मत्तः परतरः नान्या किंचि जस्ति धनन्या। शुत्रे गणायिव, everything is resting on me. अहं सर्वश्य प्रभुगत। The Vedanta says, जन्मा दस्य जताँ। जन्मा स्थिते लौज। Where it is staying, where it is being conducted, that is Brahman. Kṛṣṇa answers this question that अहं सर्वश्य प्रभुगत। He is deceiving Brahman. Therefore Arjuna accepted him. परंब्रम्म परंधम्। We are Brahmas, but we are not परंब्रम्म। परंब्रम्म is Kṛṣṇa. We are आत्मा, but we are not परंब्रम्मात्मा। परंब्रम्मात्मा is Kṛṣṇa. So in this way, मनुष्चा नाम सहर्षेशु कष्चि जतति सिद्धये जततामपि सिद्ध्यान। कष्चि वेत्ति माम। So in this way, we have to understand Kṛṣṇa. एमं परंप्राप्रात्म एमं राजर्षय विदु। We have to understand Kṛṣṇa through the paramparā disciple succession, not by our ABCD knowledge.

### guru, disciple succession, representative of Krishna, respect for guru

**Key Quote:** "We have to understand Kṛṣṇa through the paramparā disciple succession, not by our ABCD knowledge."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of accepting a bona fide spiritual master (guru) who is a representative of Krishna, highlighting the need to respect the guru as Krishna's representative without the guru considering himself Krishna.

That is not possible. One has to accept the disciple succession line. तद्विज्ञान अर्थम्सव गुरुमेव भिगच्छे। That guru, guru means Kṛṣṇa's representative. कृष्णा जय है। शाक्षा धरित्तेन समस्त शास्त्रयि रुप्तस्त तथा भाव्यत एवत सद्धित्यों। शाक्षा धरित्तेन, because guru is representative of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore he should be respected as guru, as Kṛṣṇa. किन्तु प्रवोर्ज्य प्रिय एवत सद्धित्यों। But because a guru is respected as Kṛṣṇa, the guru does not think that he has become Kṛṣṇa. No. That is foolishness. He is the most confidential servant of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, just like most confidential secretary, he acts as the master. His signature, his settlement, he'll be accepted by the master. Similarly, yasya prasādād bhagavata-prasād. Yasya prasādād naga-tī-pṛto. We are to select the right representative of Kṛṣṇa and accept Him as guru. And if I please Him, then Kṛṣṇa will be pleased. There is no need of somebody, they say that Kṛṣṇa is not present, how shall I please Him? No. Kṛṣṇa's representative is present. You please Him. जस्व देवे पराभक्ति जथा देवे तथा गुरोगुरु। This is the process. जथा देवे तथा गुरुगुरु। तश्य इते कति ता जर्चा प्रकाश्म गुरुक्ति। This is the process. आदु गुर्भास्रम्। That is Gosvāmī, Rūpa Gosvāmī giving his, in the Bhakti-rasāmṛta-kṛṣṇa, आदु गुर्भास्रम्। If you are actually interested to understand Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa-bhakti, the first business is आदु गुर्भास्रम्। You take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master who is representative of Kṛṣṇa.

### representative of Krishna, surrender to Krishna, Krishna consciousness, real dharma

**Key Quote:** "If his representative says that he surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, he is representative."
**Summary:** This segment explains how to identify a representative of Krishna, emphasizing that the representative will advocate surrender to Krishna and promote Krishna consciousness, which is the real dharma.

And how we can understand the representative of Kṛṣṇa? And that is not very difficult, because what Kṛṣṇa says, if the representative says the same thing, then he is representative. It is not very difficult. कृष्ण सेज सर्वधन्माण पुरित्तज्य मामेकं सरणं भज्याँ। If his representative says that he surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, he is representative. He does not become himself Kṛṣṇa. That is bogus. A faithful servant will never say that आम ने मास्ता है। I am servant, although he is as good as the master. सिमिलली गुरु ई शक्षा धरित्ते पहनो समस्त शास्त्री उक्तस्तथाभाव्यसौ प्रभुर्जप्रिय एवतृ। He is the most confidential ruse. जो कृपया का शर्मान का विश्वाल रहता है कि वह भूल है। इसका जाना पाए। वह कृपया को कुछ नहीं पहले जाना पाता है किृष्णौ के लिए। प्राप्त का अक्षय प्रबेशन रहता है। गोपी भत्तु पदकमलो दाशो, दाशो, दाशानो दाशा ए गुरु ही जबंपणी या ज्रमण ये होता है हắn लेंưng वे कुछ ऩर्ली आप नहीं का जर्मण स्ट्रिल क्रम करते हैं भी कुछ  Collect. भाग αν आप सर्वेशन का सेक्स्यशन है, सर्वेशन की सर्वेशन और सर्वेशन की सर्वेशन होते पर कुराम प्रार्पंस होना। Backup प्रक्रर्पुतृ, तो आप वह डृपन्तप्राप्तंत होते होंगे, और खत्म की साहत का संधीर होने के लिए ने गुरु, कृष्णा, and the latest गुरु, कृष्णा, because the aim is the same. कृष्णा personally says शर्वधर्मान पुरित्त जम्मामिकं शरुणं भज़ाँ, and who is representative of कृष्णा, he will say the same thing. You surrender to कृष्णा. कृष्णा says मन्मना भवमत भक्त मत जाजि माग नमस्कुरू, the guru will say, yes, you become always कृष्णा conscious. मन्मना. कृष्णा says मन्मना. A guru says you become कृष्णा conscious. The same thing. There is no difference. You become devotee of कृष्णा. You always think of कृष्णा. You always chant of कृष्णा. You always speak of कृष्णा. You do not know anything but कृष्णा. Simply this life is required. So this कृष्णा consciousness movement is teaching people to become कृष्णा, कृष्णा conscious means कृष्णा says मन्मना भव मत भक्त मत जाजि माग नमस्कुरू, the four things. You just become always thinking of कृष्णा. You just become a devotee of कृष्णा. You just offer your obeisances unto कृष्णा and you just worship कृष्णा. And accept कृष्णा, giving up any other engagement. Because real धर्म is to surrender to कृष्णा. Otherwise why कृष्णा says सर्वधर्माल पुरितर्यु. Why he says give up all other so called धर्मास. They are not धर्मास. And the भागवात से धर्म प्रोज्जित कोईत वत्र.

**Key Quote:** "Simply by chanting हरे कृष्ण हरे कृष्ण कृष्ण कृष्ण हरे हरे। You become uncontaminated of this material contamination."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that real dharma is surrendering to Krishna, promoting the Krishna consciousness movement as genuine and easy, especially in this age, and highlighting the power of chanting Hare Krishna to become free from material contamination and return to God.

The cheating type of धर्म is kicked out from this भागवात. Cheating type. Real धर्म, what is that? Real धर्म. धर्मं तुषाप्षाद भगवत्र नेख़ाँ. What भागवान says सर्वधर्माल पुरितर्यु मामे कमुष्णा. This is real धर्म. So we request everyone. It is very scientific. It is authorized. We are not talking nonsense. Authorized. We are taking the version of कृष्णा. We are taking the version of the वेदि कंक्रूशन्त्. वेदा इष्ट शर्वई अहमेव वेद्या. वेदा, study of वेदा means to understand कृष्णा. One who does not understand कृष्णा, he is simply wasting his time. धर्म शनु स्थितप्पंश विश्यक्षेण कथासु जत। नुत्पादय दृतिं जदि स्रमय वहिके। You can execute your धर्म, your occupational duty, very nicely. That's all right. But if you do not develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you are simply wasting your time and working hard for nothing. This is the part. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is very genuine and it is very easy, especially in this age. That is also authorized statement of Śrūadeva Gosvāmī. कीतनादेव कृष्णस्य मुख्यसंग पढ़ंबजेत। He has described, because in this age, in this age it is called कलीजूप। There are so many impediments. People are fallen. मन्दाश मन्द मतयु मन्द भाग्या जुपद्रता। They are disturbed. So many botheration. It is very difficult to realize Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But there is very shortcut way recommended. कीतनादेव कृष्णस्य मुख्यसंग पढ़ंबजेत। Simply by chanting हरे कृष्ण हरे कृष्ण कृष्ण कृष्ण हरे हरे। हरे नाम हरे नाम राम राम हरे हरे। You become uncontaminated of this material contamination. And thus being free from material contamination, you become eligible to go back to home, back to God.

## Srila Gaura Kishora Dasa Babaji | Special Discourse on Disappearance Day

**Key Quote:** "After the demise of his wife Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj left the country, left his business and went to Vrindavan."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada narrates the early life and renunciation of Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj, including his time in Vrindavan and Navadvipa Dham.

Today is the most auspicious disappearance day anniversary of one of the previous acharyas in our Sampradaya, His Divine Grace Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj. So, a brief biography of Srila Gaur Kishodas, let us hear, and by his blessings, we will be able to advance in our Krishna consciousness by trying to follow some of the instructions that he has very nicely given us. Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj appeared sometime in the 1830s in the village of Vagyana in East Bengal, or Vagyana in East Bengal, which is what is now known as Bangladesh. During his boyhood, his mother and father arranged a marriage for him, and he remained in household affairs for more than 20 years. While a householder, he worked as a broker in the grain business, but even at that time, he exhibited his spirituality. After the demise of his wife, Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj left the country, left his business, and went to Vrindavan. There he approached Srila Bhagavad Das Babaji, one of the foremost disciples of Srila Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj, and accepted from Bhagavad Das Babaji Maharaj the traditional Paramahamsa Vaishnava Babaji dress. After this, he became completely renounced and would stay under trees in various parts of the forest of the 168 mile Vraja Mandala or Vrindavan area. He continuously acted thus for a period of approximately 30 years. During this time, he would sometimes travel to the holy places of pilgrimage in northern and western India. Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj became very famous among the great devotees of Vrindavan and was awarded the appropriate title of Bhajananandi. Bhajananandi means one who is dedicated to remain in one place and chant the holy name of the Supreme Lord and completely absorb themselves in the chanting and hearing of the holy name of the Supreme Lord, but we should not try to imitate such great devotees; rather, we should accept the instructions of our spiritual master and try to follow those instructions in our practical life while hearing the great qualities of our spiritual master and the previous Acharyas and their great deeds of devotion and service dedicated entirely for the pleasure of the Supreme Lord. Even though he received such honor, he never endeavored for even a small bit of material sense gratification and totally disapproved of the secret material desires of pseudo-renunciants and so many people who try to imitate great devotees, and prematurely they try to renounce this world, but it is not very easy to maintain the standard of renunciation exhibited by such paramahamsas as Sri Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj. He would perform his pure unalloyed devotional pastimes alone in a profound devotional mood. In the year 1897, during the month of Falgunna, when he was in his sixties, Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj proceeded to Navadvipa Dham from Vrindavan Dham, and under the instruction, he did this under the instruction of Srila Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj. From this time until his disappearance, Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj remained in Navadvipa Dham and in different villages

**Key Quote:** "These are considered totally impure but a renunciant has nothing to do with purity and impurity of this world."
**Summary:** This segment describes Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj's extreme renunciation and detachment from material possessions, highlighting his acceptance of things considered impure by others.

he was visiting the various places of pastimes of Lord Gauranga, and he was realizing the non-difference between Navadvipa Dham and Vrindavan Dham. He begged by gathering dry foodstuff from the householders of the holy Dham. He would sometimes offer these foodstuffs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead by simply holding them in his hand. He was totally renounced, so he didn't have any elaborate arrangements for offering or cooking or anything like that. In order to cook, he would collect dry wood from the footpath, and he would wash earthen pots discarded by the villagers along the roadside near the Ganges River on the occasion of eclipses. These are considered totally impure, but a renunciant has nothing to do with purity and impurity of this world. Just he would take something of no value to others, and somehow with those bare minimum things, he would maintain himself. This would actually ensure that such great devotees are never entangled in any material endeavors. They save time, maximum amount of time, for their spiritual activities exclusively. In order to clothe himself, he would go to the shore of the Ganges and collect and wash discarded cloth that had been used to cover dead bodies at the burning heart. This was his level of renunciation. Thus, he always remained independent of the support of others simply by utilizing items of no value to others.

**Summary:** This segment explains Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj's relationship with Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur and Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur, clarifying their roles in the disciplic succession leading to Srila Prabhupada.

In such a manner, he obtained the practical necessities of life. In 1897, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur constructed his place of bhajana on the bank of the Saraswati River at Godurma Dvipa, one of the nine islands in Navadvipa, called Svananda Sukhada Kunja. This is the name Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur gave to that building he constructed. This was a gathering place for exalted souls, for great devotees. Here, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur recited and explained the Srimad Bhagavatam and other topics regarding the conclusion of devotional service, and Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj would come and hear these talks with great delight. In this way, Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj accepted Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur as his shiksha guru. Also, Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj accepted Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur as his only disciple. That's how you see in our parampara, His divine grace, A.C. Bhaktivinoda Swami Prabhupada, the founder Acharya of ISKCON. His guru is Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur. His guru is Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj, and His shiksha guru is Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur. This is the parampara in which Srila Prabhupada, the founder Acharya of ISKCON, is coming. So Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj is the spiritual master of the spiritual master

of Srila Prabhupada. His only possessions, if at all you may consider them as possessions, were the Tulsi beads he wore around his neck, this Kanti Mala, and the Tulsi Mala he kept in his hand for counting his rounds. His Kanti Mala and his Japa Mala were his only two possessions. He also kept a few books such as Narottam Das Thakur's Prarthana and Prema Bhakti Chandrika. These are two famous books, books written by Narottam Das Thakur, contains a collection of the songs he has composed explaining the pure devotional service. Even though it appeared that Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj was not a learned Sanskrit scholar, still the purport and conclusions of all scriptures were luminous in his heart and character. It is described in the scriptures that chanting of the holy name reveals all transcendental knowledge within the heart, and this is practically seen in the life of Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj. He knew all the conclusions of the scriptures without studying them separately. That is because his chanting was pure. We should not imitate this. It was never possible for anyone to serve him, for he was never willing to accept any kind of service from any person. He exhibited the highest standard of devotion to the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna, and because of his exemplary character, he was recognized as the personification of the deepest degree of separation from Lord Sri Krishna, Vipralamba Seva, service in separation from Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Whoever eats fish is like a prostitute. These are harsh words but then they are required to cut through the several layers of illusion that is clouding the consciousness of our condition so."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada narrates an incident where Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj refuses sweets offered by a lawyer, emphasizing the importance of purity and devotion in offerings to the Lord.

This is what is taught by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, especially in our Gaudiya Vaishnava Sampradaya, because in separation from Krishna, one feels intense mood of service to Krishna, not as much as when one is in the presence of Krishna. It is more intense than in the presence of Krishna. In separation from Krishna, one is able to serve with more intensity Krishna, with that intense feeling of devotion towards Krishna. There are many incidents recorded by biographers about his preaching. Even though he is called a bhajananandi, he would not travel and actively preach, but anybody approached him for getting guidance, for getting some practical instructions, he was ever willing to give them his divine association. So I will just mention one or two such incidents which are very instructive for all of us. Once a lawyer by name Bhattacharya brought several sweets and prayerfully requested Srila Gautishwada's Babaji Maharaj to accept his offering. Srila Babaji Maharaj told him, "I never take any sweets." So then Bhattacharya replied, "There is nothing higher than accepting food that the Lord has directly accepted," indicating thereby that it is Prasadam. "Why are you refusing Prasadam?" So then Srila Babaji Maharaj, Gautishwada's Babaji Maharaj, sharply retorted, "Whoever eats fish is like a prostitute." These are harsh words, but then they are required to cut through the several layers of illusion that is clouding the consciousness of our condition. So if someone has perverted desires and offers foodstuffs to Lord Chaitanya, these preparations can never be accepted

as the Prasad of the Supreme Lord because the Lord does not partake of them. What does Krishna say in the Bhagavad Gita? Yome Bhaktya Prayacchati Patram Pushpam Phalam Toyam Yome Bhaktya Prayacchati. The important aspect of the offering, more than the item itself, is the devotion with which that offering is made. So Krishna, what does he want when we offer? He wants devotion. He wants Bhakti. So somebody is having lusty desires in his heart and then makes a show of offering, that is not accepted by Krishna. To offer foodstuffs to the Supreme Lord that have been contaminated by one's lusty desire should be considered a great offense. That means it is against our devotional interest. If one accepts the grains of a sinful person, then his mind becomes impure. This is very important for all of us that why do we say eat only Prasadam, don't eat food that is not offered to Krishna because we do not know sometimes the source of such food could be, if it is not properly offered to Krishna, then it could be from the sinful person, and then that contaminates our mind, so we should be very careful not to accept anything which is not Prasadam properly offered to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "When one eats food offered by a materialistic man, one's mind becomes contaminated and when the mind becomes contaminated one is unable to think of Krishna properly."
**Summary:** This segment continues the discussion on purity, emphasizing the importance of avoiding food cooked by lustful persons and the contamination of the mind that results from it.

Thus one is directed by Babaji Maharaj not to accept food cooked by lustful persons, especially by those who know the actual standard of behavior expected of devotees of Sri Krishna, but who nevertheless indulge knowingly in illicit activities. So this is very, very important for us to remember, knowingly one should never indulge in sinful activities, at the same time perform devotional service, especially offering of food stuff to the Supreme Lord. Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu instructed Srila Swaroop Damodar Goswami as follows: when one eats food offered by a materialistic man, one's mind becomes contaminated, and when the mind becomes contaminated, one is unable to think of Krishna properly. Contaminated mind is not conducive for any form of devotional service, our practice becomes obstructed. Srila Gaukishodas Babaji Maharaj always gave beneficial instructions to persons who approached him with faith and humility, no matter what their spiritual status might have been. On one such occasion, a seeker went to Babaji Maharaj to hear topics concerning the Supreme Lord, but he heard some harsh words from him instead. The seeker therefore resolved, sorry, the seeker therefore resolved never again to go near Babaji Maharaj because he was feeling hurt by the harsh words spoken by Gaukishodas Babaji Maharaj.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada narrates another incident where a seeker is corrected by Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj for avoiding the association of devotees due to harsh words.

after some time, however, when he was very much distressed in his mind, he decided to go and see Babaji Maharaj. So Srila Gaukishodas Babaji Maharaj could immediately understand the reason for the depression of this particular seeker, and he told him, "You have left the association of devotees where topics about Krishna are discussed, and now you are living in a secluded place performing solitary worship of Krishna. When one hears the topic of Supreme Lord in the company of devotees, then one becomes freed from Maya's net of illusion, but if someone performs worship of the Lord in a secluded place, not in the association of devotees, one becomes caught by the material illusory energy of the Lord. As a consequence, instead of topics about the Supreme Lord possessing the heart, mundane subject matters will occupy the heart." The seeker replied, "I thought it better to reside in a secluded place and perform my own individual worship than to become disturbed by hearing the sharp words of a sadhu." He thought, "If I remain with a sadhu and the sadhu speaks very harsh words, then my mind will always be disturbed. I can peacefully go to some other place and do my own worship and be nicely situated to do devotional service." So Babaji Maharaj replied, "Please take note that these sadhus who speak sharp words to drive away the witch of the illusory energy are actually the only real devotees of Krishna and friends of the living entities. When a devotee of the Lord who is always desirous of the living entity's ultimate welfare chastises him just once with instructions meant to drive away maya, then that living being immediately makes plans to leave the saintly persons for his entire life.

**Key Quote:** "Then you must accept the harsh language of the sadhu as the medicine by which maya can be given up."
**Summary:** This segment explains that the harsh words of a sadhu are like medicine, meant to cure one of illusion, and should be accepted for spiritual advancement.

if you actually want to perform devotional service properly, then you must accept the harsh language of the sadhu as the medicine by which maya can be given up. It's just like when a doctor prescribes a medicine, even if it is bitter, you take it because you know that only by taking the proper medicine, even if it is bitter, it will cure you of your ailment or disease. So you should not look for something that is tasting sweet when it comes to taking medicine. Similarly, the harsh words of a sadhu may sound very, very hurting, but actually they are meant simply to pull you out of illusion, which is the purpose of your doing devotional service. By this, one can obtain the necessary spiritual advancement to successfully chant the holy name of the Supreme Lord. Then another instance, one other person, he inquired from Srila Gaurakeshwara's Babaji Maharaj as follows. He said, "We see that there are many Vaishnavas living with their wives who perform devotional service to Lord Hari. Will they get any benefit from such service?" Srila Babaji Maharaj replied, "The living entity is the eternal servant of Lord Krishna, but when the conditioned soul looks upon his wife and son simply by seeing their material external forms, then one does not have the eye of devotion, and he can never perceive his real identity as the eternal servant of Krishna. The conditioned souls always have inclination to enjoy their wives and children, that's natural, and they don't like to hear so much the topics of the Supreme Lord or to get association of the Lord's devotees.

**Key Quote:** "The living entity is the eternal servant of lord Krishna, but when the conditioned soul looks upon his wife and son simply by seeing their material external forms then one does not have the eye of devotion."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the challenges of family life and devotional service, contrasting genuine Vaishnavas with those who exhibit 'monkey renunciation' (external detachment without inner purity).

if one does not attain the spiritual energy given by chanting the holy name, then one will become attracted by his wife and children. Then again, there are other persons who externally want to detach themselves from their wives and children and sense enjoyment, but they don't have any kind of external renunciation without actually having that detachment within the heart is like the renunciation of monkeys, markata vairagya, this is what it's called. And although they externally live away from their possessions, but their heart is dirty, the heart is not clean. So what is the characteristic of a monkey? A monkey lives naked, so it doesn't even have a piece of cloth, it doesn't have a proper house, it lives simply on the ground, it lives on the ground. So the monkey has the desire to enjoy so many female monkeys, not just one, every male monkey will have so many male monkeys as a devotee or an ancient should reflect the inner detachment or should at least aim it also simultaneously strenuously trying for detachment from within the heart. The genuine vaishnava will never maintain an attitude of sense gratification towards his wife and children, but he will always regard himself. Those actually desirous of performing Haribhajana, but in whose heart the weeds of material desires grow and were unable to give up excessive attachment of their wife and children, should always try to hear from pure devotees and chant Hare Krishna and perform congregational chanting. Instead of leaving their family and going away to a secluded place, one should actually engage in such activities even while remaining in family life. In this way, they can quickly become detached from the inclination to enjoy materially. Then they will gradually realize that if one completely surrenders to Krishna, then one will attain all the qualities of life. This is called auspiciousness. As long as one remains in bodily consciousness, one cannot obtain the mercy of Krishna.

**Summary:** This segment describes the events surrounding Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj's passing away and the controversy that arose regarding the location of his samadhi due to material motives.

So in this way, Gaur Kishore das Babaji Maharaj taught what is real renunciation because he himself was a real renunciate. Then regarding his passing away, on November 16, 1915, Gaur Kishore das Babaji Maharaj entered the eternal pastimes of the Lord, Nitya Leela Pravishta. That means he passed away from this world. That day at sunrise, his disciple Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur left Sri Mayapur for the place where Srila Bhaktisiddhanta, sorry, Gaur Kishore das Babaji Maharaj had been staying in a place at Kuliyam. The head priest of Navadvipa's various temples and ashrams began to argue where would Babaji Maharaj's samadhi be made, the actual place. So there was a heated argument among so many different people. So because there was a material motive, whoever got the opportunity to prepare the samadhi of this great Paramahamsa, Srila Gaur Kishore das Babaji Maharaj, they would have huge number of people visit their temple and get handsomely from the pilgrims. So with this material motive, there was so much of argument. So Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur could understand their material motive, and he wanted to actually stop them from simply creating a controversy. Now, not only Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur wanted to avoid the controversy, but even the Navadvipa's inspector of police, whose name was Jathindra Sinha at that time, he arrived at that place apprehending some breach of peace.

**Summary:** This segment narrates how Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur asserted his right to prepare Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj's samadhi by challenging the purity of other claimants, ultimately establishing his position as the true disciple.

So after much discussions, the other Vaishnavas who were running different ashrams and mats, they stated their position to the inspector. That Saraswati Thakur is not a sannyasi. He has no right to prepare a samadhi for a person who is completely renounced. Hearing their pronouncement, Saraswati Thakur replied in a voice like thunder, "I am the sole disciple of Paramahamsa Srila Gaurakeshwara das Babaji Maharaj. Even though I have not accepted sannyas, I am a celibate brahmachari, and by the grace of Babaji Maharaj, I am not hypocritical, renunciant, addicted to abominable habits." So he put a challenge for those people who within the last one year or six months or three months or just even one month or even three days has not indulged in illicit association with women will be able to touch the spiritually blissful body of Srila Gaurakeshwara das Babaji Maharaj. If anyone else touches the body, he will be completely ruined. Hearing these words, the inspector of police asked Srila Saraswati Thakur, "How will evidence for this be produced?" So Saraswati Thakur replied, "I will believe whatever they say. Let them just tell it. That's all." After this challenge is offered, all the other Babaji's, they turned their backs and went away one by one. That means they all accepted that they were not leading a pure life. The inspector was dumbfounded. Then, Srila Bhaktisiddhan Saraswati Thakur actually prepared a nice samadhi and laid to rest the blissful transcendental body of Srila Gaurakeshwara das Babaji Maharaj. So let us end this presentation with the prayer to Srila Gaurakeshwara das Babaji Maharaj. Namo Gaurakeshwaraya Sakshad Vairagya Murtaye Vipralambhara Sambhode Padambhu Jayate Namaha. The meaning is, I offer my respectful obeisances unto Srila Gaurakeshwara das Babaji Maharaj, the spiritual master of Srila Bhaktisiddhan Saraswati Thakur, whose renunciation personified, Sakshad Vairagya Murti, he is always merged in a feeling of separation from an intense love of Krishna.

That does not mean that just because he is born, he will become a lawyer. He has to train him. And that is what Krishna consciousness movement is doing. And when you become a Vaishnava, even karma you cross, you will be able to do work which is not even your nature. If that work is for Krishna, you will transcend even karma. We do not care. Your birth is Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra, we do not care. Come surrender to Krishna and develop Vaishnava culture, Brahmanical culture.

**Summary:** This segment narrates how the three brothers settled in Malda, became attractive figures in society, and were eventually pressured by Nawab Hussain Shah to become ministers.

After Kumara Deva had died, these three brothers came over and settled here at Malda, where they continued with their studies. As they grew up, they became exceptionally attractive to all of the society. They possessed beautiful bodily features, noble character and natural compassion towards every living being. They were embodiments of the Lord's love. These three brothers studied the science of logic, Nyaya, and the knowledge of the divine. They were also the descendants of Madhusudana Vachaspati, who was the brother of Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya. They also became proficient in Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian. When Sanatana Goswami was very young, he saw a dream in which a Brahmin gave him a copy of Srimad Bhagavatam. The next day, to his surprise, he indeed received Srimad Bhagavatam. From then on, Shri Sanatana began scrutinizingly studying Srimad Bhagavatam, leaving aside all other scriptures. Bengal, during that time, was under the Mughal rule of Nawab Hussain Shah. He is the same king who had employed Shri Mukunda Dasa of Shrikhanda as his personal doctor. Seeing the popularity of Shri Rupa and Sanatana amongst the great general populace, the Nawab decided to employ them as his ministers. In this way, he planned to bring the entire Hindu population under his control. If Rupa and Sanatana joined him, then his subjects would become more submissive, he thought. On the other hand, he notified Shri Rupa and Sanatana, telling them that if they became the ministers, he would award the Vaishnavas and Hindus with all freedom. Instead, if they did not accept his proposal, then he would torture and prosecute the masses.

Due to their close proximity with the Muslims, the two brothers were excommunicated from the Hindu society by the orthodox caste Brahmins of Gaur Mandala. Thus, Shri Rupa Goswami came to be known as Dabarkhas and Shri Sanatana as Sakaramalik. The king grew very fond of them and considered them his own brothers. He awarded them with tremendous amounts of wealth and power. They settled down here at Ramkeli in Malda, where they constructed beautiful opulent palaces and gardens that served as a replica of Vruddhavan. Being pure devotees, Rupa and Sanatana always lived in the mood of separation from the Lord and his abode. Here at Ramkeli, the beautiful temples and ponds dug by our Goswamis are still present. The beautiful deity of Shri Madana Mohana that was installed by them over here continues to accept our humble services till this day.

**Summary:** This segment highlights the Goswamis' humility and hospitality, and describes Lord Chaitanya's visit to Ramkeli, where he attracted a large crowd and immersed them in ecstatic devotion.

They held the highest post in the government as they were very rich, yet the Goswamis did not possess even a grain of pride. People, scholars, Vaishnavas from all parts of the country would come to meet them and they would worship them with most intimate hospitality. Their humility and simplicity captured people's heart. There was a beautiful piece of architecture that we came across while visiting. This marvelous victory tower known as Firoz Minar is more than 26 meters in height. According to reliable sources, this tower was engineered by Sanatan Goswami while he served as Bengal Gov. Lord Chaitanya, during his second attempt to reach Vruddhavan, decided to take a roundabout route. Actually, his desire was not travelling to Vruddhavan, but instead he wanted to meet and shower his mercy upon Sri Rupa and Sanatana. Thousands of men accompanied the Lord during his journey. All of them were surcharged with deep ecstatic feelings, completely devoid of external consciousness and surrendering themselves completely. They sang and danced along. An ocean of love flooded the people with waves after waves of ecstasy. As the procession reached new places, more people joined. Wherever the Lord touched the ground with his lotus feet, people immediately gathered to take the dust. The people took out so much dirt that holes were created in the ground. Just by seeing the smiling face of the Lord, all their lamentations and unhappinesses became vanquished. Eventually, the Lord arrived at Ramkeli, where innumerable people arrived to take his darshan.

**Summary:** This segment details Nawab Hussain Shah's reaction to Lord Chaitanya's popularity, Keshava Chhatri's diplomatic response, and Rupa Goswami's glorification of Chaitanya as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Performing Sankirtana over here, the Lord danced and sometimes lost his consciousness out of intense love of God. When Nawab Hussain Shah came to know that Lord Chaitanya was attracting so much attention, he was astonished. His spies informed him how Mahaprabhu had immersed everyone in a wave of transcendental ecstasy. He learned how the people, irrespective of their caste, creed or religion, were raising their hands and engaging in the congregational chanting of Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. So the Nawab then asked Keshava Chhatri whether he knew anything about Lord Chaitanya. Keshava, in spite of knowing everything, tried to diplomatically downplay the situation. He replied that Chaitanya Deva was simply a touring mendicant and that only a few people had come to see him. He warned the King against considering the advice of his spies too seriously. After pacifying the King in this way, Keshava sent a Brahmana messenger to Lord Chaitanya, requesting him to leave without delay. The King then inquired from Rupa Goswami Dabarkas and asked his opinion. Rupa Goswami glorified Sri Chaitanya and revealed that he was none other than the Supreme Personality of God and Himself. He added that it was the Nawab's great fortune that the Lord has chosen to descend and manifest his pastime in this country. It was only by Mahaprabhu's mercy that the Nawab was enlightened. The Nawab was successful and victorious in all his affairs. The Nawab agreed with Rupa Goswami and remarked that he would perceive in his mind as well that Lord Chaitanya was none other than his worshipable God.

Raja kahe suno suna mora mane ye laya sakshadi saraiha nahika samshayam chaitany chaitam tata. Sri Rupa and Sanatana then began considering how they could meet Lord Chaitanya incognito. Thus, in the dead of the night, the two brothers went to meet the Lord. First, they met Nityananda Prabhu and Haridas Dhaka who introduced them to Sri Gaurahari. Out of great humility, the two brothers held straw between their teeth and fell down like a rod before Mahaprabhu. They were so overwhelmed that they began crying in joy. They introduced themselves as the lowest of men who were employed in the worst kind of employment. They glorified the Lord as Patitapavana, the deliverer of the fallen, and assured him that none in the world qualified as being more fallen than them. Out of sheer humility, they declared themselves millions of times more fallen than even Jagai and Madai, the sinful brothers whom Lord Chaitanya had previously delivered. Jagai and Madai are millions of times more virtuous. Adhamma and Patita are sinners. We are two people. Thus, they tried to establish themselves as the befitting candidates upon which Lord Chaitanya should shower his costless mercy. Hearing their prayers, Lord Chaitanya became very pleased and blessed them wholeheartedly. He then revealed that the two brothers were his eternal servants. Mahaprabhu also informed them that he had received several of their letters, which reflected their humble state of mind and consciousness. He accepted them and awarded them the name Rupa unto Dhabi's caste and Sanatana unto Sakara-Malik.

**Summary:** This segment describes Lord Chaitanya assuring Rupa and Sanatana of his protection, their advice for him to leave Ramkeli, and his subsequent departure, followed by his disclosure of his mercy to his associates in Puri.

The Lord also revealed that he had come to Ramkali only to meet and bless the two of them. He assured them of his protection and asked them not to worry. He added that they would be delivered very soon. The two brothers then sought the blessings of the Vaishnava's presence. Before leaving, however, they humbly cautioned the Lord that although the nabob was favorable at that moment, his mood was unpredictable. By nature, the nabob was a very dangerous and a very violent man. Hence, they suggested that it would be better if Mahaprabhu departed from that place without further delay. They also added that it would not be very appropriate for Mahaprabhu to travel to Vrindavan, accompanying such thousands of followers. Instead, it would be more befitting if Mahaprabhu went alone, accompanied by a select few. Having spoken thus, the two brothers offered prayers unto the lotus feet of the Lord and returned to their homes. Although Sri Chaitanya was the Supreme Lord himself, yet he acted like a mere human. In order to teach us neophytes how to react in such situations, heeding the advice of Rupa and Sanatana, he decided to leave that village. In the morning, he left for a place called Kanenaarsala, where he relished many past times of Lord Krishna. Then, thinking about the words of Sanatana, Mahaprabhu concluded that it would indeed not be proper to travel to Vrindavan with so many followers as it might disturb the atmosphere of the dhamma. Thus, he decided to return to Jagannath Puri. On returning to Puri, the Lord disclosed to his intimate associates

how he had bestowed his most intimate mercy upon Rupa and Sanatana, owing to their humility and pure devotional qualities. Rupa Goswami took all his treasures and loaded them into a boat. He and his younger brother, Anupama, left for their ancestral home at Fateh Bar, presently in Bangladesh, where they distributed all their wealth. He appointed a brahmana to perform auspicious ceremonies so that they might obtain the shelter of Mahaprabhu. Of his wealth, he gave 50% charity to the brahmanas and Vaishnavas and 25% to his relatives. Srila Prabhupada highly glorifies and hails this as a perfect example of how one should divide his money and retire from one's household life. He also deposited 10,000 gold coins with a grocer in order to help Sanatana Goswami to escape. Sri Rupa Goswami kept one-fourth of his wealth aside with a respectable brahmana for his personal safety and emergencies. Srila Rupa Goswami then set out with two men to find out where Mahaprabhu was, when Mahaprabhu would be leaving for Vrindavan from Jagannath Puri. The men came back with news that Lord Chaitanya had already left. Sri Rupa immediately wrote a letter to Sanatana Goswami informing him of the news.

In the assembly of devotees, Nawab Hussain Shah came to his residence to enquire about Sanatana's health as he thought he was sick. Seeing that he was perfectly fit, the Nawab asked Sanatana to assist him in attacking the province of Orissa. Sanatana Goswami refused to obey the order of the king and expressed his desire to retire from service instead. The king became enraged and ordered Sanatana's arrest. Using the money that Rupa Goswami had kept for him, Sanatana Goswami managed to bribe the jailer and somehow escaped. The jailer was initially reluctant to release him, but 7,000 gold coins were enough to change his position. On being released, Sanatana immediately crossed over the Ganges and fled. He passed through hilly terrains and spent the night at a small hotel on his way to Benares. The hotel owner, knowing that Sanatana's servant Isha had eight gold coins in his possession, wanted to murder both of them and take away the money. However, Isha could guess the evil plans of the hotel owner and voluntarily offered him the coins and sought his help to safely reach his destination. Thus, the owner helped them cross the hilly track and proceed towards Varanasi.

Both Rupa and Sanatana travelled extensively through Vraja Mandala, discovering many pastimes, places of Radha Madhava. Having no fixed residence, they would catch a few winks of sleep, no more than one and a half hours per day, under a tree or bush. They used to live by whatever little they obtained, by performing Madhukari, begging from door to door. Shri Rupa and Sanatana spent all their time writing, discussing Krishna pastimes, and chanting Krishna's holy names. Shri Rupa Goswami established the worship of Shri Radha Govinda Dev in Vrindavan, while Shri Sanatana inaugurated the worship of Shri Madan Mohana. Both of these enchanting deities are currently being worshipped in Rajasthan. So the different things we see in Ramkeli here are the temples. That is this temple where we are sitting. That is Radha Madan Mohan Deity, established by Rupa and Sanatana. We also have Balarama and Revati. And they also established Chaitanya. Three Deities of the Pancha Tattva. Pancha Tattva have five personalities, but installed three personalities here: Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in the middle, Nityananda on the left, and Advaita on the right. So three personalities they installed here. There is this Keli Kadamba tree, under which Chaitanya Mahaprabhu met Rupa and Sanatana. And there is a small temple and the entrance of Govinda Hari's lotus feet. There is Rupa Sagar, a large pond excavated by Sri Rupa Goswami.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Bhagavad-gita is a mystery that can only be understood by devotees, not by those with superficial interpretations.

This is a very important verse to understand Bhagavad-gītā. By rascal interpretation, you cannot understand what is Bhagavad-gītā. It is a mystery, rahāsyam, mysterious. Only a devotee... who is in intimate relation with Kṛṣṇa, he can understand. That is clearly stated here. When Kṛṣṇa was speaking Bhagavad-gītā to Arjuna, it was in the battlefield. It is not a parlor, discussing, smoking and discussing business. No. It is not like that. Very serious, in the battlefield. And Kṛṣṇa selected Arjuna. At that time, when Kṛṣṇa was present, there were very, very great learned scholars. Even Vyāsadeva was present there, the Veda-vyāsa, and many others. Asita, Devaloka, great, great saintly persons and saints. Rājarṣis. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was rājarṣi because in the previous verse he says, evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ. So why he selected Arjuna? He was a military man. He was not a Vedāntist. A military man is not supposed to become a Vedāntist, very great sannyāsī. No. Because the so-called Vedāntists, they cannot understand Bhagavad-gītā. It is not possible. It is a mystery. Kṛṣṇa in other places says, nāhaṁ prakāśa-sarvasya-yoga-māyā-samābhṛtaḥ. I cannot be exposed to anyone. Yoga-māyā-samābhṛtaḥ. Therefore those who are fools, rascals, they consider Kṛṣṇa as fictitious, Kṛṣṇa as a human being, Kṛṣṇa as a historical person, or there was no Kṛṣṇa, it is an imaginary writing. Because these rascals, they cannot understand. Unless one is a bona fide devotee and intimately related with Kṛṣṇa,

**Summary:** The speaker explains that hearing about Krishna is the beginning of bhakti, and discusses the Vedic principles, the relationship with God, and Krishna as the original father.

tan manye adhitaṁ uttamaṁ. This is the statement of Prahlāda Mahārāja. These are the bhakti process. If one wants to become bhakta, then he must begin with śravaṇaṁ. Just like you have kindly come here to hear about Kṛṣṇa. This is the beginning of bhakti. Unless you hear about the Supreme Person, that is Vedic process, śruti. Śruti. Veda is known as śruti. Śruti-śmiti-pūrānādi-pāñcarātrika-vidhiṁ vinā ahikāntaki harer bhakti utpātāya-vakalpataḥ. If one does not follow the principle, Vedic principle, smṛti, the Vedic corollaries, smṛti means literature which is written according to Vedic principle. That is called smṛti. And śruti means the Vedas. Bhaktā-śrūta-gṛhitaya. Śrūta-gṛhitaya. Śrūta-gṛhitās are two meanings: by hearing or through the Vedic literature. Through the Vedic literature, only bhaktis. There are three kinds of departmental study in the Vedas. First thing is sambandha. Sambandha means what is my relationship with God. This is stated there. In the Vedānta it is said, janmādy asya yataḥ. The absolute truth is that from whom everything is generated. So everything amongst everything I am also. You are also. So you are also coming from that supreme absolute truth. Kṛṣṇa says, mam evāṁśa jīva-bhūtaḥ. All these living entities, sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya, in every species, any form of life, saṁyavanti-mūrtaḥ, as many forms are there, not only human being, the animals. The trees, the birds, the aquatics, the insects, everyone, all living entities. Kṛṣṇa says, sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya saṁyavanti-mūrtaḥ. In any species of life, as many forms are there, ahaṁ vija-pradabhitāḥ. I am their original father. Vija-pradabhitāḥ, seed-giving father. So as father places the seeds within the womb of the mother, similarly the material nature is the mother, and Kṛṣṇa is the father. Kṛṣṇa impregnates the material nature, and we come out in different forms.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the different forms of life and explains that the human form of life provides the opportunity to understand God.

Seda-ya, udvija, and jarā-yuja, and anda-ya. Seda-ya means by perspiration, through perspiration. That is like bed bugs. Bed bugs, because if you keep your bed nasty, do not keep it very clean, then by your perspiration there is generation of these bed bugs. They are called seda-ya, by perspiration. And anda-ya, through the eggs, just like the birds, the living entities coming through the eggs. That is called anda-ya. Seda-ya, anda-ya, jarā-yuja, embryo. Just like we are coming from the embryo, anda-ya, jarā-yuja, and udvija. Coming from the seeds, the trees, plants. So within these four groups, all different living entities are coming. So by gradual evolution we are coming to the human form of life. So in the human form of life, here there is a prerogative, there is a chance to know what is God.

And what is my relationship with Him. That is called sambandha-jñāna. Sambandha-avideya. Then execution of the duty. Just like sambandha, we can understand, an unmarried girl, an unmarried boy, there is first of all sambandha. The father-mother makes the relationship. Then there is function between husband and wife. That is called avideya. And why? No, because there is a necessity. What is that? To get children. Sambandha, avideya, preya-ja. Preya-ja. Every sambandha, every relationship is made, every action is done with the aim, the goal, the preya-ja. So Vedic literature means sambandha, avideya and preya-ja. That is to be studied in the human form of life. Vedaisya sarvair aham eva vedyam. To study Vedas means to understand what is my relationship, what is Kṛṣṇa, what I am, and what is my relationship, and how to act in that relationship, and what is the aim of life.

The aim of life is to go back to home, back to garden. That is aim of life. We are fallen in this material condition of life. You are suffering. But we do not know. We are so full, just like animal. We do not know what is the aim of life. Aim of life, that is also described in the Bhagavad-gītā. Jarma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-dūśānudarśanam. When we can understand that this process of repetition of birth, death, old age and disease, this is not wanted by me, nobody wants to die, but the death is forced upon him. He does not think that this is my problem. I do not want to die, but death is as sure as anything. So this is the problem. Nobody is careful how to solve this problem. They are simply engaged in the, I mean to say, temporary problems. The temporary problems are not problems. Real problem is how to stop death, how to stop birth, how to stop old age and how to stop disease. That is real problem.

That can be done when you are liberated from this material world. This is our problem. So Kṛṣṇa comes here again. Yadā yadā hi dharmasya jñāni bhavati bhārata. Dharmasya jñāni. Jñāni means when it is distorted. So people are manufacturing in the name of so-called religion. This is our religion, this is Hindu religion, this is Muslim religion, this is Christian religion, this is Buddha religion, and this is Sikh religion, this is that religion, that religion. They have manufactured so many religions, so many religions. But real religion is dharmanta-sākṣād bhagavat-pranam. Religion means the codes and the laws given by the Lord, given by God. That is religion. Simple definition of religion is dharmanta-sākṣād bhagavat-pranetam. Just like law is given by the state, by the government. You cannot manufacture law. I have repeatedly said. Law is made by the government. Similarly, religion is made by God. If you accept God's religion, then that is religion. And what is God's religion? If you stand, you can stand here. Other people are sitting. God's religion is, you'll find in the Bhagavad-gītā, sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.

**Summary:** The speaker advocates surrendering to God, becoming a devotee, and chanting Hare Krishna, especially in this age.

This is God's religion. You give up all this nonsense religion. You become a devotee, a surrendered soul unto Me. That is the religion. One who does not know what is God, one who does not know how to surrender to Him, he is not religious. Any religion without the conception of God, without knowledge of God, without knowing the surrendering process, that is called, described in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam as cheating religion, dharma-projjhita-kaitava-atra. The so-called religious system, which is cheating only, that kind of religion is completely thrown away, kicked out. Because religion means to develop your dormant love for God or to execute the laws of God. That is it. The laws of God is, Kṛṣṇa says, sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja. And how to achieve that? That also Kṛṣṇa said: man-manā bhava-bhaktah mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru. Four principles only. Only. Always think of Me, Hare Kṛṣṇa. If you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, then you are remembering Kṛṣṇa. Man-manāḥ. Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa. This is the religion, at least of this age. Hare nāma, Hare nāma, Hare nāma eva kevalam kalau nāsteva nāsteva nāsteva gati hraṇyata. There is no other way.

But people do not know. They are not educated. What is God? What is God's place? Where to go back? What is my position? What is my relation? Nothing of these things are educated or given lessons in any university, anywhere. But it is there, the Bhagavad-gītā. Kṛṣṇa is personally giving him instruction. Kṛṣṇa is giving instruction to Arjuna. Arjuna does not mean that… Arjuna is to take that lesson. Every one of us. And it is very old. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, don't manufacture new type of religion. What you will do then? It is simply waste of time. You cannot manufacture anything. But thereafter modernized religion. What is this nonsense, modernized religion? You are living entity. You are part and parcel of God. It is old relationship. Purāṇa. It is said purāṇa. Purāṇa means very old. na jāyate na abhryate vāt kadācit nitya-śāśvatayam purāṇa. We have to accept that purāṇa. We are purāṇa, eternal. na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre. We are not destroyed simply by destruction of this body. We remain. We accept another body. tathā dehāntara-prāptir dhīras tattva-numayate.

This is eternal relationship. It cannot be broken. But you have forgotten. You have forgotten your relationship with Kṛṣṇa. You have made your relationship with your family, so-called family, so-called country, so-called society, and so on, so on, so on, so on. This is all temporary. Suppose I am Indian today. You are American today. But is there a guarantee after your death you will become American or I will become Indian? Or I will take my birth in the same family? No. According to my karma, I may become cats and dogs. You may become demigods. You may become something else. But dehāntara-prāptir. Dehāntara-prāptir, you will have to accept another body. And there are 8,400,000 species or forms of body. Any of them you will have to accept. Prakṛteḥ kriyamārāṇi guṇaiḥ karmaṇi sarvaśaḥ. You are wasting your time as the family member or as a national or this or that. But there is no guarantee that next life we will be same countrymen or same family. No, there is no such guarantee.

And that body means any out of these four, according to my karma. karmaṇā daiva-natreṇa yanto deha-upapatti. So these are the instructions of the śāstras. And this is very scientific and very important thing. But unfortunately you are not taking care of these things. You are very busy with the temporary problems. Temporary problems are not problems. That is also stated in the Bhagavad-gītā. āgama-pāina anityātāṁ titikṣaśya bhārataḥ mātrāś paraśāstha-kaunteya śrī-daśna-śukha-dakkha-dāntaḥ. Your temporary problems, so-called happiness and distress, these are āgama-pāina. They come and go. That is not very important. Just like the seasonal changes. The winter season comes and again goes on. For the time being you may feel very cold, but it will go. Similarly, summer season also. It comes and goes, any seasonal changes. We should not be disturbed with the seasonal changes of happiness and distress.

**Summary:** The speaker stresses the importance of spiritual advancement and developing the intelligence to recognize and address the problem of death, contrasting it with an animalistic focus on bodily comfort.

We should be very serious about the problems of life: janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vādi. That is spiritual advancement. Unless we come to the serious point, unless you have become very intelligent, that I do not want to die. Why death is there? This is intelligence. You may solve your temporary problem, but you cannot by your so-called materialistic activities. The problem of death. Nobody wants to die. mṛtyu-sarva-harasya-haṁ. Death will come. But the people have become so much unintelligent, they do not take up seriously the real problems. Just like animals. The animals is being taken to the slaughterhouse. One animal enters to the slaughterhouse store, livestock store. All the animals enters. He does not know that this, I have to stay here for being killed. He does not know. This is animal. Similarly, if you do not take this problem seriously, you are no better than animal. However, you may be advanced for this bodily comfort. You are animal. yasyānta-buddhi-kuṇapeti-dhātuke. This bag of three elements, kava-vitva-vayu, if I think that I am this body and the comfort of this body is my happiness, sa eva go-kharo, you are no better than animal. This is animal conception of life. You must know that I am not this body. I am spirit soul. Circumstantially I have been put into this body, and again I will be put into another body. So what is the solution of this problem? That is Bhagavad-gītā.

Therefore Kṛṣṇa is saying, this is old. It is not new type of religion. It is the oldest. Bhagavad-bhakti. Bhagavan is there, and the living entities are there. Their relationship is there. Now by forgetting God, forgetting Kṛṣṇa, you are busy with the temporary problems, but you are forgetting the real problem. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, the bhaktoṣi, one has to become bhakto. The bhakto means Bhagavan. If there is Bhagavan, then there is bhakto, and there is bhakti. But these people are denying the existence of Bhagavan. There is no God. Then how He can become bhakto? Or how there will be execution of bhakti? Bhakto bhagavān bhakti. The same thing. Bhakto is in relationship with Bhagavan, and the transaction between Bhagavan and bhakto is called bhakti.

**Summary:** The speaker provides definitions of bhakti and emphasizes the importance of kirtana (chanting) and hearing about Krishna.

Bhakti. Bhakti means ānukulyena kṛṣṇa-anusilaṇaṁ anyā vilāśitā sunyaṁ jñāna-karmādana-vṛtaṁ ānukulyena kṛṣṇa-anusilaṇaṁ bhakti-vṛttamaḥ. This is the definition given by Rūpa Gosvāmī. Similarly, in Nārada-pañcarātra, the bhakti is defined: sarva-pādhi-vinirmaktaṁ tat-paratyena nirmanam rīśi-keṇa-rīśi-keśa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate. These are the definition of bhakti. Bhakti, without bhakti, nobody can become bhakti. Bhakti means one who is executing bhakti. That is bhakti. And the beneficiary, the beneficiary is the Bhagavān. So those who are engaged in this process of bhakti, sarva-nām kīrtanaḥ Viṣṇu, Viṣṇu means Bhagavān, or Kṛṣṇa. So sarva-nām kīrtanaḥ, you have to hear about Kṛṣṇa. That is sarva-nām. And kīrtanaḥ, one has to chant, This is also kīrtanaḥ. I am speaking to you. This is also kīrtanaḥ. When you are hearing, this is bhakti. Sarva-nām kīrtanaḥ, about Kṛṣṇa. The chanting, dancing about Kṛṣṇa, this is bhakti. Sarva-nām kīrtanaḥ, Viṣṇu.

Smaraṇaṁ, and remembering about Kṛṣṇa. Man-manā bhava-bhakti. If you engage your mind, savai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayaḥ, we have to fix up our mind always to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. So if you do not accept this object, this temple worship, how you can become always be engaged in the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa? These are the processes. These are not sentiments. This is the scientific process. If you want, your business is to become bhakti, that is perfection. And because Arjuna was bhakti, therefore Kṛṣṇa is speaking to him. So if you become, it is not monopolized by Arjuna. If you also become bhakti, Kṛṣṇa will speak to you. Now he says, where is God? Where is God? Here is God. God is speaking. Why don't you see God? God is speaking. You'll find in the seventh chapter, if you cannot see God, if you cannot see Kṛṣṇa in the temple, if you cannot see Kṛṣṇa within Bhagavad-gītā, then Kṛṣṇa says, raśo'haṁ apsukam teyaḥ prabhāsaṁ miṣaśa-śūryaḥ. You see while you drink water. Or anything you drink, you can see Kṛṣṇa there. Raśo. That taste is Kṛṣṇa. So there is no difficulty to see God. These rascals, they said, where is God? Here is God. You are drinking water. Why don't you see? Give me water. So Kṛṣṇa can be seen always, provided you want to see God. But you don't want to see God. That is the difficulty.

If you remain always addicted to sinful activities, how you can see God? That is not possible. You have to give up this, just called sinful activities. What are the sinful activities? Illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. That's all. You have to give up this.

Anyā yathāndhairu punyam ānā. Blind man is leading other man. Therefore there is no solution. Why the world is in chaos? Why the world is in chaos? Because the world is in chaos. Because leaders are all sinful. These are the sinful definition. triyas sunā pāṇudūta yatra pāpaśyata-durvedāḥ. So God's sin is not very difficult, provided you are purified, you are pure. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is purificatory process. Purificatory process. The first condition, we do not accept any rascal who is addicted to these four principles. We do not make cheap disciples. Our condition is, first of all, you must give up these things, illicit sex and meat-eating and intoxication, up to the drinking of tea and cigarette. You have to give up gambling. They are nice boys. They have given up. They are addicted to all these habits in their previous life, but they have given up. Therefore they are making progress.

santā. They have become santā, saintly persons. So Kṛṣṇa is parampavitra. Arjuna, when addressed Kṛṣṇa after reading Bhagavad-gītā, after addressing, parambrahma-parandhāma pavitraṁ paramambhavār. He understood. pavitraṁ paramambhavār. You are the most pure. You cannot approach the most pure if you are impure. You must be pure. Therefore this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra is a purificatory process. The more you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, you become purified. ceta-darpaṇamāryaṇaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam śreya-kairava-candra-kāvitaraṇaṁ vidyā-bhada-jīvaṇaṁ ānanda-ambudhi-vardhanam pratibhadam pūrṇā-mṛtā-śvādanaṁ ānanda-ambudhi-vardhanam pratibhadam pūrṇā-mṛtā-śvādanaṁ sarvātma-sapanaṁ param vijayati śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṁkīrtanaṁ. So take to this Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. It is very easy. Even a child can take part. You see, those children, they are not born of brāhmaṇa family or this family or that family. Never mind. Because they are taking part in chanting and dancing, they are becoming purified. Every step of their dancing, being... Being noted, being noted. Ajñāta-śukṛtiḥ chatur-vidā-bhajante māṁ.

And Vishuddha Gosvāmī says, your question is very pious question. That's it, sādhu, because it is about Kṛṣṇa. The question was, after the departure of Kṛṣṇa, dharma, kaṁ, what is that, sarnā-gata, kārthaṁ, what is that? This is the inquiry. The answer is given there. Sir, your inquiry, Kṛṣṇa comes for re-establishing the principles of religion. That's it. Lillian means the order set by the Supreme Personality of God. That is lillian. You do like this, just like king's order, or the government order, do like this. Loose and, does not, So that is dharma. If you follow the do's and do nots given by Kṛṣṇa, that is a lie. You cannot manufacture it. That is bogus. So munayam svayabhu kṛṣṇa-bhagavad-vī-loka-maṅgalam. This question, just like our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, is the same.

**Summary:** Hearing about Kṛṣṇa's attractive qualities and activities guarantees liberation, as Kṛṣṇa comes to re-establish religious principles.

Kṛṣṇa saṅkṣu, cīnātmā suprasūdhī. Another feature is, Kṛṣṇa is all-attractive, therefore talks about Him is also attractive. In our Kṛṣṇa book, there are so many topics about Kṛṣṇa. Janma karma-mṛdivyam, about His birth, about His transference from real father's house to another foster father. Then the attack by the demon upon Kṛṣṇa, kaṁsau, all these activities. If we simply study and hear the Kṛṣṇa saṅkṣu-prasṇā, then we are liberated. Without any doubt, our liberation is guaranteed simply by hearing about Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa therefore comes, so many activities. Na māṅg karmānī limpaṇṭhī na me kaṇva-pareśa-prihāḥ. Kṛṣṇa says that He has nothing to do. What He has to do? But still He is killing so many demons, He is giving protection to so many devotees, because He has come to reestablish what is religious principle. So by His personal activities, He's telling, otherwise, Kṛṣṇa has nothing to do. Nā mā rāma kṛṣṇaḥ. He is self-satisfied. He has nothing to do. But to teach us, He comes. In this way we should live, from the very beginning of His childhood.

**Key Quote:** "The ultimate Absolute Truth is Kṛṣṇa, the person."
**Summary:** The human form of life is meant for inquiring about the Absolute Truth, with Kṛṣṇa being the ultimate Absolute Truth, surpassing the understanding of Paramātmā and brahma effulgence.

Athāta brahma-jīgānta. Athā. Now, this is the time for inquiring about the Absolute Truth. This is the time, means, this human form of life. Animals cannot inquire. So therefore Vedānta Sutra says athā, athā, brahma-jīgānta, inquire about the Absolute Truth. Brahma, brahmeti, paramātmeti, bhagavān eti sadyati. The ultimate Absolute Truth is Kṛṣṇa, the person. Paramātmā is plenary expansion. And brahma, he is impersonal, effulgent. So if one understands Kṛṣṇa by question and answer, then he understands the other three features. But simply by understanding the impersonal feature, brahma effulgence, one cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. Neither by understanding or seeing the Paramātmā, one can understand Kṛṣṇa. To see the Paramātmā is the business of the yogis. dhyānā-vasthita-tad-gatena-manuṣā patsyante saṁyam yogiḥ. Yogina, the yogi, they are trying to see Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu within their heart by meditation. Meditation means this. dhyānā-vasthita-tad-gatena-manuṣā. patsyante saṁyam yogiḥ.

The idea was that we shall show something opulent, that we are very great nation. We have got nice buildings, nice churches, nice roads, swapsa. Everyone wants to be swapsa before his friends and relatives. So this is materialism. But the same thing done for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa, that we shall construct this temple for Kṛṣṇa's inauguration. We shall construct this building for providing devotees of Kṛṣṇa so that they may be able to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra without any disturbance. It appears the same thing, karma and bhakti. But bhakti is always in relation with Kṛṣṇa, and karma is always in relation with sense gratification. Therefore the thing, the ingredient, is originally spiritual, because it is Kṛṣṇa's energy. But ahaṁ mamṛti, when we try to impose our proprietorship, that is materialism. Materialism means forgetfulness of Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise there is no materialism.

**Key Quote:** "That will solve all social problems."
**Summary:** Introducing Kṛṣṇa consciousness into family life through acca-vigraha-seva can solve social problems by centering activities around Kṛṣṇa.

So in Kṛṣṇa center, even in Kṛṣṇa center, we are having different opinions, because we are accustomed to live like that. But actually, if we are serious about serving Kṛṣṇa, then there cannot be two people. One of them. How to serve Kṛṣṇa? So in family life, if we introduce this acca-vigraha-seva, every family can see Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa-vigraha, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu's photo, vigraha. And as we are, whatever we are doing, center is Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, everyone can do that. That will solve all social problems.

**Key Quote:** "So without being Kṛṣṇa conscious, there is no end of social problems."
**Summary:** Kṛṣṇa consciousness can resolve economic and social problems by fostering satisfaction and reducing the endless pursuit of more money.

Social problems, political problems, economic problems. Economic problem, practically there is no economic problem. Just like in London, they are throwing away tons of tomatoes. It will be seed. That is our clue. God has given sufficient to eat. But because there is strike, we have created a problem. So if one is Kṛṣṇa conscious, what is this strike? Strike means they want money, more money, more money. There is no end. When I first came to America and New York, there was strike of the transport man. All transports stopped. The subway, the bus, everything. People became so much in difficulty. So without being Kṛṣṇa conscious, there is no end of social problems. There is no end of self-justification. Nobody knows.

**Summary:** Instead of focusing on improving economic policy, one should utilize their time in chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa for peace of mind and satisfaction.

But Kṛṣṇa conscious person, they are satisfied. Even still in India, you will find this satisfaction by Kṛṣṇa conscious. A poor man, practically very big income, but he is satisfied. He is satisfied in this way. He thinks, Kṛṣṇa has given me this much. I must receive this much. Kṛṣṇa has given me this much. Why should I eat? And that is also recommendation of the śāsyas, that tasya-yoheta-pratyate tatha-vidah nanabhate yantra-matāṁ kare. We should not waste our time for improving our economic policy. That is already settled up. So whatever Kṛṣṇa will do, that is all right. Let me utilize my valuable time of this human form of life in chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Summary:** Saintly persons dedicated to Kṛṣṇa consciousness rely on Kṛṣṇa for their needs, exemplified by the story of Gīla Maṁgata, who received personal care from Kṛṣṇa.

People will not agree to this, but actually if anyone wants peace of the mind, jñātmā-śutra-siddhanti, then this process will be allowed. This is practical also. There are many saintly persons. They do not try where to go, where to take money, or where to eat. They are busy in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If Kṛṣṇa sends some food, I shall eat. Otherwise it doesn't matter. I shall starve. Then what is their determination? Spirit. They do not go anywhere. But Kṛṣṇa sends it, everything. Just like Gīla Maṁgata. Just like Gīla Maṁgata. He was not going anywhere. He was living in Vrndavana. Kṛṣṇa personally was coming to give him something. He became blind. He could not see. So Kṛṣṇa would come just like a boy. Gīla Maṁgata, I think you are hungry. Will you take some milk? I am not very good. All right, so give me little milk. Next day he comes. Then he would ask, who is this boy? I cannot see. He comes and gives me milk daily. Yuga-kemaṁ bhāmaḥ. In the Bhagavad-gītā he said that, until the devotee is completely dependent upon me, I carry personally whatever he needs. Yuga-bhūṇāṁ vṛnda-kāmaḥ. That one person is supplying all the necessities of all the living entities.

That is God. God is not beggar. God fulfills everyone's necessities. Freshly carried. So that is, people are unhappy by so-called economic development. Everyone is competing. They have no satisfaction. Without God, godless civilization is created. Unnecessary competition. But if you become God-conscious, he'll be satisfied. Jaya ātmāḥ sattva-śrīve.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the true purpose of knowledge is to understand and glorify Kṛṣṇa, the infallible purpose.

Now, śāstra says that avicchito artha, artha means purpose. If somebody asks what is the purpose of becoming a scientist, what is the purpose of becoming a physicist? So different men will give different answers. It is meant for this purpose, it is meant for this purpose. But kavi bhi, those who are actually learned, advanced learning, they have said that avicchito, avicchito means without any failure, without any contradiction. You say that chemistry is required for this purpose. I say chemistry is required for this purpose. Another man says chemistry is required for this purpose. But difference of opinion, that is not accepted. Avicchito, infallible purpose. What is that infallible purpose? Avicchito artha. Kavi bhi nirupita. Nirupita means it is already settled. You haven't got to make research anymore. Nirupita means it is already settled. It is already concluded. What is that? Yad uttama-sloka-guṇa-anuvarnanam. If you can explain the activities of Kṛṣṇa, uttama-sloka, how He is acting, how the chemical process is going on under His direction, if you can write a thesis on this subject matter, then ultimately Kṛṣṇa is behind that, then your study of chemistry is perfect.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that true education leads to understanding Kṛṣṇa as the cause of all causes and that scientific knowledge should be used to glorify God.

Nirupitam, it is concluded. No more argument. That is the purpose. That means if you are intelligent enough, actually, then through any source of knowledge you come ultimately to Kṛṣṇa. That mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ śrūyate śrī-cāryaḥ. Kṛṣṇa says, but if by your education, if you come to the same point, that here is Kṛṣṇa, He is in the background, sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇaṁ, cause of all causes, then education is perfect. Otherwise it is śrama eva hi kevalam. Otherwise it is simply laboring for nothing. Waste of time. This is the purpose. Aviccita-artha-kavirbhi-nirupitam. Yad uttamaḥ śloka-guṇānubhanyanam. So parāśa-śakti-bhībhi-daivaśyate. Very, very big chemistry, physical laws, mathematics, everything is required to understand the potency of God. How He is working. Actually everything is being done by His potency. Here there are different tests. The material is the same, but the method of mixing the material, different tests are coming out in existence. So how that expertly management of mixing is going on, if we can explain by our chemistry, by our mathematical values, then our studying of the material is going to be very, very

God's curiosity is the end of the brain. How God's brain is working. He appreciated. He was a great scientist. And the ordinary, fanatics, sāyāsadeva thinks that now we are able to do everything without God, therefore we are bigger than God. That is not fact.

He is my devotee. Devotee's business is to glorify. He doesn't take any credit for himself. Actually there is nothing to be taken, credit. All credit goes to Kṛṣṇa. A devotee neither claims anything. He is not taking any credit for himself. Neither it is possible. Even he may be very, very big devotee, he will never claim any credit for his glorious activities. His glorious activities means to make Kṛṣṇa glorious. That is his glorious activities. Not that like the so-called materialist, he takes, wants to take the credit.

The sun is rising exactly in the time, and it is setting exactly in the time, and the temperature, according to the different season, the movement, uttarāyaṇa, dakṣināyaṇa, everything is managed so expertly under the order of the Supreme, mayādhyakṣeṇa, prapṛti. Don't think the sun is working so nicely. Automatical, not automatical. The master is there, Kṛṣṇa. The sun is so powerful substance within this universe. There are many millions of suns. This is one sun only. But it is carrying out the order of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa. yaccha kṣuresa śavitā śagala-grhānā rājā samastha śra-mṛti aśeṣu tezā Aśeṣu tezā. Unlimited. Light. Unlimited fire. Unlimited heat. Aśeṣu. Aśeṣu tezā. There is no compression. With the sunlight, sunset, there is no compression within this universe. Unlimited. For millions and millions of years, it is from the sun, the light and heat is coming out, but there is no diminution. They, it is the same as it was millions of years ago, and after giving you light and heat for millions of years, the same quantity of light and heat is still there. So if it is possible for a material thing, that after giving unlimited heat and light, it remains the same. Similarly, the Supreme Lord, by expanding His potencies by His energy, He remains the same. He does not diminish. Purnasya purna-mādāya purna-mī-bhāva-śuṣyate. So if we can see in the material object that the heat being emanated from many millions and millions, it remains the same heat. It maintains the same heat, same life. Why it is not possible for the Supreme? Therefore, Īśvara-bhūta-paṇiṣāda informs us that purnasya purna-mādāya purna-mī-bhāva-śuṣyate.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the limited power of modern gurus who claim to give away their power with the unlimited potency of Kṛṣṇa, who can expand Himself without diminishing.

If you take the whole energy of Kṛṣṇa from Kṛṣṇa, then still the whole energy is there. But you'll be surprised. Nowadays, modern gods, there are so many modern gods. I do not wish to name, but one modern god, he gave his power to his disciples. And when he came to Kṛṣṇa, he gave his power to his disciples. And when he came to consciousness, then he was crying. The disciples inquired from the guru, why you are crying, sir? No, I have finished everything. I have given you everything. Therefore, I am now finished. That is not spiritual. That is material. I have got hundred rupees. If I pay you hundred rupees, then my pocket is empty. But Kṛṣṇa is not like that. Kṛṣṇa can make hundreds of thousands and millions of Kṛṣṇa, still He is Kṛṣṇa. That is Kṛṣṇa. The potency is never exhausted. That is called purnasya purna-mādāya purna-mī-bhāva-śuṣyate.

Jagad-anna means the universe. And nāthā, the lord of the universe, means Lord Brahmā. So he has got a duration of life. And what is the duration of life? The breathing period of Mahā-Viṣṇu. yasyaika-niśya-śutakālam athāva-nambha-jīvanti-lobha-vilajā, jagad-anna-nāthā, viṣṇu-mahāna-śayaya-yasya-kalā-viśyeṣa. Govinda-mādi-puruṣaṁ tamāṁ. That is God.

**Key Quote:** "We accept Kṛṣṇa, the sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam, and we want to be eternal servant."
**Summary:** The speaker rejects the idea of 'cheap gods' and emphasizes the importance of accepting Kṛṣṇa as the source of everything and becoming His eternal servant, highlighting the inherent desire for variety in our constitutional position.

And the duration of existence of each and every universe is the duration of life of Brahmā. That we cannot calculate. Even we cannot calculate His twelve hours. So that is God. We accept such kind of life. We accept such kind of God. Not a little magician. No. That is not possible. We cannot accept such cheap gods. We accept Kṛṣṇa, the sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam, and we want to be eternal servant. That is our actual position, jiveśvarūpa-nitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa, by His unlimited potency, energy. Unlimited universes are coming out with unlimited number of varieties of planet. And each planet is differently situated, different atmosphere, different temperature. So in this way, varieties. That is ānanda. Kṛṣṇa has created these varieties because He is ānanda-mayo vyāsāt. Ānanda-mayo. Unless there is variety. So we are partakers. We are part and parcel of that variety maker. We are also one of the varieties. Jīva-śakti. We are also one of the varieties. So how we can become variety-less, nirvīśeṣa? That is not possible. Even artificially we try to become nirvīśeṣa, variety-less. Our constitutional position is that we want variety. How it can be stopped?

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the downfall of impersonalists and emphasizes the need to transfer our service from māyā (illusion) to Kṛṣṇa in order to achieve a successful and blissful life.

Therefore, in the śāstra it is said, so-called māyāvādī, impersonalist, monies, āryajya krccheṇa-param padanta-taḥ. Although they get up to the position of oneness, monies, but from that position they fall down. Why? āryajya krccheṇa-param padanta-taḥ, patanti adhā, ānādita jagособas vlogs. Why? Because you cannot become jīvadora. You are going to become s Sitting-abh Knights. You cannot become a teacher, good teacher, teacher, But you cannot become an ascetic. Because you cannot become a teacher, good teacher, good monk, Junga. So this is the definition of vaiṇādita-jisma-dhangrāja. Because they have no information of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, where to enjoy ānanda, ānandamaya-bhāsā. And they are by nature seeking after ānanda, the so-called oneness, monism, that will not please them. So they will require again ānanda. But because anādhita-yusmataṁ grhayaḥ, they have not worshipped Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet, they come down again in this material world and worship the feet of māyā. That is their tradition. ārīja-kṛcchreṇa-parampadam tato patanti adhaḥ. And as soon as you are engaged in the service of māyā, that is your adhapatam. Adhapatam. As we, all these materialistic persons who are within this material world, you are serving māyā. Everyone is serving. Nobody is without serving. But they are serving māyā. So you have to transform, transfer your service from māyā to Kṛṣṇa. Then your life will be successful, and you will taste different varieties of prasādam perpetually and enjoy life eternally and blissfully.

**Key Quote:** "All these truths were explained to Sanatana Goswami by the Lord himself out of his causeless mercy."
**Summary:** The lecture begins with an introduction to the verses from Chaitanya Charitamrita, focusing on Krishna's identity, conjugal love, opulence, and the mellows of devotional service, all revealed to Sanatana Goswami through the Lord's mercy.

Jaya Jaya Shri Chaitanya Jaya Nithyananda Jaya Dvaita Chandra Jaya Gaurabhakta Vrinda. We are reading from Shri Chaitanya Charita Amrita, Madhya Leela, Chapter 20, entitled Lord Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu Instructs Sanatana Goswami in the Science of the Absolute Truth from verse 97 to 99. I will read 97 and 98 and will repeat verse 99. Krishna Swaroopa Madhuri Aishwarya Bhakti Rasashriyam Tatvam Sanatana Yesha Kripa Yopadi Desha Saha. Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, had personally told Sanatana Goswami about Lord Krishna's real identity. He also told him about the Lord's conjugal love, his personal opulence, and the message of love. He also told him about the Lord's conjugal love, his personal opulence, and the mellows of devotional service. All these truths were explained to Sanatana Goswami by the Lord himself out of His causeless mercy.

**Key Quote:** "Although they are fallen, if they simply submit themselves at the lotus feet of Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, they will be saved from sinful reactions."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Sanatana Goswami's humility and self-identification as fallen due to association with materialistic individuals, emphasizing the importance of surrendering to Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu for salvation from sinful reactions.

Text 98: Putting a straw in his mouth and bowing down, Sanatana Goswami clasped the lotus feet of Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and humbly spoke as follows. Translation and purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Shri Prabhupada. Translation: Sanatana Goswami said, "I was born in a low family and my associates are all low class men. I myself am fallen and am the lowest of men. Indeed, I have passed my whole life fallen in the well of sinful materialism." Actually, Shri Sanatana Goswami belonged to a brahmana family because he belonged to the Saraswati division of the brahmanas and was well-cultured and well-educated. Somehow or other, he accepted a ministership in the Muslim government. Therefore, he had to associate with meat-eaters, drunkards, and gross materialists. Sanatana Goswami considered himself fallen, for in the association of such men, he also fell victim to material enjoyment. Having passed his life in that way, he considered that he had wasted his valuable time. This statement about how one can become fallen in this material world is made by the greatest authority in the Gaudiya Vaishnavasampradaya. Actually, the whole world is presently fallen into material existence. Everyone is a meat-eater, drunkard, woman-hunter, gambler, and what not. People are enjoying material life by committing the four basic sins. Although they are fallen, if they simply submit themselves at the lotus feet of Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, they will be saved from sinful reactions.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "These three things can be understood through devotional service by no other means."
**Summary:** This section explains that Krishna's svarupa (actual position), madhurya (attractiveness), and aisharja (opulences) can only be understood through devotional service, emphasizing that material speculation is insufficient.

Sanātana Gosvāmī is taking instruction and lessons from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. And what is the subject matter of instruction that is described herein by the author of this Caitanya-caritāmī? The subject matter is Kṛṣṇa's svarūpa. What is the actual position of Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa's svarūpa, mādhujya. And what is the special attractiveness of Kṛṣṇa? Mādhujya. Kṛṣṇa's svarūpa, mādhujya, aisharja. And what are the opulences of Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa's svarūpa, mādhujya, aisharja. And what are the opulences of Kṛṣṇa? Bhakti-vāsākram. And all these, what is Kṛṣṇa? What is His special qualification for attraction? And what is His opulence? These three things can be understood through devotional service by no other means. Just like I have several times cited the example that if you want to be in confidence of a great personality, then you must satisfy him by your service. You cannot understand a big man by your speculation, even in this material world. If you want to know a big man... By disappointment. What he is. Then you must satisfy him by your service, attitude, by friendship, by love. And he will disclose to you what he's... So the same process is bhakti-vāsākram. If you want to know what is Kṛṣṇa, what is His opulence, what is his special feature for attraction, then you should try to understand by no other means anything other than Kṛṣṇa, anything.

In another place, the Lord says that to understand Me, actually what I am, is very difficult. Manuṣyānāṁ sa śreṣu kaścid yaḥ. Out of many millions of human beings, somebody tries to make a perfection of his life. Otherwise they are all working jail cats and dogs. That's all. Simply āhāra-vidrā-vāya-mṛti-viṣaḥ. They have no other information. Work hard, eat and be merry and enjoy. And making, that's all. So out of millions and millions of persons, they are all working. Therefore they are all working. They cannot be made devoid of the sacraments of the Lord. And what is the profession of a person who is engaged in animal profession? Even for a person like this, engaged in animal profession of life, only a few persons, selected persons, because the illusory energy has grasped under her clutches very tightly. To get out of the clutches is very difficult. So somehow or other, a few people, out of many millions and thousands, they come to the understanding of God. And then the rest of them, they are not able to understanding that what is the real perfection of life. Now, those who are actually perfected, out of them, out of millions of them, one can understand Kṛṣṇa. That is the statement of Bhagavad-gītā. Manuṣṭhānaṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye yatatām api siddhānaṁ Siddhānaṁ means those who have already achieved perfection. Out of them. Not these imperfect fools. Those who are actually attained perfection, they can understand what Kṛṣṇa is actually. Tattva. And that actual position can be understood in another place of Bhagavad-gītā state, bhaktyā mām abhijānāti. What he sees actually, that can be understood by this devotional service. No other process. No other process will help to understand Kṛṣṇa. You can, by other processes, you can achieve some other thing. But if you want to know Kṛṣṇa, then you have to understand through your devotional service. Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore Lord Caitanya instructed Sanātana Gosvāmī about Kṛṣṇa through devotional service."
**Summary:** This section discusses entering the spiritual kingdom through understanding Krishna via devotional service, highlighting Lord Caitanya's direct instruction to Sanatana Goswami.

So you will have entrance into the spiritual kingdom, into the abode of Kṛṣṇa, when you have perfectly… We cannot understand perfectly, but as far as possible, as far as you have got the capacity, if you understand Kṛṣṇa as He is, then the entrance will be there. Otherwise there is no entrance. Therefore Lord Caitanya instructed Sanātana Gosvāmī about Kṛṣṇa through devotional service. This instruction is very important. You should very carefully hear and, if possible, note. This is directly the instruction. Just like the Bhagavad-gītā, Lord Kṛṣṇa is directly instructing or doing. But in the Bhagavad-gītā there are many phases of instruction, fruitive action, philosophical speculation, and yoga system, and jñāna system, all kinds of different paths. Ultimately, of course, Lord Kṛṣṇa instructing him that sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ītaṁ sarvaṁ bhajaṁ. That is the most confidential part. But here Lord Caitanya, He is not instructing any superfluous thing.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes Lord Caitanya's unparalleled mercy in directly offering the highest instruction of surrendering to Krishna, even more directly than Krishna himself did in the Bhagavad-gita.

So that is the blessing of Lord Caitanya. Even what Kṛṣṇa could not give, what Kṛṣṇa could not, or Kṛṣṇa hesitated to give, because Kṛṣṇa hesitated that if I speak in the beginning of the Bhagavad-gītā, sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ītaṁ sarvaṁ bhajaṁ, people would not accept it. There was no necessity of describing Bhagavad-gītā in so many phases of instruction. Because the last instruction, most confidential instruction was that you give up everything and just surrender unto Him. That is the actual instruction of Bhagavad-gītā. But that was not spoken in the beginning. Because there are many phases of human being. They are under different stages of soul. Or they have different stages, karma, jñāna, yoga, so many things they have been discovered. Here Caitanya Mahāprabhu, His mercy is that He directly gives this highest instruction. What Kṛṣṇa could not give, but Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, or Kṛṣṇa in His incarnation as Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He gave up. Therefore He is considered the most munificent, charitable personality, man of charity. Rūpa Gosvāmī offered His respect that namo mahā-vadānā, you are the greatest munificent personality. You are directly offering Kṛṣṇa, which is very difficult for you. It is very difficult to understand. So many scholars, so many philosophers, so many great personalities, they could not understand Kṛṣṇa. But your mercy is so broad that you are directly offering Kṛṣṇa. Therefore mahā-vadānā, Kṛṣṇa prema-pradāya, directly you are giving love of Kṛṣṇa.

**Key Quote:** "So Sanātana Gosvāmī in this way directly received instruction from Lord Caitanya about bhakti-yoga, what is bhakti."
**Summary:** This section describes how Sanatana Goswami received direct instruction on bhakti-yoga from Lord Caitanya, emphasizing his humility and self-identification as belonging to the lowest caste due to his associations.

So Sanātana Gosvāmī in this way directly received instruction from Lord Caitanya about bhakti-yoga, what is bhakti. So this is called tattvaṁ sanātanāya īśa, kṛpayāpadi-veṣa īśa. īśa means the Lord, the Lord, Supreme Controller. So He is also there. Just like Arjuna received instruction directly, similarly Sanātana Gosvāmī also received instruction directly from the Supreme Lord. So here how to receive instruction, that is given by example by Sanātana Gosvāmī. tave sanātana-prahūr-carane dharīya dainya-vinati-kare dante-triṇalaiya Sanātana Gosvāmī very humbly fell down on the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. And most humbly He submitted. What is that submission? nīca-jāti nīca-saṅgī-patīt adhaṁ pūpiṣaya pūpe parī gāyaṇu janam My dear sir, I have wasted my time in simply sensual gratification. That is my qualification. And I belong to the lowest caste. Nīca-jāti. Nīca-saṅgī. And my association is also of the lowest type. And patīt. I have fallen and I am the lowest of all. This is my qualification. Now, why He is submitting himself? Nīca-jāti. Nīca-jāti means those who are born in lower family. They are called nīca-jāti. They are śūdras or less than the śūdras. According to Vedic system, the brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya and vaiśya, they are higher caste. And the śūdras, they are lower caste. And less than śūdras, they are lowest.

**Key Quote:** "So in those days, amongst the brāhmaṇa community, if any brāhmaṇa would accept service, he becomes at once a śūdra."
**Summary:** This segment explains Sanatana Goswami's background as a brahmana who became ostracized for accepting service in a Muslim government, highlighting the strict social conditions of the time.

So Sanātana Gosvāmī, actually he belongs to the brāhmaṇa family. He, his forefathers belonged to the śārasya-brāhmaṇa family. There are different set, gaura-brāhmaṇa and śārasya-brāhmaṇa. So śārasya-brāhmaṇa, actually, they belong to the Aryan, āryavartā, the Panyāra side and Kashmir side. They are considered high-class brāhmaṇas. So he belongs to that community. But somehow or other, their forefathers… I mean, make their domicile in Bengal. Because they had some property in Bengal. They are very rich, aristocratic family. And this Sanātana Gosvāmī accepted ministership in the Mohammedan kingdom. So in those days, amongst the brāhmaṇa community, if any brāhmaṇa would accept service, he becomes at once a śūdra. He becomes at once. Because service is meant for the śūdras, not for the brāhmaṇas, kṣatriya and vaiśya. They would never accept anybody's obligation as service. They would starve. That was the principle. Only the śūdras could accept service. So because these Sanātana Gosvāmī and Rupa Gosvāmī accepted government office, although it was government office, but it was service, so they were outside the brāhmaṇa community.

**Key Quote:** "Everyone, unless he is conscious of his position that he is the lowest, he cannot become the highest."
**Summary:** This section emphasizes the importance of humility and recognizing one's fallen state due to engagement in sense gratification (eating, sleeping, mating, and defending) as a prerequisite for spiritual advancement.

Patīr, I have fallen. Ādhāṁ. And ādhāṁ means I am the lowest of the human beings. So, of course, because Sanātana Gosvāmī was under certain condition, it is not simply particularly for the Sanātana Gosvāmī. Everyone, unless he is conscious of his position that he is the lowest, he cannot become the highest. One should not think, while approaching his spiritual master, one should not be puffed up with his so-called qualifications. He should be a blank slate. That is the, that is requirement. He should forget that whatever nonsense he had learnt, he should forget. Otherwise, there will be no benefit by approaching spiritual master. He should forget. If he keeps his personality, I believe, I cannot, there is no necessity. With such nonsense things, nobody should approach a spiritual master. One should become a blank slate. So, I am fallen. I am the lowest. And I am lower born. So many things are good qualifications. This is my position. Nityānā. And ku viṣaya kupe parī gāiṇu-janaḥ. I have now wasted my time simply by sense gratification. Viṣaya means āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maitur. These are called viṣaya. Objects of sense gratification. Eating, sleeping, mating, and defending. These are called viṣaya. And we are engaged only how to eat very nicely, how to sleep very nicely, how to give me protection, and how to have nice mating. This is our business.

**Key Quote:** "Because I am so much fallen, because I have wasted my time in sense gratification...therefore my position is that I do not know what is actually beneficial to me."
**Summary:** This segment explores Sanatana Goswami's realization that despite his education and aristocratic associations, he doesn't know what is truly beneficial due to his wasted time in sense gratification.

So, Samātana Gosvāmī says that I have simply wasted my time in this way. And my position is this. So, therefore, actually, āpanār hita hi kisi na hi yati. Because I am so much fallen, because I have wasted my time in sense gratification, because I am ostracized, because my association is so lower, therefore my position is that I do not know what is actually beneficial to me. Āpanār hita hi kisi na yati. Now, Samātana Gosvāmī was minister, educated, he was learned scholar in Parsi and Sanskrit. So, how is it that he is placing himself in that way? Is he, I would say, imitating something, such humbleness? But actually he was known? Yes. Actually he was. No. Actually he was so. A devotee does not say anything falsely unless he feels. He feels himself like that. Why does he feel? He was educated. He belonged to the brāhmaṇa aristocratic family. His association was all Nabhāvas and Yamindārasa aristocratic family. And still he says like this. Why? What is the defect? That he felt like that. Now he is expressing. Āpanār hita hi kisi na yati. I do not know what is actually beneficial to me. I am thinking that if I am posted in a service like this, and if I have got some aristocratic association, I have got some enchantment for sense gratification, that is materialism. So I have passed my, wasted my time in that.

**Summary:** This section explains the social etiquette of addressing different communities in India (brahmanas as pandita, kshatriyas as Thakura, vaishyas as sedji, and shudras as mahajana).

But actually I do not know what is beneficial to me. So grāma-bhāvahara paṇḍita tāi sattva-māne. In the Indian system, a brāhmaṇa is addressed as paṇḍita. But as you know, Paṇḍita Jahannālaya, although he had no brāhmaṇical qualification, but because he was born in a brāhmaṇa family, so this title was Paṇḍita. Paṇḍita. So a brāhmaṇa is addressed as paṇḍita. A kṣatriya is addressed as Ṭhākura. And a vaiśya is addressed as a saint, sīrjī, a rich man. The vaiśyas, vaiśyas are generally very rich men. For us, as you have in your country, the Rockefeller, Carnegie and Ford, similarly in our country you have got many rich men. Just like Billard, Dalmya, Bangar and so many. So they are called sēdjī. So sēdjī, Ṭhākura-jī and paṇḍita-jī. And the śūdras are called mahājana. Because if they are called śūdras, they will be angry. And mahājana means great personality.

**Key Quote:** "When you come to this culture, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they will be all in the same place."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how Krishna consciousness can unite people despite social classifications, contrasting it with the illusion of accepting false qualifications.

So these are some etiquette for addressing different communities. Among the different communities, although there are such classifications, still there was no enmity. They lived in village, although in their position, but the relationship was very friendly. Just like brothers, just like brothers, actually. Because the culture was religion. Culture was the Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So they depended on the culture. There was no provincialism. Because they depended on culture. The culture is the thing. The Kṛṣṇa conscious speech can… Even there are materially so many high and low classifications. When you come to this culture, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they will be all in the same place. So he said, the grāhma-bhābhāre paṇḍita. And as a matter of social etiquette, I am addressed as paṇḍita. Paṇḍita means planet. Planet scholar. He is called paṇḍita. Paṇḍita asama-darśana. He has read in the Bhagavad-gītā. Paṇḍita means he sees everything on equal eyes. Why? Because he is brāhmaṇa. He has known what is grāhma and what are these living entities. He has got such knowledge. That is called paṇḍita. So Sanātana Gosvāmī had no such knowledge. At least he is pretending like that. So he said, the grāhma-bhābhāre kahaye paṇḍita. By social etiquette, I am addressed as paṇḍita. But… And I also accept that I am paṇḍita. If somebody falsely calls me that your majesty… So it is an insult. It is not honoring him. I am an ordinary man. If somebody calls me your majesty… So a man who has no qualification… If he is visualized in that way, that is an insult. But we are so much poor that if somebody calls me your majesty, I shall feel, I am majesty. Yes? I am his majesty. That is our nature. If some false qualifications are awarded to me, I shall be very glad to accept it. I shall think, yes, I am. So Sarātana Gosvāmī said that actually I am not paṇḍita because I do not know what is my benefit, what is beneficial to me. I do not know the goal of my life. I simply wasted my time in sense gratification. I do not know. And still people say, you are paṇḍita. And I accept it. Just see my position. So this is blank slate, admitting that I am fool number one. But people say, I am learned and I accept it. This is our nature.

**Key Quote:** "So this mentality should be sacrificed first, before going to a spiritual master."
**Summary:** This section emphasizes the need to sacrifice pride and approach a spiritual master with humility and a blank slate, first understanding if the guru is qualified and then offering oneself as a student.

This is called illusion. He will never think that I am fool number one. He will always think, oh, who can be greater than me? I am the… I can think myself. What is the necessity of a spiritual master? I can… I can become a religious leader. I can become… This, this is our mentality. So this mentality should be sacrificed first, before going to a spiritual master. First of all, you have to select who can be your spiritual master. That requires some knowledge. Or you have to behave with a person to understand whether he is fit to be a spiritual master. If you become my spiritual master, then you should offer yourself to be a student. That is the process. Not that all of a sudden you shall go to a person, oh, please accept me as my student. No. You should first of all try to understand whether he is actually fit. Then offer yourself. So just like Sanātana Gosvāmī, when he first saw Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he did not offer himself. He just… But when he heard from Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and he understood, yes, it is a very nice thing, so I should now retire from service, and I should wholly devote to Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He left his very lucrative job, minister seat, and just like a very poor man, he approached to Caitanya Mahāprabhu. And he… And he placing, submitting himself as blank place. That these are my qualifications. Please accept me.

Shilabhakti Vinod Thakur reveals in Navadvipa Dhamamahatmya, after Lord Brahma stole the calves and the cowherd friends of Lord Krishna to test the supremacy of the cowherd boy in Vrindavan, he realized his mistake that the boy in Vrindavan is none other than his master, Supreme Lord Sri Krishna.

He came to Navadvipa Dham and performed severe auspiciousness. Lord Brahma was pleased with his austerities to atone his offences in Antaradvipa. Being pleased with his austerities, Supreme Lord Krishna appeared before him and gave his darshan.

Wherever you go within this material world, either in the Brahma-loka or in the Pātlā-loka, you have to die. That is the problem. So Hiraṇā Kaśipu wanted to solve this in a materialistic way, but that is not possible. So in a negative way, he wanted that I shall not die on the land, I shall not die in the air, I shall not die in the water, I shall not be killed by any man-made weapon. In so many ways, negatively, he thought that he has become immortal. But Kṛṣṇa is so intelligent that, keeping all the words or the blessings given by Lord Brahmā to Hiraṇā Kaśipu, He cannot kill anyone. So we cannot cheat God. That is not possible. However scientifically we may be advanced, God is always more intelligent than ourselves. We should always remember.

Alas, how strange it is that we are preparing to commit greatly sinful acts, driven by the desire to enjoy royal happiness, purport by Śrīla Prabhupāda. Driven by selfish motives, one may be inclined to such sinful acts as the killing of one's own brother, father, or mother. There are many such instances in the history of the world.

Emmanuel. So sometimes Arjuna is accused, Bhagavad-gītā is also accused that there is violence. Bhagavad-gītā is full of violence. Yes, it is full of violence, the war field, but here the Vaiṣṇava thinking, Arjuna is thinking that it was arranged for his love, rājya-sukha, yad rājya-sukha-lobhī, loving. It was arranged for the satisfaction of Arjuna so that he could enjoy the kingdom and the happiness thereof. Actually it was not so.

**Key Quote:** "That is His satisfaction, not Arjuna's satisfaction, not anyone's satisfaction. It is His plan."
**Summary:** The speaker distinguishes devotional service from ordinary work, emphasizing Krishna's mission to protect the good and vanquish the wicked.

Yes. So that is the difference between ordinary work and devotional service. Devotional service and ordinary work, they look almost equal. Just like we are living in this house, the neighbors, they may think that something is wrong. Some people are living here, chanting, dancing. We also dance. We also sometimes sing and eating. They are also eating. So what is the difference? They may think that what is the difference between devotional service and ordinary work? It looks almost equal. Therefore people misunderstand that Bhagavad-gītā is ordinary warfare, violence. But it is not that. It is arranged by Kṛṣṇa because to fulfill His mission, His mission is paritrāṇāṁ sādhunāṁ vināśāya ca dṛśkṛtām.

**Key Quote:** "So kinsman does not mean, in higher sense, only my brother or my sister or my father or my uncle. Sa janam means all living entities because one who hasn't got Kṛṣṇa consciousness, ordinary consciousness, material consciousness, he cannot think in terms of sa janam, my kinsmen, all living entities. He cannot think."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the real purpose of religious life is to establish Krishna consciousness, and kinsmen means all living entities.

That is His satisfaction, not Arjuna's satisfaction, not anyone's satisfaction. It is His plan. He comes, He descends on this planet, in this universe, just to establish the real purpose of religious life and to kill, to vanquish those who are opposing the real purpose. That is His mission. Simultaneously, two things: paritrāṇāṁ sādhunāṁ vināśāya ca dṛśkṛtām. So sa janam ahavato mahat-pāpam kartam bhavuṣitābhayaṁ yad rājya-sukha-levana hantam sa janam urdatam sa janam means kinsman. So kinsman does not mean, in higher sense, only my brother or my sister or my father or my uncle. No. Sa janam means all living entities because one who hasn't got Kṛṣṇa consciousness,

Actually, everyone is our sa janam because if God is father, as Kṛṣṇa claims, ahaṁ vīja-pradapitāḥ, if He is the Supreme Father, not only He claims, at least any fine religious system claims God is the original Father. That's the fact. ahaṁ sarvasya prabhava matta-sarvaṁ prabhartate. Everything has come from Him. He is the Supreme Father. If Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Father, He is father of everyone. sarva-joni-sukha-antaya. In all species of life, in all forms of life, they are all our sa janam, kinsmen. How it cannot be? Because Kṛṣṇa is the original Father. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore, a devotee of Kṛṣṇa does not want to commit a little harm to any living entity. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Yukta-cuse

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna loves everyone equally and a Krishna conscious devotee also sees everyone equally.

도 Do you want to move to a state where KṛṣṇaUfar is not real in the sense of pieces which we have seen in our lives? In the sense of worldview I mean. Well, that's true, true. I mean, you can move about your little yard. In your little yard. Oh my, that is true. That's true, true. That's true, true. also. Cows also. Samadarsana. For Krishna, the gopi is the calf and the cows or anyone in Vṛndāvana who has come to serve him, they are all equal to him. Somebody wants to serve Krishna as calf. Somebody wants to serve Krishna as cow. Somebody wants to serve Krishna as gopi. Somebody wants to serve Krishna as cowherd boy. Somebody wants to serve Krishna as his father. Somebody wants to serve Krishna as his mother. These are the different mellows, different tastes. Every living entity has got his own taste, how to love Krishna. But the central point is to love Krishna. Krishna also reciprocates. He has no discrimination that here is gopi, beautiful girl, therefore I shall love her more than the calf. No. Krishna is not so partial. Similarly, Krishna's devotees also, because he has Krishna consciousness means he has got now a minute quantity, Krishna's quality. Therefore, he is also equal to everyone. He thinks everyone sajana.

**Key Quote:** "The living part, the soul is the same dimension either within the ant or in the elephant."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the dimension of the soul and explains that a pundit sees the soul in everyone, regardless of their external form.

The same member of the same family. It does not matter if one has become ant or one has become elephant. The living part, the soul is the same dimension either within the ant or in the elephant. This dimension of the soul we have several times discussed. One ten thousand part of the top of the hair. keśāgra śatavāgasya śatadhā kalpitasyaca jīva-bhāga-sabhījña sa anantāya kalpate. There is the dimension. In śāstra we get the dimension of the soul. Very, very minute. One ten thousand part of the top of the hair, just a minute. So that portion is within the ant and within brahmā and within elephant. Therefore, one who is pundit, one who knows what are these soul spiritual parts, part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, if he has got full knowledge, then his vision is vidyā-vinaya-sampanne brāhmaṇe govi hastini śunite ca sapāke ca paṇḍitāḥ samadarsana. Samadarsana means equal vision. A learned brāhmaṇa is most intelligent man in the human society. And a dog superficially, externally, there is much difference. Here is a dog, a street dog, and here is a learned brāhmaṇa. But one who is pundit, one who is Kṛṣṇa conscious, he sees that the pundit and the dog, they are the same, because they are also the same spiritual part. By his karma, he has become a learned pundit. And by his karma, he has become a dog.

**Key Quote:** "If we want to kill any living entity, for my satisfaction, either my tongue satisfaction or any sense satisfaction, it is mahāpāpaṁ great sinful act."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that killing any living entity for one's own satisfaction is a great sin.

But within the different body, dehi na smin jathā dehi kaumār, smin dehe, in this body, there is the soul. That is his vision. Of course, externally it is not that I shall behave equally with the brāhmaṇa and the dog. That is external behavior. But internally we should know that both the brāhmaṇa and the dog, they are spiritual parts. This is called brahma-jñāna. Brahma-jñāna means the knowledge of spiritual self. That is called brahma-jñāna. So when one attains this brahma-jñāna, then brahma-bhūta-prasannātmā na śocati na kānta samas sarveṣu bhūteṣu samatā equal. That is brahma-jñāna. So in this verse, Arjuna says that yad rājya sukha-lobhena hantuṁ śva-janam pūrdhataḥ. So when we are killing animals for the satisfaction of our tongue, this is mahāpātaḥ. Arjuna says ahavatau mahat-pāpaṁ mahat-pāpaṁ great sinful act. If we want to kill anyone, any living entity, for my satisfaction, either my tongue satisfaction or any sense satisfaction, it is mahāpāpaṁ great sinful act.

**Summary:** The speaker laments that people kill for sense gratification, even in the name of religion, and questions how they can be happy.

Because they are all śva-jana. You cannot kill. Either you take this sense or that sense. But Arjuna is speaking in a limited sense. He is thinking of his own family members. But if one is actually in knowledge, brahma-jñāna, he thinks in the same way that the lower animals, they are also our family members. And if I kill him for my satisfaction, my sense satisfaction, it is great sinful act. Unfortunately, everyone is killing for his sense satisfaction, gratification, in the name of religion. In the name of religion, and although it is prohibited, still they are killing. Thus, imagine how much sinful activity they are doing and how they can be happy. Happiness, of course, a hawk also thinks that he is very happy, that he is eating stool, living in filthy place, and because he has got the facility of sex life without any discrimination, he may think happy life. But that is not happiness.

**Key Quote:** "If you want to feel happiness by your, this blunt material senses, that is not happiness. Happiness is beyond your material senses."
**Summary:** The speaker defines real happiness as being beyond material senses and achieved through purified senses employed for Krishna's sake.

Happiness is different thing. sukhaṁ ātyam tṛtaṁ yatraṁ atindriya grāhyam. If you want to feel happiness by your, this blunt material senses, that is not happiness. Happiness is beyond your material senses. ātyam tṛtaṁ. That is real happiness. Real happiness means it will never end. And you will never feel satiation. There is no more want. That is real happiness. Material happiness, there is no such thing. That you will feel immediately satiation. After enjoying any material happiness, a few minutes, you will feel again another, again another, again another. So, therefore, in the Bhagavad-gītā it is said, sukhaṁ ātyam tṛtaṁ yatraṁ. So, real joy, what is real happiness, that is not felt by these blunt material senses. What is that sense? That is purified senses. sarva-pādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratyena nirvana. When our senses are purified, tat-paratyena, for the sake of Kṛṣṇa, when our senses are employed for the sake of Kṛṣṇa, that is purified senses. hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanam bhakti-rīcchate.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts acting for one's own sense gratification with acting for Krishna's satisfaction, stating that the latter leads to spiritual advancement.

That is wanted. So, here, in the beginning, Arjuna is thinking in terms of his blunt senses. But the same thing he will do. He will do. ātyam tṛtaṁ atindriyaḥ purified senses. Just try to understand. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Arjuna is now thinking yad rājya-sukha-lobhena. For the matter of getting kingdom and sense gratification, I am going to kill my kinsmen. So it is great sin. That's a fact. If the warfare, in the Kurukṣetra battlefield, was for Arjuna's sense satisfaction, then it was a great sin. But actually it is not being done for Arjuna's satisfaction. It is to be done for Kṛṣṇa's satisfaction. So therefore the conclusion should be that whatever we do, if we do it for our own sense satisfaction, that is mahāpā, sinful activities. But if we do the same thing for Kṛṣṇa's satisfaction, that is spiritual advancement. This is the

**Summary:** The speaker explains that perfection of life is achieved by acting for the satisfaction of Krishna according to one's prescribed duties within the varnasrama system.

difference. You have to change, the consciousness, what you are doing, for whom you are doing, for yourself or for Kṛṣṇa. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And that is the perfection of life. In whatever position you are, whatever you are doing, it doesn't matter. That is confirmed in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. adapyaṁ vīdīyaśreṣṭa-varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ sānuṣṭhitaśya-dharmanāṁ saṁsiddhī-haritauśanaṁ haritauśanaṁ means to satisfy the Supreme Lord. That is perfection. It doesn't matter what you are doing. varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaṁ. First of all, whatever doing, it does not mean whatever nonsense you are doing. That will be accepted. No. varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaṁ. God is the one who makes you happy. So that's the definition of varṇāśrama. According to Vedic civilization, there is division of varṇa. Brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūrya. So activities must be done according to the varṇāśrama prescription. A brāhmaṇa is ordered to do like this: Satyamādhama titikṣhā, aryava. So that is, therefore, it is called varnāsana. The prescribed duties are already there. Therefore perfect human society means, first of all, there must be this division: Brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya. And when they act the duties of that particular position, brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa, that is perfection of life. It doesn't matter whether you are a śūdra or you are brāhmaṇa, but if you act for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa according to the prescription of your position, then your life is perfect. That is wanted.

**Key Quote:** "Although superficially it appears that Kṛṣṇa is engaging Arjuna to fight in the sinful activities. No. That is not sinful. Whatever Kṛṣṇa does, it is not sinful. It is transcendental. The most pure activity."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that human civilization should be based on the principle of satisfying Krishna, and that Kṛṣṇa's actions are transcendental and not sinful.

The whole human civilization should be based on this principle. There must be division. The division is already there. They should be coordinated. Systematized. Not that everyone is brāhmaṇa. Brāhmaṇa means the intelligent man. So we should pick up the intelligent man. They should be trained as brāhmaṇa. Those who are martial, having fighting spirit, they should be selected as kṣatriya. Those who are for increasing money, mercantile mentality, they should be also collected. Similarly, śūdras. And they should be trained, everyone, to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. Varnāsamo vibhāgasaḥ sānuṣṭitasya dharmasya saṁsiddhiḥ hṛtośaḥ. So here Arjuna is a fighter. He is engaged in fighting. Now he is thinking that is proper. He is Vaiṣṇava. He is devotee. He is properly thinking that for my sense gratification, I am going to kill my kingdom. What a great sinful activity I am going to do. But actually Kṛṣṇa is not engaging His devotee to act sinfully. No. That is not Kṛṣṇa's business. Although superficially it appears that Kṛṣṇa is engaging Arjuna to fight in the sinful activities. No. That is not sinful. Whatever Kṛṣṇa does, it is not sinful. It is transcendental. The most pure activity. Therefore one, the rascals who do not understand Kṛṣṇa, they say that Kṛṣṇa is immoral.

**Summary:** The speaker defends Kṛṣṇa's actions against accusations of immorality, using the analogy of the sun purifying even impure things.

They do not know what is Kṛṣṇa and what is Kṛṣṇa's action. They do not know. They think, now Kṛṣṇa is engaging Arjuna to fight, it is immoral. Why Kṛṣṇa should engage Arjuna in the fighting business? So therefore, or why Kṛṣṇa is engaged in dancing with the gopīs, their wives and sisters of other men? It is sinful. If we enjoy with other's wife or other's daughter or other's sister, who is not bona fide my wife, if I want to enjoy life, that illicit sex. Kṛṣṇa is not doing that. But artificially, those who are nonsense, they say that Kṛṣṇa is dancing at dead of night with other's daughters and girls. Therefore He is immoral. But that means He does not know what is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa can do anything. Tejiya-sāṅga-nadośāya. He, just like the sun, is very powerful. As we see in this material world, the sun, a material thing, and it is very powerful. But the sun is soaking water, taking water from the sea as well as from filthy place. See, He is also taking, what is called soaking? Evaporating, yes. Evaporating water from urine also. And fill the place where ditches. He is evaporating water as well as from the sea. But it does not mean by evaporating water from the sweat, ditch and urine, the sun is becoming polluted. No. Rather He is turning that place, what is called, prophylactic, antiseptic, by His sun sign. Similarly, even though somebody comes to Kṛṣṇa with some purpose which is not moral, but the man or woman who comes there, he becomes, he or she becomes purified.

**Summary:** The speaker criticizes those who misunderstand Kṛṣṇa and His activities, particularly the rāsa dance, and emphasizes that it should not be discussed among fools.

And Kṛṣṇa does not become immoral. This science has to be known by the rascals before calling Kṛṣṇa immoral. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says in the Bhagavad-gītā, manuṣyānāṁ śāśay su kaścid yatati siddhaya, yatatāṁ api siddhānāṁ kaścid vetti mām tattvaḥ. These rascals, they do not know what is Kṛṣṇa. They think Kṛṣṇa is ordinary man. Why He is engaging Arjuna in the fighting? Why He is dancing with others, daughter and girls? These are immoral things. Therefore this rāsa dance should not be discussed among the fools and rascals. They misunderstand. Although the professional reciters, they take part. Whenever they speak of bhāgavata, they easily jump over this rāsa dance. That is not to be done. Caitanya Mahāprabhu never indulged in such thing. For months of April, He engaged Himself in saṅkīrtana. And when Kṛṣṇa's dealing with the gopīs were discussed, He was discussing amongst three selected devotees: Rāmānanda Raya, Śarūpa Dāmodara and Śikī Mahīta. He had thousands and thousands of devotees. But He never discussed Kṛṣṇa's rāśrīla in the mass of people, never. That word is restricted.

**Key Quote:** "Kāma means lust. What is lust? Lust means whenever you try to satisfy your senses, that is called lust. And the same, whenever you try to satisfy Kṛṣṇa's senses, that is love."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that Kṛṣṇa is not immoral and is not engaging Arjuna in sinful activities, and that the difference between lust and love is whether one is satisfying their own senses or Kṛṣṇa's.

Kṛṣṇa, because they will misunderstand. These rascals, they do not know what is Kṛṣṇa, and they will misunderstand. They will be polluted. Of course not polluted, because they, after all, they will hear about Kṛṣṇa. But they may misunderstand. That is against their making progress through the spiritual life. So Kṛṣṇa is not immoral. Kṛṣṇa is not engaging Arjuna to commit such sinful activities, sajanaṁ hatyā. No. Kṛṣṇa is engaging him in His service. So one has to understand that. So when Arjuna will understand that this war, this fighting, is not for my sense gratification, it is for Kṛṣṇa's sense gratification, then he agrees, because he is a devotee. Kariseva-canantaḥ. Yes, I shall now act. This is the proposition. The ātma-indriya-tṛpti-vañca-dhare tārṇāṁ kāmaḥ. Kāma means lust. What is lust? Lust means whenever you try to satisfy your senses, that is called lust. And the same, whenever you try to satisfy Kṛṣṇa's senses, that is love. Practically the same business, but personal and Kṛṣṇa's. So the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means we have to act everything for Kṛṣṇa under proper direction.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of acting for Kṛṣṇa under proper direction and the necessity of guidance from a spiritual master.

We cannot manufacture that I am doing for Kṛṣṇa. Then there is another misleading. Therefore we require the guidance of the spiritual master. Kṛṣṇa, guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya. That is caitanya-caitāmṛta. You have to seek the mercy both of Kṛṣṇa and guru. Not that you have become so advanced that you are directly in connection with Kṛṣṇa and whatever you are doing it is mercy. No, don't think like that. It must be guided, it must be confirmed by guru. Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya-pāya-bhakti-latā-vīr. Bhakti line is there. So our business is, Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is that we have to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. That reference by that professor Zenner, that one robe, he did by his whims and he alleged that after reading Bhagavad-gītā violence he committed this violence. So did he take permission from Kṛṣṇa or Kṛṣṇa's representative? But he does not know the technique. He has unnecessarily accused, committed a great offense to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. So therefore an inexperienced person, they should not try to teach Bhagavad-gītā to others because he has no knowledge. This knowledge has to be received by paramparā system, evaṁ paramparā-prāptam evaṁ rāja-śaya-vidu.

**Summary:** The speaker warns against hearing about Kṛṣṇa from non-devotees, as it can lead to misunderstanding, and reiterates that Kṛṣṇa engages Arjuna to serve His purpose.

So simply by academic career, by knowledge of ABCD, you cannot understand Bhagavad-gītā. In the Bhagavad-gītā it is said, bhaktosī priyosī, without becoming bhakti. Therefore Sanātana Gosvāmī has proven that don't hear anything about Kṛṣṇa from a person who is not a Vaiṣṇava. Ā Vaiṣṇava mukha-gīnā pūta hari-kathā mṛtam śrava-naṁ na katham. This is private. You cannot hear. Because this audience of the students, they also do not know that here is a rascal, he is not a devotee. He is not a Vaiṣṇava. Why should we hear from him Bhagavad-gītā? The first condition is bhaktosī. And the prohibition is also by ācāryas. Ā Vaiṣṇava mukha-gīnā pūta hari-kathā mṛtam śrava-naṁ na katham. Pūta hari-kathā mṛtam. Hari-kathā, talks of Kṛṣṇa, they are by themselves pure. But still it is prohibited that if it is spoken by a ā Vaiṣṇava, non-devotee, one should not hear, should not hear. Must immediately reject. First of all we have to see who is going to speak about Kṛṣṇa. Is he a devotee of Kṛṣṇa? Is he a Vaiṣṇava or not? If he is not, then immediately reject. Oh, we are not going to hear from him. But people do not know. Any rascal speaking about Bhagavad-gītā, we hear. That is not the process. Then we will misunderstand. Ā Vaiṣṇava mukha-gīnā. Śarpa-kṣiṣṭa-paryoja-tā. Just like milk is very good food, everyone knows. But when it is touched by the tongue of the serpent, it is positive, immediately. So we cannot drink poison. Don't hear Bhagavad-gītā or any talk about Kṛṣṇa from a person who is not a Vaiṣṇava, who is not a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. We will misunderstand. Just like what they will say. Then we will say, oh, Kṛṣṇa is engaging Arjuna for fighting, for committing so many sinful activities. No, that is not the fact. Kṛṣṇa is engaging Arjuna, fighting, to fighting, just to serve His purpose. Paritrāṇāya sādhunāṁ vināśāya ca duṣṭhṛtaḥ.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada reads and translates Bhagavad Gita verse 1.43, emphasizing the consequences of destroying family traditions.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya. Reading from Srimad Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 1, Observing the Armies on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, Verse number 43: Utsanna kula-dharmāṇāṁ manuṣyāṇāṁ janārdana narake niyatam vāso bhavatīty anuśuśruma. Translation and purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada: O Krishna, maintainer of the people, I have heard by disciplic succession that those who destroy family traditions dwell always in hell. Purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada: Arjuna bases his argument not on his own personal experience but on what he has heard from the authorities; that is the way of receiving real knowledge. One cannot reach the real point of factual knowledge without being helped by the right person, one who is already established in that knowledge. There is a system in the varnasrama institution by which one has to undergo the process of ablation before death for his sinful activities. One who is always engaged in sinful activities must utilize the process of ablation, called the Prayaschitta. Without doing so, one surely will be transferred to the left path. One who is engaged in sinful activities will not be transferred to the right path. One who has been engaged in sinful activities should be transferred to hellish planets in order to undergo a miserable life as a result of sinful activities. This is Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada's purport. O Krishna, maintainer of the people, I have heard by disciplic succession that those who destroy family traditions dwell always in hell.

This is meant for the human being, Manuśyāna, not for the animals. So unless the human society accepts that, these principles of varnasana-dharma, ordained by Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, is not considered amongst the human beings, they are as good as animals, because there is no regular, systematic principles.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada introduces the concept of Sadhya-Sadhana (goal and means) and mentions Caitanya Mahaprabhu's inquiry about the aim of life.

of how to live as a human being. Therefore in the Viṣṇu Purāṇa, when Caitanya Mahāprabhu was talking with Rāmānanda Rāya, so Caitanya Mahāprabhu inquired, what is the actual aim of life? Sādhya-sādhana. Sādhya and sādhana. What is the aim? Sādhya means what for this human form of life we have got. That is called sādhya, the goal, the goal of life. And sādhana. Sādhana means the activity by which we can attain, we can achieve that goal of life. This is called sādhya-sādhana.

**Key Quote:** "Why this living entity is wandering, not fixed up? So there must be some goal. He is hankering after that. There must be some goal of life."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada critiques Darwin's theory, emphasizing the lack of understanding of the goal of life and the transmigration of the soul.

Taking some hints from the Padma Purāṇa, Brahma Vaibhata Purāṇa: Asyadeṁ saturāṁ caiva jīva-jātiṣu. Lakkhāṁ stāṁ jīva-jātiṣu. There are 8,400,000 types of jīva-jāti. Asyadeṁ saturāṁ caiva lakkhāṁ stāṁ jīva-jātiṣu. This is already there. Brahmadvī. In this way, the living entity is wandering in the cycle of transmigration of the soul. So from this, Mr. Darwin might have taken some hints, but he could not explain properly. He could not catch up that Brahmadvī, who is wandering. So it is a chaos. So anyway, why this living entity is wandering, not fixed up? So there must be some goal. He is hankering after that. There must be some goal of life. To achieve that goal of life, that is called śādhya. Why we are struggling here? For happiness or something else, we are struggling. So this question was raised by Caitanya Mahāprabhu. What is the goal of life? Unless there is goal of life, why is there struggle? Why is there? There must be some goal of life, śādhya. And śādhana. śādhana means the means by which we can achieve that goal of life. That is called śādhana.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada contrasts modern opinions with Vedic principles, highlighting Caitanya Mahaprabhu's humility when questioned about his practices.

So Rāmānanda Raya quoted, because when there is talk between two learned persons, they, just like nowadays, it has become a fashion, in my opinion, I think in this way. What nonsense? Why you can think? What is your knowledge? But he is very proud. Everyone writes that. The other day, Sir Alistair, Alistair Hardy came. He also said, it is my opinion. Nobody thinks that he is a nonsense number one. What is the value of his opinion? Nobody thinks. But this is the Vedic principle. Even Caitanya Mahāprabhu, when he was asked by Prakāśananda Sarasvati, that you are a sannyāsī, you do not engage yourself in the study of Vedānta. You are simply chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa. So, because sannyāsī is supposed to be always reading Vedānta philosophy especially and all other philosophies. So what is this that you are chanting? Like a sentimental person. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied,

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada emphasizes the importance of humility, citing Caitanya Mahaprabhu's example and verses from Caitanya Caritamrita about considering oneself lower than a worm in stool.

yes, my Guru Mahārāja, spiritual master, saw me a fool number one. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu, it was known to Prakāśananda Sarasvati was a great learned scholar in his student life. So he is posing himself as a fool number one. So, this is the way, Caitanya Caitāmṛta, the author of Caitanya Caitāmṛta, he is presenting himself as, puriṣer ki thaita muhiṣe logiṣṭa, I am lower than the worm of the stool. Puriṣer ki thaita muhiṣe logiṣṭa, logiṣṭa means lower. Lowest. Jagai madhāi haite muhiṣe pāpiṣṭa. Jagai madhāi was taken. They are drunkards, woman-hunters, therefore they are sinful. So Caitanya Caitāmṛta, the author, says that jagai madhāi haite muhiṣe pāpiṣṭa. Although, this is the way, nobody thinks himself as, one has become very big man, and he has his own opinion to give. This is rascala. Everyone should think that, I am a pig, what is my value? That is really large.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada continues to stress humility, stating that one should always consider oneself a fool and avoid giving personal opinions without authoritative support, referencing Arjuna's example.

Humble and meek. Nobody should think that, now I have learnt everything. I can surpass everyone. I have become above all rules and regulations. Now I have become paramāṁśa. This is rascala. Everyone should always think as a fool number one. Therefore, they never will go on to become perfect. If we think that, now I have become perfect, paramāṁśa, then the spiritual regulatory principles will never be followed, and he will fall down. So, here Arjuna also says, nara ke niyataṁ vāsa bhavati iti anuśuṣyumaḥ Krishna, I have heard it from authoritative sense. He never says, Krishna, in my opinion, if it is done like that, then people will go to hell. He does not give his own opinion. He says, iti das anuśuṣyumaḥ abhā. This is called paramāṁśa-siṣṭha. Nobody should give his own opinion. He must quote the authoritative statement to support his proposition.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that the aim of life is to satisfy Krishna, drawing an analogy to citizens satisfying their government.

So similarly, when Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked, what is the aim of life? And how to achieve it? So Rāmānanda Rāya, he did not give his own opinion. That in my opinion, like this. Here also, Arjuna says, iti anuśuṣyumaḥ I have heard it. Heard it means, suṣyumaḥ means heard from authority. So Rāmānanda Rāya said, that, the real purpose of life, goal of life, is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of God. Just like, as we are citizens, what is our duty? We want to satisfy the authority, the government. When one serves the government nicely, in this country, he is recognized as knight, he is recognized as Earl, as Lord, as, so many, they have got titles. Every country, when a person is a very exalted citizen, then he is recognized by the God. So if this is the system in our ordinary life, then, the aim of life should be to satisfy the supreme governor or supreme God.

It is very common sense. But they have no supreme God. They think, whatever government we make, that is fine. No. There are so many kingdoms, so many planets. In each planet, there is government, there is authority, and above all of them, there is the supreme authority, Krishna, Isvara Parama Krishna, Svacchidananda Vidra. This is the Shastric Indian. There are many controllers. In this planet, there is controller. There is another planet, another planet. Even Brahma is the controller of the whole universe. Just like in our government, there is system. One department, several departments is being managed by another director. Several directors are being managed by another secretary. And the same system. Krishna is the supreme proprietor. Sarva Loka Maheswara. And he has got many secretary's assistants. They are called Brahma. So Brahma means the manager of one Brahma universe.

Bhuvol. Gol means round. I have heard that before the science, people were under the impression that this world is square. But this world is square. Is it not? Flat. Flat. Yes.

And you can see also the sky is round. This is the wall of this universe. So anyway so as we are here in this small government our business is to satisfy the government. You publicly suppose the queen is a prostitute. Then what will be? Immediately will be arrested and punished. In your private house you can say nobody will hear. But if you say such thing nonsense in public that is your aim of good citizens. What is the difference between good citizens and outlaws?

destroyed. They have no family. They don't care about what is destroyed. No family life. No taking bath. No what say nothing at all. Irresponsible. I've seen it in Amsterdam. What is that part? Horrible. Exactly. This this what now happening. Utsarna, all destroyed, finished. Kula-dharmana, no family life. Therefore, for human being, it is the duty to understand his position, and it is his duty to satisfy the Supreme Lord, Vishnu. This is the whole plan. Therefore, Ramananda Raya quoted the verse from Vishnu Purana: The varnasrama-carvatam purujena para-pramana. Vishnu-aradhati. Because the aim is to satisfy Vishnu, to become Vaisnava. To become Brahmana is also to satisfy the lower status. You will hear from the Caitanya-caritamrta that our Madhavendra Puri, he was installing deities. So there are many Brahmanas, caste Brahmana born in. So in order to give charge of worship to those Brahmanas, he initiated them to become Vaisnavas.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that Vishnu accepts offerings based on love and bhakti, emphasizing that a Vaishnava leads a regulated life aimed at satisfying Vishnu.

Because without becoming Vaisnava, nobody has got right to worship Vishnu. Vishnu will not accept anything from anyone unless he is devotee. And Vishnu is poverty-stricken that he has come to take from you. He cannot eat. He has no eating means. No, he can't. Why? He agrees to accept our offering just on the basis of love. The Vaishnava loves Vishnu and Vishnu agrees to accept any foodstuff. That bhakti is main thing, not your palatable dish. Vishnu is quite competent to prepare thousand times better palatable dishes than you can offer. But the real thing is bhakti. So Vishnu Aradhana means, that should be the aim of human life. Vishnu Aradhana means one must become a Vaishnava. And Vaishnava means regulated life. Not destroy everything, finish, to become hoax. That is not Vaishnava. Vaishnava means regulated life. Aim to how to satisfy Vishnu.

So whole Vedic scheme is there. How to satisfy Vishnu? Therefore it is said, the ussanya-kula-dharmanam manasranam. In the human life, if they do not follow the regulative principles of family life, family tradition and systematic arrangement of four division of the society, Brahman, Kshatriya, Bhakti. In this way, we can satisfy the Supreme Lord. Our aim is to satisfy the Supreme Lord. And this can be done perfectly, if we follow the regulative principles of jati-dharma, kula-dharma. Jati-dharma means, if you are born in the family of a Brahmana, you have got particular duties. Simply, you have to engage in this. duties. Simply if you think yourself that I am in, I am born in a Brahman family, my duty is all finished. Now I can do whatever nonsense. They think like that. I have spoken. They are very much proud of taking birth in Brahmana family. So when others are engaged in devotional service, they say, oh, you are born in lower family. You have got to do this. We are born in Brahmana family. We have nothing to do. But they do not know that jati-dharma-kula-grhana, utsanna-kula-dharmana. If you are actually Brahmana, you must keep your family tradition.

Otherwise, if you sacrifice everything of your family tradition, just like in your country, the lower family, the lower family is maintained.

Or if they spoil, then no one cares for them. Then their house will be sold and they will be still bigger. No more Lord family. So everywhere, you take politically or socially or spiritually. For human beings, if you want to make your life successful, then you must keep the tradition of Brahmana-kula-dharmana. So our, we are Visnava. Our only tradition is how to satisfy Visnava. That is the tradition of everyone. But especially our Visnava. They must be very alert, very careful how to keep Lord Visnava, Krsna satisfied. That is our only business. You should not neglect it.

Then you will spoil everything. When you have invited Visnava, Krsna, Ekanya, Mahaprabhu to accept your service, you must be very, very careful how to render service. How cleanly, how nicely you have to serve. Otherwise everything will be spoiled. utsanna-kula-dharmana. Visnava's kula-dharma is simply to satisfy. Visnava's kula-dharma is simply to satisfy. Visnava's kula-dharma is simply to satisfy. Visnava's kula-dharma is simply to satisfy. Visnava's kula-dharma is simply to satisfy, Krsna. So in the manuṣana, actually human life begins, when he's ready to serve the Supreme Lord, Visnu. That is human life. Otherwise they are never like that. Therefore, the whole world is in chaos. They are not eager to have Visnu. are simply eager to serve their senses. Godas, servant of the senses. So instead of becoming servant of the senses, you have to become master of the senses. That is called gosvam. If you remain servant of the senses, then you are godas. Kamadinankati dhanakati. That is animal life. And when you become master of the senses, how is it possible? Master of the senses. Now, if you employ your senses always in the service of Krsna, your senses

If you have this vow that I shall not allow my tongue to eat anything except prasadam, it is already controlled. Gosvam. That means to control the senses means to engage the senses in the service of the Lord. This is control. Otherwise, by force, just like the yogis, they try artificially. By some force, they try artificially. But some gymnastics. That may be possible for some time. But if it is, there are many instances, it becomes impossible. Because by force, you cannot control the senses. That is not possible. You must give better and just better. If I force, you think that I shall control my tongue, I shall control my eyes, I shall control my eyes, or I shall control my belly. Artificial. But maybe possible. But sometimes. But they are so strong. The senses are so strong. Artificially, it can have this power. Param drstasyam. Stated in the Bhagavad-gita. That is, give the senses better engagement. Then you can control. Risi-kena risi-kesa sevana-dvaha sarva-pādipi-nenmukta-tattva-tena. You have to purify the senses. How? By engaging the senses in the sarva-paratvena. In fact, then you will be able to purify the senses. And purified senses, when you are engaged in the service of the Supreme, that is called bhakti. So if we are actually human beings, manushyana, pulo-dharma, this family tradition is not meant for the cats and dogs. If you live life, cats, no question of family tradition. But if you live one life, you will be able to purify the senses. That is called bhakti.

Risi-kena risi-kesa sevana-dvaha sarva-pādipi-nenmukta-tena. So if you want to live like human beings, manushyana, then this system must be karyatā puruṣiṇa-paraptam āyata-manjmaya-sviṣṭhaṁ dhuna-gana-vihāgya, then society must be divided into four classes. As we have got, four divisions in the Mahākārīya, Vaisya, Śūdra must be there. And each one should serve according to his guṇa, karma, quality and capacity to work. Yes. it is organized, position will be perfect, there will be peace, no war, nothing on the side, and gradually making progress back to conduct, otherwise it will become at the present moment.

**Key Quote:** "Kṛṣṇa will fulfill your material desires and at the end will give shelter at His lotus feet."
**Summary:** Worshipping Krsna fulfills material desires and ultimately leads to shelter at His lotus feet, unlike worshipping demigods which provides temporary and finite benefits.

People generally go to temples and churches for mitigating some material wants. Even if you have material desires, still you take shelter of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa will fulfill your material desires and at the end will give shelter at His lotus feet. This is the advantage of devotion and service. Whereas if you worship other demigods, you may get some temporary benefit, but at the end the benefit will be finished, you will be finished, and the demigod who has given you the benediction, he will also be finished. But even if one has got some material desires to be fulfilled, if he worships Kṛṣṇa, those desires will be fulfilled. At the same time, he will get shelter under the lotus feet of the Lord.

Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding, namely Brahman, or the impersonal all-pervasive spirit; Paramatma, or the centralized aspect of the Supreme within the heart of all living entities; and Bhagawan, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Krishna. In the Srimad Bhagavatam, this conception of the Absolute Truth is explained thus: vadanti tattva vidas tattvam yajnana madhvayam brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavaneti shabdhyate. The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the knower of the Absolute Truth, and all of them are identical. Such phases of the Absolute Truth are expressed as Brahman, Paramatma, and Bhagawan. These three Divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun, which also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun's surface, and the sun planet itself. One who studies the sunshine only is the preliminary student; one who understands the sun's surface is further advanced; and one who can enter into the sun planet is the highest. Ordinary students who are satisfied by simply understanding the sunshine, its universal pervasiveness, and the glaring effulgence of its impersonal nature may be compared to those who can realize only the Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth. The student who has advanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to knowledge of the Paramatma feature of the Absolute Truth, and the student who can enter into the heart of the Sun planet is compared to those who realize the personal features of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Therefore, the bhaktas, or the transcendentalists, who have realized the Bhagawan feature of the Absolute Truth are the topmost transcendentalists. Although all students who are engaged in the study of the Absolute Truth are engaged in the same subject matter, the sunshine, the sun disc, and the inner affairs of the Sun planet cannot be separated from one another, and yet the students of the three different phases are not in the same category. The Sanskrit word Bhagawan is explained by the great authority Parashara Muni, the father of Vyasa Deva: the Supreme personality who possesses all riches, all strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge, and all renunciation is called Bhagawan. There are many persons who are very rich, very powerful, very beautiful, very famous, very learned, and very much detached, but no one can claim that he possesses all riches, all strength, etc., entirely. Only Krishna can claim this because he is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No living entity, including Brahma, Lord Shiva, or Narayana, can possess as fully as Krishna. Therefore, it is concluded in the Brahma Samhita by Lord Brahma himself that Lord Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one is equal to or above him. He is the primeval Lord, or Bhagawan, known as Govinda, and he is the supreme cause of all causes. There are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagawan, but Krishna is the Supreme because none can excel him. He is the Supreme person, and his body is eternal, full of knowledge, and Bliss. He is the Primeval Lord Govinda and the cause of all causes. In the Bhagavatam also, there is a list of many incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but Krishna is described as the original Personality of Godhead from whom many, many incarnations and personalities of Godhead expand. Krishna is the one who is eternal and full of knowledge and bliss; he is the Supreme personality whom many incarnations and personalities of Godhead expand. इंद्राहारी व्याकुलम लोकम रदयन्ति युगे युगे All the lists of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either plenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the Supreme Godhead, but Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. Therefore, Krishna is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, the source of both the Supersoul and the Impersonal Brahman. In the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna's lamentation for his kinsmen is certainly unbecoming, and therefore Krishna expressed His surprise with the word, कुतस, wherefrom? Such unmanly sentiments were never expected from a person belonging to the civilized class of men known as Aryans. The word Aryan is applicable to persons who know the value of life and have a civilization based on spiritual realization. Persons who are led by the material conception of life do not know that the aim of life is really to achieve the goal of life. They are led by the realization of the Absolute Truth, Vishnu or Bhagavan, and they are captivated by the external features of the material world, and therefore they do not know what liberation is. Persons who have no knowledge of liberation from material bondage are called non-Aryans. Although Arjuna was a Kshatriya, he was deviating from his prescribed duties by declining to fight. This act of cowardice is described as befitting the non-Aryans. Such deviation from duty does not help one in the program, nor does it even give one the opportunity to become famous in this world. Lord Krishna did not approve of the so-called compassion of Arjuna for his kinsmen.

### Bhagavan, Krishna, Vyasadeva, Authority of Scripture, Mayavadi philosophy

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada emphasizes Krishna's supreme position as Bhagavan, refuting claims of equality and highlighting the authority of Vyasadeva as an incarnation of Narayana, while criticizing Mayavadi philosophers.

The Supreme Person, Bhagavan, said, "My dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon you? They are not at all befitting a man who knows the progressive values of life. They do not lead to higher planets, but to infamy." So, in this verse, Bayas Dev is writing, of course, the speaking is through, but the original writer is Bayas Dev, for in other shlokas he writes Arjuna Uvaj, Sanjaya Uvaj, like that. Similarly, he could write here Krishna Uvaj. He could write, no, he is writing Bhagavān Uvaj. So, Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By this writing, it is established, see Bhagavān Uvaj. He cannot be equal with Arjuna or Sanjaya or anybody else. He cannot be equal with Arjuna or Sanjaya or anybody else. 심्थ मूर्थ. भगवां ह्रमां। दु अध्यम् पर्स्णेज् हु गर्ण तामा कूब्य। दु अध्यम् पर्णिया भागत गार्णाम। पर्णिया। वह रही है। धर्जठ को ब्लबेयार वही ने डाल रहा था, दुअरे उजदौर ट्रू unrelated to BSVмार. Nobody is equal to him. Nobody is higher than him. Everyone is lower. That is the meaning of Bhagavān. Nobody can claim, "I am Bhagavān." But nowadays there are so many rascals. They are claiming that everyone is Bhagavān. But Vyāsadeva is mistaken. Actually, these Māyāvādī philosophers, they are so great rascals, they sometimes say like that, that Vyāsadeva is also mistaken. They have got the audacity to say, Vyāsadeva is accepted as incarnation of Nārāyaṇa, who has given us the Vedic literature. So many books he has given: The Vedas, the Puranas, Mahābhārata, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Vedānta-Śūtra. Everything is given by Vyāsadeva in writing, and he is accepted, Nārāyaṇa, incarnation of Nārāyaṇa.

### Disciple Succession, Perfect Knowledge, Four Defects, Cheating, Bhagavad-gita

**Key Quote:** "Vyāsadeva is writing śrī-bhagavān vāca where there is no cheating, no imperfection, no illusion, no mistake."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada discusses the importance of disciplic succession for receiving perfect knowledge, contrasting it with the four defects of those in the material world: mistakes, illusion, imperfect senses, and cheating, and emphasizing the perfection of Bhagavad-gita due to its divine source.

There cannot be any mistake in the words of Vyāsadeva. This is the difficulty, if one does not come through the channel of disciple succession. So there, in so many ways, mistaken. Vyāsadeva is above all this. He is not an ordinary writer for material description, for material name and place. He cannot be mistaken, as Bhagavān Kṛṣṇa cannot be mistaken. Similarly, Vyāsadeva, incarnation of Bhagavān, he also cannot be mistaken. Neither devotee of Kṛṣṇa can be mistaken. Devotee of Kṛṣṇa, he does not say anything as his own opinion. He never says what Kṛṣṇa says. He says he may be not perfect, but what Kṛṣṇa has said, that is perfect. Therefore, a pure devotee who does not say anything beyond which was spoken by Kṛṣṇa, therefore his statement is also without mistake. Common man within this material world, he commits mistake. To any human, even big, big personality, they commit mistake, but Nārāyaṇa para, he is transcendental. Kṛṣṇa is transcendental. There cannot be any mistake. There cannot be any illusion. Those who are within this material world, they have got four defects. They commit mistake, they are illusioned, and their senses are imperfect, Brahmapramādvī, and they are cheaters. Because just like modern day scientists and philosophers, they propagate so many branches of knowledge, but when on the question of knowledge, the crucial point, they are caught. They say, "I do not know perfect. I do not know perfect. We are trying to know. In future we shall tell you the perfect." But if you are not in perfect knowledge, why should you take the post of a teacher? If your knowledge is imperfect, then whatever you speak, that is imperfect. Therefore, with this knowledge, therefore with imperfect knowledge, why you should become a teacher? That is cheating. Therefore, purposefully Vyāsadeva is writing śrī-bhagavān vāca, where there is no cheating, no imperfection, no illusion, no mistake. Four things: no mistake, no illusion, no cheating, and no imperfection.

### Vedic Process, Parampara System, Disciplic Succession, Spiritual Master, Order of Guru

**Key Quote:** "The only qualification is that I have tried to execute the order of superior authority, this is the secret of success."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains the Vedic process of receiving perfect knowledge through disciplic succession and emphasizes that becoming a spiritual master requires following the order of a superior authority, rather than personal qualification.

Why you are taking Bhagavad-gītā so seriously? There are so many other books we can read, so many theories, so many philosophers, big, big philosophers, but we cannot take them because they are defective. The author, the author is sure to commit mistake, he is illusioned because his senses are not perfect, therefore imperfection. So with all these defects, we cannot accept anyone's knowledge. This is Vedic process. This is called paramparā system, disciplic succession. We receive knowledge perfectly from the supreme bhagavān, and if I receive the knowledge from bhagavān, and if I distribute the same knowledge as bhagavān has said without any interpretation of my cheating policy, then the knowledge which I distribute, that is also perfect. I may not be perfect, but the knowledge which I have taken from Kṛṣṇa, if I present it as it is without any interpretation, then what I give you, that is perfect. It is very easy to understand. I have given several times, just like a peon has brought a money order for you, thousand dollars. I have given a thousand dollars for you. I have given a thousand dollars just like a peon has brought a money order for you, thousand dollars just like a peon has brought a money order for you, thousand dollars, so he is giving you. So you cannot say, "Here is a peon, he is a poor man, how he can give me one thousand dollars?" He is not giving, the money is sent by somebody else, he is simply handing it over. Therefore, Caitanya Mahāprabhu says āmā rāgdhāya guruhaiyā tāraḥ sarva-deśaḥ tāraḥ sarva-deśaḥ. He is asking everyone to become a spiritual master. So how everyone can become spiritual master? A spiritual master have sufficient knowledge and so many other qualification. No, even without any qualification one can become spiritual master. How? The process is Caitanya Mahāprabhu says āmā rāgdhāya guruhaiyā tāraḥ sarva-deśaḥ tāraḥ sarva-deśaḥ. No, even without any qualification one can become spiritual master. How? On my order. That is the crucial point. One does not become spiritual master by his own wings. That is not spiritual master. He must be ordered by superior authority, then he is spiritual. āmā rāgdhāya, just like in our case, our superior authority, our spiritual master, he ordered me that you just try to preach this gospel, whatever you have learned from me in English. That I have tried to execute the order of superior authority, that's all. The only qualification is that I have tried to execute the order of superior authority. This is the secret of success.

### Sannyasi, Krishna Consciousness, Bhagavan, Impersonalism, Absolute Truth
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/e3SxWTcHSKk?t=1386
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "भगवान means person. भगवान is not imperson."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada defines a true sannyasi as one who works for Krishna without attachment to results, emphasizes that Bhagavan is personal, not impersonal, and explains the three features of the Absolute Truth.

He is actual sannyāśī. सन्यासी does not become simply by changing dress. नौ सन्याशी means he is to work for कृष्णा without taking shelter of the result. It doesn't matter. कृष्णा has order and कृष्णा's representative has order. Therefore I have to do it. कार्यं कर्म करोगे. सा सन्याशी. So here, भगवान वाज. वैस्तिम् दोस्तों नहीं कहते है कि कृष्णा वाज. If you would have said कृष्णा, then people would have misunderstood. He is directly speaking भगवान वाज, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So anyone who is impersonalist, how he can understand भगवाद गीता? भगवान means person. भगवान is not imperson. The absolute truth is manifested in three features: ब्रह्म, परमात्मा, भगवान. ब्रह्म is the beginning, impersonal. सर्वमिदं खुलू ब्रह्मा because just like fire, fire is burning somewhere, but its heat and light is impersonal. Suppose here is big fire, just like we got fire place, that is in one corner, where the whole room you are feeling heat. That heat, that heat, that heat is impersonal, but the fire place where there is blazing fire, that is personal. So impersonal conception is the offshoot of the person. That will be explained in the 13th chapter. मया ततमिदं सर्वम। कृष्णा से That everyone, everywhere I am spread. I exist everywhere. How does he exist? By his energy. That energy is impersonal, but the Supreme Person, he is not impersonal. He is personal.

**Key Quote:** "Full understanding is Bhagavān. Therefore it is stated here, śrī-bhagavān vāca. There cannot be any mistake that is final."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that Bhagavan is the ultimate understanding of the Absolute Truth, criticizing Arjuna's material compassion and contrasting it with the spiritual perspective.

Therefore it is said, स्री भगवान दधार्च। भगवान means who is full with six kinds of appearance. अईशत जब। विशार्चाँ। विशार्चाँ। Richest, the most famous, the most learned, the most beautiful, the most strong, and the most renouncing, he is Bhagavān. So Bhagavān is the ultimate understanding of the Absolute Truth. Just like when you feel temperature, just like we feel temperature from the sunshine, heat, and light. The sun is giving heat and light. Everyone can enjoy the light and heat, but if you trace where from this heat and light is coming, then you go to the sun planet. That is localized. That is not important. And again, if you enter into the sun planet, then you will see the sun gone. We were shunned. So we should not conclude final simply by heat and light. So Brahmā understanding, impersonal understanding of the Absolute Truth is imperfect understanding, partial understanding. It is not full understanding. Full understanding is Bhagavān. Therefore it is stated here, śrī-bhagavān vāca. There cannot be any mistake, that is final. So Bhagavān is criticizing. Arjuna became very good man. Why is he like this? I cannot kill my kinsmen. From material point of view, people will very much appeaset. He is Arjuna, he is so nice, Don't Fourth. He is purgohing. He's claiming. He has gimla. He is asâtrā daa, bow and arrows by legs, lips, teeth. He is no longer fighting. He has decided not to fight with his kinsmen. He has decided not to kill his own man. So from

### Killing vs. Non-killing, Progress of Life, Higher Planetary Systems, Miscreants, Hateful Habits, Aryan vs. Non-Aryan

**Key Quote:** "So, आर्ज्य means must make progress. अनार्ज्य means one who does not know what is progress of life."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada discusses the balance between killing and non-killing in Krishna consciousness, emphasizing the importance of making progress in life and contrasting Aryan and non-Aryan values.

but if a tiger comes to attack you, you must kill, that is self-defense and that is not himself. So a devotee knows, a Krishna conscious person knows when to kill and when not to kill, but it is not that because we accept not killing, therefore in every case killing should be stopped. No. If there is necessity, killing should be accepted. Therefore Arjuna decided not to kill, not to fight, and Krishna says that this is anārya-duṣṭam, this kind of decision is made by the uncivilized rasa. Anārya-duṣṭam. Asargaṁ. Akhirti-karam. So many things. Asargaṁ. Because the aim of human life should be to make progress. That is called Arjuna. Progressing, marching. Now we have got this human form and knowledge. Progressing from the lowest species of life in aquatic, then trees, plants, insects, birds, beasts. Eight million four hundred thousand. Now I have got this civilized form of body. Then my endeavour should be how to make further progress. This further progress is described in the Bhagavad-gītā. That you can go to the higher planetary system. पुर्णंग च्छंति सत्तस्वाः। पुर्णंग च्छंति सत्तस्वाः। Higher planetary system. मद्दे ते संति राशवाः। मद्दे ते संति राशवाः। मद्दे संति राशवाः. In the middle planetary system. Those who are contaminated with the passion quality, they remain without it. जघन्न गुणवित्तिष्ट अधोवच्छंति नामेशाओ। And those who are miscreant, जघन्न गुणवित्तिष्ट, most hatefully accustomed. This is hatefully accustomed: illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling, intoxication. These are habits of hateful nature. अब जघन्न गुणवित्तिष्ट नामेशाओ। जघन्न गुणवित्तिष्ट अधोवच्छंति नामेशाओ। अधोवच्छंति नामेशाओ. They go down. They become animals of the same kinds of lower planetary system. तर अतर नितर पाठार तर अतर रसातर लेकिन. So, आर्ज्य means must make progress. अनार्ज्य means one who does not know what is progress of life. They think there is no life after death. So, I have got this life now. Let me enjoy my senses to the best capacity.

**Key Quote:** "So, in this video, let us get to the bottom of this."
**Summary:** The video introduces the debate surrounding the Rithvik system of initiation in ISKCON and the May 28th GBC meeting as a crucial piece of evidence.

We have been hearing from the supporters of the unauthorized self-appointed Guru system in ISKCON that the Rithvik system was temporary and they also say that Srila Prabhupada said, disciple of my disciple, grand disciple, he becomes regular Guru. These kind of words are loosely bandied about. So, they quote these. Words like disciple of my disciple, grand disciple and these kind of things. And say that because of these words from Srila Prabhupada, Rithvik system is not bona fide. That Prabhupada's disciples are authorized to be Gurus by Prabhupada. So, in this video, let us get to the bottom of this. The most crucial pieces of information. The most crucial pieces of evidence for the Rithvik system of initiations in ISKCON are two in number. Number one, the May 28th, 1977 GBC meeting with Srila Prabhupada. And number two, the July 9th, 1977 directive. So, these words, disciple of my disciple, grand disciple, he becomes regular Guru. These are all taken out of the. May 28th meeting. So, out of these two important pieces of evidence, the May 28th conversation and the July 9th directive. Let us first take up the May 28 GBC meeting.

**Key Quote:** "Tamalkrishna Goswami knew that nobody in ISKCON was qualified to become Guru. And Srila Prabhupada also confirmed his statement."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights a conversation from April 1977 where Tamal Krishna Goswami and Srila Prabhupada discuss the lack of qualified gurus in ISKCON.

So, before we dive into that meeting, let us first understand why this meeting assumes importance and what relevance it has today. When Srila Prabhupada is not physically with us anymore. Because Prabhupada, there are many, many recordings of Prabhupada's conversations. So, what is special about this conversation? To understand this, we have to go back in history to the year 1977. Now, first, let us hear one revealing conversation between Tamal Krishna Goswami and Srila Prabhupada. This conversation took place on 22nd. 22nd. 22nd of April, 1977. People complained again also. Did you know that? I am not sure of the particular incidences, but I have heard generally. In Germany. In Germany. The devotees there. I am coming. That is where we met. The devotees offered me their condolences. Why is 지는 Goodbye. Get well. He followed up. He is the guide here. Therefore, change is good. Therefore, change is social. You know that? I heard that, yes. You are producing some lessons here. Well, I have studied myself and all of your disciples and I... It's clear fact that we are all conditioned souls, so we cannot be glued. Maybe one day it may be possible, not now. Yes. I can do it. Now I am doing. I can say, now I will become a father, you become a father. I am waiting for you. You become all I want. I retire, complete. The train must be complete. So, you heard that from Srila Prabhupada's lotus lips. In April, of 1977, barely seven months before Srila Prabhupada departed from this planet, Tamalkrishna Goswami knew that nobody in ISKCON was qualified to become Guru. And Srila Prabhupada also confirmed his statement.

**Key Quote:** "The key principle here is that to become guru, one must be ordered by one's guru."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that a true guru must be ordered by their own guru, contrasting this with unauthorized or 'rubber-stamped' gurus.

So, let us hear what went on further in the conversation. The process of purification has begun. In the present times, you may have to throw everything away, but in the future, now I will tell you that He did not do that yet. He did not do that. So I have to tell you, He gave me money. He has told me, If you want to become a guru, come. Come to the life of God. You see, we are Gaurīmās. Everyone wants to become guru. And in small temple you have guru. That's all. No obligation, no preaching, simply brings a foodstuff, my Guru Mahārāj, joint mess, place for eating, our ātya khana, joint mess. Exactly. So we see here. Śrīla Prabhupāda emphasized that a rubber-stamped guru won't be effective. The key principle here is that to become guru, one must be ordered by one's guru. In other words, any person ordered by his guru to become guru is authorized. And any person who is not ordered by his guru, but he becomes guru, some or the other. Either by himself or somebody else tells him, or there is a body of some people who give him a no objection to become a guru, some or the other, he becomes guru, then he is not bona fide, he is rubber-stamped or unauthorized guru.

**Key Quote:** "Srila Prabhupada said, it is better to plan for the worst. And he called all the GBCs to come to Vrindavan."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Srila Prabhupada's declining health in May 1977 and his decision to call the GBC members to Vrindavan.

Now, let us move on in history to the month of May in the same year, 1977. This month means that one has to take the terms of Jayasabila and Chandrasurga for every business Day of Ram. What had happened was, by May of 1977, Śrīla Prabhupāda's health had deteriorated considerably. Therefore, devotees had decided to shift Śrīla Prabhupāda to a more salubrious place, so that Śrīla Prabhupāda could recover from his limp念. So, they chose H capsule ministry. H capsule ministry in Uttarakhand? H capsule ministry in Uttarakhand? was the place which was chosen for Srila Prabhupada to recuperate. On the 7th of May in 1977, Srila Prabhupada left for Rishikesh by a night train. Overnight, they travelled from Delhi to Rishikesh. And there in Rishikesh, they had taken a place on rent and some few devotees and Prabhupada was staying there. While they were staying there, on the 14th of May, in the night, there was a fierce thunderstorm. There was a power cut. It was pitch black in the night and there was lightning, thunder and strong winds were blowing the whole night. Devotees were all shaken up. The next day, on May 15th, Srila Prabhupada called the devotees and instructed them, to make his will. So now, this was a clear indication that Srila Prabhupada had decided to leave the material world. Now, the very next day after that, on the 16th of May, Srila Prabhupada again called the devotees. At 2.30 am, Prabhupada was sitting up straight on his bed and he said, if I am going to die, then let it be in Vrindavan. Now, it was more clear what Srila Prabhupada had decided. So, the devotees immediately started making arrangements and maybe they could not arrange train tickets at such a short notice or for whatever reason, they got a car to take Srila Prabhupada to Vrindavan. So the same day, Srila Prabhupada was taken to Delhi by car. And there is Delhi in the evening. They stayed in Delhi for the night. And again in the morning, the next day, May 17th, they left from Delhi by car and went to Vrindavan. And in this way, Prabhupada reached Vrindavan on the 17th of May, 1977. There many of you who would have visited the Krishnabalram temple in the guest house, there is Prabhupada's quarters. And Prabhupada was staying there. Five days after reaching Vrindavan on the 22nd of May, Srila Prabhupada said, it is better to plan for the worst. And he called all the GBCs to come to Vrindavan. So based on this order of Prabhupada on 22nd of May, by May 28th, most of the GBC members had reached Vrindavan.

**Key Quote:** "So we can see that all the five questions that were prepared by the GBC in that meeting on 28 May were all for the time after Srila Prabhupada left."
**Summary:** The speaker outlines the five questions the GBC members prepared for Srila Prabhupada, all concerning the period after his departure.

And they held a meeting in Vrindavan. At that time in ISKCON, there were 23 GBC members. But only 18 were able to make it to Vrindavan for the meeting. After due deliberations in the meeting, the GBC chose five questions that they wanted answers from Srila Prabhupada for the time after his departure. So the 18 GBC members were present there. Noted down the five questions. they wanted to ask Srila Prabhupada. What were those questions? The questions were, number one, how long should GBC members remain in office? Number two, how can GBC members who leave be replaced? So actually, you see, these two questions are relevant only in Prabhupada's disappearance. Because as long as Prabhupada was there, the GBC members were continuing and whoever was leaving, Prabhupada was replacing them. So this question was coming up because in future, when Prabhupada is not there, how will they do it? Question number three, in the absence of Srila Prabhupada, what is the procedure for first, second and sannyas initiations? Question number four, what is the relationship of the person who gives this initiation to the person he gives it to? And question number five, the last question, is there any provision for publication of other translations of Vaishnava scriptures by the BBT after the departure of Srila Prabhupada? So we can see that all the five questions that were prepared by the GBC in that meeting on 28 May were all for the time after Srila Prabhupada left.

**Key Quote:** "Even the question on how initiations were to be conducted in ISKCON were also for the future, when Prabhupada was not there with us."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the GBC's questions, including the one about initiations, were specifically for the time after Srila Prabhupada's physical presence.

Shaila Prabhupada's departure. Until May of 1977, Shaila Prabhupada appointed the GBCs. So, they wanted to know after Prabhupada's departure, how the GBCs would be appointed. Similarly, the other questions are also valid, especially for the time after Prabhupada's disappearance. Even the question on how initiations were to be conducted in ISKCON were also for the future, when Prabhupada was not there with us. Initiations had already been going on in ISKCON for 11 years, from 1966 till 1977. So, what was the need to ask how it would be conducted, unless it was for the time when Shaila Prabhupada was appointed? Shaila Prabhupada had departed when he was no longer with us. Otherwise, this question has no meaning. So, coming back to the meeting, the 18 GBC members then chose 7 senior-most devotees amongst them. These devotees were the ones who had been part of the original 12 GBC members chosen by Shaila Prabhupada in 1970. When the direction of management was formulated, which is how the GBC was born. So, these 7 members were to take these 5 questions to Shaila Prabhupada. In effect, the GBC meeting for these 5 questions was chaired by Shaila Prabhupada himself. Now, let us listen to the recording of this meeting between the 7 GBC members and Shaila Prabhupada. Where these 5 questions were put to Shaila Prabhupada. So, we will listen to that portion of the meeting, which is relevant to questions 3 and 4, which are related to initiations in ISKCON. Question number 3. In the absence of Shaila Prabhupada, what is the procedure for first, second and sannyas initiations? This was question 3. And what was question 4? What is the procedure to initiate, what is the relationship of the person, who gives this initiation to the person, he gives it to? This is the fourth question. A little bit of complicated, convoluted question, but nevertheless, these are the two questions that we will be focusing upon and here is

Yes, they are disciples. I consider. Who? No, he's asking that these Hrithik acharyas, they're officiating, giving diksha. They're the people who they give diksha to, whose disciple are they? They're his disciples. They're his disciples. Who is initiated, his grand disciple, you see. Yes. Then we have a question. When I order you become guru, he becomes regular guru. That's all.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "However, let us try to understand the meeting proceedings a little better."
**Summary:** The speaker begins to analyze the conversation, focusing on the claims made by supporters of self-authorized gurus based on Srila Prabhupada's statements.

He becomes disciple of my disciple. That's it. Now that you have heard this portion of the conversation, the supporters of the self-authorized gurus use the last portion of this meeting, especially the portion where Srila Prabhupada says he is his disciple, he is grand disciple, to claim that Srila Prabhupada appointed them as gurus. However, let us try to understand the meeting proceedings a little better. However, let us take one question at a time. If you all recollect, there were two questions, question number three and question number four. So, let us take one question at a time and see what Srila Prabhupada's reply to it was. Question number three, we will take this up first. What was question number three? Satsvarupa, by the votes of the present GBC. Then, our next question concerns initiations in the future. Particularly, at that time, when you are no longer with us, we want to know how first and second initiation would be conducted. This was question number three, put forth by Satsvarupa Das. Prabhupada responded, yes, I shall recommend some of you. After this is settled up, I shall recommend some of you to act as officiating. Are you ready? This was Prabhupada's immediate response. And Tamalkrishna responded to that. Is that called Rithvik Acharya? And Prabhupada said, Rithvik, yes. Prabhupada actually corrected him. Tamalkrishna Goswami said, Rithvik Acharya. Prabhupada said, no, it is Rithvik. Rithvik, yes. So, with this, the response to question three ended. It is very obvious. And clear, that Shaila Prabhupada's response was crystal clear. And there was no doubt about Prabhupada's response in the minds of the GBC present. So, question three and its response, very clear, no ambiguity. Immediately after this, Satsvarupa Das and Tamalkrishna went on to the next question. So, it is as clear as daylight that Shaila Prabhupada was going to appoint him. He was going to appoint officiating Acharyas or Rithviks, not Diksha Gurus.

**Key Quote:** "If Shaila Prabhupada wanted them to become Gurus, he could have said that he is going to recommend some of them to act as Diksha Gurus or Gurus."
**Summary:** The speaker argues that Srila Prabhupada's intention was to appoint officiating Acharyas or Rithviks, not Diksha Gurus, and that the July 9th directive is not a temporary arrangement.

If Shaila Prabhupada wanted them to become Gurus, he could have said that he is going to recommend some of them to act as Diksha Gurus or Gurus. But no. The moment the question was put to Shaila Prabhupada, how initiations will be conducted in the future, particularly at that time, When Prabhupada is no longer with us, Shaila Prabhupada, without hesitating for a moment, or waiting to think, or considering different options, should we do like this, or should we have this system, or we have that system, there was no such consideration. Prabhupada immediately responded with officiating Acharyas. A clear, straight question and a clear, straight answer. And we all know that Shaila Prabhupada did choose eleven people to act as Rithvik, representative of the Acharya, which, in other words, is officiating Acharya. And when did Shaila Prabhupada do this? He did this in the July 9th, 1977 directive. Hence, the July 9th directive appointing Rithviks is not a temporary arrangement, but it is meant for the time, particularly when Shaila Prabhupada is appointed. It is not a temporary arrangement. But it is meant for the time, particularly when Shaila Prabhupada is appointed. It is meant for the time, particularly when Shaila Prabhupada is appointed.

**Key Quote:** "Shaila Prabhupada's reply to this question can be split into two."
**Summary:** The speaker begins to analyze the fourth question, noting its convoluted nature and splitting Srila Prabhupada's reply into two parts.

So, Question 3 and its response, very clear. There was no doubt in the minds of Tamalkrishna or Satsarupadas. Now, we come to Question 4. This question, as we saw earlier, is framed in a little convoluted manner. They could have asked a clear and straight question. Whose disciple are those who are getting initiated? Instead, they came up with this. Satsarupadas started, reading out the fourth question. Then, what is the relationship of that person who gives the initiation and the he came to only that much, Prabhupada interrupted him. So, this was a complicated question. And, naturally, complicated question will get a complicated reply. So, Shaila Prabhupada's reply to this question can be split into two. So, Shaila Prabhupada's reply to this question can be split into two. So, Shaila Prabhupada's reply to this question can be split into two. So, Shaila Prabhupada's reply to this question can be split into two. In the first part, Shaila Prabhupada gives the principle. The same principle which he mentioned in the April 22nd meeting with Tamalkrishna Goswami, which we have gone through already. So, this April 22nd meeting discussion with Tamalkrishna Goswami happened just about a month before this May 28th meeting. In that meeting, in that discussion, as well as here, Shaila Prabhupada quoted Amar Ajnayi verse and stressed on the fact that without order of the predecessor Guru, no one can become Guru. This is an inviolable principle. So, now, let us see what is Prabhupada's response to Satswaroop Dasa's question. Prabhupada, he is Guru. He is Guru, Satswaroop. But he does it on your behalf. Prabhupada, yes, that is formality. Because in my presence, one should not become Guru. So, on my behalf, on my order, Amar Ajnayi Guru Haya. Be actually Guru, but by my order. So, here, we can clearly see that Prabhupada is reiterating the same principle which he discussed in the April 22nd meeting. April 22nd discussion between Prabhupada and Tamalkrishna Goswami.

### Guru's order, Initiation, Rithvik, Disciple

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Without one's Guru's order, no one can become Guru."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the principle that no one can become a guru without the order of their own guru, as stated by Srila Prabhupada.

Without one's Guru's order, no one can become Guru. Shaila Prabhupada was stating this principle. Another point to note here is that Satswaroop Dasa wanted to ask what is the relationship between the Rithvik and the devotee who is getting initiated. But instead, he ended up asking, what is the relationship between the person who gives initiation and the disciple? Actually, in Shaila Prabhupada's mind, it is clear that there are two people. One who gives initiation, which is Shaila Prabhupada, and the other one who officiates, which is the Rithvik. So, when Satswaroop Dasa asked what is the relationship of the person who gives initiation, and the disciple, Shaila Prabhupada immediately said that he is Guru. What does that mean? The person who is giving initiation, the initiator is the Guru. And the officiator is the Rithvik. Initiator is Shaila Prabhupada and he is Guru. It is very clear, abundantly clear. Now, in the second part of this session, of this conversation, of this reply, Satswaroop Dasa and Tamalkrishna Goswami wanted to clearly know if the disciples are theirs or Shaila Prabhupada's. So, the first part of the reply did not yield the response they were looking for. So, they wanted to see if they can eke out something which they were looking for. Because, in the first part of this reply, Prabhupada only spoke about the principle, Amarajnaya Guruhaya and all that. So, Satswaroop Dasa wanted to clarify. So, Satswaroop, so they may also be considered your disciples. Prabhupada, yes, they are disciples. Why consider who? Tamalkrishna intervened. No, he is asking that these Rithvik Acharyas, they are officiating, giving Diksha. There, the people who they give Diksha to, whose disciple are they? So, you have to understand this question by Tamalkrishna Goswami. Here, Tamalkrishna Goswami sensed the difference in understanding between Satswaroop Dasa and Shaila Prabhupada. When Satswaroop Dasa asked, what is the relationship of the person who gives initiation, he was referring to the officiator, the Rithvik. But Prabhupada, he referred to the initiator, which was himself. So, Tamalkrishna Goswami understood. And he intervened with the clarification that they were asking about the Rithvik, not the one who gives initiation.

### Rithvik Acharyas, Diksha, Disciple, Grand Disciple

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Prabhupada. They are his disciple."
**Summary:** The speaker analyzes the conversation further, highlighting Tamalkrishna Goswami's intervention to clarify the question about the disciples of the Rithvik Acharyas.

And then, to that, Shaila Prabhupada replied as follows, Prabhupada, they are his disciple. Tamalkrishna, they are his disciple. Prabhupada, who is initiating? He is grand disciple. Satswaroop, yes. Tamalkrishna, that's clear. Satswaroop, immediately, he is going to the next question. Then, we have a question concerning, Prabhupada has still not completed. He intervenes. When I order you become Guru, he becomes regular Guru. That's all. He becomes disciple of my disciple. That's it. Now, this appears a little confusing. The moment Shaila Prabhupada said, they are his disciple, Tamalkrishna Goswami and Satswaroop Das felt that the response that they had wanted to hear has now come. They wanted to close the reply and go to the next question. Looks like they were not aware that Shaila Prabhupada had not finished his reply and they ended up interrupting Prabhupada. So, if we remove the interruptions, which are simply repetitions of whatever Prabhupada said, they are his disciple, they are his disciple. Then, Shaila Prabhupada's reply looks like this. Tamalkrishna, no. He is asking that these Rithvik Acharyas, they are officiating, giving Diksha. There, the people who they give Diksha to, whose disciple are they? Prabhupada. They are his disciple. Who is initiating? He is grand disciple. When I order, you become Guru. He becomes regular Guru. That's all. He becomes disciple of my disciple. That's it.

### Initiating, Grand Disciple, Guru, Disciple

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "When I order you become Guru, he becomes regular Guru."
**Summary:** The speaker interprets Srila Prabhupada's response, suggesting that the disciples belong to the initiator (Srila Prabhupada) and that one only becomes a regular guru when ordered by Srila Prabhupada.

So, when we remove the interruptions, the conversation looks like this. Now, in the last part, one option of Shaila Prabhupada's reply is, who is initiating? He is grand disciple. But the phrase, who is initiating? He is grand disciple, doesn't make any sense at all. I am initiating someone. How do I become my own grand disciple? It doesn't make sense. So, what is the other option? The other option is, that it must be, they are his disciple who is initiating. Now, this option, they are his disciple who is initiating, makes perfect sense and is completely in sync with what Shaila Prabhupada said earlier, that the disciples are his. He is the initiator and whoever is initiating, the disciples belong to him. There are two people here. One is the initiator. The other is the officiator. Shaila Prabhupada is the initiator and Tamalkrishna Goswami, Satsarup Das and others were going to become the officiators. So, whose disciple are they? They are the disciples of the initiator who is giving the initiation, which is Shaila Prabhupada. So then, the conversation looks like this. Let us take a look at it in light of this. Tamalkrishna, now, he is asking that these Ritvik Acharyas, they are officiating, giving Diksha. There, the people who they give Diksha to, whose disciple are they? Prabhupada. They are his disciple who is initiating. He is grand disciple. When I order you become Guru, he becomes regular Guru. That's all. He becomes disciple of my disciple. That's it. Now, the conversation is beginning to make sense. This means, Prabhupada goes on to clarify that only when he orders someone to become Guru, saying you become Guru, then only he becomes Guru and the question of disciple of Prabhupada's disciple arises. Prabhupada is again stating the same principle, Amarajnaya, which Prabhupada spoke in the first half of the reply, which we have already seen. So, now, the entire thing makes perfect sense. Otherwise, you see, a few seconds earlier, when Satsarupadas asked, so, they may also be considered your disciples. When Satsarupadas asked this, what was Srila Prabhupada's reply? Srila Prabhupada replied, yes, they are disciples. Why consider? To think that Srila Prabhupada first said that the disciples are his and then changed it to disciple of his disciple in a matter of few seconds does not make sense at all. However, when we see that Srila Prabhupada is stressing that the disciples are his and that they can become their disciple only when he orders, it becomes crystal clear that Srila Prabhupada is consistent throughout the discussion.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that Srila Prabhupada did not order anyone to become a disciple of a disciple or to become a guru, emphasizing the consistency of Srila Prabhupada's statements.

Now that we have understood the real meaning of this conversation, let us go through it once again, beginning with question 3. Satsarupa, then our next question concerns initiations in the future, particularly at that time when you are no longer with us. We want to know how first and second initiation will be conducted. Prabhupada, yes, I shall recommend some of you. After this is settled up, I shall recommend some of you to act as officiating Acharyas. Tamalkrishna, is that called Rithvik Acharya? Prabhupada, Rithvik, yes. So, here the reply to question 3 ended. So, Prabhupada is going to appoint a Rithvik. Appoint only Rithviks, not Diksha Gurus. Then Satsarupa starts with question number 4. Satsarupa, then what is the relationship between the person who gives the initiation and the... So, he said, who gives the initiation. He did not say who officiates. So, because he used the word initiation, Prabhupada replied, he is Guru. He is Guru. Meaning, the person who gives the initiation, which is Prabhupada, is the Guru. But Satsarupa has misunderstood. He is thinking the person who is giving initiation is the Rithvik. So, he says, but he does it on your behalf. So, Prabhupada understands that he is now referring to the officiator, the Rithvik. So, Prabhupada says, yes, that is formality because in my presence one should not become Guru. So, on my behalf, on my order, Amar Adnyai Guruhaya, be actually Guru but by my order. So, Prabhupada is stating two principles here. One is, in Prabhupada's presence one should not become Guru. So, anyway, he cannot become Guru. And another principle is, Amar Adnyai Guruhaya, you can become Guru but only against Prabhupada's order. Satswarupa, so they may also be considered your disciples. Prabhupada, yes, they are disciples. Why consider who? So, Prabhupada still has not changed this stance that there is an officiator who will represent Prabhupada and Prabhupada will give diksha and the disciples will be his. So, he is saying, yes, they are disciples. Why consider who? So, Tamalkrishna understood now. Okay, Satswarupa has got confused. So, he, jumped in, clarifying. No, he is asking that these Ritvik Acharyas, they are officiating, giving diksha. They are the people who they give diksha to. Whose disciple are they? Prabhupada. They are his disciple who is initiating. So, you see, Prabhupada is throughout consistently saying the person who is initiating which is Prabhupada, the disciples belong to him. That means disciples belong to Prabhupada. He is grand disciple. When I order, you become guru. He becomes regular guru. That's all. He becomes disciple of my disciple. That's it. So, again, Prabhupada stated the principle. Don't expect that they will become your disciples. When I order you become guru, then you become regular guru. At that time, he will become disciple of my disciple. So, we can see here clearly that when we look at the conversation of the disciples, they are completely free from any sort of confusion. So, now, there is no confusion. It is very clear Prabhupada did not order anyone to become disciple of disciple or to become guru.

### Rithviks, Diksha Gurus, GBC minutes, Srila Prabhupada's signature

**Key Quote:** "It is irrefutable that Srila Prabhupada appointed gurus or diksha gurus or acharyas. He only appointed officiating acharyas or rithwiks."
**Summary:** The speaker argues that even if there was confusion in the reply to question 4, the reply to question 3 was clear: they would be rithwiks, not diksha gurus, and that Srila Prabhupada's signature was essential on the minutes.

Anyway, hypothetically speaking, for the sake of argument, let us say that Srila Prabhupada's reply to question 4 was not clear. Whether the disciples belong to Srila Prabhupada or they become disciples, it is not clear. So, no matter whatever the lack of clarity in the reply to question 4, the reply to question 3, there was never any doubt. It was crystal clear and it was accepted to be so by all the GBC members present there. What was that? That they would be rithwiks and not diksha gurus. None of them had any question. So, it is irrefutable that Srila Prabhupada appointed gurus or diksha gurus or acharyas. He only appointed officiating acharyas or rithwiks. Now, the hypothetical confusion is with regard to only question 4. And what is that question 4? The question 4 is what is the relationship between the rithwik and the person getting diksha or initiation. This is where confusion hypothetically is. It is shown that there is no confusion. Even if such confusion is there, all such confusion was completely cleared by Srila Prabhupada when he chose the first 11 rithwiks through his directive on July 9, 1977. In that directive, Srila Prabhupada not only appointed 11 rithwiks but he also made it amply clear there what is the relationship between the rithwik and the disciple. So, that confusion about the relationship between the rithwik and the disciple was also cleared by Srila Prabhupada on July 9. So, what remains? However, despite the so-called confusion in the response to question 4, here is what the rithwik recorded. Srila Prabhupada said he will appoint several devotees who shall perform initiation in the future even after his disappearance. The disciples they accept shall be their disciples and Srila Prabhupada will be their grand spiritual master. Actually, this is not what Prabhupada said. Anyway, this is what they recorded in the minutes book. The seven members came back and whatever they said got entered into the minutes book. And all the 18 members present there signed the minutes. But, they did not take Srila Prabhupada's signature on the minutes. That was a grave omission. After all, all the devotees in all fairness, in an ideal case, Srila Prabhupada's signature was essential on the minutes. But, they did not take it. Devotees, in fact, did try to take Srila Prabhupada's signature on that minutes. But, see for yourself what happened. This is what happened. He states, Jyadvaita Maharaj did say strongly that I had better get this in writing from Srila Prabhupada. He said this was very important and that it was really not clear. He said that unless it was in writing, it would be contested by devotees later. I was not clear to me. But, Jyadvaita Maharaj insisted that I get it in writing from Prabhupada.

### Tamalkrishna Goswami, GBC minutes, July 9, 1977 Directive, Rittviks, Gurus

**Key Quote:** "Tamalkrishna Goswami stalled, obstructed the demand to get Srila Prabhupada's signature on the GBC minutes."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how Tamalkrishna Goswami prevented Srila Prabhupada from signing the GBC minutes and emphasizes that the July 9, 1977 Directive is the clear instruction.

So, on his advice, I thought he must be right that it was very serious. I went down to Tamalkrishna Maharaj and asked about it. I asked Tamalkrishna Maharaj to please understand that Prabhupada picked the regular gurus when he named the persons who would initiate while he was still with us. Tamalkrishna Maharaj replied that he himself knew very well what Prabhupada intended and that was good enough for him. So, he continues, I tried again to ask him, to ask Prabhupada to sign something, but Tamalkrishna was not willing. So, you see, Tamalkrishna Goswami stalled, obstructed the demand to get Srila Prabhupada's signature on the GBC minutes. Maybe he knew what would happen if they did that. Srila Prabhupada gave clear directions in the July 9, 1977 Directive. Those instructions are unequivocal. We cannot go by what the GBC recorded in the minutes book because it is not countersigned by Srila Prabhupada. Again, for hypothetical argument's sake, if we assume that Srila Prabhupada did indeed want his signature as it was recorded in the minutes of the GBC in writing, one thing is very very clear. The GBC recorded in their minutes that Srila Prabhupada will appoint devotees who shall perform initiations in the future. This is what that recording says. But, did that appointment come from Srila Prabhupada or their grand disciples of Srila Prabhupada? Fact is that the appointment of gurus never came from Srila Prabhupada. Hence, there is no basis for the guru system which was implemented in ISKCON in 1978 nor the one which is currently running. Both are only rubber stamped in 1977 for rittviks not for gurus not for diksha gurus. And in that directive, very clearly it is mentioned that the disciples will be Srila Prabhupada's disciples not the rittviks.

**Key Quote:** "The newly initiated devotees are disciples of His Divine Grace who receives a letter from these representatives giving the spiritual name or the thread."
**Summary:** The speaker reads the July 9, 1977 Directive, highlighting that the newly initiated devotees are disciples of Srila Prabhupada.

And here is that directive. So, this directive was written to all GBC and temple members and it is approved by Srila Prabhupada with his signature on this letter. So, this letter begins Dear Maharajs and Prabhus, please accept my humble obeisances at your feet. Recently, when all of the GBC members were with His Divine Grace in Vrindavan, Srila Prabhupada indicated that soon he would have the purpose of performing initiations, both first initiation and second initiation. His Divine Grace has so far given a list of eleven disciples who will act in that capacity. And then the list of the eleven names was written down in the letter. These were the eleven names. And the letter continues. In the past, temple presidents have returned to Srila Prabhupada recommending the first and second initiation to whichever of these eleven representatives are nearest their temple. After considering the recommendation, these representatives may accept the devotee as an initiated disciple of Srila Prabhupada by giving a spiritual name or in the case of second initiation by chanting on the Gayatri thread just as Srila Prabhupada has done. The newly initiated devotees are disciples of His Divine Grace who receives a letter from these representatives giving the spiritual name or the thread. He can perform the fire ajna in the temple as was being done before. The Devotee who is a devotee of Srila Prabhupada is a disciple of Srila Prabhupada and approved by Srila Prabhupada himself with his trademark signature.

### Krishna Balram temple, Hrithik Acharya, Tamal Krishna, Guru Kripa

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Prabhupada is not well. Besides, I think he is busy. Let's not disturb him with this."
**Summary:** The speaker shares an interaction that happened on the Krishna Balram temple courtyard.

So, in four places in the temple in his diary of late July 1977, he has recorded an interaction which happened on the Krishna Balram temple courtyard. Guru Kripa to Bhagawan Why don't we go and ask Lord Krishna? Let's go and see Prabhupada and clarify this Hrithik Acharya thing. Tamal Krishna to Guru Kripa. Prabhupada is not well. Besides, I think he is busy. Let's not disturb him with this. Let's see the next few days, who also recollect about this Hrithik incident. One of them is Gouridas Pandit Prabhu who recalls in On My Behalf. So Gouridas Pandit next morning, July 8th, if there should be Vyasasans for the Ritwiks in the temples. So July 7th was a conversation where Prabhupada gave all the names, which finally appeared on the July 9th directive. But on the intervening day on July 8th, Tamalkrishna Goswami had further questions to ask, so that when he finally made the July 9th letter, all these things could go in. So, on July 9th, he asked them in the next morning, on July 8th, if there should be Vyasasans for the Ritwiks in the temple. Srila Prabhupada said, no, that would create enmity amongst my disciples. Tamalkrishna Goswami also asked Srila Prabhupada if there could be more Ritwiks in the future. Srila Prabhupada said that more could be appointed by the GBC at Mayapur. Tamalkrishna Goswami asked Srila Prabhupada what to do if a Ritwik falls down and Srila Prabhupada replied that, the GBC could remove them. I told some of the devotees what I heard about this and Yashodha Nandan wrote it down in his diary. So, actually, you see, appointment or removal of the Ritwiks is not a major issue. Because if we need more Ritwiks, how will we decide we need more Ritwiks? It is when there are too many devotees to be initiated and whatever number of Ritwiks we have now, it is not sufficing. So, you increase the number of Ritwiks. It is purely based on demand. And when you have to manage demand and supply, it is called management. And the GBC is a managerial body. It will manage appointment as well as removal of the Ritwiks. And that's why Prabhupada's July 9th directive did not talk about appointing or removal of the Ritwiks because the GBCs could do it.

**Key Quote:** "Tamalkrishna Maharaj was talking about the Ritwik gurus to initiate on behalf of Prabhupada after he leaves the planet."
**Summary:** The speaker shares an interaction that happened on the Krishna Balram temple courtyard.

Then Gauridas Pandit Prabhu continues. On July 8th, Yashodha Nandan Prabhu wrote in his diary, Tamalkrishna Maharaj was talking about the Ritwik gurus to initiate on behalf of Prabhupada after he leaves the planet. And on July 9th, Yashodha Nandan Prabhu wrote in his diary. I heard from Tamalkrishna Maharaj in the afternoon, that Sri Prabhupada had told him to send a letter to all temples to explain the Ritwik system for the future. The next day, on 10th of July, Yashodha Nandan Prabhu wrote in his diary, Tamalkrishna Maharaj had written on behalf of Sri Prabhupada to issue a letter to all the temples to explain the Ritwik system for the future. Tamal Krishna Maharaj comes out of Prabhupada's room and the conversation goes like this. Tamal Krishna Maharaj, Haribol, Yesodha, did you see this? Yesodha, no, what is it? Tamal Krishna Goswami. This is signed by Prabhupada. Yesodha Nandan Prabhu, what does all this mean? Tamal Krishna Goswami. Devotees have been writing to Prabhupada asking for initiations and now Prabhupada has named 11 Ritwiks who can initiate on his behalf. Prabhupada said, others can be added. Yesodha Nandan Prabhu. And when Prabhupada disappears, Tamal Krishna Goswami, they will be Ritwiks. That is what Prabhupada said. It is all on tape. And this is what Gauridas Pandit Prabhu has recorded in his On My Behalf. So you see, Tamal Krishna Goswami said, devotees have been writing to Prabhupada asking for initiations. So actually what had happened, after the May 28th conversation, it was clear to everyone. That Prabhupada was going to appoint Ritwiks. So all the initiations were put on hold. And by July 7th, lot of requests had become pending. And that is how Tamal Krishna Maharaj went and asked Prabhupada, what to do now? May 28th, already Prabhupada had said that he is going to appoint some Ritwiks, but that had not happened. And they did not know what to do now. They were waiting. So Prabhupada then, on July 7th, gave the names for the Ritwiks. So when Tamal Krishna Maharaj said, got it, he told Yashodha Nandan Prabhu, devotees have been writing to Prabhupada asking for initiations and now Prabhupada has named 11 Ritwiks who can initiate on his behalf. And Prabhupada said, others can be added. By whom? Naturally by the GBC. In another testimony by His Holiness Chyavana Swami on his Facebook page on September 7th, 2016, he gave a testimony. According to his testimony, Srila Prabhupada said, I will continue to accept this. I will have millions of disciples and give them my blessings. Even after I am no longer physically present, you may initiate them on my behalf.

**Summary:** The speaker shares an interaction that happened on the Krishna Balram temple courtyard.

To that, Prabhupada added, I will have millions of disciples. This is what Chyavana Swami recalls. Yet another devotee from Srila Prabhupada coined the term Ritwik, which was an article on Vaishnava News Network on December 1st, 1998. One devotee, Pitha Prabhu, recollected in 1998, The fact of the matter was, Srila Prabhupada made himself very clear on how new devotees coming into his movement were to be accepted into it after his disappearance. The word Ritwik was first heard by me from Srila Prabhupada's lotus mouth and His Divine Grace used the term many times during his last two weeks in Vandavan. I remember this clearly. Because I didn't know what a Ritwik was. This is Pitha Prabhu. Another devotee, Lochanananda Prabhu, in his book, Srila Prabhupada's Hidden Glories, he writes, One other thing Pitha Prabhu mentioned in the same letter to Lochanananda Prabhu was that he heard Srila Prabhupada say at least a dozen times in Vandavan in 1977 that initiation should be performed after his departure. by the Ritwik Acharya. So, you can see there are multiple devotees who recollect Prabhupada saying that the future initiations, even after his disappearance, would continue to be done by the Ritwiks. Now, let us see what a third party, a person not connected to ISKCON, had to say on this appointment. This is B. V. Puri Maharaj from Sri Chaitanya Chandra Ashram. This is B. V. Puri Maharaj from Sri Chaitanya Chandra Ashram. This is B. V. Puri Maharaj from Sri Chaitanya Chandra Ashram. He recollects a conversation with Srila Prabhupada that he had in late 1977. B. V. Puri Maharaj, Maharaj, you have established 11 Gurus. There is no harmony. There can be no harmony. Guru must be one. You have selected 11 Gurus. Srila Prabhupada, I have not selected. I have appointed 11 Ritwiks. So, even someone outside of ISKCON was very clear and certain.

**Key Quote:** "Hence, the July 9th directive to carry out initiations in ISKCON is not some temporary order. It is the final order of Srila Prabhupada and ISKCON must follow it."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the crucial significance of the May 28th meeting and the July 9th directive, stating that the Rithvik system of initiation is the final order of Srila Prabhupada.

That Srila Prabhupada appointed Ritwiks, not Gurus. And as we have seen the events leading up to the May 28th meeting of the GBC, it was of very crucial significance. Srila Prabhupada had decided to leave the world and came to Vrindavan for that very purpose. And there he called the GBC to Vrindavan to discuss what directions they wanted for the future of the movement after his departure. It was in that context that the May 28th meeting took place. It was in that context that the May 28th meeting took place. It was in that context that the May 28th meeting took place. And the July 9th directive was an outcome of that meeting as it is mentioned in the opening lines of the directive. Recently, when all of the GBC members were there with his divine grace in Vrindavan, Srila Prabhupada indicated that soon he would appoint some of his senior disciples to act as Ritwik representative of the Acharya for the purpose of performing his duties. Srila Prabhupada indicated that soon he would appoint some of his senior disciples to act as Ritwik representative of the Acharya for the purpose of performing his duties. Srila Prabhupada indicated that soon he would appoint some of his senior disciples to act as Ritwik representative of the Acharya for the purpose of performing his duties. Srila Prabhupada indicated that soon he would appoint some of his senior disciples to act as Ritwik representative of the Acharya for the purpose of performing his duties. Srila Prabhupada indicated that soon he would appoint some of his senior disciples to act as Ritwik representative of the Acharya for the purpose of performing his duties. Srila Prabhupada indicated that soon he would appoint some of his senior disciples to act as Ritwik representative of the Acharya for the purpose of performing his duties. initiation. This is the opening line of the July 9th directive. So, this opening line refers to the recent meeting of the GBC with Srila Prabhupada. So, it is clear that this Rithvik system of initiation was particularly for the time when Srila Prabhupada was no longer with us, because that GBC meeting with Srila Prabhupada referred to in the opening line of this July 9th directive is referring to the May 28th GBC meeting. Hence, the July 9th directive to carry out initiations in ISKCON is not some temporary order. It is the final order of Srila Prabhupada and ISKCON must follow it. Vishwaguru Srila Prabhupada ki jai. Hare Krishna.
