**Key Quote:** "The bull was as white as a white lotus flower. He was terrified of the Shudra."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam describing the bull (Dharma) in the age of Kali, emphasizing its fear and trembling.

In this session we will be discussing from the second verse of the seventeenth chapter of the first canto of Sriman Bhagavatam. Vrisham Vrindala Dhavalam Mehantam Iva Bhyatam Vepamanam Padaikenam Siddhantam Shudra Taditam. The meaning of this verse is, the bull was as white as a white lotus flower. He was terrified of the Shudra, who was beating him, and he was so afraid that he was standing on one leg, trembling and urinating.

**Key Quote:** "The next symptom of the age of Kali is that principles of religion which are all spotlessly white like the white lotus flower will be attacked by the uncultured Shudra population of the age."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the bull represents religious principles and the Shudra represents the uncultured population of Kali Yuga who attack these principles.

So further descriptions of the age of Kali is being given here by Suta Goswami, Srila Suta Goswami. The bull is actually the personality of religious principles, Dharma, in the shape, in the formality, in the form of a bull. The personality of religious principles has appeared in order to give us a message. Now Srila Prabhupada explains what is the significance of this bull being described as as white as a white lotus flower. The purpose, Srila Prabhupada says, the next symptom of the age of Kali is that principles of religion, which are all spotlessly white, like the white lotus flower, will be attacked by the uncultured Shudra population of the age. In the scriptures it is said, Kalau Shudra Sambhavaha, in Kali Yuga majority of the population will be of the Shudra category. Shudra category means uncultured, uncultured. They don't follow the cultural principles.

**Key Quote:** "Without such a purificatory process, the children born will be uncultured, will have criminal mentality."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of cultural purification rituals like Garbha Dhana for conceiving good children, contrasting it with the lack of such practices in Kali Yuga, leading to an uncultured population.

They don't have a system for purification of the contamination due to this age. Just like to beget a child according to scriptural directions or injunctions, one should follow what is called as a Garbha Dhana. Garbha Dhana is a ritual where the parents, before they combine to conceive a child, they undergo cultural purification. They prepare their consciousness to attract a good soul to take shelter of good parents. Without such a purificatory process, the children born will be uncultured, will have criminal mentality. So this is very, very important that the parents should prepare themselves to beget good class of population, to beget good children. Now because in Kalyuga these principles are not followed, so the majority of the population is of the Shudra quality, means uncultured, contaminated by bad qualities like that.

**Key Quote:** "But in Kalyuga, the Shudra class of people who are uncultured, they will not follow the religious principles as it is."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that in Kali Yuga, the uncultured Shudra population defies religious principles due to a lack of education and Vedic wisdom.

So I think this is very important that the parents should prepare themselves to beget good class of population, to beget good children. Now because in Kalyuga these principles are not followed, so the majority of the population is of the Shudra quality, means uncultured, contaminated by bad qualities like that. So the principles of religion are compared to a white lotus flower, means they are spotless, they are perfect. But in Kalyuga, the Shudra class of people who are uncultured, they will not follow the religious principles as it is. So Prabhupada says how they actually spoil the religious principles. Prabhupada says in the purport, they may be descendants of Brahmana or Kshatriya forefathers, but in this age of Kali, for want of sufficient education and culture of Vedic wisdom, such a Shudra like population will defy the principles of religion. They will not follow the principles of religion. They will go against it, or they won't care for it. Or they will say, we don't believe in such and such religious principles. Religious principles are not a question of belief. That is what people should understand. Just like when we live in a civilized state, the state

### State Laws, Religious Principles, Kali Yuga, Vedic Knowledge

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This sort of attitude is killing the whole vitality of the human population in this age of Kali."
**Summary:** The speaker compares following religious principles to obeying state laws, highlighting how defiance and lack of Vedic knowledge contribute to the decline of society in Kali Yuga.

laws are to be followed by all civilized people, all cultured people. Good citizens means they are law-abiding. It is not that I don't believe in some rules and regulations which are given by the state, or I don't like to follow, or I don't think I should care about them, or I just don't bother about them. I do whatever I like to do. This sort of attitude is killing the whole vitality of the human population in this age of Kali. So these are, these kind of people are actually upstarts. They actually are less intelligent, though they pose themselves as very, very intelligent. They may claim like that, that they are very intelligent, because they put forward all kinds of arguments against following religious principles. But they are actually uneducated, uncultured, they are less intelligent, they are foolish, and they suffer the consequences of not taking the Vedic wisdom. They don't have sufficient education in the proper way. They don't have proper system of Vedic knowledge. Neither they have the culture of the Vedic wisdom. They don't have good habits, good practices, good traditions. They don't have any of those. So they will defy the principles of religion. And persons who are religiously endowed will be terrified by such things.

**Key Quote:** "They also harass others who want to follow the religious principles. They will decry them."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how those who defy religious principles harass and discourage those who try to follow them, exploiting the concept of freedom in the name of religion.

They also harass others who want to follow the religious principles. They will decry them. They will put them down. They will harass them. They will trouble them. They will give all sorts of lame excuses for not following the religious principles. And such people, the uncultured, uneducated, less intelligent people, will declare themselves as adherents of no religious principles, and many isms and cults will spring up in Kali Yuga only to kill this spotless bull of religion. That means real religious principles nobody will follow, most people will not follow, but they will declare that they have their own religious beliefs, they are their own religious system that they want to follow because state also gives freedom. Freedom means you can do whatever you like in the name of

### Religious Systems, Animal Killing, Kali Yuga, Secularism

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So why one religious system says you should not kill innocent animals another system will say oh as as far as eating is eating habits are concerned that's the person's choice"
**Summary:** The speaker criticizes the proliferation of unfounded religious systems in Kali Yuga, using the example of animal killing to illustrate the lack of a proper basis for these systems and the secular nature of the state.

religion, so why one religious system says you should not kill innocent animals, another system will say, oh, as far as eating habits are concerned, that's the person's choice. Some people like to eat vegetables, some people like to eat meat, so they will kill animals for eating the flesh of the animal. They say our religious system does not prohibit, your religious system may prohibit, but we don't think it is sinful to kill innocent animals, helpless animals, even though there is plenty of fruits and vegetables and grains without harming any animal you can eat. But no, they don't want, they don't want to restrict themselves, though they also eat fruits, vegetables. If they want to eat vegetables, they don't want to restrict themselves, though they also eat fruits, vegetables. If they like this is our choice, we eat what we like to eat. So this is the nature of the people in Kali Yuga and these different so-called religious systems will be so many curbs without any foundation, without any proper understanding, without any proper basis, irrational, unreasonable sort of arguments or basis, whimsical. They will have their own so-called religious system. The state will be declared to be

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "But in Kali Yuga, in the name of secularism there will be no religious principles which are proper principles which will be followed by people."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the indifference to real religious principles in Kali Yuga, emphasizing the lack of respect for truthfulness, saintly persons (sadhu), scriptures (shastra), and spiritual masters (guru).

secular or without any particular principle of religion. See, the religious principles are not to be based on some people's whims and fancies. That can never be the proper system within a state. But in Kali Yuga, in the name of secularism there will be no religious principles which are proper principles which will be followed by people. As a result there will be total indifference to the real principles of religion. Nobody cares. Like the real religious principle is to tell the truth, but now they don't care whether they are telling the truth or not. They don't care, lies. As it suits them, if they want to tell truth, they want to be truthful, they are truthful. If they don't want to be truthful, they are not truthful. That's all. They don't care. So like this, the indifference to the actual religious principles. The citizens will be free to act as they like without respect for sadhu, shastra and guru. There are three standards according to our Vedic tradition. Sadhu means the saintly persons who are completely well established in following the religious principles and teaching them to the others because they are solidly well established in understanding, getting trained, getting educated, having knowledge, having certain good practices and having a sober mind, such saintly people, sadhu, no regard for them, no respect for them in this Kali Yuga. Shastra is the authentic bona fide scriptures, especially the Vedic literature. People don't care for the Vedic literature, what is explained in the Vedas. The truth, the actual facts of life, of this material world, of material existence, that they don't care. And guru, the bona fide spiritual master, though there are many gurus, but the bona fide spiritual masters are ignored, neglected, they are not given respect. So, the bulls

**Key Quote:** "People don't care for religious principles. Even if there is a deterioration or decline, they just don't bother."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by highlighting the diminishing state of religious principles and the lack of concern for this decline, emphasizing the link between God consciousness and societal peace and prosperity.

standing on one leg indicates that the principles of religion are gradually diminishing and diminishing. Even the fragmental existence of religious principles would be embraced by so many obstacles, as if in the trembling condition of falling down at any time. People don't care for religious principles. Even if there is a deterioration or decline, they just don't bother. They say, don't bring in religion or God when we want to, when we want to point out that the real cause of all problems is this godlessness or irreligiosity. Then they say, don't bring in that, because they have no understanding as to how God consciousness is directly linked up with the peace and prosperity of this human society. That they do not know.

**Key Quote:** "Cow is representing mother earth."
**Summary:** This segment introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains how the cow represents mother earth and the exploitation of resources in Kali Yuga.

In this session, we are discussing from the third verse of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Gaamcha Dharma Dughaam Deenam Prasham Shudra Padahatam Vivatsam Ashruvadanam Ksham Maam Yavasam Ichchateem. The meaning of this verse is, although the cow is beneficial because one can draw religious principles from her, she was now rendered poor and calfless. Her legs were being beaten by a shudra. There were tears in her eyes, and she was distressed and weak. She was hankering after some grass in the field. Earlier, the condition of the bull was described. Now the condition of the cow is being described. Cow is representing mother earth, and how people in Kali Yugaam exploit the resources of material.

**Key Quote:** "It is very very important to protect the cow because one can draw religious principles from her."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the importance of cow protection, drawing religious principles from the cow, and the nutritional value of cow's milk as a complete food.

The next part is a lot more interesting. The nature of the earth, and because of that, there are so many anomalies in this age. So the cow, particularly as an animal in human society, it is very, very important to protect the cow because one can draw religious principles from her. How is that? Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "The next symptom of the age of Kali is the distressed condition of the cow. Milking the cow means drawing the principles of religion in a liquid form." What is the meaning of this? Prabhupada explains further, "The great rishis and moneys would live only on milk. Milk is the only food which is complete, which provides complete nutrition for a human being. There is no other food item which gives natural food item which gives complete nutrition for

a human being except the cow's milk and of course the mother's milk. So the saintly persons would generally live only on milk, and particularly in the Bhagavatam, this is particularly described. Srila Shukadeva Goswami would go to a householder while he was milking a cow, and he would simply take a little quantity of that milk for his subsistence. And Srila Prabhupada particularly says here, even 50 years ago, Prabhupada was writing this purport sometime in the 60s, that means in the beginning of the 20th century, Prabhupada says, "No one would deprive a sadhu of a quart or two of milk." This quart is a volume measure. Quart means about a liter. So no one would deprive a sadhu of 1 liter of milk, and every householder would give milk like water. They would freely supply that milk to the householder and then the milk would be given to the

milk the cow and give it protection. So there was plenty of milk and milk products in every house. So Srila Prabhupada says, "For a Sanatanist, a follower of Vedic principles, it is the duty of every householder to have cows and bulls as household paraphernalia, not only for drinking milk but also for deriving religious principles." The milk is complete nutrition. It is very, very nutritious food, but beyond just that, from the cow you can derive religious principles. How's that? Srila Prabhupada says, "The Sanatanist worships cows on religious principles and respects Brahmanas." The prayer we offer to Krishna: namo brahmanya devaya go Brahmana hita ayutya. Krishna wants to see that the cows and the Brahmanas are given special protection, special protection. In general, the animals and the humans have to be protected by the king, but among the animals, the cows should be given special protection, and among the human beings, the Brahmanas should be given special protection because both the cow and the Brahmanas actually ensure peace and prosperity in

When Krishna performed the Govardhan Leela, he directed the Brijavasis to worship Govardhan hill and the cows and the Brahmanas. So on that day of Govardhan Puja, we specifically worship the cows, the Brahmanas and the Govardhan hill itself. So the human society is totally dependent for its prosperity and subsistence on the cows and the Brahmanas. The Brahmanas give directions, proper direction to the general public and the cow gives the most important foodstuff that is milk for development of finer brain tissues to understand spiritual subject matter. The cow's milk is required for a sacrificial fire because cow's milk is converted to

In the forth chapter Bhagavad Gita, Krishna elaborately explains how sacrifice is linked to happiness for human beings, for human society. Nobody can be happy they do not have the opportunity to be happy in Divine presence. Nobody can be happy if they have no perform sacrifice. Nobody can get their necessities if they don't perform sacrifice. In general, people cannot expect good rainfall if they don't perform sacrifice for Vishnu. Yajna bhavati parjanya. Parjanya means rains. There will be no proper rainfall if one does not perform sacrifice for Vishnu.

**Key Quote:** "But in Kali Yuga, the calves are separated from the cows as early as possible."
**Summary:** This segment describes the natural bond between cow and calf and how it is disrupted in Kali Yuga due to exploitation, particularly the mistreatment of male calves.

Now, further Srila Prabhupada says, the cow's calf, the young one of the cow, not only is beautiful to look at but also gives satisfaction to the cow, and the cow delivers as much milk as possible when the calf is properly protected and the cow is able to have the calf with her. But in Kali Yuga, the calves are separated from the cows as early as possible for purposes which cannot be mentioned in these pages of the Srimad Bhagavatam. They don't want to allow especially the male calves to remain and to survive because a cow may give birth to a male calf or a female calf. But they want only the female calf because they can milk it. Whereas the male calf, they don't know how to utilize the bull, the male calf. When it grows, it can actually produce grains. It can do so many things, so many things. But because they do not know how to engage the bulls, they provide milk to the cow. They give them milk but they don't want to do that. They allow the cow to get the milk of the cow and give them protection and utilize them in a proper way.

**Key Quote:** "These greatly sinful acts are responsible for all the troubles in the present society."
**Summary:** This segment details the sinful acts of separating calves from cows, artificially milking cows, and sending them to slaughterhouses, linking these actions to societal problems.

Therefore, they don't allow these calves to survive, to remain, especially male calves. The cow stands with tears in her eyes and the shuttle milkman draws milk from the cow artificially. The cow will give milk only after the calf has taken its share. The cow will be satisfied to give plenty of milk. But now the calf is not allowed to drink the cow's milk at all, and the calf is separated from the cow very, very early. And how do they make the cow give milk? They force the cow to give milk. They will use a pump, artificial pump to suck out the milk from the cow. The cow is unwilling to give when the calf is not there. And when there is no milk, the cow is sent to be slaughtered. The cow will give milk for some number of years. After it becomes old, it stops giving milk and immediately send it to the slaughterhouse for being slaughtered. The cow is then butchered for cow flesh.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the consequences of sinful acts and violating the laws of nature and God, even in the pursuit of economic development, leading to suffering.

These greatly sinful acts are responsible for all the troubles in the present society. Very, very sinful. To kill the cow, to kill the male calf, doesn't even have a chance of surviving, living its normal lifespan. And people do not understand that this is very, very sinful. It means the laws of nature will work regardless of whether people have belief or people are educated or uneducated. And people have to suffer in so many ways. People do not know what they are doing in the name of economic development. They are just concerned with somehow making money, but they do not realize that while it is not entirely wrong to strive for economic development or earning money, but the way it is done is if it is not in accordance with the laws of nature, the laws of God, then people have to suffer so much.

**Key Quote:** "If you want to be happy as a human being, you should ensure that cows and bulls are protected and they are happy in all respects."
**Summary:** This segment concludes by emphasizing the importance of cow and bull protection for peace, prosperity, and happiness in society, advocating for a Brahmanical culture where cows and Brahmanas are protected.

The consequences of violating God's laws. The influence of Kali will keep the people in this age in the darkness of ignorance. Despite all endeavors for peace and prosperity, they must try to see the cows and the bulls happy in all respects. If you want to be happy as a human being, you should ensure that cows and bulls are protected and they are happy in all respects. Otherwise, if the cows and bulls are not happy, they are not given proper protection, human beings have to suffer and there will be no peace and prosperity in human society where cows and bulls are particularly not properly protected. Foolish people do not know how one can earn happiness by making the cows and bulls happy, but it is a fact by laws of nature. The laws of nature people do not know. They are doing some research to find out. Some research to find out how things are working in nature, but they do not have the authoritative knowledge from the perfect source, from God to the Vedas. Let us take it from the authority of Srimad Bhagavatam and adopt the principles for the total happiness of human society. So Bhagavatam teaches us that we should have this Brahmanical culture, whereby Brahmanas are protected, Brahmanas direct the society and the cows are protected and the cows are giving us wonderful milk and they are happy in every respect, so that there is peace and prosperity in human society.

**Key Quote:** "Pariksit is a qualified Kshatriya. He has got the courage to face such upstarts. He is well equipped to deal sufficient punishment to the miscreants and he has got his authority to enforce law and order."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verses from Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on Maharaj Pariksit's role as a qualified Kshatriya challenging the influence of Kali.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudhirayet. In this session we are discussing from two verses, the fourth and fifth verses of the 17 Chakras, the first chapter of the first canto of Sriman Bhagavatam. The fourth verse is as follows: Paprachya Ratham Aarudhaha Kartasvara Paricchadam Megha Gambhir Raya Vacha Samaropita Karmukaha. The meaning of this verse is, Maharaj Pariksit, well equipped with arrows and bow and seated on a gold embossed chariot, spoke to him, the shudra, with a deep voice sounding like thunder. Pariksit Maharaj came to that spot, he noticed that Kali Purusha was actually beating an innocent carbon bull, and he immediately, with a deep voice sounding like thunder, he questioned this low class, unqualified person, and Pariksit's words will be described in the next two verses. So in the Parpochila, Prabhupada says an administrative head or king like Maharaj Pariksit with full majestic authority, well equipped with weapons to chastise miscreants, can challenge the agents of the age of Kali. Pariksit is a qualified Kshatriya. He has got the courage to face such upstarts. He is well equipped to deal sufficient punishment to the miscreants and he has got his authority to enforce law and order. So he is competent to challenge the agents of the age of Kali.

**Key Quote:** "Unfortunately we don't have qualified Kshatriyas like Pariksit Maharaj in our present time."
**Summary:** The speaker laments the absence of qualified Kshatriyas in the present age and criticizes the ineffectiveness of modern leaders elected through degraded public votes.

And as opposed to this, in the absence of such strong executive heads, there is always disruption of tranquility. Unfortunately, we don't have qualified Kshatriyas like Pariksit Maharaj in our present time. If there is no qualified Kshatriya, then it is not possible to counteract the influence, evil influence of this degraded Kali Yuga. What is that evil influence of Kali Yuga? People are exposed to too much sinful activities. The atmosphere is surcharged with tendency to commit sins more and more without any restriction. So this sinful age, the sinful age Kali Yuga. So the absence of strong executive heads means people become more and more sinful. They are already sinful but they become more sinful without caring for any adverse effect by their sinful activities. They don't realise that. The elected show bottle executive head... Show bottle means he appears like an executive but he doesn't have qualification. He doesn't have strength, he doesn't have courage, he doesn't have knowledge, he doesn't have training, he doesn't have skills. How much he will have, etc, is beyond his level of application. Thus he is a not Ryan Pes politically nominated Kanna Akram started in May protests against the Indian Congress in 2016 before solidifying Akram on份 DNA. Such a person is called show-bottling skater. He is a representative of a degraded public because by votes a person becomes a ruler or a legislator or a governor by votes. And who is voting this person? He gets but he is supposed to get majority votes from people who are degraded themselves. They do not know what should be the qualification of a proper Chhatriya who can rule properly, they do not know. Neither the representative is actually qualified. And Prabhupada says such show bottle executive heads cannot be equal to the strong king like

### Importance of Actions, Pariksit's Questioning, Kali Purusha, Twice-Born

**Key Quote:** "It is one's actions which are counted. It is very important. The actions are important."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of actions over mere appearance, explaining Pariksit Maharaj's questioning of Kali Purusha and introducing the concept of 'twice-born' for Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas.

Maharaj Pariksit. You can never expect the situation now to be like what it was when Pariksit was ruling or Yudhishthira Maharaj was ruling. The dress or style of royal order does not count. It is one's actions which are counted. It is very important. The actions are important. According to the proper understanding a person will perform different activities. So those activities should be backed up by proper knowledge, by good culture. Then only those actions will be good for the welfare of the entire human society. The meaning of this verse is, O who are you? You appear to be strong and yet you dare kill within my protection those who are helpless. By your grace, you pose yourself to be a godly man, that means a king, Naradeva. But by your deeds, you are opposing the principles of the twice-born Kshatriyas. So Pariksit Maharaj is questioning this Kali Purusha, this personality of this age of Kali, that who are you? Because how dare you actually try to kill such helpless, innocent animals like the cow and the bull. Even though you appear like a godly person, a Kshatriya is supposed to be qualified and a god-conscious person. But you are not a godly person. You are a Kshatriya. Your dress is externally appealing like a Kshatriya, but your actions are totally opposed to those activities which are performed by a qualified Kshatriya. So in the Parpotsha Prabhupada says, the Brahmanas, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas are called twice-born, dvija. Dvija means they have two kinds of birth. For the two-born Kshatriyas, they are called the two-born Kshatriyas.

### Second Birth, Cultural Rejuvenation, Kshatriya Duty, Incarnation of the Lord

**Key Quote:** "Second birth is a cultural rejuvenation, reviving the spiritual culture. And how does it happen? It happens by spiritual initiation obtained from the bona fide Acharya, by spiritual initiation."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of second birth through spiritual initiation and discusses the Kshatriya's duty to protect the helpless, connecting it to the incarnation of the Lord to re-establish religious principles.

These classes of men, that is, Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, there is one birth by parental conjugation. Parents combine to conceive a child. That is the first birth. And there is another birth of cultural rejuvenation by spiritual initiation from the bona fide Acharya or spiritual master. So there is always second birth for those who are Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Vedic culture. What is second birth? Second birth is a cultural rejuvenation, reviving the spiritual culture. And how does it happen? It happens by spiritual initiation obtained from the bona fide Acharya, by spiritual initiation. So a Kshatriya is also twice born like a Brahmana. It is not only the Brahmanas who are having this second birth. It is also the Kshatriyas and the Vaishyas. The Kshatriya's duty is to give protection to the helpless humans. The Kshatriya king is considered to be representative of God to give protection to the helpless and chastise the miscreants. It is called Naradeva, because Deva because is the representative of God in human society. He is the representative of God in human society. He himself is a human being but he is meant to give protection to the human society by following the rules and regulations of the authoritative scriptures to administer properly to the human beings. Whereas in Kali Yuga there is no qualified Kshatriya. Whenever there are anomalies in the routine work by administrators there is an incarnation of the Lord to re-establish the principles of the Godly Kingdom. Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, I incarnate whenever there is neglect of religious principles and there is rise of irreligion.

### Incarnation of the Lord, Protection of the Saintly, Destruction of Miscreants, Cow Protection, Nameless Administrators

**Key Quote:** "In the age of Kali, the poor helpless animals, especially the cows, which are meant to receive all sorts of protection from the administrative age, are killed without restriction."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the Lord's incarnations to protect the saintly and destroy miscreants, highlighting the lack of cow protection in Kali Yuga and criticizing administrators who are representatives of God in name only.

I incarnate. And when Krishna incarnates, whenever, wherever he incarnates, paritranaya sadhuna, he actually protects, saves the saintly persons, the law-abiding citizens or those following strict religious principles. And Vinashayaji Dushkrutami, he destroys these miscreants, these upstarts. In the age of Kali, the poor helpless animals, especially the cows, which are meant to receive all sorts of protection from the administrative age, are killed without restriction. Nobody is there to voice the concern for the cows. They are helpless. They are innocent, and they are being killed without any restriction. There is no one to protect them, no one to raise their voice against the cows being killed. Thus the administrative heads under whose noses such things happen are representatives of God in names only. The king is supposed to be a representative of God. But such kings or administrators who are not God-conscious, who have not undergone spiritual initiation, they are actually representatives of God in name only.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore in the age of Kali everyone is unhappy due to the maladministration of the state."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the worthlessness of unqualified leaders, the resulting maladministration, and the general unhappiness in Kali Yuga due to the lack of proper, trained Kshatriya rulers.

That means they are namesake administrators. They are not real administrators. Such powerful administrators are rulers of the poor citizens by dress or office. Simply they dress as if they are kings or administrators, but they don't have the proper knowledge, the proper authority to actually properly enforce the laws and the rules for ruling citizens. Factually they are worthless lower class men without cultural assets of the twice born. They don't have the culture to properly rule over the citizens. No one can expect justice or equality of treatment from once born spiritually uncultured lower class men. We can't expect when by votes some unqualified person comes and tries to carry out the administration, we cannot expect any real benefit. Therefore in the age of Kali everyone is unhappy due to the maladministration of the state. People in general are very unhappy in Kali. Therefore the people's government by the people who are not twice born must be a government of Kali in which everyone is unhappy. You see, people should be unhappy if they don't have a proper leader, proper trained Kshatriya to rule them. People must be unhappy, and there will be no peace and prosperity in such a state.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining that only those detached from material happiness can understand spiritual knowledge and that the materially attached need to be shown the path to transcendental realization.

Namah Om Vishnupadaya Krishna Prishtaya Bhutale Sri Mate Bhaktivedanta Swamin Nithinamine Namaste Saraswate Deve Gauravani Pracharine Nirvishesha Shunyavadi Pashchatya Deshatarine Jaya Sri Krishna Chaitanya Prabhu Nithyananda Sri Advaita Gadadhara Sri Vasadi Gaurabhakta Vrinda Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudhirayet. In this session we will be discussing from the 16th verse of the 5th chapter of the 1st canto of Sri Mahabharata. This chapter concerns instructions by Narad Muni to Vyasa Deva about Sri Madbhagavatam. The verse is Vichakshanoya Asyarhati Veditum Vibhor Anantaparasya Nivritita Sukham Pravartamanasya Gunair Anatmanah Tato Bhavan Darsaya Chestitam Vibho. The meaning of this verse is: The Supreme Lord is unlimited. Only a very expert personality retired from the activities of material happiness deserves to understand this knowledge of spiritual values. Therefore, those who are not so well situated due to material attachment should be shown the ways of transcendental realization by your goodness through descriptions of the transcendental activities of the Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "As soon as one understands scientifically, factually, what is God, all his problems are solved."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the verse, emphasizing the difficulty in understanding God due to material attachment and highlighting the importance of describing Krishna's transcendental activities to help people understand.

What's the meaning of this verse? The transcendentalists are very compassionate upon the fallen souls of this world. In this world there are two kinds of people: people who are materially attached and people who are materially detached. Now, the Supreme Lord is unlimited; he is not a limited person like any of us. So that is where the difficulty lies in understanding properly who is God as a person. So Narada Muni is telling, even though God or Krishna appears like one of us, he is not at all limited like us. He is unlimited personality. Therefore, Narada Muni says only a very expert person who is limited is the one who is not limited, and who is not limited is the one who is limited, retired from the activities of material happiness, deserves to understand this knowledge of spiritual values. Knowledge about the Supreme Lord Krishna is completely spiritual; it has nothing to do with any material knowledge or material happiness or material things. It has nothing to do with material. So there are people who are materially attached and they can't easily understand who is Krishna, what is God, because as soon as one understands scientifically, factually, what is God, all his problems are solved, all his problems are solved. So therefore, how to understand God? So the transcendentalists like Narad Muni, Vyasa Deva, they are all thinking how to actually make people understand. So Narad Muni is telling here, those who are having material attachment, they should be shown the way of transcendentalism, transcendental realization by Vyasa Deva, and what is the method he is telling? Through descriptions of the transcendental activities of the Supreme Lord, exclusively describe Krishna's transcendental activities.

### theological science, transcendental nature of God, material attachment

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Materially attached people cannot understand the nature of God. They have to become detached somehow or the other."
**Summary:** The speaker refers to Srila Prabhupada's explanation, stating that theological science is difficult, especially concerning God's transcendental nature, and that material attachment hinders understanding God.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, theological science is a difficult subject matter, especially when it deals with transcendental nature of God. Theological science means the science dealing with the subject matter of God. So the transcendental nature of God, God is the supreme person, is the original person, but he is a transcendental personality. So the transcendental nature of God is the original person, but he is a transcendental personality. What does he mean? Transcendental personality means he is not having a material body like we have. He is not under the clutches of the material nature. He is the master, he is the lord, he is the controller, he is above and is eternally so. Therefore, this subject matter of God as this transcendental person is not to be understood by persons who are too much attached to material activities, which is the nature of most common people. Majority of the people in this world, they are attached to material activities, that's their life. So materially attached people cannot understand the nature of God. They have to become detached somehow or the other. Now, if they have to become detached to understand who is God, then what is the way? Any of the traditional ways are very slow, very difficult, very tedious. So is there a quick way of becoming materially detached?

**Key Quote:** "Those who cultivate spiritual knowledge, they understand the worthlessness of all these materialistic activities."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how to become materially detached, explaining that cultivating spiritual knowledge helps one realize the futility of materialistic activities.

What is the way? So here it is said that first of all understand the point Prabhupada is telling, understand this point that expert people who are retired from materialistic activities by culture of spiritual knowledge, those who cultivate spiritual knowledge, they understand the worthlessness of all these materialistic activities. They are useless, they really don't give us any happiness, they have no eternal benefit, they are no benefit for the soul, they are simply some illusory activities which give some illusory happiness, feeling of happiness, no real happiness. So give those activities, retire from those activities, then they may be admitted to study this great science of the personality of God Krishna science.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Even such people, some or the other, if they hear this subject matter, describing exclusively the transcendental activities of Krishna, then that sound vibration enters their ears, penetrates the heart, and cleanses the heart of desire for material enjoyment."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Bhagavad Gita to emphasize the rarity of those seeking spiritual perfection and highlights how describing Krishna's transcendental activities can purify the hearts of even the materially attached.

Now, Bhagavad Gita clearly states, Manushyanam sahasreshu kashchit yatati siddhaye yatatam api siddhanam kashchinmam vetti tattvatah. What is the meaning of this verse? Although many hundreds and thousands of people, hardly there may be one or two people who are not in the spiritual world, one rare person who actually is interested in the perfection of life, human life. What is siddhi? What is the meaning of liberation from material bondage? Most people don't even know we are bound up in this material world, they don't know. So one who knows and also takes interest in how to get out of this material bondage, to put an end to all our material problems, such a person is a rare person. And among many thousands of transcendently realized persons, very, very, very, very few people can understand the theological science dealing with God as person. So this being the case, Vyasadeva is advised by Narada, describe the science of God by directly relating his transcendental activities. They are very attractive, they are wonderful, they work within the depths of the heart of conditioned souls. Even those who have no understanding, no interest, they are materially attached, even such people, some or the other, if they hear this subject matter describing exclusively the transcendental activities of Krishna, then that sound vibration enters their ears, penetrates the heart, and cleanses the heart of desire for material enjoyment. This is already described in the second chapter.

**Key Quote:** "Simply give oral reception, give your ears somehow to descriptions of the transcendental activities of Krishna, then it is going to bring about a change of heart, it is going to cleanse the heart."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that listening to descriptions of Krishna's activities purifies the heart and that Srimad Bhagavatam is the literary incarnation of Krishna.

Apadrani vidunoti, simply give oral reception, give your ears somehow to descriptions of the transcendental activities of Krishna, then it is going to bring about a change of heart, it is going to cleanse the heart, automatically you become purified of all material contamination. And it is also told here, Vyasadeva is the right person because he is expert in this science and he is also detached completely from material enjoyment. So he is the right person to describe this subject matter of the transcendental activities of Krishna, and Shukadeva Goswami, his son, is the right person to receive this knowledge, he is the right person to receive this knowledge. Therefore, Srimad Bhagavatam is the topmost theological science and it can act on the common people as a medicine. In the beginning, medicine, medicine means it may not be very palatable in the beginning, but the moment that medicine works, then people awaken their real interest in Krishna consciousness, in hearing about Krishna, Krishna's transcendental activities. And another important point Prabhupada says is this, transcendental activities of the Lord and the Lord himself, there is no difference because both are absolute, so.

**Key Quote:** "If the common people, they simply hear the Bhagavatam, they are able to associate directly with Krishna and they become gradually purified from all kinds of material contamination."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of hearing Srimad Bhagavatam for purification and association with Krishna, highlighting the various ways to broadcast Krishna's transcendental activities, as exemplified by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.

This literature, this Srimad Bhagavatam, is the literary incarnation of Krishna. Krishna is incarnated in the form of Bhagavatam in this Kali Yuga. Krishnae Swadhaamopagate Dharma Gyanadi Visaha, in the third chapter it was described that when Krishna went back after performing his pastimes, then this Bhagavatam has arisen as the brilliant sun which can dispel the dense darkness of Kali. So Bhagavatam is a very special literature, among all the Vedic literatures Bhagavatam is very special. So if the common people they simply hear the Bhagavatam, they are able to associate directly with Krishna and they become gradually purified from all kinds of material contamination. And those who are expert devotees, they should find ways and means to inject this transcendental descriptions of Krishna's activities into the ears of the common people. And there are so many intelligent ways in which this can be broadcast, not just one way, not just the standard way that there is a discourse and people sit in the discourse and try to hear when a learned person is speaking on the subject matter, not just that, there are so many ways, so many ways. And Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and his followers exhibited expert dexterity in doing this. And Narada Muni is telling that to Vyasadeva, kindly describe these activities and that way people can be actually benefited, they can get out of this material existence and suffering and be promoted to the highest perfection very easily. Hare Krishna.

Yet there is no danger of his being unsuccessful. On the other hand, a non-devotee, though fully engaged in occupational duties, does not gain anything." This is a very, very strong statement by Narada Muni, and we have to carefully understand this in order to really become serious about devotional service.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the two types of duties, material and spiritual, explaining how material duties create debt and karma, leading to repeated birth and death.

Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport. Before we go to the purport, just a point about this verse itself, that everybody as a human being has got two kinds of duties: material duties and spiritual duties. Material duties are connected with the body and the mind, the material body and the material mind, and they are based on the obligations that we have because of taking birth in a certain family, because of the facilities that we have to take birth there, are provided by the Devatas for our material existence in this body that we take. Because of the knowledge that we receive, Deva, Rishi, Bhuta, Aapta, Niranam, Pitranam, as soon as one takes birth as a human being, there are six different personalities to whom we are obligated. And if we do not perform our duties in relationship with our mind and body because we are taking so many benefits for our existence, we become debtors. We accrue some karma, and that karma forces us to again and again take birth, repetition of birth and death. So, materially we are obligated, and we have to discharge duties in order to liquidate our debt.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts material obligations with the liberation offered by surrendering to Krishna through pure devotional service, emphasizing the eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

But, the Srimad Bhagavatam declares that if anybody takes to devotional service, pure devotional service by completely surrendering to Krishna, such a person is completely freed from all material obligations simply because the person has surrendered to the lotus feet of Krishna and is engaged in pure devotional service. So, spiritual duties are meant for the liberation of the soul from material bondage. Nobody wants miseries. Nobody wants to suffer in this material world, but then they are forced to suffer. Miseries are forced upon a person. Now, what is the way out of these miseries? What is the way out of these fundamental problems of material existence? That is, doing our spiritual duties. Spiritual duties, ultimately the understanding is, as spirit soul, each one of us, irrespective of our karma, irrespective of the type of family we are born, irrespective of the type of past activities we might have done, good or bad, whatever, we are actually receiving all maintenance from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is our eternal well-wisher, with whom we have an eternal relationship.

**Key Quote:** "But here, Narad Muni is telling something very, very revolutionary, that if somebody is giving up the material duties, in order to engage in pure devotional service, as instructed in the Bhagavatam, that when you engage in pure devotional service by surrendering to Krishna, then you have no obligation, no material obligations at all."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the revolutionary idea that giving up material duties for pure devotional service can free one from obligations, and addresses the question of what happens if someone falls down from devotional service.

Under all circumstances, in all times, in all situations. So, spiritual duties are definitely very, very important. So, generally, people who are aware of these material duties and spiritual duties, they try to discharge both of them. Any civilized person will have some sense of responsibility for discharging material duties, and also will be doing some kind of worship of the Supreme, some kind of spiritual duties one will be discharging. But here, Narad Muni is telling something very, very revolutionary, that if somebody is giving up the material duties in order to engage in pure devotional service, as instructed in the Bhagavatam, that when you engage in pure devotional service by surrendering to Krishna, then you have no obligation, no material obligations at all. Then such a person, if such a person performs pure devotional service and becomes completely successful in getting ultimate liberation, then very good. The person is liberated, freed from all material contamination, purified, no more material obligations, and has attained the success in pure devotional service of getting ultimate liberation, going back home, back to Godhead. But what if they fall down after taking to pure devotional service? That happens when somebody is still in an immature stage. bhajan apapvo atha patetato yadi. Then they fall down means they give up devotional, pure devotional service, and they take to material life once again, which they had given up in order to do pure devotional service. Then what about this person's situation? Neither has he gained anything materially by engaging in pure devotional service, nor has that person been successful in doing his pure devotional service. So he is a loser both ways. So Narada Muni is telling, there is no loss for such a person who in an immature stage, after having taken to pure devotional service, gives up pure devotional service and goes back to material way of life. There is no loss at all. There is no loss. Why?

**Key Quote:** "One is that whatever pure devotional service somebody performs, the credit, for having done that pure devotional service, is eternally attached to the soul."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that even if someone falls down from devotional service, the spiritual advancement made is permanent and attached to the soul, unlike the temporary benefits of material duties.

One is that whatever pure devotional service somebody performs, the credit for having done that pure devotional service is eternally attached to the soul. It is not connected to the body. The spiritual advancement that a person makes by rendering pure devotional service is attached to the soul. It is permanent. It is forever that credit is available. So such a person resumes pure devotional service any time in the future, will resume from the point where he or she has stopped pure devotional service. Supposing they make 2% advancement and then they give up pure devotional service. So next time they take up pure devotional service, whenever that is in the future, then they'll begin from 3%. It is never lost. Whereas, Narada Muni is telling, even if a person is a non-devotee and fully engages in occupational duties, whatever occupational duties the person does, all such occupational duties do not have any spiritual benefit for a non-devotee engaged in occupational duties. According to the Shastras we are talking, there is no spiritual benefit at all. And what about the material benefit one gets by doing some occupational duty? That is all temporary. It is all temporary. Just like with this body, whatever we may gain while working with this body, all that is just as long as this body is there, my wealth, my possessions, my relationships based on the body, my material knowledge, material power, material position, everything is finished the moment this body is, life on this body is over. When I quit the body, I cannot take my money with me, I cannot take my degrees with me, I cannot take my power with me, my position with me, my influence with me, nothing I can take. So what is the gain? Oh, in this life, because he worked very hard, he could enjoy some nice power, nice position. Oh, that enjoyment is illusory happiness. Illusory happiness. It's not real happiness. It is not real satisfaction.

**Key Quote:** "There is an instance of one Bharat Maharaj. He performed, he gave up his kingdom and went to a holy place and he was practicing pure devotional service. And then, towards the end of his life, he became attached to a deer and he died thinking of the deer."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the lack of lasting satisfaction in material pursuits and provides examples of Bharat Maharaj and Chitraketu to illustrate that even those who fall down from devotional service are not lost.

It has nothing to do with soul happiness, soul satisfaction. Deep within, there is no satisfaction. Even if one is getting some material pleasure or material enjoyment or material happiness, deep within there is nothing that is worthwhile that one can experience. So, here it is said that there are instances in history of somebody who performed pure devotional service and fell down. There is an instance of one Bharat Maharaj. He performed, he gave up his kingdom and went to a holy place, and he was practicing pure devotional service. And then, towards the end of his life, he became attached to a deer, and he died thinking of the deer. So, he took birth, next birth, as a deer. But, because he had done pure devotional service, the Lord was kind enough to give him memory of what he did in his previous life. In the body of a deer, he was able to remember. And in that body of a deer, he was associating with saintly persons and hearing their discourses. He was not interested in eating or sleeping or nothing, even in the body of a deer. Similarly, there is an instance of Chitraketu who actually committed some offense at the feet of Shiva, and he fell down. But, next life, he was delivered. He realized his mistake, and he was delivered. Next life, even though he took birth as a demon, in the body of a demon, not as a demon, in the body of a demon, he was delivered, completely delivered. He got ultimate liberation. He was given memory by the Supreme Lord. So, there is no loss if one falls down. But, if one does occupational duties without doing pure devotional service, there is no gain at all. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Persons who are actually intelligent and philosophically inclined should endeavor only for that purposeful end which is not obtainable even by wandering from the topmost planet, Brahmaloka, down to the lowest planet, Patala."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 18th verse of the 5th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, emphasizing that intelligent individuals should strive for something beyond material attainments.

In this session, we will be discussing the 18th verse of the 5th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The translation of this verse, as given by Srila Prabhupada: "Persons who are actually intelligent and philosophically inclined should endeavor only for that purposeful end which is not obtainable, even by wandering from the topmost planet, Brahmaloka, down to the lowest planet, Patala. As far as happiness derived from sense enjoyment is concerned, it can be obtained automatically in course of time, just as in course of time we obtain miseries even though we do not desire them."

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "It is pure devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that pure devotional service is the ultimate goal, unattainable through material pursuits in any part of the universe, from Brahmaloka to Patala.

So, the previous verse was, we were discussing, that there is no loss in pure devotional service even if one does not complete it in one lifetime, achieve the 100% success of perfection. But, another point that is being made now is that those who are intelligent human beings, intelligent human beings who are philosophically inclined, they question, "Who am I? What is this world?" Such fundamental questions they are able to raise. Such people, Narada Muni is telling, should endeavor only for one purposeful end. What is that? That which is not obtainable in any place, in any place within the whole universe, from the topmost planet, Brahmaloka, up to the bottom most, Patala. By wandering anywhere, you cannot get that which you cannot get. What is that which is not available from the topmost planet, up to the bottom most, Patala, Brahmaloka to Patala?

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "It is miseries and mixed material happiness."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how material happiness and distress are available everywhere, varying based on past karma and circumstances, but ultimately limited and mixed with suffering.

By dint of one's past karma, whatever happiness one can get, whatever material facilities one can get in different planets, in different circumstances, in different types of good work, now that is available differently in different places. Even people who do different kinds of activities, they enjoy different kinds of facilities. So just like even in this life we can see in our own situation, when we see other people in our own neighborhood, there are some people who are born with not so much of facilities or benefits. Somebody is born in a very poor family, or somebody is born in a very rich family. Somebody is born with good material intelligence. Somebody is born with not so good material intelligence, not so much of material intelligence. So we see variations. But in any case, whatever benefits they may have by birth, or they may acquire knowledge in this life by working very hard, or they may acquire wealth, or they may acquire a nice position, power, influence, whatever they may get, or whatever they already have, it can only give them some material happiness. It is miseries and mixed material happiness.

### suffering, material existence, gunas, heavenly planets

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Two features of existence in this material world is miseries and mixed happiness."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the inevitability of suffering in material existence, even in higher planets, due to the influence of the three gunas and the inherent miseries of birth, death, disease, and old age.

Miseries you cannot avoid. Even in Brahmaloka, the four fundamental problems, janma-mṛtyu-jarāvyādhi-dukkha-doṣānudarśanam, birth, death, disease, old age, associated with birth in the material world, anywhere, any planet, with however much good karma, one cannot avoid these four fundamental problems. And, the three-fold miseries are always there everywhere. Material existence means the three gunas are acting, and the three-fold miseries are always there: Adi-bhautika, adhyatmika, adidaivika klesha. Misery is due to one's own body and mind, misery is due to other living beings, and misery is due to supernatural forces of nature. So, the Bhagavata is telling, this verse is telling, don't endeavor for material happiness, or material facilities, or material enjoyment, which is available even for the dogs and hogs. Of course, according to their standard, according to the body and mentality they have, they have their own enjoyment. And, many gods are enjoying on a different scale, or different level. In their own heavenly planets, they have their own long span of life, they have beautiful body, they have material power, they have influence, and they have facilities. But, two features of existence in this material world is miseries and mixed happiness. It's available everywhere, for every living being.

**Key Quote:** "This pure devotional service, by which one can get eternal life, one can get eternal bliss, one can get eternal spiritual knowledge, that is not available by any amount of material activities."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts material pursuits with pure devotional service, which offers eternal life, bliss, and knowledge, emphasizing that sense enjoyment comes automatically according to destiny.

But, this pure devotional service, by which one can get eternal life, one can get eternal bliss, one can get eternal spiritual knowledge, that is not available by any amount of material activities, by any good karma, by birth in any planet within this whole universe, it's not available. And, one more point, Narad Muni is telling here, as far as happiness derived from sense enjoyment is concerned, it can be obtained automatically in course of time, even without your separate endeavor, just as miseries come even without your endeavoring for them.

### destiny, material endeavor, karma, temporary happiness

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "You cannot increase material happiness, you cannot reduce material distress."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of destiny, stating that material endeavors cannot ultimately increase happiness or decrease distress beyond what is already destined, and that even good karma only leads to temporary enjoyment.

Destiny. Deha Yogena Dehina. Another place in the Bhagavatam it is said, Sukham Aindriyakam Daitya Deha Yogena Dehina. Deha Yoga. The moment we get a certain type of material body, along with that body, there is a certain amount of material happiness and material distress, which is destined in this body, in this life. It is destined. You cannot reduce, by material endeavor, you cannot reduce the material miseries or material distress that you are destined to suffer. And, by any material endeavor, you cannot increase the material happiness, the material happiness that is due to you. That is destined. You cannot increase material happiness, you cannot reduce material distress. Then, why are you endeavoring? This is foolishness, to think that I can increase my material happiness by gaining more wealth, by having more possessions, by having nice family relationships, by getting some material power, by transferring myself to heavenly planets. In the next life, either in this life or next life, you cannot increase more than what is destined. You cannot. So, and even if somebody thinks that in this life I will work hard and gain good karma, by which in my next life, in my next life I can enjoy, that is also temporary. It is temporary. It will be finished with passage of time.

**Key Quote:** "Whereas, pure devotional service gives us eternal happiness, eternal life, eternal knowledge."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights the eternal benefits of pure devotional service, contrasting it with the anxiety-ridden nature of material existence, even for elevated beings like Lord Brahma.

eternal happiness, eternal life, eternal knowledge. So, please think over what is the value of pure devotional service: freedom from anxiety, complete freedom from anxiety. In fact, the word, the term that is used for the spiritual planets is called Vaikuntha Loka. Vaikuntha means Vigatakuntha, without any anxiety. Life, in the eternal life, in the spiritual planets of the Supreme Lord, personal abode of the Supreme Lord, is life without any anxiety, zero anxiety. Whereas, material world is characterized by anxiety. Even Lord Brahma, when Hiranyakashipu was terrorizing the whole universe, Brahma was in so much anxiety what to do for cutting down the terrorist activities of Hiranyakashipu, and giving some protection and relief for the people who are thus suffering under his torture. So, Brahma also is in anxiety. So, nobody is free from anxiety in the material existence. Nobody, none of the Devatas, none of the Yogis, Karmis, Jnanis, Tapasvis, nobody, only pure devotees are completely free.

And such endeavor is worthwhile because simply because of some past karma, you are not going to get any spiritual happiness. No. Spiritual happiness is entirely dependent on our executing pure devotional service. And the benefit of pure devotional service is eternal benefit, eternal benefit. The advancement made is never lost, even after we quit the body. It is eternally to our credit, whatever advancement we make in pure devotional service, it's never lost.

### Srimad Bhagavatam, Krishna's pastimes, Vyasadeva, Narada Muni
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/sEYKHopPCdA?t=42
**Verse References:** SB 1.5.21
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Therefore, Narada Muni is telling, describe the transcendental pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Sri Krishna more vividly."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami discusses Narada Muni's instruction to Vyasadeva to vividly describe Krishna's pastimes in the Srimad Bhagavatam, emphasizing the detailed descriptions in the 10th canto and the establishment of Krishna's nature and relationships in other cantos.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devim Saraswathim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet In this session we will be discussing from the 21st verse of the 5th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Tvam Atmana Atmanam Avehi Amoghadrik Parasya Pumsah Paramatmanah Kalam Ajam Prajatam Jagatashivayatat Mahanubhavabhyudayo Adhiganyatam The meaning of this verse is, your goodness has perfect vision. You yourself can know the supreme personality of Godhead. I am sorry. You yourself can know the Supersoul personality of Godhead because you are present as the plenary portion of the Lord. Although you are birthless, you have appeared on this earth for the well-being of all people. Please therefore describe the transcendental pastimes of the supreme personality of Godhead Shri Krishna more vividly. This is yet another verse spoken by Shri Narada to Vyasadeva. He is instructing Vyasadeva on compiling Bhagavatam. And Bhagavatam is specifically describing, very vividly, supposed to describe very detailed way, the various transcendental pastimes of the supreme personality of Godhead Krishna. Krishna means Krishna and his various transcendental forms of expansion, various incarnations. So all of them are included. So here Vyasadeva is essentially being told that Vyasa is actually the incarnation of the Supreme Lord for the sake of compiling the Vedic literature. So he has perfect vision. He is himself the plenary portion. Plenary portion means the portion of the Supreme Lord who has got the power of the Supreme Lord. So he himself knows the Supersoul personality of Godhead by his perfect vision. And even though he is birthless, Ajam Prajatam, Ajam means he is birthless, Prajatam means he has taken birth for the well-being of all people. Shivaya for the well-being of all people. Therefore, Narada Muni is telling, describe the transcendental pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Sri Krishna more vividly. In the earlier work of Vyasa Deva, the different Puranas and the Mahabharata, he has described the pastimes of the Supreme Lord, but not as detailed as it will be described by him in the Bhagavatam under the instruction of Narada. Just like the 10th canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam is fully dedicated for describing the pastimes of Krishna very, very, very detailed way. It is the biggest canto in the entire Srimad Bhagavatam. And it is also describing the pastimes of Krishna's birth, then the childhood pastimes in Vrindavan. Then the pastimes of Krishna as youth in the Mathura Dham, then his pastimes as the king of Dwaraka in Dwaraka. All the pastimes are very nicely, vividly, detailed way described in the Bhagavatam 10th canto. And the other cantos are establishing the pastimes of Krishna. Who is this personality of Godhead Krishna? What is his transcendental nature? What is his relationship with this material world, with the spiritual world, with the living beings, with the liberated souls, with the jnanis, tapasvis, karmis, yogis, devotees, everybody? All that is very scientifically described in connection with his pastimes. This is the special thing. Everything is connected with Krishna's pastimes.

### Incarnations, Fallen souls, Spiritual master, Vyasadeva, Krishna
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/sEYKHopPCdA?t=360
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "He is teaching by his own example that one must accept a spiritual master even though he is God himself."
**Summary:** This segment explains the purpose of incarnations delivering fallen souls, the importance of Vedic literature, and the role of a spiritual master, even for incarnations like Vyasadeva and Krishna, emphasizing the need to take shelter of Krishna's lotus feet.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, Vyasa Deva has descended by his costless mercy to deliver the fallen souls in this material world. That's the purpose of all incarnations. Every incarnation is descending, coming from the spiritual world, from the spiritual world to the material world, for the sake of delivering the fallen souls, those who are lost in this material world. Now the people in this world are mostly forgetful of who they are, who is Krishna, what is their relationship. So they are detached from the transcendental loving service of Krishna, which is the natural condition, healthy condition, the spiritual state of our existence. Eternally we are meant simply for rendering pure devotional service, loving devotional service to Krishna. The Vedic literatures are compiled for the benefit of such fallen souls. And the duty of the fallen souls is to take care of them, especially in the human form of life. Take advantage of such literature to be freed from the bondage of material existence. Now Narada Muni is formally accepted as the spiritual master of Vyasa Deva. But Vyasa Deva being the incarnation of the Lord is not dependent at all on anyone. He is completely enlightened always. And he is the spiritual master of everyone else. But as doing the work of an Acharya, he is teaching by his own example that one must accept a spiritual master even though he is God himself. For example Lord Krishna, Lord Rama, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. All are incarnations of the Supreme Lord. But they accepted formally a spiritual master. They were already enlightened in all transcendental knowledge. They are the source of all knowledge. But still to direct people they actually accept a spiritual master, teach by their example. Similarly Vyasa Deva is directed by Narada Rishi as his spiritual master to describe the transcendental pastimes of Krishna in order to direct people to take shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna. That is the only shelter we actually have.

### Krishna's lotus feet, Material existence, Liberation, Murari, Vamanadev

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna's lotus feet are the most suitable boat for crossing over this ocean of material existence."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Krishna's lotus feet as the boat to cross the ocean of material existence, referencing Krishna as Murari and Vamanadev, and explaining how taking shelter of Krishna shrinks the material world, leading to the supreme abode.

We don't have any other shelter. In the Bhagavatam it is described in a later portion, Samashrita ye pada pallava plavam. Krishna's lotus feet are the most suitable boat for crossing over this ocean of material existence. Plavam means boat. Pada pallava means it is like lotus feet. Krishna's lotus feet is like a boat, the most suitable boat for crossing over the ocean of material existence. Mahapadampunya Yesho Murari. And Krishna is famous as Murari, the killer of the Mura demon, whose pain as the deliverer of all the fallen souls, all the fallen souls in this material world. Whenever he incarnates he delivers them. His fame as the deliverer is spotless. Punya Yesho. It's pure fame, spotless fame. Mahapadam. Now he became famous as keeping that giant step when he appeared as Vaman Dev, Trivikrama. In one step he covered the earth and all the lower planets. And he stretched his other foot to pierce the covering of the top portion of the universe beyond Brahma Loka. So he covered all the upper planets with the second step. And there was no place left for covering the third step, for keeping the third step and covering some land. There was no land left. All the middle, lower, upper, all three planetary systems were covered in two steps. So Mahapadampunya Yesho Murari, Bhavambudhir Vatsapadam. What happens when you take shelter of Krishna's lotus feet? How do you cross over this material existence? So in this verse it is described, the whole material existence becomes shrunk to the quantity of water contained in the footprint of a calf. Vatsapadam. Vatsa means calf. So a huge ocean shrinks into water contained in the footprint of a calf. Bhavambudhir. Bhava means this material existence is compared to a huge ocean that compresses or condenses or shrinks into a very very small quantity of water so that you can easily cross over, just as easily as one can put his foot across a small puddle of water. Parampadam. And you cross over material existence to reach the supreme abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

### Surrender, Krishna's lotus feet, Liberation, Bhagavad Gita
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/sEYKHopPCdA?t=782
**Verse References:** BG 18.66
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, Surrender to me alone."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the ease and effectiveness of taking shelter of Krishna's lotus feet for liberation, contrasting it with other difficult methods, and quoting Krishna's instruction in the Bhagavad Gita to surrender to Him alone, assuring protection from sinful reactions.

That is the result of taking shelter of Krishna's lotus feet. This is the glorification of the incarnation of Krishna and all the other incarnations. Taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, Personality of Godhead is the easiest and the most effective way of crossing over this ocean of material existence. Otherwise the other methods are very very very difficult, very slow, and very very tedious. This is very very easy, the method of taking shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna. So everywhere it is described in the Bhagavatam, this very literature is directing us, take shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna. Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, surrender to me alone, giving up all other processes of religion. Simply surrender and don't worry about the consequences of such surrender. Don't worry about it. Mahashu Chaha. Because Krishna says, I will take charge of all your sinful reactions. Even if there are any sinful reactions, don't worry. I will nullify them. Aham Tvam Sarva Pape Bhya Moksha Isha. So Krishna specially gives the assurance. So this transcendental literature, Vedic literature, are directing the fallen souls how they can come to the point of taking shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna. That's the direction that is ultimately given and that's the perfection. I'll stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "All the scriptures, ultimately it is a supreme personality of Godhead Lord Hari who is glorified."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that all scriptures ultimately glorify Lord Hari (Krishna) and that Vyasadeva should describe the transcendental activities of Krishna in detail.

So this verse, spoken again by Narada Muni to Vyasadeva, describes ultimately what is the purpose of advancement of knowledge through various methods. The methods are listed here. There are many methods of advancement of transcendental knowledge. One can perform austerities, one can study the Vedas, one can perform various sacrifices, or somebody may chant the Vedic hymns, or one may give in charity. Yajna, dana, tapa, swadhyaya, and then chanting the hymns... So all these, ultimately, ends in what? According to the Vedic Scriptures, it ends in transcendental descriptions of the Lord! Everything is meant for transcendental description of the Lord! Every pious activity is ultimately meant for glorifying Krishna. Hari Sarvatra Giyate, this is what Vilamadvacharya says. All the scriptures, ultimately it is a supreme personality of Godhead Lord Hari who is glorified. So that's why Narada is telling Vyasa Deva you must describe

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "perfection of self-realization depends on Vishnu, the personality of Godhead, that they do not understand, they do not know."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that human intellect should be used to understand the transcendental activities of the Lord, leading to self-realization, and warns against being enamored by Vishnu Maya (material energy) and sense enjoyment.

in detail the transcendental activities of the supreme personality of Godhead Krishna. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport here, human intellect is developed for advancement of learning in art, science, philosophy, physics, chemistry, psychology, economics, politics, etc. So many subjects human beings have, they have developed that. Now it is expected that you will be able to understand the transcendental activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that by culture of such knowledge, the human society can attain perfection of life. That is the purpose. Now this perfection of life itself, what is the perfection of life? It is self-realization. Now that self-realization, therefore the Shruti or the original Vedas directs those who are actually advanced in learning, they should aspire for service of Lord Vishnu, devotional service to Vishnu. Now there are persons who are enamored by the external beauty of Vishnu Maya, the external enamelling, the external energy of the Supreme Lord Vishnu. He has many energies of which this material energy is very prominent in this material world. So those who are enamored by this material energy, they do not understand that perfection of self-realization depends on Vishnu, the personality of Godhead, that they do not understand, they do not know.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "only when advancement of knowledge is applied in devotion and service of the Supreme Lord, the whole process becomes absolute."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the transient and miserable nature of sense gratification, contrasting it with the absolute nature of knowledge applied in devotion and service to the Lord.

Now, Vishnu maya means sense enjoyment. The effect of maya, the influence of maya is such that one is inclined simply to try to enjoy sense gratification. Now, what is the nature of the sense gratification? Everywhere in the scriptures it is described. It is transient, means it is flickering. Just for a very short time it is there. That enjoyment is there for a very short time. And also, it is actually miserable. Now, those who are in the trap of this Vishnu maya, they utilize advancement of knowledge for sense enjoyment. And that is very, very prominent in the material world, Kali Yuga. Everywhere you see people engaging in sense gratification in various ways, even those who are cultivating knowledge, even those who are cultivating spiritual knowledge, they desire a subtle type of sense gratification. Now, already Narad Muni has explained that all this paraphernalia, all this knowledge of the cosmic universe is an emanation of the Supreme Lord through his different energies. He has created this world, he maintains and he destroys. And the Lord has set in motion the actions and reactions of this material world by his inconceivable energy. So, in effect, ultimately, everything is non-different from this Lord because it is a manifestation of his own energy. At the same time, the Lord is always different from his energies. Therefore, only when advancement of knowledge is applied in devotion and service of the Supreme Lord,

**Key Quote:** "whatever be the subject matter of advancement of knowledge, whether it be art or science or philosophy or physics or chemistry or psychology, they should simply be applied in service of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that all branches of knowledge should be used in the service of the Lord, giving examples of Valmiki and Vyasa who achieved immortality by glorifying the Lord through their writings.

the whole process becomes absolute because the personality of Godhead is non-different from his name, his form, his qualities, his activities, his paraphernalia, is non-different. So, all the sages and devotees of the Lord have therefore recommended that whatever be the subject matter of advancement of knowledge, whether it be art or science or philosophy or physics or chemistry or psychology, they should simply be applied in service of the Lord. How can they be applied in the service of the Lord? So, literature, poetry may be used in glorifying the Lord. The fiction writers and poets generally are writing some subject matter of self-gratification. But if they turn towards the service of the Lord, they can beautifully describe the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. For example, Valviki Muni, he was a great poet, but he has composed Ramayana, the transcendental pastimes of the personality of Godhead, Lord Rama. And it is such a wonderful composition, but it is completely transcendental because it is glorifying the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Rama. Vyasa Deva is a great writer, but he has simply engaged all his talent in composing nice poetry, simply in glorifying the Supreme Lord in his various incarnations. So, they have become immortal, Valviki and Vyasa, simply by glorifying the Supreme Lord through poetry, Sanskrit poetry. Similarly, Shila Prabhupada says, science and philosophy also should be used in the service of the Lord. Simply, some people are busy presenting some dry speculative theories for self-gratification. That is useless. That cannot satisfy them, that cannot satisfy any of their readers. Ultimately, people become frustrated.

### establishing the glory of the Lord, science and philosophy in service of the Lord, knowledge not engaged in service is nescience

**Key Quote:** "knowledge not engaged in the service of the Lord is nescience."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that philosophy and science should be used to establish the glory of the Lord, and that knowledge not engaged in the service of the Lord is considered ignorance.

So, Prabhupada is telling that philosophy and science should be engaged to establish the glory of the Supreme Lord. Because those who are advanced in intellect, they want to understand what is the ultimate reality through the medium of science or through the medium of philosophy. Therefore, a great scientist should endeavor to prove the existence of the Lord on a scientific basis. Similarly, philosophical speculation should be used to establish the supreme absolute truth as sentient, conscious person and all-powerful, absolutely powerful. All branches of knowledge should always be engaged in the service of the Lord. Bhagavad Gita also confirms the same fact. Apply all knowledge in the service of the Lord. Bhagavanam janmanamante jnanavan mam prapadyate vasudeva sarvamiti vedaisya sarvair ahameva vedhyam Neyam, the object of knowledge, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The goal of all knowledge is to know the Supreme Person, Krishna. Like this, knowledge ultimately should be aimed at knowing Krishna, at realizing Krishna. Knowledge should be aimed at engaging in devotional service to Krishna. And Prabhupada further says, knowledge not engaged in the service of the Lord is nescience. Nescience means darkness of ignorance.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that all activities, including scientific knowledge, can be used as harikirtana (glorification of the Lord), and that everyone can utilize their talents and intelligence for glorifying Krishna.

Therefore, the real import of this verse in the Bhagavatam is that advanced knowledge is simply meant for establishing the glories of the Supreme Lord. Now further, Prabhupada says, all such activities, including employing scientific knowledge in service of the Lord, is factual harikirtana or glorification of the Lord. This can be done by anybody in their own field, whether somebody is a scientist or an artist or a philosopher or a teacher, anybody can utilize their talent, their learning, their advanced intelligence simply for glorifying the Supreme Lord. Even the creation, entire creation is nothing but the creation of the Supreme Lord. So therefore, the ultimate goal is Krishna only and nothing else or no one else. Therefore, this verse is stressing, everything should be utilized for glorification of Krishna, especially knowledge. So I'll stop here.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of the verse, highlighting Narada Muni's description of his previous life as the son of a maidservant and his association with pure devotees, emphasizing his self-control, detachment from sports, and lack of naughtiness even as a young boy.

Now this is the section where Narad Muni describes his previous life to Vyasa Deva. In the previous session we have seen how Narad Muni begins the description by telling about his previous birth, that he was born as a son of a maidservant, but then he happened to get the association of pure devotees and in their association he engaged in their service and a big transformation took place that is being described. So this 24th verse is Temai Apeta Akhila Chaapale Arbake Dante Adratha Kriyada. The meaning of this verse is, although they were impartial by nature, those followers of the Vedanta blessed me with their causeless mercy. As far as I was concerned, I was self-controlled and had no attachment for sports, even though I was a boy. In addition, I was not naughty and I did not speak more than required.

**Key Quote:** "Their nature is they are impartial."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the qualities of the sages who showed causeless mercy to Narada Muni, emphasizing their impartiality and the boy's unusual self-control and detachment from childish activities.

So, Narada Muni is describing, he was a small boy. He was not very old, when the sages were camping due to Chaturmasya in the place where Narada Muni's mother was engaged in such menial service. Their nature is they are impartial. They are impartial by nature. They have no special liking for somebody or hatred towards anybody else. No. They are completely impartial. But still, when they see somebody is inclined to actually take up devotional service, then they immediately, out of their causeless mercy, they actually bless such a soul with transcendental enlightenment. So, Narada Muni says, those sages, they blessed him, with their causeless mercy. Now, what was this boy's behavior? He was self-controlled and he had no attachment for sports, even though he was a boy. Normally, boys will always be playing, young boys, small boys. Till they come of certain maturity, they generally be engaged in playing, playing, playing. But, Narada Muni, this boy was an unusual boy. He was not interested in sports, childish sports. And, he was controlled, self-controlled. He was not naughty and he did not speak more than required.

**Summary:** The speaker references Srila Prabhupada and Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to explain the three subjects of the Vedas: establishing the relationship of living entities with God (Sambandha), performing devotional service (Abhideya), and achieving the ultimate goal of going back to Godhead (Prayojana).

So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, in the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord says, all the Vedas are searching after me. All the Vedic literature are directing one towards Krishna. Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu describes that in the Vedas, there are three subjects. What are the three subjects? To establish the relation of the living entities with the personality of Godhead, to perform the relative duties in devotional service, and thus achieve the ultimate goal of going back home, back to Godhead. It's called Sambandha Abhideya Prayojana. Sambandha is, each one of us have got a relationship with the Supreme Lord. Every living being, without exception, because we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Mamey Vamsho Jeeva Loke Jeeva Bhuta Sanatana. And, in that relationship, there are certain activities. Relationship means activities. So, such activities performed in the relationship with the Supreme Lord are called Abhideya. And, the result is Prayojana. It results in developing our love for the Supreme Lord, or going back home, back to Godhead, where we belong.

**Key Quote:** "Because, sometimes Vedantavadis are mistaken to be those who are impersonalists."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that the Vedantavadis mentioned in the verse are pure devotees, distinguishing them from impersonalists who have an incomplete understanding of Vedanta philosophy, and emphasizing the impartiality of Bhaktivedantas in distributing transcendental knowledge.

The Vedantavadis, or the followers of Vedanta, as described in this verse by Narad Muni, indicates pure devotees of the Supreme Lord, because sometimes Vedantavadis are mistaken to be those who are impersonalists. Impersonalists actually have no proper understanding of Vedanta philosophy, because they start with an assumption, even though unjustified, that ultimately, the Absolute Truth is impersonal. But, actually, the Absolute Truth has got three features. Impersonal feature is just one of the preliminary understanding of the Absolute Truth. There are two other features, the Paramatma feature and the Bhagavan feature. So, this Paramatma feature and the Bhagavan feature are completely mis-doubted by the impersonalists. Therefore, their understanding of Vedanta, is not complete. It is imperfect. It is incomplete, and it is misleading also, that ultimately, the Absolute Truth is impersonal. No. The Absolute Truth is the personality of Godhead. Therefore, Vedantavadis, refers to the pure devotees of the Supreme Lord, who have full understanding of all the three features of the Absolute Truth. Such Vedantavadis are also called as Bhaktivedantas. They are impartial in distributing the transcendental knowledge of devotional service. To them, nobody is enemy, nobody is friend. Nobody is educated, nobody is uneducated. They don't make distinctions based on all these type of characteristics. Nobody is favorable, nobody is unfavorable.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the general state of people as being born into ignorance and engaged in self-gratification, highlighting the role of Bhaktivedantas in awakening them to spiritual life and re-establishing their relationship with Krishna.

So, they see, their vision is, people in general are engaged in wasting time in self-gratification, because they do not know the goal of life. By birth, it is described, every conditioned soul is born into ignorance. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains this. Everyone is born into ignorance. So, they have to be awakened by such Bhaktivedantas. So, such Bhaktivedantas, they want to get this ignorant mass of people to get out of ignorance, to re-establish their lost relationship with the Supreme Personality of God, Krishna. Now, by the endeavor of such Bhaktivedantas, even the most forgetful souls, most ignorant person, is awakened to a sense of spiritual life. And, the people, in general,

begin to make progress on the path of self-realization. Now, this boy, Narada in his previous life, when he was the son of a maid servant, this boy, actually, before being initiated even, he was very self-controlled. He was detached from childish sporting, and he was more or less very disciplined. But, the Vedantavadis, the Bhaktivedantas, they were compassionate upon the boy and they did not consider this boy is too small or he is still of an age where he is meant to engage in childish sports. They did not consider that. In spite of his being a small boy, they did initiate him and they blessed him to actually begin to render devotional service. So, this is their causeless mercy upon this boy. But, this boy also happened to be a disciplined, self-controlled boy who is not naughty, who would not speak more than required like that. So, in his case, we can understand his advancement was very, very fast. But, we should always remember the effect of the blessing of such Vedantavadis is very, very powerful. Even if somebody is not so self-controlled, still, they can become very quickly purified

### Vedic system, Gurukul, Brahmacharya, Garbhadana Samskar, self-control, self-realization

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Without being self-controlled, nobody can make proper progress in self-realization."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the Vedic system of sending young boys to Gurukul for Brahmacharya training, emphasizing the importance of self-control and spiritual acumen injected even before birth through Garbhadana Samskar for self-realization and creating responsible citizens.

by such powerful association. So, therefore, Srila Prabhupada says in the Vedic system, small boys who are about five years of age, between five and eight years, they are sent to the Gurukul or the Guru's ashram and they are systematically trained in Brahmacharya, celibacy, because then their mind can be focused on learning the essential knowledge that is required for self-realization. This training is also compulsory to create good citizens of the state. Without such basic training at an early age, it is difficult to prepare somebody for a good future life as a responsible citizen of the society. Now, the present day situation is such that people have become irresponsible. They are simply engaged in sense enjoyment. Neither they have such Brahmacharya training nor are they serious about the real goal of self-realization. But, the Vedic system is the spiritual acumen is injected into the child even before the birth of the child by what is called as Garbhadana Samskar. The parents actually conceive a child with spiritual consciousness. So, the child is injected with the spiritual acumen at the time of conceiving the child in the mother's womb. So, this is extraordinary chance given to a soul who is taking birth as a human being to prepare for self-realization even before the birth itself. So, this is the way to beget children in complete perfection. So, Srila Prabhupada says without being self-controlled, nobody can make proper progress in self-realization. That's impossible. It's not merely a matter of reading some books or hearing some discourses or studying some literature. No. It is much more than that. It is the systematic training specially in self-control by Brahmacharya. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Content Type:** philosophy

**Key Quote:** "Such Krishna Katha purifies the heart and in the purified state one can understand what I am and what is the Lord."
**Summary:** This segment explains that hearing Krishna Katha purifies the heart, leading to the realization of the transcendental nature of both the self and the Lord, distinguishing them from matter.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 27th verse of the 5th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. तस्मिम्स्तदा लब्धरुचेर महामते प्रियश्रवस्य अस्खलिता मतिर्ममा ययाहं एतत सदसत स्वमायया पशेमई ब्रह्मणि कल्पितं परे। The meaning of this verse is, O great sage, this is Narada Muni addressing Vedavyasa, as soon as I got a taste for the personality of Godhead, my attention to hear of the Lord was unflinching, and as my taste developed, I could realize that it was only in my ignorance that I had accepted gross and subtle coverings, for both the Lord and I are transcendental. So this is a very important realization that has come about by hearing about the glories of the Lord and developing a taste for such Krishna Katha. Such Krishna Katha purifies the heart, and in the purified state, one can understand what I am and what is the Lord. Neither I am a product of matter, nor is the Lord anything to do with matter in terms of his spiritual form, spiritual existence, spiritual attributes. So this becomes very, very clear as the heart becomes clean.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Similarly, as soon as the Krishna sun rises in the heart, immediately the darkness of material ignorance is dissipated, completely dissipated."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of darkness and the sun, this segment explains how ignorance is like darkness and Krishna is like the sun, whose presence dispels ignorance from the heart.

This is the whole point. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, ignorance in material existence is compared to darkness. Just like, very easy to understand, when we are in darkness, we cannot see anything around us, and therefore we cannot act properly. Similarly, our existence in this material world, or material existence, is compared to darkness because in ignorance of who we are, we are acting on the material platform. And on the material platform, we are only aware of matter. We are not aware of spirit. We are totally ignorant about spirit on the material platform. So therefore, here it is said, in all Vedic literatures, the personality of Godhead is compared to the sun. Krishna Surya Sama. Maya Hoi Andhakar. Krishna is compared to the sun to help us understand what is the position of Krishna, and Maya is like darkness. Wherever there is light, there cannot be darkness. As soon as there is light, just like in the morning when the sun rises, immediately the darkness is dispelled. Similarly, as soon as the Krishna sun rises in the heart, immediately the darkness of material ignorance is dissipated, completely dissipated.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Hearing of the Lord's pastimes is itself transcendental association with the Lord."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of hearing Krishna's pastimes from a bona fide source, which is equivalent to direct spiritual association with Krishna due to His absolute nature.

Now, how does the Krishna sun rise in the heart? So, Srila Prabhupada says, hearing of the Lord's pastimes is itself transcendental association with the Lord. When you hear attentively Krishna's pastimes, and you have to hear from a proper source. We have been discussing this many, many times. We have already discussed earlier, from a bona fide source, from an authorized source, from a proper source. Not from a professional reciter, not from a non-devotee, not from a speculator, but from a pure devotee or a representative of a pure devotee who repeats the words of the pure devotee. You hear the Lord's pastimes. That is same as spiritual association with Krishna directly. It's direct association with Krishna on the transcendental platform. It is not material at all. Even though right now we are situated in the material body, we are in the material world, but such hearing immediately elevates the hearer to the spiritual world, to the spiritual platform. Why? Why does it happen? How does it happen like that? It is because there is no difference between the Lord and His transcendental pastimes. Identical. In a previous session, I had described Lord is absolute. Absolute means Krishna, His name, His form, His qualities, His pastimes, His paraphernalia, His pure devotees are all identical.

**Key Quote:** "Whereas Krishna, when you hear about Krishna, because Krishna is fully present in his descriptions, you directly associate with Krishna."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of a phone call, this segment contrasts relative experiences with the absolute presence of Krishna in His descriptions, leading to a change of heart.

There is no relativity. To give another example to help you understand the difference between relative and absolute. Now when you receive a phone call from a person who is far distant, physically the person is situated, present in a very distant place. Let's say you are in Bangalore and the person is in Delhi. So when you receive the phone call, then you speak with the person. But then on speaking, you have to recollect about the person's appearance, about the person's qualities, about the person's background, everything. Based on a past experience, you are having some idea. The voice itself of the person is very soothing to hear, particularly if you have a relationship. But still the person is not present in the voice. All the other attributes of the person are not experienced. For example, you cannot, supposing you are talking to your own child, you cannot pat the back of the child. You cannot embrace the child, just when you hear the voice. Whereas Krishna, when you hear about Krishna, because Krishna is fully present in his descriptions, you directly associate with Krishna. Krishna is fully present. So you are coming face to face with Krishna, though you don't realize immediately. But the fact is Krishna is there. Krishna is present, fully present in the descriptions. Therefore the change of heart takes place.

**Key Quote:** "Material existence means we don't know who is Krishna. I don't know who I am. In terms of our spiritual nature."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how ignorance leads to a conditioned state where one identifies with the material body, and emphasizes the importance of realizing one's spiritual identity and Krishna's transcendental nature.

Ignorance is dissipated. So, Prabhupada says further, to become associated with the supreme light is to dissipate all ignorance. All ignorance is gone. Material existence means we don't know who is Krishna. I don't know who I am in terms of our spiritual nature. We don't know spiritual nature. So, Prabhupada says, particularly here, by ignorance only, the conditioned soul, conditioned soul means one who is habituated to this material world, material existence, three gunas, and material body, and material surroundings, material possessions, material relationships, everything material. We are not matter. No person is the material body. So, it is only because of spiritual ignorance, ignorance of the spiritual fact, that every person thinks in terms of I am the body, I am a product of material nature. I came into existence when I took birth in this world. This is wrong understanding. No, I exist eternally because I am spirit soul. I am not this body. My body was fabricated by Maya in the mother's womb, and this body was prepared and wrongly I associate myself with the body, think I am the body. Even the Supreme Lord, he may take birth as son of Vasudeva and Devaki, but he is not the product of material nature. Neither he is actually the son of Vasudeva. He is actually the supreme father of everyone in this world. He is the supreme father. So, where is the question of he taking birth? He appears to take birth. He actually does not take birth. So, the fact is, the personality of Godhead and the living beings are transcendental and have nothing to do with materiality.

**Summary:** This segment explains that after realizing our spiritual nature, we should engage both the gross body and the subtle mind in the service of the Lord through physical actions and devotional practices like hearing and chanting.

Nothing to do with material nature. So, when ignorance is removed, it is perfectly realized that there is nothing existing other than Krishna. Whole existence, only Krishna is there. Krishna is there means Krishna and his energies, especially which energy? His spiritual energy. Krishna is a spiritual personality and his spiritual energy is important. Now, while we are in this body, after having learnt about Krishna's spiritual nature and our own spiritual nature, what do we do with this body? So, that Prabhupada explains, both this gross body and the subtle mind, they have got two coverings. The soul, I, you, any person, spirit soul, is covered by a subtle body. That is the inner body. And then over that there is a gross body covering. So, two coverings. Both of them can be engaged in the service of the Lord while we are in this material world, because both are belonging to the material energy of the Supreme Lord. So, the gross body should be engaged in acts of rendering physical service to the Lord, like bringing water for cleansing the temple, paying obeisances by bowing down, etc. And, the subtle mind should be engaged in hearing attentively about the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, thinking about the Lord, chanting His name. So, all such activities are completely spiritual.

So, simply by hearing from a pure devotee, all this transformation inside can take place very quickly. Otherwise, gradually the change happens through the regular methods. Gradual change happens. Otherwise, quickly the change can take place. And that is being illustrated in the life of Narada Muni when he was a small boy, and he was fortunate to get the association of pure devotees, bhaktivedantas.

**Key Quote:** "But please understand that happiness experienced in material existence, which is called as material happiness, is described in the scriptures as simply another form of misery only."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that material happiness is ultimately another form of misery, arising from the contact of senses with sense objects.

So here is the conclusion of the instruction by the Bhaktivedantas to Narada. Narada is addressing Vyasa Deva, telling about his previous life and he is telling it is decided by the learned ओडेड श्री कृष्णा This is a remedial measure for removing all troubles and miseries. This is because, from the scriptures we understand, and by our personal experience also, we have knowledge about the miseries of this material existence. Now, people may not disagree that there are miseries, but they will say there are also good things. There is happiness and there is distress, both are there. But please understand that happiness experienced in material existence, which is called as material happiness, is described in the scriptures as simply another form of misery only. This is a very, very shocking revelation, but it's a fact. What is the nature of this happiness which we experience in this material world? It is called samsparsha-bhoga. Samsparsha means contact. Contact of the senses with the sense object. For the eyes it is form, for the ears it is sound, for the nose it is smell or fragrance, for the tongue it is taste, and for the sense of touch it is the touch sensation itself, for the perception of the sense of touch. So, this contact produces a kind of feeling in the mind, and that is interpreted as happiness or distress according to one's conditioning. Anyway, it's a very detailed subject, which I don't want to go into details now.

**Key Quote:** "To dedicate one's activities to the service of the Supreme Lord Personality of God."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that dedicating all activities to Krishna is the best remedial measure for removing miseries.

But please understand, the essence of material existence is miseries. And generally, for most people, when there is absence of misery, or they get relief from some misery, immediate misery, then they consider that as happiness. Real happiness is something else, different from what we expect. So, therefore, the best remedial measure for removing all troubles and miseries, that is being told here. And this is a very, very important point for everyone to note. It is a very practical utility for everyone in this world. What is it? To dedicate one's activities to the service of the Supreme Lord Personality of God.

**Key Quote:** "But they do not know that without the sanction of the Supreme Lord, nobody can become free from miseries."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that freedom from misery requires the sanction of the Supreme Lord, drawing from Narada Muni's personal experience.

Dedicate all your activities to Krishna, and thereby you become free from all miseries. How does it work? Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport that Narada Muni, from his personal experience, he is telling that simply sit and hear the transcendental activities of the Lord, and thereby you become from the right source, from the bona fide source, and thereby you become completely free from all miseries. Now, what if somebody is not able to do that? For that, Narada Muni is giving another solution. People may say, I am very busy working for maintaining my family, for my own maintenance. So, I don't have time to sit and hear. Even if I am able to hear, I can hear a little. I can't hear all the time. So, for such people whose time is mainly engaged in some work for the sake of maintenance, bodily maintenance, or for some responsibility, or duty, for such people, Narada Muni is telling that you have to learn from devotees how to dedicate your activities in the service of Krishna. How to do that? So, Prabhupada explains in the purport that generally people in this world are struggling very hard to get rid of miseries. Nobody wants miseries. Nobody wants suffering. But they do not know that without the sanction of the Supreme Lord, nobody can become free from miseries.

**Key Quote:** "So, the point is that sanction of the Supreme Lord is very much necessary for the treatment to be effective."
**Summary:** The speaker provides examples of medical treatment and crossing a river to illustrate that the sanction of the Supreme Lord is necessary for success.

So, three examples are given specifically to illustrate this point: that to cure a patient by medical treatment is useless if it is not sanctioned by the Lord. So, we know that doctors do help by giving some treatment to a patient who has got an infection or a disease. But doctor also is helpless if the patient does not survive the treatment. If the patient doesn't survive the treatment, then the doctor is helpless. Or the particular remedy doesn't work, then the doctor is helpless. So, the point is that sanction of the Supreme Lord is very much necessary for the treatment to be effective. Similarly, another example that is given, to cross the river or the ocean by a suitable boat is no remedial measure if the remedy is not sanctioned by the Lord. So, therefore, the ultimate sanctioning officer is the Supreme Lord

**Key Quote:** "So, therefore, we should learn how to dedicate whatever activities we may do to the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding the Lord's presence and power, and learning to dedicate all activities to Him, especially through studying how His energies work.

and we must therefore dedicate our activities to the Supreme Lord for ultimate success. Now, how to do that? First of all, we should understand the Lord is present everywhere and He is all-knowing and He is all-powerful. Omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent. Present everywhere, He is all-knowing and He is all-powerful. So, therefore, we should learn how to dedicate whatever activities we may do to the Supreme Lord. Whatever one may be, how should one dedicate whatever activity one is doing? So, Prabhupada gives specific examples here. If one is a learned scholar or a learned scientist or a philosopher or poet, he should employ his learning to establish the supremacy of the Lord. This is the purpose of all knowledge, all learning, especially by those who are scholars or scientists or philosophers or poets. They should try to study how the energy of the Lord is working in every sphere of life. The Lord is there, Krishna is there and His energies are there. So, in every sphere of life, the Lord's energies are working. So, try to study that. That is what is presented in the Bhagavad Gita. Especially in the Bhagavad Gita, how the Lord's energies are working in every sphere of life.

**Key Quote:** "They should try to study how the energy of the Lord is working in every sphere of life."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how different individuals, such as scholars, scientists, and warriors, can dedicate their activities to the Lord, using Arjuna as an example.

Srila Prabhupada further says, do not decry Him. Do not try to become like Him. Do not try to take His position simply by some little knowledge. No. So, one should actually understand the glories of the Lord in terms of how His energies are working in every sphere of life. And establish the supremacy of the Lord through one's writings, through one's knowledge, through one's descriptions, through enlightening others who are ignorant, etc. Next, Prabhupada says, if one is an administrator or a statesman or a warrior or a politician, that is a Kshatriya, then one should try to establish the Lord's supremacy in statesmanship. Fight for the cause of the Lord as Sri Arjuna did. A warrior should fight for the cause of the Lord. So, regarding Arjuna, it is particularly mentioned here that in the beginning, Arjuna declined to fight. But when he was convinced by the Lord that the fighting was necessary, then Arjuna changed his decision and fought for the cause of the Lord. Karishye Vachanam Tava, I'll simply follow your instructions, your directions.

**Key Quote:** "Think always that the money which is accumulated is the wealth of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how businessmen and even those engaged in menial work can dedicate their activities to the Lord, emphasizing the importance of chanting Hare Krishna.

So, similarly, if one is a businessman or an industrialist, an agriculturist, then one should spend his hard-earned money for the cause of the Lord. How can one do this? Think always that the money which is accumulated is the wealth of the Lord. Because wealth is considered Lakshmi or goddess of fortune. And Lord of Lakshmi is Narayana, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, husband of Lakshmi. So, try to engage the wealth in the service of Lord Narayana and be happy. That is the way to realize the Lord in every sphere of life. Either one works like a Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya or even a Shudra. Shudra is one who does some menial work for getting some maintenance. So, even whatever menial activities one may do, one should try to do it as a service to the Lord. One should think that I am engaged in this particular activity. Of course, the activity should not be a sinful activity. It should be a pious activity. So, engaged in any pious activity, one should think, Krishna is engaging me in this activity. So, think of Krishna. Now, how to think of Krishna? By chanting Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. This can be done by everyone. This should be done by everyone. That is the scriptural direction. Hare Nama, Hare Nama, Hare Namaiva Kevalam.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Perfectly able to acquire a transcendental knowledge for spiritual realization."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains the common notion that performing fruitive work according to scriptures leads to transcendental knowledge and spiritual realization.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 35th verse of the 5th chapter of the 1st canto, Srimad Bhagavatam. Yaratra Kriyate Karma Bhagavat Paritoshanam Jnanam Yattad Atheenam Hi Bhakti Yoga Samanvitam. The meaning of this verse is, whatever work is done here in this life for the satisfaction of the mission of the Lord is called Bhakti Yoga or Transcendental Loving Service to the Lord. And what is called knowledge becomes a concomitant factor. So this verse is explained by Srila Prabhupada very nicely in the purport. I will directly go to the purport. From the purport, we can understand what is being said in this verse by Narada. The general and popular notion is that by discharging fruity work in terms of the directions of the scriptures, one becomes perfect, perfectly able to acquire a transcendental knowledge for spiritual realization.

**Key Quote:** "People think that if we do the particular activities mentioned in the scriptures for getting some material benefit...we will develop this spiritual understanding."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the general inclination to perform activities for material benefits, believing it will lead to spiritual knowledge and realization, and how this perspective often equates Bhakti Yoga with Karma.

Most people are generally inclined to work or do some activity. That is the nature of the soul, to be always active. So people think that according to the directions of the Shastra, they should perform certain types of pious activities or those activities recommended in the scriptures for some material benefit, and that will lead to getting transcendental knowledge, spiritual knowledge for spiritual realization. Ultimately, the Shastra say we have to realize we are spirit, so we have to realize the spiritual truth, and for that spiritual knowledge is required. And how do you get that knowledge? Of course, you can get knowledge by studying the scriptures, but to realize that knowledge, merely studying, will it help? No, that is not enough. So therefore, people think that if we do the particular activities mentioned in the scriptures for getting some material benefit, not necessarily in terms of just some gross benefits in this life, but something for the future, could be for the future, could be for some next life, like that, so they think that we will develop this spiritual understanding by which we can develop the spiritual knowledge, and the spiritual knowledge which we can actually become realized, and therefore they

**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that Bhakti Yoga is superior to both Karma and Jnana, a confidential truth revealed in the Srimad Bhagavatam, and that Bhakti Yoga is independent.

realize, and therefore they consider such people, they consider Bhakti Yoga as another form of Karma only, because Bhakti Yoga involves activities, and Karma means doing pious activities recommended in the scriptures, so both are same. And Shastra gives an explanation how they areradas can not be followed is it evenkul sat Cal relieved a due exhibition by the Shastra. And therefore, they give a higher position to Jnana or spiritual knowledge. But the real fact is that Bhakti Yoga is above both Karma and Jnana. This is not known to many people. And this confidential truth is revealed in the Srimad Bhagavatam. So Bhakti Yoga is independent of Jnana, Bhakti Yoga is independent of Karma. On the other hand, if you really study carefully Karma, Jnana, and Bhakti, then both Karma and Jnana are different. They are dependent on Bhakti Yoga.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The success in performing Karma is dependent on pleasing the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Karma and Jnana are dependent on Bhakti Yoga, emphasizing that the success of activities and the transformation of knowledge into realization depend on pleasing the Supreme Lord, referencing the Bhagavad Gita on Karma Yoga and Yajna.

How are they dependent? Because, whatever activities we may perform, unless those, even pious activities, unless the results of such activities are sanctioned by the Supreme Lord, one will not get the results. So one has to perform such pious activities which are recommended in the scriptures in order to please the Supreme Lord, either directly or indirectly. So the success in performing Karma is dependent on pleasing the Supreme Lord. And pleasing the Supreme Lord means Bhakti or Bhakti Yoga. And as regards knowledge, if somebody is cultivating spiritual knowledge, that spiritual knowledge will turn into realization only when such knowledge is employed in pleasing the Supreme Lord. In the Bhagavad Gita, very clearly it is said that Karma becomes Karma Yoga only when Karma is performed as Yajna. Yajna arthat karmanah anyatra lo koyam karma bandhanah. If you want freedom from karma bandhana, then Karma should be done as Yajna. Yajna means to do some work for pleasing the Supreme Lord,

**Key Quote:** "Jnana independent of Bhakti will not give the real result of realization, spiritual realization."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Karma and Jnana, when independent of Bhakti, do not yield true results, and that only through Bhakti can one achieve spiritual realization, referencing the Bhagavad Gita on surrendering to Krishna after many lifetimes of knowledge.

which is nothing but Bhakti. So Karma independent of Bhakti is not going to give the real result. Jnana independent of Bhakti will not give the real result of realization, spiritual realization. That is also explained in the Bhagavad Gita. Bahunam janmanam ante jnanavan mam prapadyate. Those who are jnanavan, those who have really come to the stage of mature knowledge, they surrender to Krishna. Only then they become realized. Otherwise, any amount of knowledge, which is simply some theoretical information, remains as theory. It doesn't become realized knowledge. It doesn't lead to enlightenment. So enlightenment is possible only by Bhakti. And real results of Karma, sorry, results of Karma is possible only by dedicating those activities in service of the Supreme Lord.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Kriya Yoga is specifically the principle to satisfy the Supreme Lord by one's activities."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Kriya Yoga as the principle of satisfying the Supreme Lord through one's activities, even those performed as duties or within the varnashrama system, and quotes Bhagavad Gita on Krishna being the enjoyer, proprietor, and well-wisher.

That's why Narad Muni is telling here that this Kriya Yoga, as he says here, yaratra kriyate karma bhagavad paritoshanam Kriya Yoga. Kriya Yoga is specifically the principle to satisfy the Supreme Lord by one's activities. Whatever activities one performs, even as duties or as one's own work in terms of one's position in the varnashrama system, whatever work one does, even spiritual activities, what may be called spiritual activities, activities of self-realization, all such activities have to be done to satisfy the Supreme Lord. Because in the fifth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna says, bhoktaram yajna tapasam sarva loka maheshwaram surdam sarva bhutana. Three principles he explains which are very, very important to understand. For ultimate peace, gyatvamam shanti mrcchati. What are the three principles? That Krishna is the supreme enjoyer of all sacrifices and penances. Ultimately, every sacrifice culminates in pleasing the Supreme Lord. Bhoktaram means he is the real enjoyer, ultimate enjoyer, of all, yajna tapasam, yajna and tapasya. And sarva loka maheshwaram, he is the supreme proprietor of all planets, all devatas, the entire creation, the entire existence. He is the Lord, he is the master, he is the proprietor. And the third point is surdam sarva maheshwaram, surdam sarva bhutanam, he is the topmost well-wisher

**Key Quote:** "When you please Krishna, everyone is satisfied."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of watering the root of a tree or feeding the stomach to illustrate that pleasing Krishna satisfies everyone, as all are parts and parcels of Him, and that transcendental knowledge is automatically achieved without separate endeavor.

of every living being, which means that if he is pleased, everyone is satisfied. You can easily understand it is very difficult to separately, individually satisfy every person. We are obligated to so many people. But if we simply satisfy Krishna, that is like watering the root of a tree. Then you are supplying water to the root of the tree is the best way to nourish all the parts of the tree, or supplying food to the stomach. All the parts of the body are nourished. There is an arrangement. So similarly, when you please Krishna, everyone is satisfied. All the parts and parcels, because everyone is a part and parcel of Krishna. So therefore, the recommendation here is that simply do all activities for pleasing the Supreme Lord. Transcendental knowledge or spiritual knowledge or enlightenment is automatically achieved without separate endeavour.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that Krishna gives knowledge to those engaged in loving devotional service, destroying the darkness of ignorance with the lamp of knowledge from within, emphasizing that devotional service works without separate endeavor.

This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita also. Krishna says, I give the knowledge to those who are engaged in my loving, devotional service. The principle is to please Krishna, out of love, for pleasing Krishna. And how does it work? Tesham eva anukampartham aham ajnana-jamta-maha-nashayami Atma bhavastho jnana-dipena-bhasuta. Because Krishna is seated in everyone's heart, so he destroys with the shining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance. All darkness is dispelled by Krishna. So therefore, that's how it works. Devotional service works without separate endeavour. And Krishna enlightens the devotee from within. Of this, there need be no doubt at all. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "The principle of always remembering Krishna through remembering his names, his qualities, his pastimes, his forms, etc."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam 1.5.36, explaining that it emphasizes remembering Krishna's names, qualities, and pastimes while performing one's duties according to Krishna's instructions.

This session we will be discussing from the 36th verse of the 5th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Kurvana Yatra Karmaani Bhagavachikshaya Asakrit Grnanthi Gunanamani Krishnasya Anusmaranticha. The meaning of this verse is: While performing duties according to the order of Sri Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one constantly remembers Him, His names, and His qualities. So, Srila Prabhupada has written a very elaborate purport for this verse. This is spoken by Narada Muni to Vyasa Deva. The principle of always remembering Krishna through remembering his names, his qualities, his pastimes, his forms, etc. This is what is being described here, and that also while performing duties accordingly.

**Key Quote:** "One should work only for Lord Krishna in all spheres of life."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on how to remember Krishna in all aspects of life, stating that Krishna should be considered the proprietor in every sphere, even in Vedic rites involving demigods.

So how does it actually work? Srila Prabhupada elaborates this in the purport. He says, an expert devotee of the Lord can mold his life in such a way that while performing all kinds of duties, either for this or the next life, he can constantly remember the Lord's name, fame, qualities, etc. So it is a question of molding one's life in a particular way that is enabling one to remember the Lord's name, qualities, pastimes, etc. The order of the Lord is distinctly there in the Bhagavad Gita. What is that order? One should work only for Lord Krishna in all spheres of life. In every sphere of life the Lord should be situated as the proprietor. According to Vedic rites, even in the worship of some demigods like Indra, Brahma, Saraswatthi, Ganesha, the system is that in all circumstances the representation of Vishnu must be there as Yajneshwara or the controlling power of such sacrifices.

**Verse References:** BG 5.29
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Vishnu is the supreme lord of all the demigods."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Vishnu is the supreme lord and that all activities should be offered to Krishna, the supreme enjoyer, referencing Bhagavad Gita 5.29 and explaining that associating with Krishna's name and fame is associating with Krishna himself.

So, sacrifice to demigods also involves the representation of Vishnu as Yajneshwara. He is the supreme lord of all sacrifices. It is recommended that a particular demigod be worshipped for a particular purpose, as far as Karmakanda section of the Vedas is concerned. But still, the presence of Vishnu is compulsory in order to make the function proper, because the fact is, Vishnu is the supreme lord of all the demigods. Apart from such demigods, there are other demigods as well. Apart from such Vedic duties, even in our ordinary dealings, for example, in our business or profession or in our household affairs, we must consider that the result of all activities must be given over to the supreme enjoyer Lord Krishna. In the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna has declared himself to be the supreme enjoyer of everything, the supreme proprietor of every planet and the supreme friend of all beings. This is a famous verse in the 5th chapter, 29th verse: bhoktaram yajnatapasam sarva-loka-maheshwaram suradam sarva-bhutanam jnatvamam shanti-mrcchati. So therefore, no one else but Lord Shri Krishna can claim to be the proprietor of everything within his creation. A pure devotee remembers this constantly and in doing so, he repeats the transcendental name, fame and qualities of the Lord, which means that he is constantly in touch with Lord Krishna. Now the Lord is identical with his name, fame, etc.

**Key Quote:** "No one is more dear to him than one who is always engaged in preaching work, of the Lord's name and fame all over the world."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that chanting Hare Krishna constantly connects one with the Lord and that a significant portion of one's income should be used to spread Krishna consciousness, as preaching is very dear to the Lord.

So in simple words, while doing any work, if I keep chanting Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, then I am constantly in touch with the Lord himself. I am constantly performing all kinds of duties which are according to scriptural direction, not concocted duties. Then Srila Prabhupada talks about results of the activity. What about that? The major portion of our monetary income, not less than 50%, must be spent to carry out the order of Lord Krishna. Not only should we give the profit of our earning to this cause, but we must also arrange to preach this cult of devotion to others, because that is also one of the orders of the Lord. In the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord definitely says, no one is more dear to him than one who is always engaged in preaching work of the Lord's name and fame all over the world.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the scope of preaching, stating that while the Lord prefers preaching among devotees, Srila Prabhupada went to America to preach among non-devotees, following his guru's order.

The scientific discoveries of the material world can also be equally engaged in carrying out his order. The scope of what Narada Muni is telling Vyasa Deva here, is very, very broad application of the instruction here. So the Lord wants the message of the Bhagavad Gita to be preached amongst his devotees. It may not be so done amongst those who have no credit of austerities, charity, education etc. So how to apply this? The Lord says, you preach my message amongst the devotees, but not amongst those who are without any austerity, those who are without education, spiritual knowledge, not among those people, among non-devotees. So, Srila Prabhupada says, when it's a fact that in Kali Yuga majority of the people are non-devotees, what should we do? The attempt must go on to convert unwilling men to become his devotees. This is a secret that Prabhupada is revealing here, and this is exactly what Prabhupada did. He went to America on the order of his Guru, and he preached my message.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Krishna consciousness is eternally established in the heart of every living being."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna consciousness is dormant in everyone's heart and can be awakened through simple methods taught by Lord Chaitanya, such as singing, dancing, and offering Prasadam (sanctified food).

He preached amongst non-devotees. Non-devotees means those who are not conversant with devotional service, those who are not from the background of Vedic culture or Sanatana Dharma, culture of Sanatana Dharma, such people, hippies, common people who are materialists, all kinds of people. He did not discriminate. Prabhupada did not discriminate. He preached among all sections of people, and the attempt is how to make them devotees. Why? Why is this suggested by Srila Prabhupada here? Because the Chaitanya Charitamrita says, Krishna Bhakti Nitya Siddha Sadhya Kabunaya. Krishna consciousness is eternally established in the heart of every living being. So it is not some artificial imposition on a non-devotee. No. In that sense, if you see, because every living being is part and parcel of Krishna, every living being has got dormant Krishna consciousness within the heart. It is just covered by the material coverings. It has to be uncovered. So Srila Prabhupada further says, Lord Chaitanya has taught a very simple method in this connection. How is this done? To convert unwilling people to become devotees. He has taught the lesson for preaching the transcendental message through singing, dancing and refreshment. As such, 50% of our income may be spent for this purpose. This is what exactly Prabhupada did.

**Key Quote:** "He becomes present when anybody sings His holy name, irrespective of who the person is."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the power of Kirtan and Prasadam to purify the heart and bring about spiritual realization, stating that the Lord becomes present when His holy name is sung.

In the beginning, he introduced the non-devotees to Kirtan and singing and dancing and refreshment, Prasadam. Kirtan and Prasadam, two things he introduced in the beginning. And in this fallen age of quarrel and dissension, if only the leading and wealthy persons of society agree to spend 50% of their income in the service of the Lord, as it is taught by Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, there is absolute certainty of converting this hell of pandemonium to the transcendental abode of the Lord. And Prabhupada showed it actually, how it works. He practically demonstrated it in many parts of the world. So, further he says, no one will disagree to partake in a function where good singing, dancing and refreshment are administered. Kirtan and Prasadam. Generally, nobody will disagree. Everyone will attend such a function and everyone is sure to feel individually the transcendental presence of the Lord. See, this is the Lord's mercy. He becomes present when anybody sings His holy name, irrespective of who the person is. The Lord becomes present with all His potencies. He is incarnated that way in this Kali Yuga. This alone will help the attendant associate with the Lord and thereby purify himself in spiritual realization. The dirty things in the heart are all cleansed, cleansed away. No matter how much the dirt that is covering the holy name, the transcendental potency of Prasadam will work in a very, very, very powerful way, as powerful as the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that the effectiveness of Kirtan and Prasadam depends on conducting these activities under the guidance of a pure devotee, who can help even unwilling people become Krishna conscious and achieve success in life.

Now, the only condition for successfully executing such spiritual activities is that they must be conducted under the guidance of a pure devotee who is completely free from all mundane desires, fruitive activities and dry speculations about the nature of the Lord. The administering of this whole program of Kirtan and Prasadam among the non-devotees should be done under the guidance of a pure devotee, sent person, pure devotee of the Lord. Then it is effective. Because a pure devotee, when he sings or when he directs somebody else to sing, in that direction or in the singing, there is full potency, sent person potency. And that will cleanse away the heart and make even unwilling people to become devotees. And such devotees can actually become Krishna conscious and thereby make their life successful.

**Key Quote:** "Narayana is the primal cause of all expansions of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of Narayana as the primal cause of all expansions of Godhead according to the Pancharatra, and introduces the Chaturvyuha (Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha).

Sankarsana Pradyumna Aniruddha. So in the Purport, Srila Prabhupada says, according to the Pancharatra, this is one of the scriptures specifically connected with Bhakti or devotional service. So according to Pancharatra, Narayana is the primal cause of all expansions of Godhead. Now Krishna is there, the original personality, supreme personality of Godhead. He has got many expansions. Balarama is His expansion. Rama is His expansion. Parashurama is His expansion. Varaha is His expansion. Sankarsana is His expansion. Mahavishnu is His expansion, like that. So there are many, many expansions, actually unlimited expansions. But the Pancharatra describes Narayana, the form of the Lord, is the primeval cause of all expansions of Godhead. Now these are Vasudeva Sankarsana Pradyumna Aniruddha. The four expansions are specifically mentioned in the Pancharatra: Vasudeva Sankarsana Pradyumna Aniruddha. Now these four expansions are described as Vasudeva and Sankarsana are on the middle left and right. Pradyumna is on the right of Sankarsana and Aniruddha is on the left of Vasudeva. And thus the four deities are described.

**Summary:** The speaker continues explaining the Chaturvyuha and then discusses the significance of 'Om' in Vedic mantras, identifying it as a representation of Krishna.

The four deities are situated. They are known as the four HD camp of Lord Sri Krishna. The Sanskrit term is Chaturvyuha Rupa. Chaturvyuha. They are the four fold forms, expansions of the Supreme Lord. So this, whatever Narada Muni has told here, Om Namo Bhagavate Dubhyam. So this is a Vedic hymn or mantra beginning with Omkara Pranava. All Vedic mantras begin with Om. All Vedic mantras. So that Om is actually the Supreme Lord Krishna himself. That is explained in the Bhagavad Gita and all of the scriptures. Omkara is actually another form of Krishna Omni. The sound representation of Krishna. Thus the mantra is established by the transcendental chanting process namely Om, Namo, Dhimahi, etc.

**Key Quote:** "Any transaction either in the field of fruity work or in emperic philosophy, which is not ultimately aimed at transcendental realization of the Supreme Lord is considered to be useless."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that activities aimed at material gain or self-realization are useless if they don't lead to transcendental realization of the Supreme Lord.

Any Vedic mantra begins with Om and it has got these words in the mantra in order to invoke the presence of the Lord through such chanting. The purport is, now what is the meaning of this whole thing that has been described in this particular verse? Any transaction either in the field of fruity work or in emperic philosophy, which is not ultimately aimed at transcendental realization of the Supreme Lord is considered to be useless. In the Vedas, there are so many recommendations in terms of doing fruity work. What is fruity work? Any work done which will give a result of some material benefit. And emperic philosophy is knowledge which will lead to realization of the Self. So whether in the field of karma or jnana, which is something which is not aimed at transcendental realization of the Supreme Lord, ultimately the goal should always be in every activity, even what is recommended in the scriptures or otherwise. The aim should be transcendental realization of the Supreme Lord. Only that is having a permanent benefit for the soul. Otherwise, any sort of material gain, it is simply a temporary benefit. It is not going to save us ultimately when we have to face the cataclysms of material nature, when we have to face death, or when we have to face pralaya, when we have to face some natural calamities, or when we have to face material miseries which are forced upon us, then all the material benefits are useless.

**Key Quote:** "each one of us as spirit-soul, we have an intimate, loving relationship with Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of transcendental realization and developing intimacy with Krishna through devotional service, culminating in Krishna Prema.

So anything that we do should be aimed at transcendental realization of the Supreme Lord. Because by realizing the Supreme Lord, immediately we are elevated beyond the three gunas to the spiritual platform where there are no miseries, there are no natural calamities, there is no illusion, there is no effect of the illusory energy. So that is very, very important. It is very important to be noted. So Srila Prabhupada is further explaining here in the purport, Naradji has therefore explained the nature of unalloyed devotional service by his personal experience in the development of intimacy between the Lord and living entity. We should not forget, each one of us as spirit-soul, we have an intimate, loving relationship with Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is already there. It is eternally there. It is not some new relationship we have to discover or establish. No. It is eternally there. It always exists. And therefore this is so important to understand that the nature of pure devotional service is that one can develop this intimacy of one's relationship with Krishna by a gradual process of progressive devotional activities. This is what Narad Muni has been explaining in the several verses which he is instructing to Vyasa Deva. Such a progressive march of transcendental devotion for the Lord culminates in the attainment of loving service of the Lord which is called Prema. That is what Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is teaching us: Krishna Prema.

**Key Quote:** "Ultimate goal of all processes is Krishna Prema."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna Prema and the different rasas, distinguishing between pure and mixed devotional service and advocating for the pursuit of pure devotion.

as the ultimate goal of all processes. Ultimate goal of all processes is Krishna Prema. And this Krishna Prema is to be experienced in different transcendental variegatedness called rasas or tastes. It is not something which is stereotyped, hackneyed, boring, dull kind of experience. No. It is full of variegatedness. Rich variegated experience of different rasas. It is a very elaborate subject, a subject matter of transcendental taste, mellow taste of devotional service. Such devotional service is also executed in mixed forms, namely mixed with fruity work or empirical philosophical speculation. So there is pure devotional service and there is mixed devotional service. What is the difference? So Srila Prabhupada says that we should aim for pure devotional service, and we should not be settled down for mixed devotional service.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "What can satisfy the soul completely? Only if devotional service is pure, unmixed with karma and jnana."
**Summary:** The speaker provides examples of mixed devotional service (karma mishrita bhakti and jnana mishrita bhakti) and reiterates the importance of striving for pure, unmotivated devotional service to achieve lasting satisfaction.

For example, it has been explained already earlier in the second chapter of this first canto, but I will just briefly mention. Just like somebody performs devotional service with the aim of getting some material gain. That material gain could be something very, very pious. It may not be something sinful. But still such material gain being the aim of performing devotional service, as recommended in the Bhagavatam, that will make it mixed devotional service. Or somebody performs devotional service with the aim of merging into the existence of the Supreme. These are called karma mishrita bhakti and jnana mishrita bhakti. These will never satisfy the soul. These will never be permanent. They are all temporary results. They may give some temporary satisfaction, some temporary happiness, some temporary effects may be there, but they will not be eternally lasting. We should always remember that as spirit souls, we are always looking for eternal happiness, full of knowledge and transcendental bliss. That's what we are looking for. We are hankering for that. That is our constitutional position. That's our natural position. But anything short of that is never going to be satisfying ultimately. So, Suta Goswami has already explained, savai pumsam paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokshaje ahaituki apratihata yayatma supraseedati. What can satisfy the soul completely? Only if devotional service is pure, unmixed with karma and jnana. Even Rupa Goswami's definition, Acharya's definition of pure devotional service is, jnana karmadi anavratam, devotional service which is free from the mixture of jnana and karma. So, such pure devotional service is being explained here. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

So this is Narad Muni speaking to Vyasadeva. Vyasadeva is being addressed as O Brahmana by Narada. This is the most confidential knowledge being revealed by Narada to Vyasadeva, and it is directly explained by Narada that worship of the Supreme Lord through worship of the transcendental sound representation is actually very, very powerful and effective. It results in the Supreme Lord bestowing transcendental knowledge of the Supreme Lord himself as it is available in the confidential parts of the Vedic literature.

**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between knowledge of Brahman, Paramatma, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, emphasizing the confidential nature of the latter, and reiterates the three gifts bestowed upon Narada: knowledge, opulences, and loving service.

Because a lot has been said about this material world, and also regarding the spiritual information, knowledge of Brahman is there, and knowledge of Paramatma is also there. But very, very confidential knowledge is knowledge of the Supreme Personality of God. That too, the spiritual, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in his spiritual abode, personal abode in the spiritual sky. That is highly confidential. And after the Lord bestowed this transcendental knowledge of the Supreme Lord himself, then he bestowed spiritual opulences on Narada. Then after that, he bestowed Narada with the Lord's intimate loving service. So three things: confidential knowledge about the Supreme Lord revealed in the Vedas, then the spiritual opulences, and intimate loving service. Three things the Lord bestowed upon Narada when Narada worshipped the Lord

**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada on communion with the Lord through transcendental sound, explaining that each soul has a loving relationship with the Supreme Lord covered by material elements, which can be revived through bhakti, especially chanting the holy name.

through his transcendental sound representation. This is explained by Srila Prabhupada in the purport. Prabhupada says, "Communion with the Lord by transmission of the transcendental sound is non-different from the whole spirit Lord Sri Krishna." What is the meaning of communion? Communion means a close relationship with someone in which thoughts and feelings are exchanged. Now, this is the special thing about a personal loving relationship. You would have heard many times that actually in the scriptures it is revealed that each one of us, we are spirit soul, the Supreme Lord is the Supreme Spirit, and each one of us has got a specific loving relationship with the Supreme Lord. Every one of us, and that relationship is now covered by this material body, material mind, material intelligence, material ego. When the coverings are removed, then gradually by the process of bhakti, especially through approaching the Supreme Lord through his transcendental sound representation, which is the holy name

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the relationship with Krishna is always present but forgotten, and it can be revived through devotional service, emphasizing that Krishna's name, form, and qualities cannot be understood through material senses.

of the Supreme Lord, then we are able to revive that relationship. The relationship is always there. It is just forgotten. It is just covered. So when it is uncovered, then we are able to actually revive the relationship. What kind of relationship is it? It is a relationship of love. So because we in the material world have been away from the Lord for many, many, many births, we cannot count and go back in this regard. So without trying to trace the beginning of forgetfulness, Shastras say accept now your condition is you are forgetful of Krishna, and through the process of bhakti revive this relationship, and when it is revived, then the Lord reveals himself. Svayam evas puratyada. In the Puranas it is said, Atha Shri Krishna Nama adi na bhaved grahyam indriyaihi. Krishna's name, form, personality, personal qualities, personal activities are not to be understood through our blunt material senses.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of beginning devotional service with the tongue, specifically through chanting and hearing, which leads to the Lord revealing Himself to the devotee.

But if we begin devotional service with the tongue, sevon mukhe hi jivadau, then what is the tongue used for? Especially for vibrating and chanting, and hearing that transcendental sound attentively. Then Svayam evas puratyadaha, the Lord reveals himself to such a devotee. So the revelation by the Lord results in that close relationship of love being revived. It is there. It just has to be revived. And Srila Prabhupada says that the sound form of the Lord is completely the Lord himself. It is not just a reference, just like when I say table, I have a table in front of me.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the material experience of a name being separate from an object with the spiritual reality that Krishna is fully present in His name.

I say table. The sound table communicates to you some object called table. But actually the sound doesn't completely represent the table, you see. Simply by hearing you don't experience what is table. You may ask questions. What is the table made of? How big is the table? Or is it an old table or a new table? So many questions can be asked. Is it your table or somebody else's table? So many questions can be asked. But when we say Hare Krishna, Krishna is fully present and it is Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead with all his features. He is fully present in the sound. So this is a completely different concept for us who are only having material experience of an object or a person and his name

**Key Quote:** "Krishna means the entire personality. Unlimited personality is there in that sound Krishna two syllables."
**Summary:** The speaker uses analogies of a rose and water in different languages to illustrate that unlike material objects, Krishna's name embodies His entire unlimited personality.

being two different things. Just like the great poet Shakespeare. He said something like, "The rose called by any other name would smell as sweet." Of course when we say rose, we understand it's that fragrant, beautiful, particular flower. But he says, "What's in a name?" That is true in this material because even take the example of the same substance water referred to in different languages by different words. In Hindi they say Paani. In Sanskrit they say Jalam. In Kannada we say Neeru. So the same thing, same object water is referred to by different names. Now it is not like that with the Supreme Lord that it's simply a reference. Krishna is not just a reference. Krishna means the entire personality. Unlimited personality is there in that sound Krishna, two syllables. Krish na, two syllables. In that unlimited personality of Krishna is there. Krishna with his names, with his forms, with his qualities, with his activities, with his devotees, pure devotees, with his associates, with his abode, with his paraphernalia, with his energies, everything is just two syllables within this two syllables Krishna. So this sound is very, very powerful, as powerful as Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that chanting the holy name is a perfect method for approaching the Lord, but purity is essential, requiring avoidance of offenses and material misconceptions to understand the Vedic literatures and the Lord's desire for us to return to His spiritual abode.

So therefore Srila Prabhupada says here this method is a completely perfect method for approaching the Lord by vibrating the tongue to produce the name, holy name of the Supreme Lord. And by such pure contact with the Lord, see the purity of our uttering the holy name is possible only when we avoid this against the holy name, that is these are all offense means material misconceptions about the Lord. What these material misconceptions are I will explain in another different session. I want to have a separate session on that. Now I don't have time. So when the contact with the Lord through this material platform is completely pure, no material misconceptions, then the devotee can rise above the material platform and understand the inner meaning of the Vedic literatures including the Lord's existence of the material world. He is the controller of the material world. It is his but he has no other personal interest. He rather wants us to get out of this material existence and go to him in his personal abode in his spiritual holy name. That is the essence of what is explained

here. So we become enriched with the Lord's knowledge about the Lord, then the spiritual opulences. What are the spiritual opulences of the Lord? It is nothing but His form, His spiritual qualities, spiritual opulences. Everything is the spiritual opulence of the Lord, and the intimate loving service. There is exchange of love through service which is loving devotional service. This is the spiritual love that we have for our Lord. So we are the spiritual opulences of the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "exclusive literature describing the glories of Krishna, especially Krishna's activities."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding the Absolute Truth as the Supreme Person, highlighting the significance of Krishna's activities and glories as described in the Srimad Bhagavatam.

So this verse, spoken by Narada Muni to Vyasadeva, is the conclusion of this chapter. The chapter title is Narada's Instructions on Srimad Bhagavatam. Narada Muni has sufficiently justified why Vyasadeva should compile Srimad Bhagavatam. Why? It is clear. He has revealed exclusive literature describing the glories of Krishna, especially Krishna's activities. The conception of the Absolute Truth as the Supreme Person is important to understand. That person means activities; impersonal, there is no activity; impersonal, there are no qualities; impersonal, there are no names, forms, there is no paraphernalia, there is no variety, there is no variegatedness. All this variety—names, forms, qualities, pastimes, activities, everything, paraphernalia, devotees, relationships, everything—is possible only if we try to understand the Absolute Truth's feature as the Supreme Person, Bhagavan. That's why Bhagavata. So here, Narada Muni's conclusion is that for helping people identify suffering of material existence, the easiest way is to provide the transcendental glories of the Supreme Lord's activities. His activities are extraordinary.

**Key Quote:** "The four classes of good men acknowledge the authority of the Almighty God, of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the four classes of good men who acknowledge the Supreme Lord and intuitively take shelter of Him.

Extraordinary. None of his activities are ordinary. So, that is Narada Muni's instruction to Vyasa Deva. Now, Srila Prabhupada very nicely explains in the purport that Narada Muni is instructing Vyasa Deva to compile the Bhagavatam for the good of all classes of people of the entire world. So, Srila Prabhupada says, according to the Bhagavad Gita analysis, there are four classes of good men and four classes of bad men also in this world. Who are the four classes of good men? First of all, the description of the four classes of good men. The four classes of good men acknowledge the authority of the Almighty God, of the Supreme Lord. And therefore, such good men fall under four classes. The first class of good men are those who are in difficulty. The second class of good men are those who are in need of money. The third class of good men are those who are advanced in knowledge. And the fourth class of good men are those who are inquisitive to know more and more about God. All these four classes of men intuitively take shelter of the Lord because they acknowledge the Lord. They acknowledge the authority of the Almighty Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "But even that vast learning, if it is not utilized for specifically describing the transcendental activities of the personality of Godhead, until then, he can have full satisfaction in the heart"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that even with vast Vedic knowledge, Vyasadeva felt a vacuum until he described the transcendental activities of the Supreme Lord, emphasizing the importance of focusing on Krishna's glories.

Now, Narada is instructing Vyasa Deva to broadcast the transcendental knowledge of God in terms of the vast Vedic knowledge which he has already attained. If you remember, at the beginning of the fourth chapter, it was described Vyasa Deva, he first of all put the Vedas in writing and he divided the Vedas into four. And then he further summarized the Vedas. He explained the Vedas for less intelligent class of people in an easily understandable way by presenting the Mahabharata. Like that, so much work he did, but he is still feeling a vacuum in his heart. So, he is vastly learned. But even that vast learning, if it is not utilized for specifically describing the transcendental activities of the personality of Godhead, until then, he can have full satisfaction in the heart, including those who are learned in the Vedas, just like Vyasa Deva himself. He is not feeling satisfaction in his heart. He is fully learned in the Vedas because he has not described the transcendental glories of the activities of the Supreme Lord.

### bad men, fruitive work, sinful activities, atheism

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "The first category of bad men that are described, those who are simply addicted to the mode of progressive fruity work."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the four classes of bad men: those addicted to fruitive work, those engaged in sinful activities, those materially advanced in knowledge but lacking devotion, and atheists who hate God.

Now, as far as the four classes of bad men are concerned, they are also described in the Bhagavad Gita. The first category of bad men that are described, those who are simply addicted to the mode of progressive fruity work. Fruity work means they have to do some work in which they get some results for their material enjoyment, material pleasure, material gain. That is called fruity work. So, there are people who are addicted to progressive fruity work and they keep on doing this, and as a result, they are subjected to the accompanying miseries. Nothing in this material world, any material work done, is always accompanied by miseries. You cannot say, I will do something and I want only pleasure. No, not possible. Always there is pleasure and pain, or enjoyment and suffering. Sukha and dukkha are two sides of the same coin. Two sides of the same coin, material activity, fructive activity. So, this is the first class of bad men. The second class of bad men are those who are simply addicted to vicious work, sinful activities. For what? For sense gratification, for sense satisfaction. And naturally they suffer the consequences because they are outright engaging in sinful activity. They have to suffer. Sooner or later, they have to suffer. And the third class of bad men are those who are materially advanced in knowledge, but they suffer. In spite of being advanced in knowledge, they suffer because they do not have the sense to acknowledge the authority of the Almighty Supreme Lord. So, what happens? The effect of their knowledge is stolen away by the illusory energy: Māyayā pahṛtaṁ jñānam. And the fourth class of bad men, those who are known as atheists and who therefore purposely hate the very name of God,

**Key Quote:** "A pure devotee is not thinking, let me try to do good to some good people. No. He is thinking of doing good to all suffering people, all types of people who are suffering material miseries, whether they are good men or bad men."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the misconceptions of atheists and highlights the compassionate vision of a pure devotee who aims to benefit all suffering beings, regardless of their nature.

although they are always in difficulty, it is natural for somebody who is in difficulty to take shelter of God. But these people, because they have developed a hatred for God with a misunderstanding that God is their enemy, or God is against them, or God is not in their favour, or God is partial to somebody who is their enemy, all kinds of misconceptions, wrong conceptions, misunderstanding. So, they are always in difficulty because they engage in sinful activities one after another, one after another, and they continuously suffer. Still, they will never surrender to God. So, Nārada is advising Vyāsadeva, you please describe the glories of the Supreme Lord to do good to all eight classes of men, both good and bad. See, this is the vision of the Āchārya. This is the vision of the pure devotee. A pure devotee is not thinking, let me try to do good to some good people. No. He is thinking of doing good to all suffering people, all types of people who are suffering material miseries, whether they are good men or bad men. So, please understand, in this world, other than devotees of the Supreme Lord, everyone else can be classified into these eight classes of good and bad men.

### Srimad Bhagavatam, universal benefit, transcendental peace

**Key Quote:** "Srimad Bhagavatam is therefore not meant for any particular class of men or any particular section of society. No. It is meant for the sincere soul who actually wants his own welfare and peace of mind."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes that Srimad Bhagavatam is for everyone seeking welfare and peace, offering liberation from material miseries and transcendence through hearing the Lord's activities.

This is the analysis of the Gita: Chaturvidhā bhajante mām janā sukṛtino arjuna and namām duṣkṛtino mūḍhā prapadyante narādhamā māyayā pahṛta-jñāna āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritam. So, if people are not devotees of the Supreme Lord in this world, then they are either fruitive workers who perform pious activities or they are sinful people who simply don't care for any pious activities and they simply do all kinds of sinful activities. So, for doing good to all eight classes of men, Narada is advising Vyasa Deva kindly compile the Bhagavatam, in which you exclusively describe the transcendental glories of the Supreme Lord, especially by describing His extraordinary activity. So, the conclusion is, Srimad Bhagavatam is therefore not meant for any particular class of men or any particular section of society. No. It is meant for the sincere soul who actually wants his own welfare and peace of mind. Simply by hearing Bhagavatam, the extraordinary activities of the transcendental Supreme Lord, one can become free from all material miseries, one can become peaceful in the mind, one can become situated transcendentally above the three gunas, no more victimized by the three modes. So, that is what is the Bhagavatam. Hare Krishna. I will stop here.

He was absorbed in the transcendental thought of separation from the Lord, and when it was very painful for him." So, a disciple should be inquisitive. A disciple should inquire from his spiritual master and should inquire about relevant things. So, here the relevant question is raised about the perfection of Nārada.

How was it achieved after he got initiated? Already, Nārada has described about his previous life, the birth and activities. Till this stage, he was able to get initiated, and the confidential knowledge about the personality of Godhead was revealed to him by the Bhaktivedanta's. And he was endowed with spiritual opulences and with the understanding about the confidential understanding about the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So now, Nārada is going to describe to Vyāsadeva, based on Vyāsadeva's enquiry, how Nārada was able to have a brief audience with the Supreme Lord, and it happened when he was completely absorbed in transcendental thought of separation from the Lord.

This desire to enquire from the spiritual master is an essential factor to the progressive path. This process is technically known as Saddharmaprcchā.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Srila Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing the significant transformation of Narada from an ordinary maidservant's son to a spiritual body of eternal life, bliss, and knowledge.

So, in the parport, Śrīla Prabhupāda says, "Śrī Nārada Muni in his previous life was just an ordinary maid servant's son. So, how he became so perfectly transformed into the spiritual body of eternal life, bliss and knowledge is certainly important. How did this transformation take place?" Bhagavad Gītā says our body is changing always. Dehi nosmin yathā dehe kaumāram yauvanam jarā. We all experience as spirit soul the body which is different from the spirit, the material body is changing from childhood to youth to old age. Similarly, the body changes at death. Of this there is no doubt. Everybody changes their body even at the time of death, tathā dehaṁ taraptiḥ. But, the significant question here is not whether the change of body has happened or not. It is about how he became so perfectly transformed into the spiritual body of eternal life, bliss and knowledge. That is the important question being raised here.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of learning from Narada's life how he achieved a spiritual body from an ordinary material one, highlighting the significance of the changes that occurred and ending with Hare Krishna.

That is not going to happen just like that. Change from a material body to a spiritual one is not going to happen easily. It doesn't happen automatically. So, how did this change happen? That is precisely the question that Vyasa Deva is asking from his spiritual master, Narada Muni. Sri Vyasa Deva desired him, desired that Narada, disclose the facts for everyone's satisfaction. It is very important to learn from the life of Narada how did Narada Muni get the spiritual body in this life when he had an ordinary material body in his previous life, like any of us, most insignificant parentage. He was born in the previous life as a son of an insignificant maid servant. But some changes happened, and those changes are important to hear about firsthand from Narada Muni himself. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

### cyclical creation, mundane wranglers, spiritual inquiry

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "The mundane wranglers waste time and energy with archeological excavations without searching into the vital necessities of life."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Srila Prabhupada's commentary on the cyclical nature of creation and criticizes 'mundane wranglers' who focus on material discoveries rather than spiritual inquiry.

So very interesting purport by Srila Prabhupada, a very pertinent observation is made by Srila Prabhupada. Kindly note this. Prabhupada says in the purport, "Man's activities in agriculture, mining, farming, industries, gardening etc. were all on the same scale as they are now." Sometimes we think when we read so-called history that there was a primitive civilization of man was very primitive condition caveman and then gradually evolved to become the present civilized society but that is not the fact. Man's activities in all these fields agriculture mining farming industries gardening etc. were on the same scale as they are now even previous to the present creation and the same activities will remain as they are even in the next creation cyclically this is going on creation maintenance destruction again creation maintenance destruction in a day of Brahma in a day of Brahma of course there are changes that happen even within one day of Brahma but at the beginning of the day of Brahma there is creation and the end of day of Brahma there is destruction so in between there is there are changes taking place with essentially man's activities at least on the earth are similar to what was there in a previous creation. So, Srila Prabhupada says, after many hundreds of millions of years, one creation is started by the law of nature and the history of the universe repeats itself practically in the same way. It is out of necessity that human beings have to do cultivation of the field and then there are forests which give certain produce without any human endeavor by the arrangement of the Supreme Lord through the nature, mother nature and then there are mines which has got deposits of different minerals, different metals, that mining activity was always there even in the past and it is there now and will be there in the future also. So, the history of the universe repeats itself practically in the same way. As far as major activities are concerned among the different classes of people on different planets, it repeats itself. Now, here is the important observation that Srila Prabhupada is making. The mundane wranglers waste time and energy. They waste time with archeological excavations without searching into the vital necessities of life. So, mundane wranglers. Mundane means they are only concerned with matter and material things and material existence. They are not have understanding of something beyond matter. They do not know who they are. They do not know their spirit. They don't know there is a spiritual dimension to existence in every human being, every living being actually, particularly in a human being. And there is a spiritual world beyond this material world, which is eternal. Of this, there are people who have no knowledge, no idea, no trace of any understanding. Totally zero when it comes to spiritual understanding. So they are called mundane wranglers.

### spiritual inquiry, Brahma Jijnasa, human life's purpose

**Key Quote:** "Without making this inquiry, human life is completely wasted."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of spiritual inquiry (Brahma Jijnasa) as the vital necessity of human life, contrasting it with the wasted effort of focusing solely on material pursuits.

They are simply busy with material things. And they are fascinated if they discover something by excavation. Some ancient civilization, they had beautiful buildings. They had a... They had, you know, gold coins. They had a system of mining and purifying. Metallurgy was very advanced even thousands of years back. When they discover all this through excavations, then they waste so much time into rebuilding so-called history. But... What they... Are losing out is the valuable human life, the time we can spend in this human form of life into searching out the vital necessity of this human form of life. What is that? Inquiry into the absolute truth. In just three words in Vedanta Sutra, the whole thing is summarized: Athato Brahma Jijnasa. Vital necessity of life. Inquire into what is spirit. What is Brahman or who is God. Or who you are. Inquire into this. Without making this inquiry, human life is completely wasted. All the developed intelligence, the ability to ask fundamental questions and try to get meaningful answers, this opportunity is lost. It's a greatest loss for a human being. In the evolution of the consciousness through different species of life in this material world, the human form of life is the most evolved, developed state of consciousness. So, therefore, it is very well known human being is a rational animal, can think, can contemplate, can inquire, can learn, can teach, can do so many things with this developed intelligence, developed consciousness. So, the most important inquiry, the most important inquiry is inquiry about spirit, inquiry about God, inquiry about spiritual reality. That's called Brahma Jijnasa. And that is the most important part of a Vedic knowledge.

### Vedic knowledge, spiritual realization, Narada's example

**Key Quote:** "Just by studying, understanding, realizing your spirit soul, all your problems are solved."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights the importance of spiritual knowledge over material knowledge, emphasizing that realizing one's spiritual identity solves all problems, and concludes by reiterating Narada Muni's example of prioritizing spiritual pursuits.

Vedic knowledge, clearly there are two departments: material knowledge and spiritual knowledge. Of these two, spiritual knowledge is the most important because that is the vital necessity of a human being. Why? Just by studying, understanding, realizing your spirit soul, all your problems are solved. Your life is ultimately a success. You can end the repetition of birth and death. You can solve all your problems only by realizing the truth that you are spirit. And of course, the supreme absolute truth is the supreme spirit, Krishna. And you have got a relationship. Three things. But it begins with inquiry into who am I. Essentially, who am I? Am I this body? Am I something different from the body? Or this inquiry is the most important inquiry. So, instead of wasting time inquiring into what was this civilization like 300 years back or 500 years back, what kind of buildings were they building, what were they eating, what were they doing for entertainment, all these kind of things are waste of human energy. That is what is being pointed out. So, after getting his impetus in spiritual life, Narad Muni, even as a 5 year old boy, did not waste time a single moment with economic development. Although he passed through all these towns, villages, mines, industries, he continually went on till he reached that sacred holy place to sit and do meditation. That was his aim. So, we will continue this discussion in the next session.

### detachment, renunciation, spiritual life

**Verse References:** SB 1.6.12
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Somebody serious about spiritual life will never be attracted to any place which is meant for satisfying the senses."
**Summary:** Narada Muni's travels are described, emphasizing his detachment from material attractions and focus on spiritual pursuits.

In this session, we will be discussing from the twelfth verse of the sixth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Chitradhatu Vichitradrin Ibha Bhagna Bhujadruman Jalashayan Shivajalan Nalini Surasevitaha Chitrasvanai Patrarathair Vibhrahmad Bhramara Shriyaha. The meaning of this verse is: I pass through hills and mountains full of reservoirs of various minerals like gold, silver, and copper, and through tracts of land with reservoirs of water filled with beautiful lotus flowers fit for the denizens of heaven, decorated with bewildered bees and singing birds. Naradamuni is describing his travel. He passed through different kinds of places, and as it will be explained in the next verse, it is the duty of a sanyasi, a renunciant, or one dedicated to spiritual life, to actually travel through different tracts of land which are all the creation of the supreme lord in this material world, and none of such places have any attraction for a serious spiritualist like Narada. There is no attraction. He is passing through reservoirs of gold, silver, copper, but he has no attraction for them, neither is he attracted to a beautiful place filled with clear water and lotus flowers so beautiful that it is fit for the heavenly inhabitants, singing birds, beautiful bees. He is not at all attracted by any of these because with one pointed attention he is determined to go to a place fit for him to sit and do meditation on the supreme lord as taught by the bhaktivedantas, his spiritual masters, when they were staying for four months during chaturmasya in that place in the forest where his mother was a maid servant. So somebody serious about spiritual life will never be attracted to any place which is meant for satisfying the senses. Any place which is meant for sense satisfaction, such a place has no attraction for a transcendentalist.

**Summary:** Narada Muni's journey through dangerous forests is described, highlighting the challenges faced by a traveling mendicant.

A serious spiritualist. The next verse describes further what are the different kinds of places he passed through. The thirteenth verse: nala venu sharastamba kusha ki chaka gahvaram eka evaati yathoham adraksham vipinam mahat ghoram pratibhayakaram vyala uluka shivajiram. The meaning of this verse is: I then passed alone through many forests of rushes, bamboo reeds, sharp grass, weeds, and caves which were very difficult to go through alone. I visited deep, dark, and dangerously fearful forests which were the play yards of snakes, owls, and jackals. So Narad Muni is passing through not only beautiful places, attractive places, but also through some dangerous tracts of land like forests which are deep, dark, and dangerously fearful because they are inhabited by snakes, owls, and jackals.

**Key Quote:** "The real purpose of a sanyasi is not to beg, so just to satisfy some householders he may take a little food, may take, may not take, but his main purpose is how to enlighten the householder in spiritual subject matter."
**Summary:** The role of a mendicant (parivrajaka acharya) is explained, emphasizing their duty to enlighten householders spiritually, rather than simply begging for food.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains it is the duty of a mendicant. Mendicant literally means a beggar, but it is taken in the sense of a spiritualist who lives a very simple life by being dedicated for spiritual practice, and for maintaining his body he simply begs for some little food from a householder. So such a mendicant is called a parivrajaka acharya. Parivrajaka means he is travelling constantly, wandering, and acharya means he is teaching. What is he teaching? He is teaching spiritual subject matter. He is awakening householders who are lost in material way of life to remind them about their spiritual goal in life. So he enlightens them, and on the plea of begging he goes to their house, but his real purpose of going to the house of a householder is not for begging, it is for enlightening them spiritually. Of course, in the Vedic culture, the householders welcome a sanyasi or a travelling mendicant or a transcendentalist. They welcome him home because they know that he brings in all auspiciousness, but the real purpose of a sanyasi is not to beg. So just to satisfy some householders, he may take a little food, may take, may not take, but his main purpose is how to enlighten the householder in spiritual subject matter which is the prime necessity for every human being.

**Summary:** The duties of a parivrajaka acharya are further elaborated, including experiencing God's creation through travel and enlightening others, followed by a brief introduction to the four stages of sanyas.

So here Srila Prabhupada is telling it is the duty of a parivrajaka acharya to experience all varieties of God's creation. How does he do that? By travelling alone through all forests, hills, towns, villages, travelling alone to gain faith in God and strength of mind as well as to enlighten the inhabitants with the message of God. This is the, this is the program of a parivrajaka acharya. In sanyas, there are four stages of development of a complete renunciation. The beginning stage is called kutichaka, the second stage is called bahudhaka, the third stage is called parivrajaka acharya, and the fourth stage is called paramahamsa.

### sanyas, renunciation, dependence on God, fearlessness
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/J643v1bHGEQ?t=562

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "One's dependence should be on the supreme lord seated in the heart, who is always accompanying every person and is providing, maintaining, is actually taking care of the well being."
**Summary:** The four stages of sanyas are explained, focusing on the initial stages of renunciation and the development of dependence on God, leading to fearlessness.

Briefly I will just mention what are the stages of sanyas. Kutichaka is when one decides to renounce connection with family members, leaves home, but not yet practiced how to maintain himself independently, so he builds a cottage outside his village and he receives food from home. He is cut off from the family members, social interaction, but as far as his food requirement is concerned, it is taken care of by the family, former family members. When he is practiced in that way, then he realizes how he can actually maintain himself very easily by begging a little from many different houses, so nobody will feel a burden for weeding one person a little bit, collecting little, little from many houses, then nobody feels the burden and the person is very easily able to get his necessity of daily food, and so that's called bahudhaka, the second stage of sanyas where one is not dependent only on his one home, the former purvashram family residence, but begs little from the different people of the village outside which he is staying, and in that way very easily he maintains himself, his requirement of food. Then when he becomes further well established in sanyas, then he starts actually travelling. Travelling is for gaining strength of mind, faith in God, and enlighten the inhabitants as he is passing through different towns, villages, or settlements, human settlements like that. So these three things are particularly mentioned here: travelling alone, travelling alone to become fearless because a sanyasi knows that God is in my heart and he is my top most well wisher, he is my protector, he is my maintainer. Only due to illusion somebody may think that I have to depend on somebody else or something else outside of me. Actually one's dependence should be on the supreme lord seated in the heart who is always accompanying every person and is providing, maintaining, is actually taking care of the well being. It is only this supreme lord who does so. This is the purpose of a sanyasi.

### preaching, Lord Chaitanya, sanyas in Kali Yuga, devotional service

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "In this age of Kali, sanyasi is forbidden for ordinary people because they cannot maintain sanyasi like in former ages, but for the sake of preaching one may accept sanyasi simply for the sake of preaching Krishna consciousness."
**Summary:** Lord Chaitanya is presented as an example of a traveling sanyasi, and the role of sanyas in Kali Yuga is discussed, emphasizing the importance of preaching Krishna consciousness.

Now further Praveshwara Prabhupada says a sanyasi is duty bound to take all these risks without fear, and the most typical sanyasi of the present age is Lord Chaitanya, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. He took sanyas and he travelled in the same manner like Narada Muni. Narada Muni travelled in a former age. Chaitanya travelled through the central Indian jungles enlightening even the tigers, bears, snakes, deer, elephants, and many other jungle animals, what to speak of enlightening human beings. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu even enlightened jungle animals while travelling. Of course, he is the supreme lord, so he can enlighten any living being, any living entity, but at least we should attempt to enlighten human beings in the subject matter of sankirtana bhakti yoga or practice of devotional service which is the recommended process in this age. So sanyasi is duty bound to take all these risks without fear. So Srila Prabhupada further says in this age, Kali, in the age of Kali, sanyasi is forbidden for ordinary people because they cannot maintain sanyasi like in former ages, but for the sake of preaching one may accept sanyasi simply for the sake of preaching Krishna consciousness because there is a need for preachers to travel and preach. So this sanyasi is more than change of dress. What is important is to stop social intercourse and devote life exclusively for preaching the message of God among the common people. That is the truth. So I'll stop.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Narada Muni's travels and how a mendicant should rely on nature's gifts rather than begging, emphasizing self-sufficiency and detachment.

In this session we will be discussing from the 14th verse of the 6th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Parishranta Indriya Atma Aham Trd Parito Bubhukshitaha Snatva Peetva Hrade Nadya Upas Prishto Gata Shramaha. The meaning of this verse is: Thus travelling, I felt tired, both bodily and mentally, and I was both thirsty and hungry. So I took a bath in a river, lake, and also drank water. By contacting water, I got relief from my exhaustion. So Narav Muni is describing his experiences while travelling to that place. In that holy place, on the way he came across so many different kinds of prosperous towns, gold mines, beautiful lakes filled with lotus flowers and singing birds, but he was not attracted by any of those. His mind was fixed on reaching that sacred spot where he could sit. So what about the demands of the body while travelling? A travelling mendicant can meet the needs of the body, namely thirst and hunger, by the gifts of nature without being a beggar at the doors of the householder.

**Key Quote:** "So to awaken them to spiritual reality is the duty of a traveling transcendentalist Parivrajakacharya."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the role of a traveling transcendentalist in enlightening householders who are often engrossed in family affairs.

By Krishna's arrangement, he could get the needs of the body. By Krishna's arrangement, there is sufficient food and water available for any person who just wants to dedicate himself for spiritual life without any need for begging at the door of a householder. So Srila Prabhupada further says the mendicant therefore does not go to the house of a householder to beg but to enlighten him spiritually. There is no need for begging, but then on the plea of begging sometimes is transcendent. A spiritualist may go and approach a householder simply to take the opportunity to enlighten the householder spiritually. That is a real purpose because people, especially in household life, they become busy with their work, family maintenance, providing for the needs of the family members, etc. Many responsibilities as regards the maintenance of the family. So they get more or less lost in such family affairs. So to awaken them to spiritual reality is the duty of a traveling transcendentalist.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the Himalayas as a place of abundance, providing both material and spiritual necessities for those seeking shelter.

Parivrajakacharya. Now Srila Prabhupada especially mentions elsewhere about the Himalaya mountains. He says that the Himalaya mountains are famous for all richnesses. What are the riches in the Himalaya mountains? There are innumerable caves to live in, numberless trees of good fruits to eat, good springs to drink water from, and profuse drugs and minerals to cure diseases. Any man who is not materially prosperous can take shelter of these great mountains and he will be provided with everything required. Both the materialist and the spiritualist can take advantage of the great shelter of the Himalayas. So Naran Muni is heading to the Himalayas only and in that place everything is provided for by the superior arrangement of the Supreme Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the resources available in the Himalayas, including fruits, flowers, caves, and hot springs, emphasizing its suitability for secluded meditation.

Any of you have been to the Himalayas? If you have been to Himalayas you should—generally people don't go visit Himalayas like away from the crowded places. If you go to a place which is not so much crowded then you'll find so many nice fruit trees. Plenty of fruits and there are plenty of flowers available, caves where one can stay, numberless caves, so many caves are there and the river flows with crystal-clear water. There are springs, even hot water springs so that one can take bath when it is very cold in the hot water of the hot water spring and there are so many herbs to cure diseases. In case somebody becomes diseased then there are so many herbs to cure the diseases so everything is provided for both materially and spiritually and they can sit in a secluded place and nicely do meditation without being disturbed or bothered by anyone else so the fifteenth words Narada Muni further describes his travel.

tasmin nirmanuje aranyepipalopastha ashritah atmana atmanam atmastham yathasutam achintayam atmanam atmastham yathasutam achintayam. The meaning of this verse is: after that under the shadow of a banyan tree in an uninhabited forest, I began to meditate upon the Supersoul situated within, using my intelligence as I had learned from liberated souls. So Narada Muni has reached a proper spot, uninhabited forest. It has to be a secluded place for doing meditation without being disturbed by anyone else and there under the shadow of a banyan tree. Banyan tree gives very nice shade so one can be sitting underneath a banyan tree then firmly seated he began to meditate upon the Supersoul within his heart doing meditation and there's a system of meditation and to search out the Supersoul one has to use one's intelligence applying the intelligence to search out the Supersoul by the method that has been taught by liberated souls whatever he had

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of learning meditation from authoritative scriptures and a bona fide spiritual master, rather than following personal whims.

learned from the liberated souls exactly that he applied. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport: one should not meditate according to one's personal whims. Meditation is not like whatever I like to do I'll do, no, that is not proper. Such meditation which one does whimsically will not give any tangible result in terms of self-realization. So Srila Prabhupada further says one should know perfectly well from the authoritative sources of scriptures through the transparent medium of a bona fide spiritual master and by proper use of one's trained intelligence for meditating upon the Supersoul dwelling within every living being. So first of all one should know that Supersoul is seated in my heart and this description is available in the authoritative scriptures but such scriptural knowledge is learned from a bona-fide spiritual master and the spiritual master trains one's intelligence how to search out the Supersoul within the heart and when these words are said surely achieve enlightenment the spiritual master will not pit itself on aHa and fix one's mind on the form of the Supersoul in the heart to meditate and

achieve the perfection of meditation called Samadhi. So further Srila Prabhupada says this consciousness is firmly developed by a devotee who has rendered loving service unto the Lord by carrying out the orders of the spiritual master. So what is the training that the spiritual master gives? He trains the devotee how to render loving service to the Supreme Lord Krishna. This is the training and this training results in the consciousness being properly fixed in devotional service to the Supreme Lord. That is very very important. It's a standard one has to establish in order to be properly situated for doing meditation. Now it is described here as far as Narada is concerned even when he was a small boy, five-year-old boy, he contacted bona fides spiritual masters. He served them sincerely and he got enlightenment rightly. They blessed him with the transcendental knowledge and Narada was enlightened because he had rendered nice service to them so they gave the blessing by which he could understand that he has to meditate on the Supersoul in the heart and he has to follow the right process for that.

Our entire mind or consciousness on the process perfectly following whatever has been taught by the spiritual master without any concoction, without any speculation, without any doubts. The spiritual master gives clear instructions. That is a bona fide practice. He himself has heard. He himself is enlightened. He himself has realized. So he can give perfect directions without any ambiguity to the disciple and disciple also hears very attentively, very nicely. Tasmad eke na manasa. Tasmad eke na manasa.

And there are nine steps through which one progresses as one practices Bhakti according to the standard procedure given in the devotional literature. So in different places in the scriptures, it is described how Bhakti has to be practiced. One of the disciples of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, by name Shrila Rupa Goswami, has gathered all the details of the practice of Bhakti from different scriptures. He is expert in gathering all the connected details about practice of bhakti and he has presented them systematically as the science of bhakti yoga in a scripture he has compiled called Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu, which is translated and explained by Sri la Prabhupada, the founder acharya of ISKCON, as Nectar of Devotion. So in Nectar of Devotion, Sri la Prabhupada explains, citing Sri la Rupa Goswami, that Bhakti begins with Shraddha. Shraddha is faith, transcendental faith. So what is this transcendental faith? This transcendental faith is that this process of Bhakti is a dirt, the understanding and the trust that this is something which is very bona fide, this is something which is very, very authentic, and this is something which will lead me to the highest perfection if I begin and follow the process systematically. This requires guidance by a

**Summary:** The speaker continues describing the steps of Bhakti, including association with devotees (sadhu-sangha), engaging in devotional activities (bhajana kriya), and receiving initiation (diksha) from a spiritual master in the parampara system.

bona fide spiritual master of divine arts who not only explains but also teaches practically how to develop that system, starting point of buscar the which is the transcendental faith. Oh, now Shraddha, ah, those Shraddha that leads to sadhu-sangha of shraddha huge... suspensions and through that the spiritual power goes liberating but the сотрудển are also practicing and who are also seriously desirous of making progress starting from shraddha till the highest perfection of prema. Prema is love for Krishna. So starting with shraddha till prema, there are nine steps. Pradha is the first step and prema is the ninth step, the highest perfection, the ultimate perfection. In between there are other steps. So shraddha leads to sadhu sangha, associating with like-minded devotees who are also practicing the standard procedure and our serious aspirants for achieving the highest perfection. Sadhu sangha then bhajana kriya step.

**Key Quote:** "That leads to Anartha Nivritti, the fourth step...cleansing the heart of all kinds of misgivings...And when Anartha Nivritti has sufficiently happened...then there is nishtha. One becomes fixed up in the practice of devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Anartha Nivritti (cleansing of misgivings) and Nishtha (fixed devotion) as steps in the process of Bhakti.

Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. That leads to Anartha Nivritti, the fourth step. Anartha Nivritti involves cleansing the heart of all kinds of misgivings, all kinds of misconceptions, wrong ideas about who I am, who is God, what is my relationship, what is this world, where have I come from, what is my ultimate goal in life, everything. We have some... some idea. But all the misunderstandings are cleared away and the correct understanding becomes established properly in the heart. And when Anartha Nivritti has sufficiently happened, say about 80 percent, then there is nishtha. One becomes fixed up in the practice of devotional service. In the association of devotees, following the standard procedure as taught by the bona fide spiritual master, without any deviation, without any speculation, without any concoction, and without any doubt. So one makes steady progress. So nishtha is the fifth stage or the fifth step. In the nine step process of perfection in bhakti, nishtha is that one becomes fixed up. There is no more any wavering. In the beginning, there is little obstacle which may make one feel that, oh, today I cannot chant or today I cannot do this. Today I cannot read. But by... by cleansing the heart of the misgivings and sufficient cleansing has happened. As I mentioned, about 80 percent cleansing has happened. Then one becomes very serious, very fixed up and will every day do the chanting, do the follow the process of bhakti, practice of bhakti without any... without any... break. Continuously, steadily follow the process without any break. Just like a good student in school will attend class every day. The school is arranging to conduct the classes. A serious student, a good student will very nicely attend the classes and do all the work associated with learning. Similarly, in bhakti also every day chanting everyday, reading every day, praying every day, paying obeisances. Whatever the standard processes.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Ruchi (spiritual taste) and Asakti (attachment) as further steps in the development of Bhakti.

Then the sixth step from nishtha it progresses to the six step, it's called... Ruchi. Ruchi progresses to the sixth step. It's called Ruchi. One develops spiritual taste for whatever one is doing. The spiritual taste is different from any material liking or material experience of some pleasantness. Beyond that, it is a spiritual taste which is because of the heart being cleansed of all material misgivings. So one develops the spiritual taste which is going to even make the devotee further determined to continue very seriously, very nicely, very rigidly follow the process and the seventh step is what is called as asakti, attachment. One becomes so attached to doing this chanting and reading and hearing and bowing down and worshipping and all those things, the process that I cannot remain without doing this even one day. I just cannot miss it. It becomes the most important thing in one person's, a devotee's life. This practice of bhakti becomes so I become attached, asakti.

Then the 8th step is bhava. That is what is mentioned here. Bhava is one the stage where one experiences transcendental ecstasy. There is joy by chanting, by reading, by hearing, by worshipping, by contemplating on the pastimes of the Lord as described in the Bhagavatam. There is ecstasy and Narada Muni, he is briefly describing he began meditation and he came to the stage of bhava where he began to experience ecstasy within and there are 8 symptoms of ecstasy that is described again in Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu that the 8 symptoms of ecstasy are perspiring, standing of the hairs on the body, faltering of the voice, trembling of the body, change of bodily colors, shedding of tears. That is described here ashrukh, ashru means tears, ashru colour tears roll down akshuesya of the eyes and tears started rolling down means he is getting daunted, tears started rolling down means he is getting daunted means he has come to the stage of bhava he is experiencing transcendental ecstasy and the last symptom that is described here is devastation. So these are not to be imitated but these are natural, natural reactions because the body cannot contain that extreme joy, spiritual joy which is beyond any material experience. It's a completely different experience and it's a very advanced stage of bhakti. So Naradunni experienced that and that is what is

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 17th verse of the 6th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on Narada Muni's experience of ecstasy during meditation and his inability to perceive himself or the Lord.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 17th verse of the 6th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Prema Atibhara Nirbhinna Pulaka Ango Ati Nirvrata Ananda Samplave Leeno Na Apashyam Ubhayam Mune. The meaning of this verse is, O Vyasa Deva, Narada Muni is speaking to Vyasa Deva, describing the experience he underwent in his previous life when he was instructed by the Bhaktivedantas and he went to a secluded place, a sacred spot in the Himalayas and he sat there firmly and began to do meditation. So, we have heard so far how he experienced symptoms of ecstasy. So, what does it mean to ecstasy? One of the symptoms is described in the 16th verse, that tears started rolling down from his eyes. What else happened? That is being described in this verse. O Vyasa Deva, at that time, being exceedingly overpowered by feelings of happiness, every part of my body became separately enlivened. Being absorbed in an ocean of ecstasy, I could not see both myself and the Lord. This is the 17th verse.

**Key Quote:** "Spiritual feelings of happiness and intense ecstasies have no mundane comparison."
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the incomparable nature of spiritual joy and ecstasy, contrasting it with the limitations of material happiness.

I just read the translation of the 17th verse. If you remember, in the 16th verse, Narada Muni had told, he experienced that joy, the ecstasy of having come to the stage of that bhava. Bhava nirjita chetasa and tears began to flow from his eyes, tears of joy, extreme joy and he also had mentioned the Supreme Lord appeared on the lotus of his heart. Krishna, who is seated on the heart, gave him darshan. Gave him darshan. Next, what? He experienced, Narada experienced, that he is overpowered by feelings of happiness, exceedingly overpowered. That means the happiness is so much, there is no comparison to any material experience of happiness at all. It is completely different. This is the first point. Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, Spiritual feelings of happiness and intense ecstasies have no mundane comparison. There is no comparison with anything material that we experience in this world. There is no material comparison. This is entirely a different experience. It is incomparable because, the amount of joy one experiences is actually unlimited.

**Summary:** The speaker outlines the stages of Bhakti, emphasizing the importance of spiritual practice, purification, and giving up misconceptions to progress towards experiencing divine ecstasy.

Though we are very, very tiny and our experience has got limitation, but still, to the extent we can experience as much joy as we really can, it is possible to experience as much joy as we really can. It is possible by spiritual practice of Bhakti, Sadhana Bhakti, through the stages, as I mentioned in the previous session, Shraddha, Sadhu Sangha, Bhajana Kriya, Anartha Nivritti, Nishtha, Ruchi, Asakti, Bhava. In that Bhava stage, the eighth stage, one stage before Prema, one stage before the ultimate perfection. In that Bhava stage, the eighth stage, one stage before Prema, one step before the ultimate perfection. In that stage, one is exceedingly overpowered by feelings of happiness. So, there is no mundane comparison. Therefore, it is very difficult to give expression to such feelings. We can just have a glimpse, as far as we are concerned, we are beginners, how we have got to make progress. It will take time. We have to become serious. We have to apply the principles. We have to follow all the rules, regulations. We have to associate with devotees. We have to give up all misconceptions that we have about ourselves, or God, or the relationship, or about this world. Everything we have to. We have to purify our heart. We have to purify our consciousness.

**Summary:** The lecture explains how the senses become awakened to serve the Lord, focusing on experiencing Krishna's form, fragrance, and other transcendental qualities through the senses.

So, we can get an idea in the words of Narada, as he is describing to Vyasa Deva. In the words of Narada, we can get a brief glimpse of the ecstasy that Narada Muni experienced by reaching that eighth stage. Reaching that eighth stage of progress in the practice of Bhakti. Here, Srila Prabhupada says, Each and every part of the body or senses has its particular function. See, a living person means there are senses. Senses of perception and senses of action. All these ten senses are centered around the mind. And the mind is called the sense within. Mind is the center. So, in the mind and the senses, one is able to experience joy, spiritual joy. And such experience, what does it do? The spiritual joy of ecstasy, bhava. That after seeing the Lord, the senses become fully awakened to render service to the Lord. Every sense has got a certain function. The eyes for seeing the form of the Lord. The ears for hearing about the Lord. The tongue for tasting food offered to the Lord. Offered tasting the tulsi leaves offered in the lotus feet of the Lord. The taste of prasadam or the taste of remnants of yajna shishta. And the nose for smelling the fragrant incense offered to the Lord. And all, all spiritual fragrances. It's not just that. That is the beginning. In the beginning we offer incense to the Lord when we do worship. But there are other kinds of spiritual fragrances. And just like Krishna's transcendental form has got a spiritual fragrance. Every spiritual form has got a unique spiritual fragrance. So when one is able to come face to face with Krishna, one is able to smell, relish that fragrance of Krishna's transcendental form.

One begins to feel exceedingly overpowered by joy upon seeing that most beautiful form. I am just trying to describe through words. But actually, each one of us has to actually see that form. Experience that vision of the form when Krishna gives darshan. Upon our seeing that form. Upon our sincere endeavor to practice bhakti exactly according to the scriptural directions. As taught practically by the bona fide spiritual master. Following his instructions very rigidly. And going through the process of purification. We will be able to see the Lord in the heart. To begin with. See the Lord in the heart. When he gives darshan. When our attention has been turned inward. Away from all material distractions. Material forms and material objects and material things. Away from that.

The fragrance of Krishna's transcendental form. The taste of offerings to Krishna. Like this. Every. The sense of touch. The embrace of the Lord. What is that experience? Embrace of the Lord. So all this is possible. And Narada Muni is describing that in very very brief. That in transcendental ecstasy it so happened that the senses became separately enlivened to serve the Lord. All this is ultimately meant for. All the senses are meant for serving the Lord. In the relationship of love. It is a loving relationship. In such loving relationship there is exchange of love. Through devotional service. Loving devotional service. So the senses become very very efficient. Most efficient in serving the Lord. That is the stage of ecstasy.

### transcendental form of the Lord, mind's desire, mental incongruities, Narada Muni's experience
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/xoI1iFCIR8g?t=58
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The transcendental form of the Lord, as it is, satisfies the mind's desire and at once erases all mental incongruities."
**Summary:** This segment explains the meaning of the verse, focusing on how the transcendental form of the Lord satisfies the mind and removes mental incongruities, as experienced by Narada Muni.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 18th verse of the 6th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: रूपं भगवतो यत्तन मनकान्तं शुचापहं अपश्यन सहत सोतस्थे वैक्लव्या दुर्मना इवा. The meaning of this verse is: "The transcendental form of the Lord, as it is, satisfies the mind's desire and at once erases all mental incongruities. Upon losing that form, I suddenly got up, being perturbed, as is usual, when one loses that which is desirable." So, Srila Nargumuni is explaining his experience to Vyasa Deva from his previous life. He began meditation. He had a glimpse of the Lord, and he became overjoyed with ecstasy. Suddenly, he lost that form. So then, after losing sight of that form, after getting a brief glimpse of darshan of that form of the Lord in the heart, Nargumuni is describing what was the kind of loss that he really felt when he lost sight of the Lord. The transcendental form of the Lord, as it is, satisfies the mind's desire. The mind is the center of all the senses, and the mind is driving the senses towards sense objects, looking for something. What is that something that each one of us is looking for? It is actually Krishna. Everyone is looking for Krishna, having forgotten Him, and also desiring to get back that which we have lost. The most desirable, the most beautiful, the most wonderful, the dear most, the dearest, we have lost that, so we are looking for that. So therefore, when we actually get darshan of the transcendental form of the Lord, then immediately our mind's desire is completely satisfied. And also, all the mental incongruities are erased, means in the mind we settle for something when we don't get what we are really looking for, and we think maybe this can satisfy me, but then we find something else which may be relatively either better or more beautiful or more pleasing for the mind, again it creates in the mind a kind of complex situation that maybe this is what I was looking for, no no no, this is not what I was looking for. So there are so many mental incongruities essentially established through contact with so many other forms other than the form of the Lord, so all these incongruities in the mind are completely erased when we actually get darshan of the form of the Lord.

### Narada Muni's experience, form of the Lord, material vs. spiritual form, limitations of material vision, Nirakar

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Nirakar means the Lord does not have a material form."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Narada Muni's experience of seeing the Lord's form, contrasting it with the common understanding of God being formless (Nirakar), and clarifying that Nirakar means the Lord doesn't have a material form, but a transcendental one, which cannot be seen with material eyes.

And that's what Narad Muni is describing here. So he says, "I lost that form which was completely satisfying to my mind, which erased the form of the Lord, which erased all my mental incongruities, that form I lost." And suddenly, on losing the form, all of a sudden I lost that form, then I became very much perturbed in my mind, and that is to be expected because when somebody loses something which is very, very desirable, then how do they feel? That's how I felt. So, Shrila Prabhupada makes a very important point in the purport here that the Lord is not formless, is experienced by Narad Muni. A widely prevalent understanding about God is that God is formless, Nirakar. Nirakar is one of the terms that is used to describe God. It is one of the terms that is used to describe the Lord's features, but we should carefully understand what this Nirakar means. Nirakar means the Lord does not have a material form. He doesn't have a form made of flesh and blood and skin and bones. No, He doesn't have such a form. He has a transcendental form. He has a completely spiritual form. That form cannot be seen with these ordinary eyes. These eyes are suitable only for seeing some material forms. Even material forms which are very big we cannot see. Material forms which are too close to the eye we cannot see. We cannot see even our own eyelids. We can't see something very small. We can't see if there is no light to see a particular object or a form. So, these eyes have got limitations. In any case, even if we overcome all kinds of limitations of this eye by some mechanical means, material means, still, spiritual form can never be seen by any material adjustment even for these eyes. You cannot see spiritual form with material vision, even making adjustments.

### spiritual endeavor, transcendental form, satisfaction of the mind, mental incongruities, material forms vs. spiritual form

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "One who has once seen that form is not satisfied with anything else."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that Narada Muni saw the transcendental form through spiritual endeavor, highlighting the unique ability of the Lord's form to completely satisfy the mind and erase mental incongruities, unlike any material form.

Not possible. So, here Srila Prabhupada is telling Narada Muni's experience of seeing the form of the Lord, is that Narada Muni is able to see the transcendental form of the Lord by his spiritual endeavor, by his spiritual efforts, not by any material efforts. But his form is completely different from all forms of our material experience. This is an important point. What Narada Muni saw was not just another experience of seeing a material form. It's not that. It is completely different. So, Srila Prabhupada explains, for the whole duration of our life, we go see different forms in the material world, but none of them is just apt to satisfy the mind, nor can any one of them vanish all perturbance of the mind. Two things Prabhupada is mentioning: none of them can satisfy the mind. No material form can satisfy the mind completely. And none of the material forms have got the power to erase all mental incongruities. That's not possible. So, therefore, what is mentioned by Narada Muni in this verse is very important to note. These are the special features of the transcendental form of the Lord. The transcendental form of the Lord is distinctly different from all material forms, and the special features are being mentioned specifically by Narada Muni, that it completely satisfies the mind. Vision of the transcendental form of the Lord completely satisfies the mind, and it erases all mental incongruities. Further, Srila Prabhupada says, one who has once seen that form is not satisfied with anything else. This is a fact. Having seen the transcendental form of the Lord even once, for a brief moment even, then one can never be satisfied with any other form.

### Nirakar, spiritual beings, eternal relationship with the Lord, searching for the spiritual form, Narada Muni's perturbation

**Key Quote:** "As spiritual beings, having eternal relations with that transcendental form of the Lord, we are life after life searching after that form of the Lord."
**Summary:** This segment reiterates the meaning of Nirakar, explains that we are eternally searching for the Lord's spiritual form, and describes Narada Muni's reaction of perturbation upon losing sight of that form.

The Lord is formless or impersonal means that He has nothing like a material form. This is again being stressed, that Nirakar means the Lord does not have a material form. Even descriptions of Lord being impersonal means He doesn't have a material personality. Now, Srila Prabhupada is also explaining in the purport, as spiritual beings having eternal relations with that transcendental form of the Lord, we are life after life searching after that form of the Lord, and we are not satisfied by any other form of material appeasement. See, this is a secret being revealed by Prabhupada based on Narad Muni's statement, that we are always looking, we are searching. But what are we searching? We are searching for the spiritual form of the Supreme Lord. Only that can satisfy our mind. Only that can give us the real joy that we are looking for. Narad Muni got a glimpse of this, but having not seen it again, he became perturbed and stood up all of a sudden to search it out. See, he got a glimpse, and he lost it, so he stood up all of a sudden. He was sitting and doing meditation. He stood up, and he began to search out, where did I lose, how did I lose sight of that beautiful transcendental form of the Lord?

### spiritual ignorance, reincarnation, struggle for existence, searching for the transcendental form

**Key Quote:** "For the soul there is no death, there is no birth."
**Summary:** This segment explains the concept of reincarnation and the continuous search for the transcendental form of the Lord due to spiritual ignorance, emphasizing the struggle for existence in the material world.

What we desire life after life. See, it is not just this life. From the Bhagavad Gita we understand, we are spirit soul. For the soul, for the real you or real I or real person, there is no death, there is no birth. So our real nature is spiritual, but we keep changing bodies. As long as we don't realize our self, we don't realize the Supreme Lord Krishna, and our relationship with Him, as long as we don't realize these three things, we keep taking birth again and again, simply quitting one body, entering another body. What kind of body? Material body. So that is what is being described here. What we desire life after life, if we remain spiritually ignorant, if we are not fortunate enough to come in touch with a pure devotee of Krishna, then we remain in ignorance. We simply are engaged in a hard struggle for existence. We keep searching for that spiritual form, transcendental form of the Supreme Lord, and none of the material forms...

**Key Quote:** "Though the deity is Krishna, the deity is completely spiritual, but unless our eyes are trained, unless we have got spiritual training, unless we have developed the spiritual vision, we cannot see the spiritual form of the deity."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the deity form in the temple, explaining that without proper spiritual training and vision, one may perceive it as merely a material statue, failing to recognize its spiritual essence.

Are like that. Somebody may say that the deity form in the temple is the transcendental form of the Lord. But then when we see the deity form without proper understanding, without proper spiritual training, then we see it as a material statue. We see it as simply a statue made of metal or wood or clay or stone, etc. We don't see it as a spiritual form, though the deity is Krishna. The deity is completely spiritual, but unless our eyes are trained, unless we have got spiritual training, unless we have developed the spiritual vision, we cannot see the spiritual form of the deity through our ordinary vision.

### Narada Muni's vision, desire to see the Lord, dissatisfaction

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "I desire to see again that transcendental form of the Lord in the heart, but despite my attempts to concentrate upon the heart, with eagerness to view the form again."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Narada Muni's desire to see the Lord again after a brief vision, and his subsequent dissatisfaction when he couldn't.

In this session we will be discussing from the first canto, sixth chapter, nineteenth and twentieth verses of the Srimad Bhagavatam. First the nineteenth verse, DIDRUKSHU STAD AHAM BHUYAH, PRANIDHAYA MANOHRDI, VIKSHAM ANO PINAPASYAM, AVITRUPTA IVATURAHA. The meaning of this verse is, I desire to see again that transcendental form of the Lord, but despite my attempts to concentrate upon the heart with eagerness, to view the form again, I could not see him anymore, and thus, dissatisfied, I was very much aggrieved. So the background for this verse is, in the previous session, we had heard how Narad Muni began to meditate on the form of the Lord in the heart, as he had been taught by the Bhaktivedantas, and using his intelligence to search out for the Lord in the heart, and very quickly he came to the stage of bhava, tears started flowing down from his eyes, and every part of his body he felt separately enlivened. In that state, the Lord gave him darshan within the heart, a brief darshan, but after a brief moment, when he was experiencing that ecstasy of joy of seeing the form of the Lord in the heart, suddenly he lost sight of that form. Then, he again tried to see that form of the Lord. So that is the description here. I desire to see again that transcendental form of the Lord in the heart, but despite my attempts to concentrate upon the heart, with eagerness to view the form again. He is again wanting to see. So he is thinking, let me do the same thing which I did previously. But he could not see the Lord, in spite of very sincere attempts, the same way, exactly the same way, as he had been taught, as he had done already, as he had already seen, he could not again see the form of the Lord, and he was very much dissatisfied and

### causeless mercy, no mechanical process, dependence on the Lord

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "There is no mechanical process to see the Lord, and it completely depends upon the causeless mercy of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that seeing the Lord is not a mechanical process based on karma, but depends entirely on the Lord's causeless mercy, using the analogy of the sun rising.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport that there is no mechanical process to see the Lord, and it completely depends upon the causeless mercy of the Lord. This word causeless means Lord will not give darshan because you are doing something good. Because of some act of yours, as it generally happens in this material world, according to the laws of karma, I do some pious activity, I get some pious result, or I do some sinful activity, then I may get a sinful result. But, the way to see the form of the Lord is no mechanical process, is no material method. We are completely dependent upon the causeless mercy of the Lord in trying to see his form. We cannot demand the Lord to be present before our vision. That I did this, I followed the process, I had taken instructions from the masters, the bhaktivedantas, so I should be able to see. Nobody can say that. And Srila Prabhupada gives an example just as we cannot demand the sun to rise whenever we like. Very good example. The sun rises exactly at the time according to its own schedule. The sun doesn't become subject to somebody else's control, or somebody else's demand. No. Same way, the Supreme Lord will give darshan whenever he wills, whenever he wants to give darshan. One should simply await the opportune moment and go on discharging his prescribed duty in devotional service of the Lord. So, this is the meaning of we should actually depend upon the causeless mercy of the Lord and not on

**Key Quote:** "One is our own sincere efforts according to the scriptural direction, according to the instructions of the bona fide spiritual master, according to the process, authorized process that has to be there. But this alone is not enough."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that while seeing the Lord depends on His mercy, sincere effort and following the authorized process are also necessary, and recounts Narada Muni's failed second attempt.

However, this does not mean that I may do nothing and I simply think that whenever the Lord wants to give me darshan, he will give me. Sometimes when we invite people to the temple, they tell, Jab Bhagwan bulayenge, hum ayenge. Whenever the Lord wants me to come, I'll come. Or whenever he invites me, I'll come. Now, this is not the correct attitude. If we don't take any step at all towards approaching the authorized process, then we'll never be able to see the Lord. We'll never be able to approach the Lord. This is very clear. So, two things. One is our own sincere efforts according to the scriptural direction, according to the instructions of the bona fide spiritual master, according to the process, authorized process that has to be there. But this alone is not enough. The second thing is the Lord's causeless mercy. So that is being described here that we have to await the opportune moment. We simply wait after doing whatever we have to do properly. Narad Muni thought the Lord could be seen again by the same mechanical process that was successful in the first attempt. But in spite of his utmost endeavor, he could not make the second attempt successful.

### unalloyed devotion, love binds the Lord, Mother Yashoda

**Key Quote:** "He can simply be bound up by the tie of unalloyed devotion... It is love that can bind the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that pure, unalloyed devotion is what pleases and binds the Lord, illustrating this with the story of Mother Yashoda trying to tie Krishna.

So, Srila Prabhupada says the Lord is completely independent of all obligations. But one important thing, the most important thing we should know about approaching the Lord or doing the devotional services, he can simply be bound up by the tie of unalloyed devotion. One thing that Krishna really is completely thoroughly pleased when a devotee offers pure devotional service. It is also called devotion unmixed with anything else. Sent person pure devotional service. Only that can actually bind the Lord because he agrees to become bound up. Just like Mother Yashoda, she attempted to tie the Lord her child, whom she thought of as her beloved child when he was becoming little naughty. She wanted to tie him to a grinding mortar with a rope. She was trying and trying and trying and the rope was always falling short by two fingers. That actually Krishna showed to us, it was for demonstrating to us, that he is not bound up simply because you know, of some mother Yashoda catching him and binding and attempting to bind him with some rope. She got all the rope available in her house but she was somehow not able to tie him. And his form appeared only a limited form but we should know the Lord's form is unlimited and also one cannot bind him simply by some attempt of one's own. The Lord should agree to become bound. So after Mother Yashoda tried and tried and she became exhausted, then Krishna just smiled and immediately she was able to tie him. So that is actually to also teach us that he agreed to become bound up by the love of Mother Yashoda. It is not ropes that can bind the Lord. It is love that can bind the Lord. And what kind of love is this? Love out of pure devotion. That is what can

**Key Quote:** "The Lord is not visible or perceivable by our material senses... He may be seen out of his own accord when he gives darshan, when he gives vision to us."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Lord's spiritual form cannot be perceived by material senses, but He can give darshan out of His causeless mercy, though people may misunderstand His form.

So, he cannot be bound up simply by some material attempts. Similarly, the Lord is not visible or perceivable by our material senses. Shastras clearly say material senses are totally incapable of actually perceiving the Lord. Though, when he appears as an incarnation, he gives darshan even though he comes in his spiritual form and these eyes are useless for seeing spiritual form. They are totally incapable of seeing any spiritual form. But still, he gives darshan to even people who have just got this ordinary vision. He gives darshan. That is his causeless mercy. But people mistake him to be another created being of this world. If he appears in a human-like form, as he appears when he appears as Krishna, then they think he is an ordinary covered boy or ordinary prince of this world, as son of Vasudeva. As son of Nanda Maharaj, they think he is just an ordinary covered boy. Or when he appears in the form of a fish or a tortoise or a boar, they think he is another and that creature is another boar or another fish of this world. No! He is completely spiritual and completely transient to everything material. He may be seen out of his own accord when he gives darshan, when he gives vision to us.

### transcendental words, mitigating grief, probationary stage

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Seeing my attempts in that lonely place, the personality of Godhead who is transcendental to all mundane description spoke to me with gravity and pleasing words just to mitigate my grief."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 20th verse, explaining that the Lord spoke to Narada to mitigate his grief, and discusses how the Lord's words are beyond mundane understanding, yet accessible by His mercy.

And then in the 20th verse, it is said, evam yatantam vijane maam aha agochara giram gambhir shrakshanaya vaacha shuchap prashama yan iva Seeing my attempts in that lonely place, the personality of Godhead who is transcendental to all mundane description spoke to me with gravity and pleasing words just to mitigate my grief. Krishna is very kind. Even though he gave a brief darshan to Narada, still to mitigate Narada's grief because Narada was at grief, he was not able to see again. Just to mitigate his grief, the Lord spoke to him. Now, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, in the Vedas it is said, God is beyond the approach of mundane words and intelligence. avam manasa gochara Yet, by his causeless mercy, one can have suitable senses to hear him or to speak to him. By his mercy, at the present moment, we are using our material senses to perceive material objects, but the completely spiritual form of the Lord or the spiritual sound of his transcendental vibration can be heard or can be seen by the Lord's mercy. So, this is the Lord's inconceivable energy. We cannot understand with our mundane logic. The Lord was very pleased with Narada Muni and therefore, the necessary strength was invested in him so that Narada could hear the Lord. It is not, however, possible for others to perceive directly the touch of the Lord during the probationary stage of regulative devotional service. Those who are practicing in the probationary stage of regulative devotional service are said to be in the probationary stage of regulative devotional service.

**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that even Narada Muni, despite his advancement, was not fully purified, and discusses the devotee's feelings of separation and the value of hearing the Lord, ending with a thank you and Hare Krishna.

we are practicing. It is also called sadhana bhakti, the stage of practice. In the stage of practice, we are yet to reach the perfection. Mind you, Narada had reached perfection. But still, he had not yet become fully purified, 100% purified, yet, though he was very sincerely following and had come to a stage of pretty good advancement stage. So, when he heard the pleasing words of the Lord, the feelings of separation were to some extent mitigated. A devotee in love feels always the pangs of separation, and is therefore always enwrapped in transcendental ecstasy. Even hearing the Lord is in no way inferior to seeing the Lord or any other experience. Though, we always desire if there is a person, we want to see him face to face. We want to interact with him the way we interact with any person in this world. Especially, dealings of love between two persons means there is active reciprocation. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

### purity, material contamination, modes of nature
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/TqNMFlPuMuw?t=54
**Verse References:** BG 10.12-13
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So there is no trace of a tinge of materiality in this person."
**Summary:** The Lord is completely pure and free from material contamination, unlike us who are influenced by the illusory energy, leading to a material conception of self and the world.

In this session we will be discussing from the first canto, 6th chapter, 21st verse of the Srimad Bhagavatam. हन्तास्मिन् जन्मनी भवान् मामाम् द्रष्टुम् इहार्हती अविपक्व कशायाणाम् दुर्दर्शोहं कुयोगिनाम् The meaning of this verse is, O Narada, the Lord is speaking to Narada, I regret that during this lifetime you will not be able to see me anymore. Those who are incomplete in service, and who are not completely free from all material taints, can hardly see me. Now here the Lord is explaining to Narada that Narada is not yet freed from all material taints. That's why one cannot see in spite of all sincerity, sincere attempts and endeavours. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, the personality of Godhead is described in the Bhagavad Gita as the most pure. In the 10th chapter, Param Brahma Param Dhama Pavitram Paramam Bhavan. Pavitram means pure. Paramam Bhavan Paramam Pavitram, Supreme pure, complete pure, 100% pure. And he is described also as the supreme and the absolute truth, Param Brahma. So there is no trace of a tinge of materiality in this person. Unlike our personality, right now, in the material world, there is a contamination of materiality in this person. So that is the categorization of this personality. There is a contamination of the illusory influence of the material energy in our consciousness, and that's why we have a material conception of our self, of everything. Whereas the Lord, even when he comes to this material world, He is 100% pure, completely spiritual. There's no tinge of any materiality in this personality. But he is giving us this materiality, the same materiality that the Lord gave us. Even though he appears like a person who is created being of this world, he appears like that, son of Devaki, or he appears in his incarnation as Matsyavatara, he appears as a fish, but he is not touched by the material energy. It's not a material form, it's not a material creation. He comes in his original transcendental form only, though he appears as required, whichever form he desires to appear, to incarnate, to give darshan to his devotees, to mitigate the problems, the sufferings of his devotees, Paritranaya sadhuna. So, therefore, it is said here, thus, one who has the slightest tinge of material affection cannot approach him. So, this is conversely also explained that the Lord doesn't have any tinge of materiality and those in this material world who have any tinge of material affection cannot approach him. Not possible. The beginning of devotional service starts from the point when one is freed from at least two forms of material modes, namely the modes of passion and ignorance. The result is exhibited by the signs of being freed from karma and lobha. Karma means lust, lobha means greed or covetousness. That is to say, one must be freed from the desires for sense satisfaction and the avarice for sense gratification. Generally material conception of life is I am seeking satisfaction of my senses and I am also desirous or greedy for getting more of sense enjoyment. These two things, kama and lobha, are the symptoms of rajas and tamas.

### modes of nature, transcendence, spiritual platform

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "We have to rise above tamas guna, rajas guna and sattva guna, and come to the plane of transcendence."
**Summary:** To see the Lord, one must transcend the three modes of material nature (goodness, passion, and ignorance) and reach the spiritual platform.

To be completely freed from all material tinges is to become free from the mode of goodness also. As you know there are three gunas, three modes, rajas, tamas and sattva guna. Don't think sattva guna is something spiritual. No, it is also material. So we have to become completely free from all the three modes. So it is described here by Srila Prabhupada, to search out the audience of God in a lonely forest is considered to be in the mode of goodness. As is explained elsewhere, a liquor shop is in the mode of ignorance, tamas guna. And a city is in the mode of passion, as a place, talking of different places, influence in different places. And a forest is considered to be in the mode of goodness or sattvic place. One can go into the forest to attain spiritual perfection, but that does not mean that one can see the Lord personally there. Just because I go to the forest, and the forest is in the mode of goodness, simply by attempting to do some meditation or some spiritual practice there, we cannot see the Lord, simply like that. One must be completely freed from all material attachment, and be situated on the plane of transcendence. We have to rise above tamas guna, rajas guna and sattva guna, and come to the plane of transcendence, shuddha sattva, purified goodness, or transcendental platform. This alone will help the devotee to get in personal touch with the personality of God. Because the Lord is on the spiritual platform, unless we rise to the spiritual platform and become fixed up, we will not be able to see the Lord.

### deity worship, temple, bhakti yoga

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "The deity form is completely a spiritual form, though it appears like a material form."
**Summary:** Deity worship in the temple is a transcendental practice, superior to other forms of spiritual practice, especially in Kali Yuga, because the Lord manifests in the deity form out of His causeless mercy.

The best method is that one should live at a place where the transcendental form of the Lord is worshipped. Now here Srila Prabhupada explains the importance of the deity form of the Lord in the temple, or even at one's home. The deity form is completely a spiritual form, though it appears like a material form. After all, the deity is made out of stone, or wood, or metal. But that doesn't mean it is a metallic form, or a clay form, or a stone form. No, it is not. The deity is not a material form. Why? Because the deity is also called Archamurti, or Archavigraha. The Lord is invited after the form of the Lord is prepared, according to Shastra. And then, by the mercy of the bona fide spiritual master, or the Acharya, the Lord agrees to come and reside in that form, and accept the worship, the service, the devotional service, agrees to give darshan to even people who don't have spiritual vision. That is the causeless mercy of the Lord. That's the mercy of the transcendental form of the Lord in his form as the deity. The temple of the Lord is a transcendental place, whereas the forest is a materially good habitation. This difference exists, that a temple of the Lord where the deity form is worshipped regularly is completely a transcendental place. It's not different from Vaikuntha. Whereas the forest is a place which is in the mode of goodness, a sattvic place. So, forest still there is some material influence, but in the temple, it is completely a spiritual place. There is no material influence in the temple, just because of the presence of the archavigraha. Devotional service begins from the process of archana, which is better than going out in the forest, especially for us in Kali Yuga, where we are not equipped to do meditation, where we are not properly equipped or not prepared to properly undergo studies, properly engage in other forms of yoga other than bhakti yoga.

### bhakti yoga, pure devotee, archana, kirtana

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Simply accept the process of bhakti yoga and don't ever even attempt any other form of yoga. It's not going to be successful."
**Summary:** Bhakti yoga, especially archana (deity worship) and kirtana (glorification), is the recommended path for spiritual progress, and pure devotees like Narada Muni can transform any place into Vaikuntha by their presence.

Therefore, in this presentation, it is recommended, simply accept the process of bhakti yoga and don't ever even attempt any other form of yoga. It's not going to be successful. And Narada Muni, in his present life, he is describing his previous life to Vyasa Deva, if you remember this whole description. But in his present life, he is completely free from all material hankerings, because he is a pure devotee. He does not go into the forest, although he can turn any place into Vaikuntha simply by his presence. Simply by his presence, because a pure devotee carries the Lord in his heart. So wherever he goes, he turns that place into a completely transcendental place. So Narada Muni now, in his present life, he travels from one planet to another, throughout the universe he travels, simply to convert all categories of persons, men, gods, that is demigods, kinaras, gandharvas, rishis, munis, anyone who is willing, he wants to convert them into a devotee of the Supreme Lord. And there are examples by his activities, he has engaged many devotees, like Prahlad Maharaj, Dhruva Maharaj, so many others, in the transcendental service of the Lord. A pure devotee of the Lord, therefore follows in the footsteps of great devotees, like Narada Muni and Prahlad Maharaj, and engages his whole time in glorifying the Lord by the process of kirtana. So archana is the worship of the deity form, and it's always to be accompanied by kirtana, the glorification of the Lord, either by singing his holy, glorification of his holy name, or glorification of his activities or pastimes, like that. Such a preaching process is transcendental to all material qualities. So clearly, Srila Prabhupada is explaining, the advantage we have in the process of archana, kirtana, of course, Bhakti Yoga begins with Shravanam Kirtanam Vishnu, but of all the processes for a neophyte, especially in this age, archana is recommended. Either you directly worship, or if you are unable to worship, then you participate in the worship of the Lord in the temple. That's what you should do. In this way, you can actually very easily progress in Bhakti Yoga and come to the stage of perfection very quickly. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (SB 1.6.22) and explains the context of Lord's words to Narada Muni after he lost sight of the Lord in meditation.

canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Sakradya Darshitam Roopam Etat Kamayate Anagha Matkamas Shanakai Sadhu Sarvan Munchatih Richhayan. The meaning of this verse is, O virtuous one, you have only once seen my person and this is just to increase your desire for me because the more you hanker for me, the more you desire for me, the more you will be freed from all material desires. So the Lord is speaking to Narada Muni. After Narada Muni began meditation, he reached the stage of bhava, ecstasy. And in that stage of ecstasy, he was able to have a brief glimpse of the Lord in the heart. But then after that brief darshan, he lost sight of the Lord and then he tried again to get that darshan, but he could not. And when he was morose, that is when the Lord spoke to him. And the Lord is speaking and explaining something very important for Narada and for all of us

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the reason why the Lord gave only a brief darshan to Narada, emphasizing the importance of purification and increasing the desire to see and associate with the Lord.

to understand. So in the 21st verse is the beginning of the Lord's words, Lord's speaking to Narada from within the heart. O Narada, in the 21st verse, the previous session, we discussed this. I regret that during this lifetime, you will not be able to see me anymore. So just the brief darshan was given. So in this verse, the Lord is telling, you have only once seen my person and just to increase your desire for me, I have done it. Because till one is completely purified in the heart, one cannot actually see the Lord, the spiritual form of the Lord. It's not possible. And why did the Lord give darshan, that brief darshan? Even before Narada was fully purified, it is because to increase the hankering, the desire to see the Lord, to associate with the Lord in person.

**Key Quote:** "A living being cannot be vacant of desires."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada, explaining that spiritual life doesn't mean becoming desireless, but rather purifying or replacing material desires with spiritual desires, focusing on pleasing the Lord instead of the senses.

And that will automatically free Narada from all material desires. So Srila Prabhupada very nicely explains in the purport. He says, A living being cannot be vacant of desires. You would have heard many times, spiritual life means we have to become desireless. Now becoming desireless, we have to understand very carefully. We cannot be completely vacant of all desires. So what does it mean to become desireless in order to advance in spiritual life? It means to become free from all material desires. And that is possible not by just trying to negate all material desires, but rather replace material desires with spiritual desires. Or as Srila Prabhupada explains elsewhere, we have to purify our desires. We have to purify our desires. In our material condition, we are full of material desires. But the same desires can be turned into spiritual desires, when we desire for the Lord. Instead of desiring for ourselves, we desire to please the Lord instead of desiring to please our own senses.

**Key Quote:** "Thinking for the service of the Lord itself is spiritual."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain Prabhupada's teachings, highlighting that living beings must have desires and that entanglement arises from material thinking, feeling, and willing, while devotional service frees one from entanglement by focusing on the Lord's service.

So Srila Prabhupada explains a living being cannot be vacant of desires. He is not a dead stone. What or who is vacant of all desires? It is dead matter. No desire. So living person must have desires. That is symptom of life. So Srila Prabhupada says further, he must be working, thinking, feeling and willing. But when he thinks, feels and wills materially, he becomes entangled. That is our present condition. We are entangled because we are thinking, feeling and willing materially. Conversely, when he thinks, feels and wills for the service of the Lord, he becomes gradually freed from all entanglement. This is the wonderful thing about devotional service, that you start thinking, feeling, willing for the service of the Lord. This is the process of bhakti, process of devotion, devotional service. A positive process. Automatically material thinking, feeling, willing will be replaced or purified when you start thinking, feeling, willing for the service of the Lord. And gradually we are freed from all entanglement. Thinking for the service of the Lord itself is spiritual, and it also frees us from all entanglement. We are free from all entanglement. Thinking for the service of the Lord itself is spiritual. We are free from material entanglement.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the nature of devotional service, explaining that even a small beginning, like chanting Hare Krishna, can lead to an increased hankering for the Lord and that guidance from experienced devotees is essential.

We are free from material entanglement. The more a person is engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, the more he acquires a hankering for it. This is the nature of devotional service. This is so nice, that you start with a little service. Make a beginning by doing a little service. Just vibrate your tongue and say Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. You begin devotional service and you keep on doing more and more of this chanting and hearing of the holy name of the Supreme Lord, the more you will acquire a hankering for chanting. That is really true. We all begin by chanting once, few times, few minutes, 108 times. Gradually, if we get guidance by experienced devotees, representatives of the spiritual master, representatives of Krishna, then we are advised to start in a small way and increase in the

**Key Quote:** "This is spiritual sound this is transcendental it is full of spiritual nector."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts chanting Hare Krishna with repeating a material sound, like 'coca-cola', explaining that the transcendental nature of the holy name prevents boredom and increases the desire to chant.

in the beginning you may not have taste for it like the way pure devotees have taste, but then you increase it and you notice that it is not like a material sound vibration. If I tell you keep saying coca-cola, coca-cola, coca-cola, coca-cola, how many times can you say that? Few times. You cannot keep repeating that material sound again and again and again. It will become hackneyed, it will become boring. But devotees have been chanting Hare Krishna for so long, they chant every day the same mantra so many times, but they never find it is boring. They never experience any boredom. Why? Because this is spiritual sound. This is transcendental. It is full of spiritual nectar. Of course we don't experience the nectar immediately, but certainly we can experience the difference in terms of not feeling the boredom. That itself is a confirmation of the sound being transcendental. The very fact that we can repeatedly chant day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year, and increase, keep increasing the chanting itself is proof that this is spiritual sound and therefore it increases.

**Key Quote:** "Material service has satiation... Whereas spiritual service of the lord has neither satiation nor end."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of satiation in material activities using the analogy of eating chocolate, contrasting it with the eternal and non-satiating nature of spiritual service to the Lord.

That is the transcendental nature of godly service, devotional service, spiritual service, spiritual activities like that. It is the transcendental nature of such service. Material service has satiation. What is satiation? You have experience that is, eat a small piece of some edible, ordinary edible that you like to eat. Let's say it's a piece of chocolate a child likes. So you give the child a piece of chocolate. So you give the child a piece of chocolate. So you give the child a piece of chocolate. So you give the child a piece, it'll eat and say very nice. You give more, it'll eat that second piece, very nice. Third piece, fourth piece. How much can the child go on eating, eating, eating, eating and experience more and more pleasure and satisfaction? There's a limit. So that limit is reached, that's called satiation. You cannot eat anymore to derive more and more pleasure, or taste, or satisfaction out of eating the sweet. That is the nature of material service, or material activity, or material objects. Whereas spiritual service of the lord has neither satiation nor end. Even the material activity comes to an end with satiation. Even the material activity comes to an end with the body. The body is not permanent. The material body is not permanent. So life in this body is not going to continue forever, no.

**Key Quote:** "Spiritual service is on the spiritual platform therefore it is eternal."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the eternal nature of spiritual service, emphasizing that it continues beyond the material body and that devotional service, like chanting Hare Krishna, has no satiation.

It is going to end when we have to quit the body at the time of death, we do. Leave this body. So spiritual service is not of the nature of material. So spiritual service is not of the nature of material activity or material service because spiritual service continues life after life after life after life. It is on the spiritual platform, therefore it is eternal. It's in the platform of the soul. The soul is eternal, therefore spiritual service is eternal. Material service has satiation, whereas spiritual service of the Lord has neither satiation nor end. What is satiation? Satiation means something material, you cannot repeatedly do that activity to derive more and more pleasure or more and more satisfaction, just like eating a piece of sweet meat or a chocolate. You eat one piece, very nice. You eat a second piece, okay this is also pleasurable. But how much can you keep on eating and deriving more pleasure? There's a limit to that. Everything material is like this. Whereas spiritual service of the Lord has neither satiation nor end. Devotional service, just like we chant Hare Krishna, there is no satiation. We go on chanting more and more and more and more. It does not become boring, it does not become hackneyed. So therefore spiritual service is on the spiritual platform, it is eternal. One can go on increasing his hankerings for the loving transcendental service of the Lord and yet he will not find satiation

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by explaining that engaging in devotional service is equivalent to seeing the Lord, as the Lord and His service are identical, and encourages sincere devotees to continue their service for purification and perfection.

or end. This is the nature of a transcendental loving service of the Lord. There is no satiation. There is no end because it is not going to end with satiation. The body. By intense service of the Lord, one can experience the presence of the Lord transcendentally. Therefore, seeing the Lord means being engaged in his service because his service and his person are identical. So we are to understand this point very carefully, that anybody engaged in devotional service is actually seeing the Lord through the service because the Lord and his devotional service are identical. Of course it's difficult to understand in the beginning, but in the words of the acharyas, we have to understand this fact about devotional service. So the sincere devotee should go on with sincere service of the Lord. The Lord will give proper direction as to how and where it has to be done. So Narada had no material desire and simply to increase his intense desire for the Lord, the Lord gave him brief darshan and then said, now continue your devotional service the way you have been doing and then one day you'll reach perfection, you become completely purified, then you'll reach perfection. I'll stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.

### Absolute Truth, spiritual master, devotional service

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Serving the Absolute Truth means rendering service unto the Absolute Personality of Godhead under the direction of the bona fide spiritual master."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of 'service to the Absolute Truth' according to Prabhupada, emphasizing the importance of serving the Absolute Personality of Godhead (Krishna) under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master.

So this is yet another verse which is spoken by the Supreme Lord, who, unseen but through his transcendental voice, is communicating to Narada. He is telling here, the Lord is telling Narada, "By service of the Absolute Truth." So what does it mean, service of the Absolute Truth? That is explained by Prabhupada in the precepts of the Absolute Truth. Prabhupada, serving the Absolute Truth, means rendering service unto the Absolute Personality of Godhead under the direction of the bona fide spiritual master. So very clear, Prabhupada is explaining what does service of the Absolute Truth mean, Satsevaya. So serving Absolute Truth is three features, having three features: Brahman, Paramahansa, and the Supreme Lord are three features. Brahman, Paramahansa, and the Supreme Lord are three features. As devotees, we are particularly concerned about the Bhagawan feature, the Absolute Personality of Godhead. So therefore, Srila Prabhupada says, serving the Absolute Truth means rendering service to the Absolute Personality of Godhead. Now, how do you render service to the Absolute Personality of Godhead? Under the direction of the bona fide spiritual master, because we do not know, at least as neophyte devotees, we do not know who is God, or we have no way to approach God directly. So we are approaching God through the bona fide spiritual master. We are approaching God through the bona fide spiritual master. The bona fide spiritual master directs the disciple, directs the aspirant, spiritual aspirant, if the spiritual aspirant agrees to follow the spiritual master. So under the direction of the bona fide spiritual master, one has to render service to Krishna, the Absolute Personality of Godhead. Now, the bona fide spiritual master is described by Prabhupada as a transparent via medium between the Lord and the neophyte devotee.

**Key Quote:** "The experience Srila Prabhupada says is direct, when I offer a flower to the Lord I am offering through my spiritual master but it is as good as me does I am directly offering flower to Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the role of the spiritual master as a 'transparent via medium' between the devotee and Krishna, making the experience of devotional service direct and personal.

What's the meaning of this transparent via medium? I am there, Lord is there, in between is the spiritual master. So via medium, and what kind of via medium is the spiritual master between the neophyte devotee and the Lord? He is a transparent via medium. Transparent means it is as if I am directly approaching the Lord, but still we should not forget I am approaching through the spiritual master. So the experience, Srila Prabhupada says, is direct. When I offer a flower to the Lord, I am offering through my spiritual master, but it is as good as me, as I am directly offering flower to Krishna. So by service of the Absolute Truth, even for a few days, adhirgaya api, not for very long time. So this is the special feature of Bhakti Yoga, unlike the other yoga systems which take a very, very, very long time for reaching perfection, achieving the ultimate result or goal takes a very long time. Panthastu Koti Shatavatsara Sampragamyo, see Koti Shatavatsara, hundreds of crores of years, whereas Bhakti Yoga is this lifetime, this lifetime, immediately, as soon as possible. So adhirgaya api, even for a few days, a devotee attains firm and fixed intelligence in me. What is this attaining intelligence in Krishna?

**Summary:** The speaker explains how training from the spiritual master, even for a short period, can lead to firm and fixed intelligence in devotional service to Krishna.

That is explained by Srila Prabhupada, that the neophyte devotee has no ability to directly approach the Lord because he has got imperfect material senses which are useless for receiving the Lord. Therefore, the direction of the spiritual master is essential, and by such direction, one gets trained up in serving the Lord. Even if for some days one gets training from the spiritual master, then such a neophyte devotee gets intelligence in rendering service to the Lord. So when he gets intelligence, that is described as devotee attains firm and fixed intelligence in the Supreme Lord Krishna. That is described here as mati, means intelligence, firm and fixed intelligence is attained by such training by the spiritual master. Even for a few days, the training is potent, it is very, very powerful, it is effective, and very quickly this intelligence becomes fixed in devotional service.

**Key Quote:** "One goes on to become Krishna's associate in transcendental world in Krishna's personal abode not in this material world."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights the ultimate goal of devotional service: to become an associate of Krishna in the transcendental world, leaving behind the miseries of the material world.

Consequently, as a result of this, he goes on to become my associate in the transcendental world. See the game of rendering service to the Lord. We all belong to the Lord, we all belong to Krishna. We are all Krishna's. In the fourth chapter of Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says, "You are all mine, you belong to me, you come back to me, you live with me, you engage always in thinking of me." So this closeness of relationship, hmm, closeness of relationship is very, very important to understand. So one goes on to become Krishna's associate in transcendental world, in Krishna's personal abode, not in this material world, no, because it is described this happens after giving up the present deplorable material world, hmm, hitva avadyam imam lokam. This word avadyam, avadyam means deplorable. It is not the perfect place for a devotee, this material world, filled as it is with miseries, hmm. Krishna describes this material world, naapnuvanti mahatmanah. If we don't practice devotional service, then we keep taking repeated birth in this material world and suffer the consequences of birth in the material world, suffering different miseries, whereas by devotional service we have become eligible to go to Krishna's personal abode to become one of his associates.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna takes personal charge of his devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that even a little training in devotional service is potent and effective, leading to liberation from the cycle of birth and death in the material world, with Krishna personally ensuring the devotee's promotion to His abode.

Hmm, so Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport that even if the neophyte devotee gets trained by the spiritual master how to render service for a few days, it is very, very potent, effective, it is very quickly we are able to perfect our service. This leads ultimately to get free from perpetual inhabitation in the material world. Material existence is such that we have been here for millions and millions of births in ignorance, simply with a desire to enjoy materially, hoping every time to succeed in getting the happiness we are really looking for, which is never available in this world, which is never available in any material activity, but we somehow have some hope, we have false hope, durashaya ye bahirartham anina, in the Bhagavatam elsewhere it is explained, durashaya, it is a hopeless hope, there is no possibility, but still we are cheated by maya, we have some hope which is never to be fulfilled, durashaya. So here Prabhupada says, ultimately we get free from the perpetual inhabitation in the material world, we no longer will have to be in the material world, we have nothing to do with this material existence, and what happens? We are promoted to the transcendental world. Krishna will ensure that we are promoted. Krishna takes personal charge of his devotees. Yogi may transfer himself by the strength of his yogic power, but a devotee, he simply is dependent, and Krishna likes that. Krishna is very pleased when we declare our entire dependence upon him because we belong to him. He is our well-wisher, suhurdam sarva bhutanam, he is our everything. So such supreme lord, it is very good, very nice to depend on him completely, and he takes charge, he will transfer us, he will promote us to his personal abode.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by describing the benefits of being transferred to Krishna's personal abode, emphasizing liberation, purification, and the eternal benefits of even small acts of devotional service, assuring that spiritual advancement is never lost.

And what happens in Krishna's personal abode after we transfer, we are transferred there by Krishna? We become one of the liberated associates of the Lord in his kingdom, liberated associate. So that is very important. Such transfer means automatically there is liberation from material bondage, purification. Purification is 100% complete when we are transferred to the spiritual world by devotional service. We become purified, and only when we are fully purified we can go there, but that happens very fast. We don't have to wait for very long time. Of course, in the beginning we may sometimes feel I am not making any progress, but the fact is that every chanting of Hare Krishna, every small little service done in devotion to Krishna is actually accounted and it is to our permanent credit, it is eternally beneficial, it is never lost, even little bit is never lost. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains this, a little advancement on the path of Krishna consciousness is going to guarantee freedom from, from greatest dangers, from all great dangers. One doesn't have to actually suffer degradation at all, never suffer any degradation, only progressively keep advancing, advancing, and unlike material gain, spiritual advancement is never lost. Materially, whatever I gain now I have to leave behind, but spiritual advancement is never lost. So this is the assurance by the Lord to Narada. I will stop here.

**Key Quote:** "Intelligence engaged in my devotion cannot be thwarted at any time."
**Summary:** The speaker explains verse 24, emphasizing the eternal nature of devotional service and the Lord's mercy, highlighting that devotion is never lost.

First the 24th verse: Matir Mayi Nibaddheyam Na Vipadyeta Karihichit Praja Sarga Nirodhepi Smritischa Mad Anugrahat. The meaning of this verse is: Intelligence engaged in my devotion cannot be thwarted at any time. Even at the time of creation as well as at the time of annihilation, your remembrance will continue by my mercy. The Supreme Lord is speaking to Narada. He is unseen but he is heard. After Narada had a brief glimpse of the Lord in the heart, and he tried to get that darshan once again but he could not, and the Lord spoke to him to pacify Narada. So in this verse, the Lord is speaking to Narada. He is explaining something very important: Intelligence engaged in my devotion cannot be thwarted at any time. So everything in relationship with the Lord is eternal. Nothing is temporary. There is no question of any loss in devotional service.

**Summary:** Referencing Srila Prabhupada's purport, the speaker contrasts material and spiritual realities, emphasizing the permanence of devotional service compared to the transient nature of material achievements.

So Shri Lakshmi... Sri La Prabhupada explains in the purport: devotional service rendered to the personality of Godhead never goes in vain, since the personality of Godhead is eternal, intelligence supplied in his service or anything done in his relation is also permanent. We have experienced materially whatever we may do, it is not going to last forever, it is subject to annihilation by time. Everything material is like that. In fact, the whole creation itself is completely annihilated at the end of Brahma's life. So everything material is subject to destruction by time, everything spiritual is permanent, eternal, never subject to any loss or deterioration by time. This is very important principle we have to remember, we have to understand, and we have to apply. So how should we be spending our time? We should be very careful to spend our time exclusively in devotional activities and devotional service.

**Key Quote:** "Anything done in devotional service bears permanent result, bears permanent result it's never lost and one continues end devotional advancement in the next life from where he left off in his previous life."
**Summary:** The speaker addresses Arjuna's question about incomplete devotional service, explaining that even unfinished devotional efforts accumulate and continue in the next life, unlike material gains.

In the Bhagavad Gita it is said that such transcendental service rendered unto the personality of Godhead accumulates birth after birth. See, it's not lost. We may make some progress by doing devotional service in this life, even if we don't complete, there is no loss. Arjuna asked this question in the sixth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. Arjuna asked what happens if somebody takes to devotional service but does not complete? Isn't he a loser both spiritually and materially? Because for taking up devotional service one sacrifices material enjoyment, material engagements, so he loses materially as well as spiritually because spiritually he is not successful. So does it mean whatever devotional activity says performed is completely a wasted, a waste of time? No, Krishna says no, anything done in devotional service bears permanent result, bears permanent result, it's never lost and one continues end devotional advancement in the next life from where he left off in his previous life. This is very important. Supposing you have earned a lot of wealth, do you carry any credit for that wealth earned in this life? If you are unable to exhaust that wealth or spend it off, you have a huge bank balance, so when you quit the body what happens to that bank balance? It doesn't go with you.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the eternal nature of devotional credit, emphasizing its connection to the soul rather than the temporary body, and how it accumulates until maturity.

You don't get any credit in your next life, you have to begin again. So unlike material gain in this life which is never carried forward to the next life or to the future, spiritual advancement is always eternally carried forward, it is never lost. So therefore when the devotee is fully matured, the total service counted together makes him eligible to enter into the association of the personality of Godhead. So even if we make some progress that progress is permanently to the credit of the devotee. Devotional service is associated with the soul not with the body. So body is replaced, body is changed, but the soul is eternal, the person as spirit soul is eternal, his devotional credit is eternal, his devotional credit is eternal, his devotional credit is also eternal. Such accumulation of God's service is never vanquished but increases

The meaning of this verse is: Then that supreme authority personified by sound and unseen by eyes but most wonderful stopped speaking, feeling a sense of gratitude I offered my obeisances unto him bowing my head. So Narada has heard the Supreme Lord speak and and in his own words he is describing it was a most wonderful speech that he heard and he is describing here that it was a supreme authority, the Supreme Lord is a supreme authority personified by sound, he could clearly hear the Lord speaking but he could not see the Lord, unseen by eyes.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport that the personality of Godhead was not seen but only heard does not make any difference in spiritual life. We learn about the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord, the personality of Godhead. What is the meaning of absolute nature? The Lord, the person personality of the Lord, his name, his form, his qualities, his speech, his instructions, his abode, his paraphernalia, everything is identical with him 100%. That means the Lord is fully present in his name. If I say Krishna in these two syllables, the Lord is fully present as transcendental sound. We are able to hear that sound Hare Krishna or Krishna, the name Krishna, but in that sound he is fully present, unlike a material sound where we say this is a table, the sound table reference the the company of prереquited in the kristini end and also the school of Godhead and refers to another object called the table. The sound table and object table are two distinct different entities. We make the association by saying this is called a table. That is not the case with the Lord's name or the Lord's instructions or the Lord's form or the Lord's qualities or his activities descriptions of his features all are identical with him.

**Key Quote:** "He produced the Vedas the four Vedas the original Vedic knowledge by his breathing and He is seen and realized through the transcendental sound of the Vedas."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how the Vedas originated from the Lord's breathing and how they are non-different from Him, emphasizing the importance of hearing the Vedas from a qualified teacher.

So it is explained here by Srila Prabhupada further, the personality of Godhead produced the four Vedas by his breathing. This is what the Vedas say. How did he give the Vedas in the beginning of the book of the creation? He produced the Vedas, the four Vedas, the original Vedic knowledge by his breathing. And He is seen and realized through the transcendental sound of the Vedas. The Vedas are again non-different from him because Vedas are describing the absolute personality of Godhead. Therefore he is seen and realized through the transcendental sound of the Vedas. Formerly there was no need of any written books, simply the teacher would recite the Vedas, the student would hear the recitation by the master, by the teacher and simply by hearing the edict of the master, by the teacher, by hearing the student's studying of the Vedas etc. This incident be a study of阿 aquí remedy especially in School by the Master by the teacher by the Teacher simply by hearing the student to learn the recitation by the Master by the teacherer fully as the teacher did not hear the recitation from the various references짱 with full attention the student would realize the subject matter completely.

**Key Quote:** "Simply by hearing Bhagavatam you can realize Krishna because Bhagavatam is non different from Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the power of hearing Srimad Bhagavatam and Bhagavad Gita, explaining that they are literary and sound incarnations of Krishna, respectively, and that understanding them through a bona fide spiritual master leads to realization.

So this is the method. Even Srimad Bhagavatam recommends that you simply hear the Bhagavatam and you can realize Krishna because Bhagavatam is non different from Krishna. Bhagavatam is the incarnation, the literary incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna. So simply by hearing Bhagavatam you can realize Krishna and that's how Parikshit Maharaj realized, that's how Shukadeva Goswami realized, he simply heard the Bhagavatam from his father Vyasadeva. Vyasadeva heard from Narada the Bhagavatam and realized the subject matter, realized subject matter of Krishna. Vyasadeva heard from Narada, Narada heard from Brahma, Brahma heard from Krishna himself. So it is explained here the Bhagavad Gita is the sound representation of the Lord and there is no difference in identity. Bhagavad Gita is personally spoken by Krishna to Arjuna and through Arjuna to all of us, to everyone, everyone in the whole world. So when Krishna spoke whatever words came out of Krishna's lotus mouth that is identical with Krishna himself. So even today we can hear the Bhagavad Gita, we can recite the Bhagavad Gita, we can study the Bhagavad Gita, we can understand the message of the Gita when it is explained by a spiritual master bona fide spiritual master in parampara in this way.

a Bhagavad Gita is non different from Krishna. So the conclusion is that the Lord can be seen and heard by person chanting of the transcendental sound, the transcendental sound of the Bhagavad Gita when Krishna spoke the lotus mouth sound could be the sound of Bhagavatam, the sound of the Hare Krishna mantra, the sound of Krishna's instructions, anything. So transcendental sound we simply have to chant and in this way by hearing repeatedly, persistently with full attention, offenselessly we can fully realize Krishna. I'll stop here thank you.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that a devotee free from material attachments, fully absorbed in Krishna consciousness through chanting and hearing, will not be reborn in the material world.

So Narada Muni is going to conclude his description about his previous life. This is the last verse about his previous life. What happened? As he was engaged in traveling throughout the earth, chanting and glorifying the Lord without any material formalities, he, in course of time, when he had become fully absorbed in thinking of Krishna and in such a state of consciousness, he did not think of Krishna. So he was not fully absorbed in thinking of Krishna. He had become completely free from all material attachments, no attachment to anything in this material world. It is important to note this, that even if a devotee has a tinge of material attachment, he has to take birth again after quitting this body in the material world, whereas that devotee who is completely free from all attachments, and how is that possible? By becoming fully absorbed in thinking of Krishna, by constantly engaging in chanting and hearing and glorifying the name, fame, pastimes, activities, qualities of the

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the process of purification through chanting and hearing, leading to freedom from material contamination and a different kind of death, like lightning and illumination.

Supreme Lord, being completely freed from all material taints. Completely free from all material taints, as one goes on chanting and hearing, the heart becomes cleansed and no further contamination can enter because such a devotee is always engaged thinking of Krishna, always engaged in hearing about Krishna, always engaged in chanting the holy name, fame, qualities, past times of Krishna, etc. So no further contamination and all past contamination is completely cleansed away. Then, in course of time, he met with death. What is that death? Quitting the present body. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, the soul doesn't die, the real person, the spiritual identity is not lost at the time of death. It is only the material body that one quits. So met with death as lightning, in the lightening and illumination occurs simultaneously. Now what is the significance of Narada Muni telling he met with death as lightning and

**Summary:** The speaker explains Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing that a devotee absorbed in Krishna has no hankerings for petty material things, which are temporary and without permanent value.

illumination occurs simultaneously is explained by Prabhupada in the purport. So let us go through the purport. To be fully absorbed in the thought of Krishna means clearance of material dirts or hankerings. Such cleansing away of material dirt is not possible for somebody who is engaged in material activities. Material activity means actions and reactions under the influence of the three gunas. So material activity means, what is the material activity? It means one becomes further entangled more and more in the material existence. Whereas cleansing away the material dirt by being absorbed fully in thought of Krishna means no more material entanglement, no more material contamination. And Srila Prabhupada gives a nice example here: As a very rich man has no hankerings for small petty things, so also a devotee of Lord Krishna who is guaranteed to pass on to the kingdom of God where life is eternal, fully cognizant and blissful, Satchitananda, naturally has no hankerings for petty material things which are like dolls or shadows of the reality and are without permanent value. Srila Prabhupada is nicely summarizing. What is this material existence consisting of? Petty material things and these material things have no permanent value. Nothing material has permanent value. We discussed this in a

previous session. So this being reinforced, this understanding for our benefit, because we have got a background of having developed value for so many different material objects or material things. But now in spiritual life, we should understand none of those material things are of any permanent value. They are compared to material things, compared to shadows of reality. That means the real shadow means there is a real object of which the shadow is nothing but a reflection. So the real object is valuable. The shadow is not. Similarly, anything material is nothing but a shadow or a reflection of the spiritual reality. So if we have a material body, it is a reflection or a shadow of our spiritual form, spiritual body. That spiritual body is covered by material coverings. Similarly, the entire material world itself, not only our own form but even the material world itself, is nothing but a reflection or a shadow of the spiritual world. Krishna's personal abode, Parastasmatubhavonyo vyakto vyaktatsanatanah, that eternal abode of the Supreme Lord. It is called the kingdom of God where life is eternal, fully cognizant and blissful. There are no miseries. There is no ignorance. There is no temporary life. There is only eternal life. There is full cognizance, full knowledge. Full knowledge. There is no ignorance at all. And there is no misery. There is no suffering. There is no disease, old age. There is no death. Completely blissful. That place, the kingdom

of God is of permanent value, is eternal. So that is where we belong. That should be our destination. So Srila Prabhupada says that is the sign of spiritually enriched persons. Spiritually enriched persons. That's how they lose all attraction for everything material. That's how they lose value for anything material. And in due course of time when a pure devotee is completely prepared. What is the complete preparation? Full absorption in thought of Krishna. Complete preparation of the self. Completely purified of all material taints and completely freed from all material hankerings. No more material contamination. No more material attachments. Completely freed. Then all of a sudden the change of body occurs which is commonly called, the change of the body occurs which is commonly called death. For a devotee, death is a sudden change of body. What is this change of body? This change of body for a devotee is that it takes place exactly like lightning and illumination follow simultaneously. In this, when there are rains, you can see there is a flash of lightning. It is simultaneously occurring with the sound of the thunder. So like that a devotee simultaneously changes his material body and develops a spiritual body by the will of the Supreme.

### purification, devotional service, spiritualization, back to Godhead

**Key Quote:** "A pure devotee's body, material body, so called material body, is not material at all. It is spiritualized because he completely engages his body, his mind, his words, everything in Krishna's pure devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that a pure devotee's body becomes spiritualized through devotional service, like an iron rod in fire, and upon death, they attain a fully spiritual body and return to Godhead.

Both happen simultaneously. The material body, generally when we quit this material body, we enter another material body. For those who are not fully purified by devotional service, they will enter another material body. But those who are completely purified and are fully ready to go to the kingdom of God, to go back to Godhead, for them simultaneously the material body, the devotee quits the material body and simultaneously develops a fully spiritual body by the will of the Supreme. This happens by the will of the Lord. Actually, it is described here, even before death for a pure devotee, there is no material affection. Why? Because a pure devotee's body being completely engaged in pure devotional service becomes spiritualized. A pure devotee's body, material body, so called material body, is not material at all. It is spiritualized because he completely engages his body, his mind, his words, everything in Krishna's pure devotional service. Exactly like an iron rod when placed in fire becomes completely red hot and acts like fire. This is the best example. Easily we can understand. Iron rod placed in blazing fire becomes completely red hot, then it acts like fire. Similarly, a pure devotee's material body, which we see ordinarily with our eyes as a material body, actually is not anymore material because he is fully engaged in pure devotional service. It becomes completely spiritualized. And when he quits that body, then fully spiritual body, in that fully spiritual body, which he develops instantaneously, he goes back to Godhead. He does not take birth again in this world. So I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

body is it, it is described in this verse, befitting and associate of the Personality of Godhead. So everywhere in the scriptures it is said that we are the same quality as Krishna, as a Supreme Personality of Godhead. Krishna has a completely transcendental form, even we in our original position, we have a completely spiritual form. And Narad Muni, he is ready for going back to Godhead, so he is awarded a transcendental body, befitting and associate of the Supreme Personality of God. And then what happened to the other body? He says, "I quit the earlier body. I quit the body made of five material elements." Of course, everybody quits such a body, but then the advantage is for Narad Muni, does all acquired fruiting results of work or karma stopped? No more karma, no more reactions. So that is the wonderful achievement of a devotee who has perfected his devotional service.

**Key Quote:** "By devotional service the spiritual body develops exactly as we go on performing pure devotional service we go on purifying our material contamination that spiritual body develops"
**Summary:** This segment explains that our spiritual form is currently undeveloped and how devotional service, guided by the spiritual master and Krishna's mercy, helps it develop.

In the purport, Shrila Prabhupada says, "Informed by the Personality of Godhead that he would be awarded a transcendental body befitting the Lord's Association." Narada got his spiritual body as soon as he quit his material body immediately. Actually, our original form is not real itself butday's body as it is said also in the bible as soon as he quit this material body immediately actually our original form is a spiritual form. What is the meaning of being awarded? It means that our spiritual form is in a undeveloped state, that is our real identity, अहम ब्रह्मास्मी, I am spirit soul. Spirit soul means spiritual form, but it is undeveloped in our present condition because we are covered by a material body due to our desire to enjoy materially. So that spiritual form is undeveloped. By spiritual practice, by devotional service, the spiritual body develops exactly as we go on performing pure devotional service. We go on purifying our material contamination, that spiritual body develops. We are awakened to spiritual reality as we go on doing pure devotional service and proportion in proportion to our awakening, we are engaged more and more and more in pure devotional service. This is only by the mercy of the spiritual master and Krishna, guru krishna, by their mercy only it's possible.

**Summary:** This segment describes the freedom from material attraction and sense disturbances that comes with a transcendental body, contrasting it with the challenges of sense control in the material world.

and time of death for a devotee, there is no fear, there is no uncertainty, there is no anxiety, there are no reactions because the devotee is guaranteed to change his body from material body to spiritual form. Now proper further explains this transit body is free from material affinity, it has got no material attraction. Just like in this body you always feel some material attraction for material sense objects, the senses, body mean senses. So these material senses are always attracted to some material sense object, eyes are looking for beautiful form, but it is very Klarboar instrument as well. This Transient ward secure character is beautiful form, ears are searching for melodious music or some words of praise, honor, nose is looking for nice fragrance or nice aromas like that, but a transcendental body is free from material affinity, no material attraction, no material attraction at all. So all the senses of the transcendental form are not disturbed, are never attracted to anything material, total freedom from all material attractions. That is the biggest problem in this material world for those who want to control their senses that senses don't easily come under the

**Key Quote:** "A transcendental body is eternal means there is no material deterioration there is no material destruction and freedom from material modes"
**Summary:** This segment contrasts the temporary and changing nature of the material body with the eternal and unchanging nature of the transcendental body, also discussing the influence of the three gunas and how devotional service can lead to freedom from them.

to avoid sense gratification is very difficult because very naturally it seems like the senses are always attracted to the sense objects, but when we get a transcendental body it is no longer so. And it is further said here, this transcendental body is invested with three primary transcendental qualities. There are three primary transcendental quality, what are they? Eternity, that means this form is an eternal form, unlike this material form which is never eternal, it is therefore a fixed duration, that's all. And even during that limited duration of time this body undergoes changes, देहिनो ऽस्मिन् यथा देहे कौमारं यौवनं जरा, it goes through stages of change through changes through changes. it goes through stages of change. and youth and old age and old age is a fundamental misery that we have to suffer invalidity due to old age. So a transcendental body is eternal means there is no material deterioration, there is no material destruction and freedom from material modes. Not only is this body temporary what we have, but it is also influenced by the gunas, raja guna, sattva guna, tamo guna, the three influences will always be there. Sometimes sattva guna dominates, sometimes raja guna dominates, sometimes tamo guna dominates, accordingly our behavior also changes. So this is material existence, it's horrible, we don't have the freedom to act properly when we are under the influence of the three gunas, but my devotional service we can rise above the gunas gradually as we go on doing devotional service and devotional service leads to our freedom completely from the three gunas.

**Key Quote:** "A devotee's body becomes at once surcharged with transcendental qualities as soon as he is engaged in the devotional service of the lord this is a wonderful thing about devotional service pure devotional service as soon as we engage we become surcharged with transcendental qualities"
**Summary:** This segment discusses freedom from the three modes and reactions of fruitive activities in a transcendental body, emphasizing that engaging in devotional service immediately imbues the devotee's body with transcendental qualities.

material mode, we come to the spiritual platform, being freed from all the three modes, three modes means the influence of the three modes, and the third characteristic of the transcendental bodies, freedom from reactions of fruitive activities, always this body is a store of previous fruitive activities, their reactions. These reactions keep on unfolding as Kala acts on this body, by the action of time, the reactions are unfolding, sometimes good, sometimes not so good. So both happiness and distress, Dvandva, Sukha Dukha, this we have to experience, but a transcendental body, has no reactions at all, no reactions, such a wonderful state of existence. This is what Krishna is inviting us, come back to me means, come back to the spiritual life of eternity, bliss and knowledge. The material body is always afflicted with a lack of these three qualities, material body is not eternal, material body is not free from material influence of the gunas, material body is not free from reactions, always these three things are there. A devotee's body becomes at once surcharged with transcendental qualities as soon as he is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. This is a wonderful thing about devotional service, pure devotional service, as soon as we engage we become surcharged with transcendental qualities.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "The effect on this material body is that the material body will not be an obstacle for our krishna consciousness"
**Summary:** This segment uses the analogy of a touchstone and iron to illustrate how devotional service immediately influences the material body, removing obstacles to Krishna consciousness, and cites examples of devotees who saw the Lord face-to-face.

immediately, immediately you don't have to wait for some advancement in Krishna consciousness, you don't have to wait, immediately the body becomes surcharged with transcendental qualities. That's how we are able to do devotional service and Prabhupada gives an example here, it acts like the magnetic influence of a touchstone upon iron. When there is iron a magnetic stone or a magnet it will immediately influence that magnetic influence on iron will always be there in the presence of a touchstone or a magnetic stone. Similarly when we do devotional service the effect on this material body is that the material body will not be an obstacle for our Krishna consciousness. That's why devotional service is described ahaituki apratihata, this is the nature of pure devotional service. Therefore change of body means stoppage of the reaction of the three qualitative modes of material body nature upon the pure devotee, no more influence. And there are many instances of this in the revealed scripture, Druva Maharaj and Pralad Maharaj and many other devotees were able to see the Personality of God face to face apparently in the same body. This means how could they see with these eyes? We cannot see it spiritual form transcendental form, how were they able to see? This means that the quality of a devotee's body changes from material to spiritual as soon as he engages in devotional service changes. So only the devotees free from influence of the reactions influence of the three gunas because of the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord upon the devotee. I'll stop here, thank you very much, Hare Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Narada is not forced to take birth like us we are forced to take birth by laws of karma only because we have got residual reactions from the previous life or previous lives therefore we take birth and we are forced to take birth by the laws of karma"
**Summary:** The speaker explains Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing the transcendental nature of Narada's birth and comparing it to the birth of Krishna, highlighting that pure devotees are not subject to karmic laws in the same way as ordinary beings.

So this is a description of what happened to Narada after he quit his material body at the time of death in his previous life. And then he was awarded a transcendental body. But still, at the end of the millennium, Prabhupada explains in purport what is the meaning of end of the millennium. So Prabhupada says in the purport, Narada is known as the son of Brahma in this present life, and Lord Krishna is known as son of Vasudeva, the personality of Godhead. And his liberated devotees appear in the material world by the same process. That means a devotee taking birth in this material world, a pure devotee is taking birth in a material world is not like ordinary persons taking birth, just like the Supreme Lord's birth and activities are completely transcendental, Janma Karma Chame Divyam Evam Yo Vetthi Tatvatah. Same way, even pure devotees appearance and activities in this material world are completely transcendental. The process is the same as it is said in the Bhagavad Gita, Janma Karma Chame Divyam. That same thing Prabhupada is telling, the birth and activities of the Lord are all transcendental, completely spiritual. Therefore, according to authorized opinion, the birth of Narada as the son of Brahma is also a transcendental pastime. What does it mean? Narada is not forced to take birth like us. We are forced to take birth by laws of karma only because we have got residual reactions from the previous life or previous lives. Therefore, we take birth and we are forced to take birth by the laws of karma only because we have got these personal tendencies, but when a child is given food he is forced to take birth in a material body. Narada or the Supreme Lord, they also apparently take birth, but they appear in spiritual form. They don't accept a material body. So it is said the birth of Narada the son of Brahma in the present life is actually a transcendental pastime, just like the Lord appears for the sake of pastime. Narada absolutely doesn't need birth of a prábh 환 hanno and shouldn't, but it is said between Narada also appears for the sake of

The Lord and his devotees are therefore simultaneously one and different as spiritual entities. Spiritual entities, both are spiritual entities. But that doesn't mean that pure devotee is God. No. God is God, pure devotee is pure devotee. But they are in the same category. They are having similar qualities. They are completely spiritual beings. They belong to the same category of transcendence. They have nothing to do with any material energy, material body, material existence. Nothing. So even though they seem to take birth in this material world, they are completely aloof from everything material. How is that possible? Mam chayo avyabhicharena bhakti yogena sevate sagunan samatit ketan brahma bhuyaya kalpate. They are always on the transcendental platform, above the three gunas, Gunatita, Gunatita. So Lord is always gunatita, and his pure devotees who are engaged always in his pure devotional service are also gunatita. But they may appear like they are also conditioned in this material world. They may appear like that, but they are not. So this difference we always have to remember.

**Key Quote:** "All these are transcendental appearance of the Lord. Similarly, transcendental appearance of Narada as the son of Brahma."
**Summary:** The speaker provides examples of transcendental appearances of the Lord (Rama, Vamana, Krishna) and reiterates that Narada's appearance is also transcendental, before introducing verse 30.

In the case of the birth of the pure devotee in this material world or the birth of the Lord as the son of Vasudeva and Devaki or the birth of Rama as son of Dasharatha and Kausalya, son of Vamana, sorry Vamana as the son of Kashyapa and Aditi. All these are transcendental appearance of the Lord. Similarly, transcendental appearance of Narada as the son of Brahma. Pure devotee. 30th verse: Sahasra yuga pariyante utha yedam sisrikshata ha mariichi misra rishayaha pranebhyoham ca jagnire. The meaning is: after 4 billion 300 million solar years when Brahma awoke to create again by the will of the Lord all the rishis like Marichi, Angira, Atri and so on were created from the transcendental body of the Lord

**Key Quote:** "When Brahma's days over, at the beginning of Brahma's night, there is a partial devastation of the universe."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the process of partial devastation at the end of Brahma's day, the entering of living entities into Garbhodakshayi Vishnu, and the subsequent re-creation by Brahma, including the appearance of Narada and other rishis.

and I also appeared along with them. When Brahma's day is over, at the beginning of Brahma's night, there is a partial devastation of the universe. The middle and the lower planetary systems are completely flooded and all the living entities enter the body of Garbhodaka Shaiv, Vishnu. The Vishnu who is lying on the Garbha ocean. This universe is like a shell half filled with water. That water is called garbha ocean. So everyone enters Garbhodaka Shaiv Vishnu, transcendental body and they remain there for the night of Brahma. How long does this night of Brahma last? The same duration as the day of Brahma. Day of Brahma the calculation is given in the Bhagavad-Gita sahasra yuga pariyanta mahar yad brahmano viduhu. Brahma's day, 1000 cycle of the four yugas on this earth, that's a duration of Brahma's day that works out to four billion three hundred million solar years account our calculation on the earth. So same duration is the night. So for the night Brahma and the residents of Brahmaloka and even Narada they entered the body of Garbhodakshayi Vishnu when the devastation happened in the previous day of Brahma and the night they remain there as if asleep, as if asleep. But when Brahma wakes up to create again by the will of the Lord, when the night is over the next day begins, then all the rishis like Marichi Angira Atri they are created by the transcendent from the transcendental body of the Lord, that means they also awaken and Narada also awakens, he also appears along with them

**Summary:** The speaker continues explaining Brahma's day and night, emphasizing the concept of 'yoga nidra' and differentiating it from ordinary sleep, highlighting Brahma's continued spiritual awareness.

as if he has taken birth the son of Brahma he appears along with them. So Prabhupada explains in the Evanpa, the duration of a day in the life of Brahma is 4 billion 320 million solar years. This is also stated in the Bhagavad Gita sahasra yuga pariyuntham at one. So for this period Brahma highercher rests in yoga Nidra within the body of Garbhodakshayi Vishnu the generator of Brahma. Sometime earlier it was described in the Bhagavad Gita itself in the third chapter of the first Kanto that Brahma appears, the Lotus which is generated on the navel of Vishnu Garbhodakshayi Vishnu, that's why the Garbhodakshayi Vishnu is also called Padmanabha. One Padma, one Lotus appears from his navel on that Lotus Brahma is born from Garbhodakshayi Vishnu. So Brahma when the end of his day happens he rests in yoga nidra. Yoga nidra is not like our sleeping. Our sleeping is total ignorance, we go into ignorance, but Brahma's resting is just not in ignorance but it is in spiritual awareness, that's called yoga nidra, spiritual awareness is there. After the sleeping period of Brahma when there is again creation of Brahma then there is again creation of Brahma then there is again creation by the will of the Lord

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Lord engages Brahma and other personalities in creation, maintenance, and destruction due to their desires, and reiterates the concept of yoga nidra.

by the will of the Lord through the agency of Brahma all the great Rishis through the agency of Brahma all the great Rishis again appeared from different parts of the and again appeared from different parts of the transcendental body and not also transcendental body and not also appears. This is the pastime of the Lord creation appears.

This means that Narada appears in the same transcendental body as a man awakes from sleep in the same body. Just like we have experienced night we go to sleep next day morning we get up we get up in the same body but in our case something else happens at night when we go to sleep we forget this body whereas Brahma goes into yoga nidra he does not forget his original

**Key Quote:** "Narada appears in the same transcendental body because Narada was awarded a transcendental body when he became perfect in devotional service he was awarded and he quit that previous body made of the five elements pancha bhautikam then he was awarded a transcendental body"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Brahma's yoga nidra with ordinary sleep, emphasizing that Brahma retains his form, and explains that Narada appears in the same transcendental body he was awarded after perfecting devotional service.

body, form as Brahma he doesn't forget that form so he is going to sleep is not same as our going to sleep therefore yoga nidra the word the prefix yoga is used for nidra whereas in our case even though we forget this body when we awaken in the morning we again awake we are awakened in the same body that we slept in the previous night. Same way Brahma also appears in the same body as he slept in the previous night. Narada appears in the same transcendental body because Narada was awarded a transcendental body when he became perfect in devotional service he was awarded and he quit that previous body made of the five elements pancha bhautikam then he was awarded a transcendental body in that transcendental body again he awakens next day of Brahma and Narada is eternally free to move in all parts of the transcendental and material creations of the Almighty. That is a nature of transcendental form spiritual form eternal form he is free to move anywhere just by his will like he is in let's say heavenly heaven planet swargaloka he decides I want to go to the earth planet he just wills and he's in the earth planet he travels like that. So this transcendental body is difficult for us to conceive difficult to understand we had to hear about that from the authentic source. So Narada Muni appears and disappears in his own transcendental body which is without distinction of body and soul unlike

### Narada Muni, Transcendental Body, Devotional Service

**Verse References:** SB 1.6.31
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Since then, by the grace of the Almighty Vishnu, I travel everywhere without restriction, both in the transcendental world and in the three divisions of the material world."
**Summary:** This segment introduces Narada Muni's ability to travel freely due to his unbroken devotional service and transcendental body, as described in Srimad Bhagavatam.

In this session we will be discussing from the 31st verse of the 6th chapter of the 1st canto of Sriman Bhagavatam: अन्तर बहिष्च लोकाम स्त्रीन परियेमी असकंधित व्रतः अनुग्रहान महा विष्णोर अविघात गति क्वचित. The meaning of this verse is: Since then, by the grace of the Almighty Vishnu, I travel everywhere without restriction, both in the transcendental world and in the three divisions of the material world. This is because I am fixed in unbroken devotional service of the Lord. So this verse pertains to Narad Muni's describing to Vyasa Deva about his present life. As was explained in the previous verse, after the night of Brahma, next day when the creation began, Narad Muni appeared as a son of Brahma, but he appeared in the same transcendental body. He changed from his material body to a transcendental body when he quit his body in his previous life. After that, once he is in a transcendental body, there is no more change of body. So, just along with Brahma, he entered into Garbhodakshayi Vishnu's transcendental form. And during the night of Brahma, he remained there and he came out appearing as the son of Brahma. But this appearance is complete, just like Krishna appears as the son of Vasudeva and Devaki, like that. So, after that appearance, he is describing here, since then, by the grace of the Almighty Vishnu, Narad Muni is the pure devotee of the Supreme Lord. So, by the grace of the Supreme Lord, Almighty Vishnu, I travel, that means Narad Muni travels everywhere without restriction. Which all places does he travel? Both in the transcendental world and in the three divisions of the material world. So, that would be explained by Prabhupada in the purport. He travels everywhere, both in the spiritual world and all the divisions of the material world. Why? How is this possible? This is because I am fixed in unbroken devotional service to the Lord. How is it possible? Because Narad Muni is fixed up completely in unbroken devotional service of the Lord. That is described in the Sanskrit as Unbroken vow. Unbroken vow of devotional service.

**Key Quote:** "And contains unlimited self-illuminated Vaikuntha planets."
**Summary:** This segment explains the three divisions of the material world, the spiritual sky with Vaikuntha planets, and the difference between living entities in the material and spiritual worlds, drawing from Bhagavad Gita.

In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, as stated in the Bhagavad Gita, there are three divisions of the material spheres. This entire material universe, there are three divisions: Urdhva Loka, the upper planetary systems; Madhya Loka, the middle planetary systems. We are in the middle planetary system on the earth planet. And downward, below the earth, that is Adho Loka. Now, beyond the Urdhva Loka, beyond the upper planetary systems of which the Brahma Loka is the topmost in this universe, there are the material coverings of the universe. This whole universe is like a shell, Brahma Anda. It's called Brahma Anda, egg-shaped, Anda, therefore. And outside this shell, there are seven layers of coverings. And above this universe with its coverings, outside that, is the spiritual sky. And the spiritual sky is described as unlimited in expansion. Material sky is limited within the universal shell, whereas the spiritual sky is spread throughout, unlimited expansion, and contains unlimited self-illuminated Vaikuntha planets. Now, Vaikuntha planets are spiritual planets, unlike the material planets within the material universe. And these Vaikuntha planets are inhabited by God himself, along with his associates, who are all eternally liberated living entities. There are living entities in this material world. There are living entities in the spiritual world.

**Key Quote:** "Such a travelling devotee is called Parivrajaka Acharya."
**Summary:** This segment contrasts conditioned souls in the material world with liberated souls in the spiritual world, highlighting Narada Muni's role as a Parivrajaka Acharya who travels to preach Krishna consciousness.

What's the difference? Living entities in the material world are conditioned souls, are bound up by their own reactions of their material actions, whereas in the spiritual world, everyone is a devotee, everyone is engaged in devotional service, and everyone is liberated eternally. Sri Narada Muni could enter all these planets in both the material and spiritual spheres without restriction. This is the position of a pure devotee who is engaged in unbroken devotional service of the Supreme Lord. He is free to travel everywhere. Why does he travel? Because he is engaged always in preaching Krishna consciousness, Krishna Bhakti. That is the reason he travels. Such a travelling devotee is called Parivrajaka Acharya. Acharya means the authority in devotional service, in spiritual line. And Parivrajaka means one who constantly travels, Parivrajaka Acharya. So, Narada Muni is free to personally travel in all the material planets as well as in the spiritual planets also, without any restriction. Srila Prabhupada says here, as much as the Almighty Lord is free to move personally in any part of His creation.

**Summary:** This segment contrasts pure devotional service with fruitive work and philosophical speculation, stating that devotees never fall from the spiritual platform, unlike materialists and impersonalists.

to those who engage in pure devotional service of the Supreme Lord, भक्त्यामाम अभिजानाती, therefore it is said here, devotees never fall down from this spiritual platform, whereas the fruitive workers and speculative philosophers, both the materialists and the spiritualists who are only aware of the impersonal feature, they fall down, they can't remain, even if they elevate themselves, they cannot remain on the spiritual platform. Now, it is described here, at the time of creation, Narad Muni appeared along with so many other rishis like Marichi and Sanaka, Sanatana, but the important point is, the rishis like Marichi and Sanaka, Sanatana, they are not able to travel freely like Narad Muni in the spiritual world. Why is that? It is explained here, rishis like Marichi are authorities in fruitive work, and rishis like Sanaka and Sanatana are authorities in philosophical speculation.

**Key Quote:** "whereas spiritual activity transcendental activity devotional service is without material inebriety without material inebriety without any material defect without any material contamination just like when we chant Hare Krishna that sound of the holy name"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the transcendental nature of Narada Muni's Veena and contrasts spiritual activity with material contamination, using the chanting of Hare Krishna as an example of pure sound.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 32nd verse of the 6th chapter of the first canto of Shreemad Bhagavatam: देवदत्ताम इमाम वीनाम स्वरब्रम्म विभूशिताम मूर्चयित्वा हरिकताम गायमानश चराम्यहम. कृष्ण, सब्सक्राइब गुंग super सब्सक्राइब गुंग गुंग सब्सक्राइब गुंग इन द्विदिशन व वर्ड इनटरे अग्रियल इस्तोंस पूरा वूंड फार्ड दोस्व who are forgetful Krishna, those who want to enjoy independent of Krishna, those who want to imitate Krishna, those who are envious of Krishna. In several ways, it's described in different places, it's for the materialists. So it is described the Veena which was handed over by Krishna to Narada and always carried by Narada, that is a transcendental instrument. Why is it a transcendental instrument? Because it is identical with Lord Sri Krishna. And Narada being in the same spiritual category, some vibrated by this instrument which Narado Muni carries. This Veena cannot be material because the Veena is itself transcendent and therefore the glories and His past विज़ाईंस विचर ब्रॉड़कास वाडि इंस्ट्रोमेंट नारदा आर आउसो ट्रसेंड नेंटल विदाउट एक टींज वो मेटीरियल इन्ने ब्रीडी कि वो टींज उपटिड इन इफरीडी मेटीरियल इन्एब्रिटी ही समितिडियल्ड इफिक. In this material world, whatever work we do ordinarily has got this material inebriety or material contamination or material defect, if I may use that word, it is a defect. So that material defect is, it is the cause of bondage, it is a cause of bondage, it results in reactions, whereas spiritual activity, transcendental activity, devotional service is without material inebriety, without any material defect, without any material contamination, just like when we chant.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how self-realized individuals can remain on the spiritual platform by constantly singing the glories of the Lord, referencing the Bhagavad-gita and describing the characteristics of a Mahatma or pure devotee.

Also properly use the sound meters, namely saray gama etc., in the service of the Lord by constantly singing the glories of the Lord as confirmed in the Bhagavad-Gita. So anybody who is self-realized, if they want to remain on the spiritual platform, on the platform of spirit, spiritual platform, then Bhagavad-Gita says it is possible to remain on the spiritual platform by constantly singing the glories of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-Gita, Krishna explains in the ninth chapter how do devotees worship Krishna? They worship Krishna, they are always constantly singing the glories of the Lord, always without any break, without any interruption, 24 hours a day, and in that way they are engaged in such glorification of the Supreme Lord with determination, very firm determination, it's not shakeable. They always bow down with all humility, with devotion they bow down to the Lord. They always bow down to the Lord, and in this way they are always engaged in worshipping the Lord. This is a description of someone who is called a Mahatma. Mahatma means a pure devotee according to the Bhagavad-Gita. That also, that is also described by a verse in the Gita: mahathmanastumam partha daivin prakritimahatmanastumam partha daivin prakritimahatmanastumahatmahatma.

### Absolute Truth, Relative Truth, Material vs. Spiritual

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Absolute Truth is Truth which is... Truth in all phases of time. Past, Present and Future."
**Summary:** The speaker defines Absolute Truth as unchanging and contrasts it with Relative Truth, which is subject to change in the material world, using the example of a person residing in a house.

The very opening verse, it is said by Vyasadeva, the author of the Bhagavatam, that I meditate upon Shri Krishna because he is the Absolute Truth. सत्यं परं धीमही. सत्यं परं सत्यं परं सत्यं is truth. परं there indicates Absolute Truth. So what is this Absolute Truth? Absolute Truth is Truth which is... Truth in all phases of time: past, present, and future. The Truth is always the Truth. It doesn't change. Relative Truth is Truth which is not true in all phases of time. Every Truth in the material world of some material object or material activity is a Relative Truth. If... To give an example, if I say such and such a gentleman is residing in a particular apartment or house. Now this statement is a Relative Truth because what happens with time, in course of time, that gentleman who's staying in a particular house, when he passes away, when he changes body, when he dies, then that statement, 'such and such a gentleman residing in the house,' is no longer true. Then we are to say he was residing, and when he died, he is no longer residing in the house, or even when he shifts from that residence due to whatever reason to another residence, then that statement, 'such a gentleman is residing in this house,' is no longer true. So like this, every statement we make about a material phenomenon in this world is a relative truth. It is relative to time, whereas the absolute personality of Godhead Krishna is absolute truth. He is always the Lord. He doesn't change his body. He doesn't change his position. His form, his name, his qualities, his forms don't change. You look at our own form, material body, it changes. They... He knows when you thought they... Hey, come on, your venom, Jara, anything material, it is constantly undergoing change. That's the...

**Key Quote:** "Spiritual existence is full of Rasa... spirit is dynamic unlike matter matter is static."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that spiritual existence is unchanging yet full of Rasa (flavor) and is dynamic, unlike static matter, emphasizing Krishna as the ultimate source of everything.

Spiritual existence is not changing, unchanging reality. So unchanging reality should not be mistaken to be something which is uninteresting in the material world because inherently in anything material, there is no Rasa. Therefore, everything material is actually without any substance. It is without substance, is without life, really speaking, without any Vasu, whereas spiritual existence is full of Rasa. Minute coworkers are... How is it interesting if it is unchanging? It is interesting because spiritual existence is full of rasa, even though unchanging. How is it interesting? It is... Spirit is dynamic, unlike matter. Matter is static, spirit is dynamic. So spirit is always alive, full of life. Spirit is actually full of life, and that life never expires, just like we say, we understand from the Bhagavad Gita that this real person inside this body, the spirit soul, does not die, is always living but changes body. The body is something which is material, is subject to deterioration, and one day we have to quit this body when it becomes old and useless. So spirit is dynamic, spirit is full of life, spirit is actually full of Rasa. That is because the Supreme Lord, personality of Godhead Krishna, the absolute personality of Godhead, he is the ultimate reality, ultimate person, the ultimate source from him everything is emanating.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the process of devotional service, particularly hearing, chanting, and remembering the Lord's names, fame, and activities.

All of them are actually absolute. All of them are absolute. They are non-different from each other. So as soon as a pure devotee engages himself in the pure devotional service of hearing, chanting, and remembering the name, fame, and activities of the Lord, a pure devotee is engaged always in devotional service. What does devotional service consist of? Nine different kinds of activities: shravanam kirtanam smaranam paada sevanam archanam vandanam dasyam sakhyam atmanivedanam, of which three are particularly mentioned here, the first three: hearing, chanting, and remembering, shravanam kirtanam smaranam. About what? Hearing about what, or chanting, or remembering what? The name, fame, and activities of the Lord. That is the recommendation in the Bhagavata: shravanaam kirtanam Vishno smaranam paada sevanam, about Vishnu, about the Supreme Lord. We have to hear about his names, his qualities, his pastimes, his forms, his paraphernalia, his Abode, his devotees, his relationships, his creation, his maintenance, destruction, everything about him when we hear that, or we chant about it, or we remember them...

At once, the Supreme Lord becomes visible to the transcendental eyes of the pure devotee. This ordinary eyes, we cannot see anything spiritual. How do the pure devotees see? They with transcendental eyes. And how do they see with transcendental eyes? That is described here by reflecting himself on the mirror of the heart of the spiritual... Prabhupada uses a term called spiritual television. Just like you have got experience of a material television, you have a television at home. Now the program that is broadcast by a station, you tune in or you connect to that station through your whatever the set of box or whatever, then the program being broadcast appears on your television screen, and you are able to see that program. That program is going on somewhere, either it is recorded and the recording is broadcast, or live it is going on. Let's say a cricket match is going on in Australia, and you are sitting in India, you can watch that cricket match live through this arrangement of television, is it not? Same way, there is something called a spiritual television. What is the spiritual television? That when a devotee sings the Lord's name or hears about the Lord's glories or remembers the Lord's glorification which he has heard before or recited before, immediately the Lord appears in his heart like a spiritual television is switched on. He reflects himself on the mirror of the heart by spiritual television, and this is possible for anybody who is engaged in pure devotional service. Seeing the Lord within the heart reflected by the spiritual television is possible for anyone who engages in pure devotional service of hearing or chanting or remembering. Therefore, a pure devotee who is related with the Lord in loving transcendental service can experience the presence of the Lord at every moment. What is the nature of pure devotees? They're always engaged in devotional service of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, they are always experiencing the presence of the Lord every moment because as soon as they sing or hear or do devotional service, the Lord is appearing on their heart.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights Narada Muni's chanting for the benefit of others and emphasizes the power of hearing the Lord's glories from pure devotees, even for those not spiritually advanced.

Another thing Sri La Prabhupada explains is that Sri Narada chants the glorification of the Lord not only for his personal benefit, but he is doing it for the benefit of everyone, especially in this material world, and even when they are not spiritual. From the spiritual point of view of the Lord, they are doing it with the intention of receiving the glory of the Lord. There are also other ways of receiving the glory of the Lord, just by hearing the glory of the Lord, simply by hearing the glories of the Lord from pure devotees.

**Summary:** Narad Muni instructs Vyasa Deva that chanting the transcendental activities of Lord Krishna helps overcome anxieties of material existence.

In this session we will be discussing from the 34th verse of the 6th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: एतद्ही आतुरचित्तानाम् मात्रास्परशेच्छयामुहु भवसिंदुप्लवो दुरुष्टो हरिचरियानु वर्णनम। The meaning of this verse is, it is personally experienced by me that those who are always full of cares and anxieties due to desiring contact of the senses with their objects can cross the ocean of nescience on a most suitable boat, the constant chanting of the transcendental activities of the personality of Godhead. These are words spoken by Narad Muni. He is instructing Vyasa Deva that by his personal experience he has found out that anybody who is full of anxieties due to this material existence, they can very easily cross over this ocean of nescience, ocean of ignorance, ocean of material existence by taking help of the constant chanting of the transcendental activities of Lord Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "The symptom of a living being is that he cannot remain silent even for some time."
**Summary:** A living being is always active, thinking, or talking, animated by the eternally living spirit soul.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, how does it work? The symptom of a living being is that he cannot remain silent even for some time. He can't find food. He can't even consume food. There is this past sente constantly silent. There is this present sensation of absence. For just some night. Nothing will happen. Continuously nothing will happen. He is unable to be became empty. Otherwise the body is by itself dead matter, what appears like a living body is not a living body, it is a dead body animated by the living spirit soul, eternally living spirit soul. So Srila Prabhupada says a living being cannot remain silent at any time, so he must be doing something or he must be thinking of something or talking about something.

**Key Quote:** "they become full with cares and anxieties"
**Summary:** Materialistic men discuss subjects that satisfy their senses, but such activities under the influence of illusory energy do not give satisfaction and lead to anxiety.

So some activity is always there if somebody is living. Generally the materialistic men think and discuss about subjects which satisfy their senses. So normally people are in ignorance about who they are and therefore they generally talk or discuss about subjects like what is meant for satisfying their senses because such things are exercised under the influence of the external illusory energy. Such sensual activities do not actually give them any satisfaction, however it may be promising or pleasing for the senses. None of these activities which are under the influence of the illusory energy can actually give us satisfaction, none of them can give us satisfaction. On the contrary, they become full with cares and anxieties. Then somebody tries to squeeze out some pleasure or happiness or some satisfaction out of material or sensual activities, then they are not able to get the satisfaction, at the same time they become filled with anxiety. This is called maya.

**Key Quote:** "satisfaction for such frustrated beings engaged in sense gratification is to chant always the activities of Lord"
**Summary:** People under the influence of illusory energy seek pleasure in things that cannot provide it, leading to frustration, which can be overcome by chanting the activities of the Lord.

Or what is not, maya means not this, that which cannot give them satisfaction is accepted as an object for satisfaction. People under the influence of the illusory energy, they are always accepting something which is not pleasurable as pleasurable. So Narad Muni, so Narad Muni by his personal experience he says that satisfaction for such frustrated beings engaged in sense gratification is to chant always the activities of Lord. What is sense gratification? The senses are seeking some objects. What is sense gratification? No. For the eyes beautiful form, for the ears some melodious sound, for the nose some fragrant smell, for the tongue something very tasty to eat, for the sense of touch something which is very soft, something which is very smooth, something which is very warm, etc. Like that all the senses are ever seeking pleasure through this sense contact, but the result of the sense contact is not really pleasure. If at all there is some pleasure, some momentary pleasure may be there by such contact, but after that they are full of anxiety. Every action results in a reaction.

So they indulge in satisfying the senses, then they become very much filled with anxiety because the senses cannot actually give any satisfaction. On the other hand, they become entangled and therefore they are always frustrated. Entanglement means there is only complicated miseries. Now what happens if somebody starts chanting the activities of the Lord?

### yoga, devotional service, sense control, soul satisfaction
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/VYxhbcV1ixE?t=59
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "yoga system is helpful to actually control the senses but it is not effective in giving satisfaction to the soul"
**Summary:** Narada Muni explains that while yoga can control the senses, it doesn't provide soul satisfaction, which comes from devotional service.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 35th verse of the 6th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. We are continuing the conversation between Narada and Vyasa Deva. Towards the end of the chapter, a few more verses, the chapter will conclude. So the 35th verse is, the meaning of this verse is, it is true that by practicing restraint of the senses by the yoga system, one can get relief from the disturbances of desire and lust, but this is not sufficient to give satisfaction to the soul, for this satisfaction is derived from devotional service to the Personality of Godhead. So Srila Narada Muni is clearly explaining that the yoga system is helpful to actually control the senses, but it is not effective in giving satisfaction to the soul. Ultimately, we are always seeking satisfaction of the soul, though we do not know it, especially those in ignorance of the spiritual nature of the self. They are unaware that the satisfaction of the senses, mind, or intelligence is not satisfaction of the soul. I, the real person, am different from the body or the senses. I am different from the mind. I am different from my intelligence. I am spirit, so this spirit requires spiritual satisfaction, soul satisfaction. So that is explained very nicely by Srila Prabhupada in the purport: yoga aims at controlling the senses. This is one of the main purposes of practicing yoga, to control the senses. Generally, our senses are totally uncontrolled in the sense, with the idea that whatever the senses demand, we are simply busy satisfying those demands, but that is not the way of spiritual life. So in yoga practice, there is by practice of the mystic process of bodily exercise in sitting, thinking, feeling, willing, concentrating, facing, and setting away, meditating and, as beam bus into trance and in this one can control the senses. So this, they call it eight-fold yoga system, Ashtanga Yoga: yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, na para nayam, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, samadhi. Samadhi is completely being merged into transcendence. But the scriptures also describe this method of controlling the senses through yoga practice, Ashtanga Yoga practice. About that, the scriptures are telling, the senses are considered like venomous serpents, and the yoga system is just to control them. Narad Muni is recommending another method for controlling the senses. What is that? The method of transcendental loving service of Mukunda, the Personality of Godhead, the system of Bhakti, the process of Bhakti. It is different than the Ashtanga Yoga process.

### Ashtanga Yoga, devotional service, sense engagement, Krishna Consciousness

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Ashtanga Yoga is denying the sense satisfaction, denying mind satisfaction, denying intellectual satisfaction all this by forcibly restraining the senses"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Ashtanga Yoga's artificial method of denying sense gratification with devotional service's positive engagement of the senses in spiritual activities.

By his experience, Narad Muni says that devotional service to the Lord is more effective and practical than the system of artificially controlling the senses. The method of Ashtanga Yoga is an artificial method. That means you have to force yourself against your natural way of living, whereby you engage your senses in sense satisfaction in some activity aimed at either satisfying the senses or the mind or the intelligence. So Ashtanga Yoga is denying the sense satisfaction, denying mind satisfaction, denying intellectual satisfaction, all this by forcibly restraining the senses, holding back the senses from their sense objects, holding back the mind, not indulging the mind or the senses or the intelligence, whereas what happens in devotional service? In the service of the Lord Mukunda. Mukunda means another name for Krishna. The senses are transcendentally engaged. This is the big difference. It is not stopping the senses, it is engaging the senses, but in a different way. What is that different way? Spiritually engaging them, transcendentally engaging them. That means we do spiritual activities in Krishna Consciousness. That is the system of Krishna Consciousness, the system of Bhakti. We engage the senses in spiritual activities, just like you may like to hear a very melodious Kirtan, Hare Krishna Kirtan. That is transcendentally engaging your ears and your mind and even your intelligence, or you may relish tasting nice Krishna Prasadam. That is engagement for the tongue, the mind, the intelligence, everything. So it is positive engagement. Bhakti is positive engagement, of course, in a specific type of activity, spiritual activity, and there are varieties, there is variety, ample variety of spiritual activities. In this way, if the senses are transcendentally engaged while serving Lord Mukunda, Lord Krishna, there is no chance of the senses being engaged in sense gratification, no chance. And the important point to notice, the senses want some engagement. They cannot be kept for long without any activity. That is artificial. To check them artificially is no check at all, because as soon as there is some opportunity for enjoyment, the serpent-like senses will certainly take advantage of it.

### sense control, Vishwamitra Muni, Haridas Thakur, devotional service, Maya

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "a devotee who is engaged in devotional service cannot be allured by Maya because this is a superior engagement"
**Summary:** The speaker uses the examples of Vishwamitra Muni and Haridas Thakur to illustrate the difference between artificial sense control and the power of devotional service to overcome Maya.

And Prabhupada gives a nice example. There are many such instances in history, and they have been recorded in the Puranas, in the scriptures, just like the example is given of Vishwamitra Muni. He was a great king. He renounced his kingdom and all the wealth and the comforts, royal comforts, and he went away to a forest, a secluded place, and he was performing tapasya. But he, while practicing tapasya, Vishwamitra Muni became a victim to the beauty of Menaka. Whenever any great personality is very determined to perform tapasya, Indra, the king of heaven, he becomes very worried that this person who is doing tapasya may overtake me and replace me as the king of heaven. So Indra sends Apsaras to disturb the tapasya, and that's what exactly happened when Vishwamitra Muni was sitting in the forest and performing meditation. Indra sent one Apsara by name Menaka, and Menaka came and she allured Vishwamitra Muni, and Vishwamitra Muni became completely distracted from his tapasya. But the other example that is also given, a devotee of Lord Chaitanya Thakur, Haridas, he was allured at midnight by the well-dressed Maya. Maya Devi herself came to allure Haridas Thakur when he was sitting and chanting Hare Krishna. Still, she could not induce him into her trap. She could not do that. In fact, Maya Devi surrendered to Haridas Thakur and begged for the holy name from him. So a devotee who is engaged in devotional service cannot be allured by Maya because this is a superior engagement. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita, param drishtva nivartate. If you want to stop the senses from being engaged in mundane sense activities, then you should engage the senses in devotional service, and such engagement is superior.

### devotional service, yoga, jnana, karma, self-realization

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "without devotional service of the Lord neither the yoga system nor philosophical speculation can ever become successful"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that pure devotional service is the topmost path to self-realization, superior to yoga, jnana, and karma, and that these other paths are dependent on bhakti.

You cannot be distracted by Maya. The whole idea is that without devotional service of the Lord, neither the yoga system nor philosophical speculation can ever become successful. Always yoga means karma, karma yoga, jnana, jnana yoga, tapasya, ashtanga yoga, they are different. Whenever the word yoga is suffixed to karma, jnana, or tapasya, then it means that you have to mix with devotional service. Now, pure devotional service of the Lord is without any tinge of or without any mixture of fruity work, mystic yoga, or speculative philosophy, without any mixture of karma, jnana, or tapasya, that without any mixture of that, pure devotional service is actually the foremost procedure for self-realization. This will be explained in detail in the later portions of the Bhagavatam. Such pure devotional service is transcendental in nature, and the systems of yoga and jnana are subordinate to such a process. Yoga and jnana are dependent on mixture of bhakti, whereas pure bhakti is independent of yoga, jnana, karma, everything else. When the transcendental devotional service is mixed with a subordinate process, it is no longer transcendental. It is called mixed devotional service. So all this will be explained by Sri Vyasadeva in the text later on, but for now Narada Muni is telling, bhakti can give complete satisfaction for the soul. Yoga can help in controlling the senses, but it cannot give satisfaction for the soul. Therefore, he is recommending bhakti over the process of yoga or even the process of jnana or even karma. So bhakti, pure devotional service, is the topmost.

**Key Quote:** "What is the cause for his dissatisfaction? That's clearly answered by Narada."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Vyasa Deva's dissatisfaction despite compiling Vedic literature and how Narada Muni instructed him to compile Srimad Bhagavatam, which exclusively glorifies Krishna.

This is almost the concluding portion of this chapter. This was spoken by Narada in response to a question by Vyasa Deva. Vyasa Deva, after compiling the varieties of Vedic literature, he was somehow feeling dissatisfaction in his heart that he had not done enough for the welfare of the people. So, just at the time when he was contemplating what was the cause of his dissatisfaction, that's exactly when Narada Muni arrived in his ashram, in Vyasa's ashram. So, Vyasa received Narada very respectfully and inquired from him, what is the cause of my dissatisfaction? So, then Narada Muni pointed out, even though you have compiled so many varieties of Vedic literature, you have not compiled one particular literature which exclusively glorifies Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhood. And Vyasa Deva was instructed by Narada to compile that particular literature. So, Narada gave instructions to Vyasa Deva how to go about compiling the Srimad Bhagavatam, which is the exclusive literature glorifying Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now not only did Vyasa get instructions about compiling Bhagavatam but he also inquired from Narada about his own self-realization and that is what Narada has explained. How did he become self-realized? How did he become the great devotee Narada? So the whole history has been described. I have explained my birth and activities for self-realization as you asked. So whatever Vyasa Dev asked, Narada has described. Now Vyasa Dev is being told by Narada, all this will be conducive for your personal satisfaction also. So Vyasa Dev was looking for a clue. What is the cause for his dissatisfaction? That's clearly answered by Narada.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how Narada's devotional service began in his previous life as the son of a maidservant through association with sages and partaking of their remnants (prasadam), leading to purification and attraction to Krishna katha.

So all these have been explained in brief, of course, by Narada to Vyasa. So Prabhupada is further explained. Narada has explained how the seeds of devotional service were sown by the transcendental association, and how they gradually developed by hearing the sages, the bhaktivedantas who happened to be passing by that place where Narada in his previous life as the son of a maidservant was staying with his mother. And the sages happened to stop by in that spot, and Narada's mother was rendering some menial service to the sages, and Narada as a small boy joined his mother. And one day he took some remnants of some food left behind by the sages, the bhaktivedantas, and that resulted in his purification and he became attracted to the subject matter of krishna katha which they were discussing. From those self-realized sages was detachment from worldliness so much so that even a small boy could receive the death news of his mother who was his only caretaker as the blessings of God. The boy became enlightened in their association by hearing them after he partook remnants of uh prasadam left behind by them so it had a very big transformation of his heart the small boy narada in his previous life as a small boy and at once he took the opportunity to search out the lord.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Narada's search for the Lord, the brief darshan he received, and how devotional service helps one get rid of the reactions of fruitive activities, breaking the cycle of birth and death.

We have to re-establish our lost relationship with Krishna, that is the whole practice of bhakti, that is what bhakti is meant for. So this boy went for searching the Lord exactly as he had been instructed by those sages, the bhaktivedantas. A sincere urge for having an interview with the Lord was also granted to him, although it is not possible for anyone to see the Lord with mundane eyes. Krishna gave him brief darshan and afterwards Narada tried to have the darshan again and he could not, but the Lord spoke to Narada to encourage him to continue his practice of meditation on the Supreme Lord in the heart as taught by the bhaktivedantas. So Naramuni also explained to Vyasa Deva how by execution of pure transcendental service one can get rid of the fruitive action of accumulated work. We have been doing so many material activities in contact with this material world, contact with the three modes and that has resulted in so many reactions and those reactions result in a repetition of birth and death in this world. We cannot get out of material existence but pure devotional service helps us to completely clear away all these reactions.

means it's very difficult to find this in the original vedas why why is it difficult to find sri la prabhupada explains in the vedas and upanishads there are only indirect hints to all this only indirect hints are there direct clear specific explanation is not there in the original vedas and the upanishads no why because the vedas are dealing with the actions and reactions to the three modes of material nature in this material world and because most people are so much interested in material gain through fruitive activity the vedas are suggesting how they can do pious activities and get their desires satisfied their material desires but we are not meant for material existence neither we can really achieve a soul's satisfaction but we have the right to achieve it without conflict we are also interested in material life and we live in a material state after the hinaus Sec mangoes we live pretty much the same but we can't ever be in a material eighteen condition so true belief your veda has a desire to live being馨 Th bread and answering with what is what is as the desire for the customer takes your body through theaction to determine이젏 the desire for the person in fact as we build in their fruit of life it is not a deskritở by material desires being fulfilled. So therefore the conclusion is Srimad Bhagavatam is the mature fruit of all Vedic tree of literature and nothing is directly explained in the original Vedas or the Upanishads but everything is directly explained in the Srimad Bhagavatam. Therefore Bhagavatam is the most important Vedic literature for us especially in this age of Kali as explained by Narada to Vyasa and as recorded by Vyasa in great detail. So

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse to be discussed (SB 1.6.37) and explains the context of Suta Goswami narrating to the sages and Narada Muni's departure after instructing Vyasa Deva.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudireet In this session we will be discussing from the last two verses of the 6th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam.

Sūtavvāca evam sambhāśya bhagavān nārado vāsavīśutam āmantryavīnām ranayan yayau yadṛcchiko muniḥ The meaning of this verse is Sūt Gosvāmī said. Remember, Sūt Gosvāmī is narrating all this to the sages of Naimisharanya based on their inquiry. So Sūt Goswāmī is telling the sages thus addressing Vyasa Deva, Srila Narada Muni took leave of him and vibrating on his Veena instrument, he left to wander at his free will.

**Key Quote:** "every living being is anxious for full freedom because that is his transcendental nature"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Narada Muni's freedom and contrasts it with the limitations of material existence, emphasizing that true freedom is obtained through transcendental service to the Lord.

So Narada Muni is being glorified that he instructed Vyasa Deva exactly to the point, and after finishing his instructions, after completing his instructions, he left to wander at his free will. He is a liberated soul and he simply is directed within his heart by the Supreme Lord directly. So we will see here in the Srimad Bhagavatam Narada Muni appearing in so many different situations in different places only for the sake of preaching about Bhakti, only for one purpose, glorifying the Lord and thereby broadcasting these glories among different people, different persons. God is null for itself. So in the purport Srila Prabhupada says something about Narada's freedom to travel at will wherever he wants. Every living being is anxious for full freedom because that is his transcendental nature. What is our nature as spirit soul? We have full freedom as spirit soul, unlike this body. What is the nature of this material body? It is full of limitations. Every body has got a very specific characteristic, just like there are creatures which can fly, creatures which can walk only, creatures which can only live in water, creatures which can only crawl on the ground, creatures which can only run or walk on four legs. Like that, every body has got a limitation and every body is a material body subject to the influence of the three gunas, subject to threefold miseries, subject to fourfold fundamental problems and all these material bodies are temporary. So we should seriously consider what is being said here. This freedom is obtained only through the transcendental service of the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the illusion of freedom in the material world, highlighting the ignorance of people regarding their true spiritual nature and the limitations of a conditioned soul.

And the only way to obtain this freedom is only through the transcendental service of the Lord. This freedom from material bondage, freedom from the limitations of this body is obtained only one way, what is that? Through transcendental service of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Illusione by the external energy everyone thinks that is through themselves free. Common people, ordinary people generally think I'm free, but actually he is bound up by the laws of nature. What people don't realize is that we are entitled to eternal life. We don't have to die, we don't have to take birth, we don't have to become old, we don't have to get diseased. Are people aware of this? Most people are ignorant about this. That is also the bad system of education that we have. People are not being taught the essential fundamentals of our real nature for real existence, spiritual existence. So Bhagavad-gita is the ultimate wisdom of the world.

**Key Quote:** "but a full-fledged free soul like Narada always engaged in the work of God always engaged in chanting the Lord's glory is free to move not only on earth but also in any part of the universe as well as in any part of the spiritual sky"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad Bhagavatam in enlightening us about our true nature and contrasts the freedom of a pure devotee like Narada Muni with the limitations of conditioned souls and yogis.

So Bhagavad-gita is the ultimate wisdom of the world. Bhagavatam is enlightening us, Srila Prabhupada is enlightening us that only under illusion we may think that I am free, but actually we are not free. A conditioned soul, who is a conditioned soul? One who is subject to the influence of this material nature consisting of three gunas because of the material body, because of our desire to enjoy materially. So a conditioned soul cannot freely move from one place to another even on this earth, and what to speak of one planet to another. On earth do we have freedom to just go wherever we want freely? No, we are bound by so many limitations. But a full-fledged free soul like Narada always engaged in the work of God, always engaged in chanting the Lord's glory is free to move not only on earth but also in any part of the universe as well as in any part of the spiritual sky. Just take note of the extent of freedom Narada Muni has. Yogis who have got mystic power can travel within this universe, but they cannot penetrate the cover of the earth and they cannot penetrate the earth and they cannot penetrate the earth and they cannot penetrate the earth and they cannot of the universe by their mystic power, not possible. Devotees like Narada who are always engaged in glorification of the Supreme Lord, they are free to travel anywhere including the spiritual world penetrating the seven layers of coverings of this universe. So that is the specific freedom that is there for pure devotees who are always engaged in broadcasting the glories of the supreme god. We can just imagine the extent and unlimitedness of his freedom, whose freedom? Narada Muni's freedom. To what extent is he really experiencing freedom which is as good as that of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is free to travel anywhere and everywhere in the whole creation in the material world or the spiritual world. Similarly Narada is also free to travel though Narada is not God, nobody becomes equal to God, but they are bestowed upon, bestowed with the freedom to travel at will by the Supreme Lord. There is no reason or obligation for his traveling and no one can stop him from his free movement.

**Key Quote:** "whereas narada bani is fully self-satisfied by devotional service to krishna which he has for the entire creation of the supreme lord krishna which he engages always and therefore he has no reason to travel that i want something i want something"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Narada Muni's travels are not driven by personal desires but by his self-satisfied engagement in devotional service to Krishna, contrasting this with the motivations of ordinary people.

If we travel we generally will have a purpose, obligation, duty or some desire for enjoyment. We are always having a reason, whereas Narada Muni is fully self-satisfied by devotional service to Krishna which he has for the entire creation of the Supreme Lord Krishna which he engages always and therefore he has no reason to travel that I want something, I want something. A pure devotee never wants anything. Of course a pure devotee always prays to Krishna may I always be engaged in your service. This is a pure devotee's prayer and the Lord is pleased with such prayers and he engages a pure devotee in devotional service always eternally. So Srila Prabhupada explains similarly the transcendental system of devotional service is also free. The transcendental system of devotional service is also free. You it may or may not develop in a particular person even after he undergoes all the detailed formulas. There is no obligation on the part of the Supreme Lord to grant us this freedom by performing devotional service. It is not obligatory for the Lord. Of course the Lord is, Lord Krishna is always our topmost well-wisher, but then we should surrender to him, execute devotional service without any reservation and then we can expect the mercy of the Lord by which alone we can get this freedom which a pure devotee enjoys by the mercy of the Supreme Lord. The association of the devotee is also free. One may be fortunate to have it or one may not have it even after thousands of endeavors. People have so many different kinds of associations in this world. Somebody's interest in sports then they are associating with other people and they are associating with the Lord because they are interested people in sports. Somebody's interested in some profession, some technical development and they associate with such technocrats. Somebody is interested in some mundane music, somebody else is interested in mundane literature. So many different interests are there and they are busy with that.

**Key Quote:** "And yet, acharyas like Prabhupada come down and they want to liberally distribute devotional service to all those who are unfortunate, all those who are bereft of devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by highlighting the rarity of devotional service and the compassion of acharyas like Prabhupada who distribute it to the suffering souls, emphasizing the importance of surrendering to the spiritual master and awaiting the causeless mercy of the Lord.

So, devotional service is not easily available in this material world. And yet, acharyas like Prabhupada come down and they want to liberally distribute devotional service to all those who are unfortunate, all those who are bereft of devotional service. Acharyas like Prabhupada, Prabhupada, his guru, his guru's guru, all the acharyas in the parampara, in the sampradaya, Vaishnava sampradaya, they are very, very, very compassionate upon the suffering souls of this world, just as Krishna is compassionate. Why does Krishna incarnate? For the sake of the conditioned souls, to rescue them. And he senses confidential devotees also to rescue the conditioned souls. Krishna is anxious for this. This is only anxiety. Prahlad Maharaj says, People are busy with illusory activities, simply for some illusory pleasure. And they are simply wasting their time. Unfortunately, they are ignorant. But the ignorance, even if it is not difficult to remove, we may not become really delivered or free from material bondage, simply by some mechanical process. No. So, therefore, it is said here, devotional service, voluntarily taken up by somebody, and serve the spiritual master, and through the spiritual master, the Supreme Lord Krishna, without any reservation, and await the causeless mercy of the spiritual master and the Supreme Lord. This is the formula. I will stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the illusory nature of material existence and the suffering caused by identifying with the body and seeking happiness in the material world.

What a wonderful personality Narad Muni is! So, he is being glorified by Suta Goswami that all glory and success to Srila Narad Muni Aho Devarashir Dhanayoyam. Why? Why is he being glorified by Suta Goswami? Because Narad Muni himself, what does he do? He always is engaged in glorifying the activities of Lord Krishna and by doing that, what happens? He himself takes pleasure and he also enlivens all the distressed souls of this universe. He is travelling everywhere to relieve the distress of those suffering souls who are conditioned souls in this world under the influence of illusion, mistakenly thinking that this world is all in all, mistakenly thinking that I am this body, mistakenly thinking illusory pleasure is real happiness.

**Key Quote:** "But simply take to the process of bhakti, especially hearing the glories of Krishna from such pure devotees as Narada, Vyasa, Srila Narad Muni, Sita Goswami, Sita Goswami, Sita Chandra, Srila Prabhupada. Your life is going to be a complete success, ultimate success."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of bhakti, hearing the glories of Krishna from pure devotees, and the role of the spiritual master as a transparent medium for the Lord's mercy.

Like this, all the defects of material existence, if we were to analyse, it is too complex. But simply take to the process of bhakti, especially hearing the glories of Krishna from such pure devotees as Narada, Vyasa, Srila Narad Muni, Sita Goswami, Sita Chandra, Srila Prabhupada. Your life is going to be a complete success, ultimate success. So how does it actually happen? In the previous session I was discussing about devotional service. That one may not attain devotional perfection even after following all the rules and regulations of devotional service, or one may get it, you know, very easily, very quickly. So it all depends on the mercy of the supreme lord coming through the transparent medium of the bona fide spiritual master. What's the meaning of this transparent medium? We discussed this earlier. The spiritual master facilitates lord's mercy to be distributed to the suffering souls for the benefit of the suffering souls. But in distributing like this, this mercy of the supreme lord to the suffering souls, the spiritual master engages in what is called as devotional activity

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of freedom in devotional service, emphasizing that bhakti cannot be forced and that the Lord's mercy is bestowed according to one's willingness to accept it.

which are meant for enlightening the ignorant souls about bhakti, especially about bhakti. But the characteristic of bhakti is, in all spheres of devotional service, freedom is the main pivot. Bhakti cannot be forced. You cannot demand bhakti. Lord is not obligated to bestow devotional service upon anyone and everyone, and yet the scriptures say even though the lord is fully independent, he is also very, very kind to the suffering souls of this world. So therefore it is his only anxiety that my beloved part and parcels are suffering in this world under illusion, so he wants to rescue, but not against our wish. The pivot of all devotional activities is freedom. You are free to accept the path of devotional service, you're free to reject it or to not accept that at all. But you should understand other than devotional service there's no way

**Summary:** The speaker explains that surrendering to Krishna leads to true freedom and liberation from material bondage, attracting the Lord's mercy.

anybody can get ultimate liberation from all material problems, and with a sober cool head if you study Bhagavad-Gita and Bhagavatam, you can understand this thoroughly. There are so many examples in the Bhagavata and Bhagavad-Gita systematically explains the principles by which devotional service works. So here Srila Prabhupada says a very important thing: without freedom there is no execution of devotional service. The freedom surrender to the Lord, it is advice in the Bhagavad-Gita. Krishna advises us, surrender your so called illusory freedom. We don't have real freedom in this material world, we have illusory freedom. So Krishna says surrender that to whom? To Krishna. That does not mean that by surrendering we become slaves. No, by surrendering to the lord we become completely free. We become free from material bondage, we attain ultimate liberation, we attract the mercy of the supreme lord.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Narada Muni's role in glorifying the Lord through his Veena, emphasizing the transcendental nature of the instrument and its sound.

So we have to, with this cool head, we have to understand this. So in the purport to this last verse, Srila Prabhupada explains, in the purport itself, Sri Narad Muni plays on his instrument to glorify the transcendental activities of the Lord. There's a song written by one of our, the veena which Narad Muni carries is completely transcendental. It's of the same spiritual quality as the supreme lord, pure devotees, the spiritual world, etc. So the sound vibrated by this veena is completely spiritual. So what is the proof that it is spiritual? Narad Muni vibrates for place on this instrument called veena and by doing so he simply sings the glories of the supreme lord. Not only Narad Muni playing on the veena instrument glorifies the supreme lord, but he also does give relief to all miserable lives. He glorifies the supreme lord and he coaches the glory of the lord

living entities of this universe. We should be fortunate to hear Narad Muni singing, playing on the Veena. So Narad Muni does that. He travels. And he enlivens others by simply glorifying the Lord while playing on his instrument, the Veena. So Prabhupada says in this purport, no one is happy here within the universe. And what is felt as happiness is Maya's illusion. This I explained in the previous session. The same thing is repeated, that only under the influence of illusion, due to illusory presentation called happiness, a person thinks himself or herself happy. But nobody is happy. Nobody. Nobody is really happy, because the quality of this material happiness is illusory. That's why. The illusory energies of the Lord is so strong that even the hog who lives on filthy stool feels happy. What kind of happiness is this, this material happiness? The hog is eating some rubbish, and the hog feels very, very happy eating such rubbish. We think it is very abominable. So whole material existence is like that. So Srila Prabhupada says, no one can be truly happy within the material world.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts material happiness with the qualitatively different pleasure derived from devotional service, stating that true happiness cannot be found through material means.

If you want real happiness, it is not available by any material methods. OK. What do people do when they try to get some happiness through material methods, and they don't get it? Or they get something which is limited, and it's not satisfying the core of the heart, the spirit soul. Then they attempt to get some other similar happiness in another way, another attempt, another background, another technique. But actually, Prabhupada's statement here is, no one can be truly happy within the material world. No one can be truly happy. And you can talk to any number of materialistic persons. If they're honest with you, they will admit that whatever pleasure they are seeking, that is simply some material happiness, which is illusory. And they will not easily admit, but that confide that such material happiness is not at all the same as the pleasure derived from devotional cells. It's totally different in quality.

We do not know of that till we actually experience it. So Narad Muni is traveling to spread the glories of the Supreme Lord, and he wants to reclaim the conditioned souls for Krishna. So mission of all genuine devotees of the Lord is to follow in the footsteps of Narad Muni. Narad Muni is the Acharya. And we are meant to follow the Acharya. Acharya teaches by example. Acharya gives clear direction. Acharya leads us to go back to Godhead where we belong. That's the function of an acharya, the duty of an acharya.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the role of the Acharya, exemplified by Srila Prabhupada, in guiding conditioned souls towards devotional service and experiencing the taste of spiritual happiness.

So such acharyas are simply concerned with welfare of the suffering souls in this world. Even Srila Prabhupada is acharya, present acharya. He's always unhappy about the suffering of the souls, conditioned souls in this world. Some or the other convince them and actually get them to engage in devotional pure devotional service and get that if they get a little taste, a very, very little taste that is so sweet that they'll be attracted to get more such pleasure, spiritual happiness more and more and more and more and it can be unlimitedly expanded because Krishna's unlimited, his service is unlimited, his spiritual abode is unlimited like that. So we can expect that we engage in pure devotional service under proper guidance with proper and strictly following the rules regulations in the association below we get a little glimpse of the taste of pure devotional service itself even before reaching perfection.

**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains Vyasa Deva's question to Narada Muni about how Narada remembers events from a previous kalpa, even after annihilation.

In this session, we will continue to discuss from the 6th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, verses 4 onwards. Today we will discuss 4 to 9, that is about 6 verses. The 4th verse, प्राककल्प विशयाम एताम् स्मृतिम्ते मुनिसत्तमा नही एश प्यवधात काल एश सर्वनिराकृतिही. The meaning of this verse is, O great sage. This verse is spoken by Vyasa Deva as an inquiry to Narada Muni. Vyasa Deva is inquiring from Narada about the further events after his initiation in his previous life, Narada's previous life. So Vyasa Deva's inquiry now is, O great sage, time annihilates everything in due course. So how is it that this subject matter, which happened prior to this day of Brahma, is still fresh in your memory, undisturbed by time? We have to be reminded that Narada is speaking of his previous life in a previous kalpa. Kalpa means a day of Brahma. In one day of Brahma, there are 1000 cycles of the 4 yugas on this earth. So, something which happened billions of years back, and after that happened, everything was completely annihilated, still, how is it fresh in the mind of Narada?

So also, spiritual consciousness is not annihilated. So, we are spirit soul. Spirit soul is eternal, never destroyed, no birth, no death, no deterioration. And the body is, of course, it is destroyed after death. So unlike the body which is destroyed, every time we acquire a body, it will be destroyed. So body is destroyed, yes, but not the spirit soul. Similarly, spiritual consciousness, the consciousness belongs to the spirit. Consciousness doesn't belong to the body or doesn't belong to anything material. Just like all the material objects around us, they are all dead matter. There is no consciousness in them. Similarly, the body itself independently does not have consciousness. Then, what is the consciousness we exhibit while in this body? So that Srila Prabhupada explains, that Narada developed his spiritual consciousness even when he had his material body in the previous kalpa, in the previous day of Brahma. He developed the spiritual consciousness.

**Key Quote:** "Whereas, the spiritual consciousness is not dependent on the condition or the state of the body."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami contrasts material consciousness, which is temporary and dependent on the body, with spiritual consciousness, which is eternal.

Now, consciousness of the material body means spiritual consciousness expressed through the medium of a material body. Just like everybody exhibits consciousness, all living persons, even though they are not situated in spiritual consciousness, whatever consciousness they are exhibiting, they are exhibiting the consciousness of the spirit through the medium of the material body. Now, this consciousness exhibited through the material body, is inferior, it is destructible and it is perverted. It is not permanent. Just like even in this life, you can see a child exhibits consciousness of a small child behavior or the characteristics of a small child. The same child, when it grows up, when its consciousness changes from the consciousness of a child to the consciousness of a young adult, it is completely different. The consciousness is different. So, that consciousness of a child is gone with that child body. The child body is no longer there. So, that consciousness of a child, is not there exhibited anymore. It is gone with the body.

So, that is the super consciousness of the supra mind, as Prabhupada says here. It is spiritual consciousness, which is above material consciousness. And it is of the super mind. The spiritual mind, not the material mind. And it is on the spiritual plane. It is on the spiritual platform. It is as good as the spirit soul and is never destroyed, never annihilated. So, this is the explanation Srila Prabhupada gives, how Narada did not forget what happened in a previous day of Brahma, when everything at the end of the day of Brahma was annihilated. So, everything is annihilated means except the spirit and the spiritual consciousness,

This is the sixth verse I am going to read now. The meaning of this verse is: I was the only son of my mother who was not only a simple woman but a maid servant as well. Since I was her only offspring, she had no other alternative for protection. She bound me with the tie of affection. This is Narada Muni describing his previous life to Vyasa Deva. He is particularly answering Vyasa's question as to what did he do after initiation. So he was the only son of his mother. He was the only son of his mother and his mother was a maid servant doing some simple work and he was her only son. So she bound him up with her affectionate bondage. The next verse, the seventh verse. The meaning is: she wanted to look after my maintenance properly but because she was not independent, she was not able to do anything for me. The world is under the full control of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, everyone is like a wooden doll in the hands of a puppet master. So Narada Muni is explaining that the mother was having a plan to look after this boy very nicely. But we should always remember, none of us in this world are independent.

**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that while the Lord is in control, humans have a degree of free will and are responsible for their actions and desires, which influence their experiences within the boundaries set by the Lord.

This sort of understanding is not the correct understanding. What is the correct understanding? The Lord is in full control, yes, that's a fact. But he also has given each of the human beings, particularly, a little free will, little independence. And we have to become responsible in properly utilizing the tiny amount of independence. Now this use of independence is dependent on our desires. In what way we want to cultivate our desires. In what way we want to cultivate our desires. So, depending on the desires and depending on our past karma, So, depending on the desires and depending on our past karma, the Supreme Lord arranges everything for a person, for each one of us. So, ultimately, the Supreme Lord is in control. Our specific enjoyment and suffering is due to our own actions, our desires. It is not imposed by the Lord. Desires are not imposed. Activities are not imposed.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the mother's death was the Lord's mercy, freeing Narada from material bondage and dependence, and emphasizes the illusory nature of bodily connections and the uncertainty of material relationships.

So, this is the supreme will of the Supreme Lord. So, Śrīla Prabhupāda explains, That is the way of dragging a sincere soul nearer to God. The boy was bound up by his mother's affection. But, to release him from that bondage, the Lord has arranged something. What is that? The poor boy was being looked after only by his affectionate mother. And yet, the mother was taken away from the world by the supreme will, in order to put him completely at the mercy of the Lord. See, this is described here as the Lord's mercy upon this soul, Narada, in his previous life. Actually, each one of us is completely dependent entirely on the Supreme Lord. It is not just the case with this boy, Narada. It is the case with everyone. But, we have created artificial sources of dependence, based on some bodily connections. But, all these are simply the effect of the illusory energy. The body itself is the arrangement of the illusory energy. So, what to speak of the bodily connections? They are all completely governed by kala karma guna. So, there is no certainty how long a certain relationship will exist, and what will be the outcome of a certain relationship, at a certain time. Nobody can actually predict, or make a definite plan, though we try to make so many plans. But, all such plans are ultimately nullified,

by the action of the supreme time. So, the boy was having only his mother. And, the mother was taken away, so that he could completely come to depend upon the Supreme Lord, who is the only available shelter, ultimately, and nobody else is the shelter. The tenth verse, tadātadaham īśasya bhaktānāṁśaṁ abhīpsatah anugrahaṁ manyamāṇaḥ prātiṣṭham diśaṁ uttarāṁ The meaning is: I took this as the special mercy of the lord, who always desires benediction for his devotees. And so thinking, I started for the north. So, Śrīla Prabhupāda explains, Confidential devotees of the lord see in every step a benedictory direction of the lord. What is considered to be an odd or difficult moment, in the mundane sense, is accepted as a special mercy of the lord. This is the position of a devotee. This boy was initiated, instructed, and enlightened by the sages, even when he was a very small boy. But he could understand, Oh, now that my mother is taken away from me, who is there for me, other than the Supreme Lord, nobody else. And therefore, this boy thought that it's the lord's mercy, that I have been placed in a situation where I exclusively have to depend on him. And, he understood that the lord has freed him from this bondage. And, as he was directed, or instructed by the sages, he actually started towards the north.

the saintly persons. So, it is explained here, mundane prosperity is a kind of material fever. And by the grace of the lord, the temperature of this material fever is gradually diminished. So, what we calculate according to our material calculation, that is not the proper understanding from the spiritual perspective. Just like fever is to be reduced. It's a symptom of an unhealthy body. Similarly, material prosperity, which may make us attached materially, or bound materially, is like a fever, unhealthy condition. So, when it comes down, then we come out of the bondage, material bondage. And that's what happened to Narada Muni. Of course, people do not understand this. Ordinary people do not understand this. It's only spiritual perspective which helps us understand this situation. So, I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

So Vyasa Deva, of course, is perfect because he is the empowered incarnation of the Supreme Lord for compiling all the Vedic literature, and he has appeared for this purpose specifically. He says also an incarnation of the Lord, Shakya Vesha Avatar, so he has no need to practice, but nonetheless, to set an example, he is situated in his ashram, and he is performing meditation in order to fix his mind on the absolute personality of Godhead, the absolute truth, and realize the whole subject matter of the Bhagavad Gita before compiling. Srila Prabhupada further explains, it does not matter whether the place belongs to a householder or a mendicant. Mendicant means somebody who is a renunciant, who is a tapasvi, who is a renounced order of life. The whole varnashrama system is so designed that each and every status of life is called an ashram. Varana ashrama, four varanas: brahmana, kshatriya, vaishya, shudra. This defines the whole system of life. This defines the occupational duty of four different classes of people in the civilized human society. Apart from these four varanas, there are four ashramas. What are the four ashramas? brahmachari ashram, grihastha ashram, vanaprastha ashram, sannyas ashram. These are four stages of gradual progress towards the ultimate goal of self realization while spiritual culture is very prominent.

**Summary:** This segment explains the meaning of the Atmarama verse, emphasizing Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's 61 different interpretations and Srila Prabhupada's elaborate purport, focusing on the multiple meanings of key terms within the verse.

The meaning of this verse is that there are all different varieties of Atmaramas. Who are called Atmaramas? Those who take pleasure in Atma or spirit self. Especially those established on the path of self realization, though freed from all kinds of material bondage, desire to render unalloyed devotional service unto the personality of Godhead.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Lord Chaitanya says, according to the Vishwa Prakasha, Sanskrit dictionary, there are seven synonyms for the word Atmarama."
**Summary:** The speaker delves into the various meanings of the words 'Atmarama,' 'Munayaha,' and 'Nirgrantha,' drawing from Sanskrit dictionaries and scriptures to provide a comprehensive understanding of these terms.

there are so many meanings of the verse that can be derived. So this is a very elaborate shloka: Atmarama, Munayaha, Nirgantha, Api, Cha, Urukrama, Kurvanti. So Lord Chaitanya says, according to the Vishwa Prakasha, Sanskrit dictionary, there are seven synonyms for the word Atmarama. What are the seven synonyms? The first one is Brahman, the Absolute Truth. The second one, Atma refers to body. The third one, mind. The fourth one, atma refers to endeavor. The fifth one, atma refers to endurance. The sixth one, atma refers to intelligence and the seventh one is atma referring to personal habits. Next Lord Chaitanya says the word Munayaha refers to, again there are seven different meanings for the word Munayaha. First is those who are thoughtful. Muni means somebody who's a deep thinker, so those who are thoughtful. Second meaning of the word Munayaha is those who are grave and silent. The third meaning is those who are ascetics. Ascetics means they have taken severe vows and they undergo austerities, penances. The fourth meaning of the word Munayaha is those who are persistent, determined. The fifth meaning is those who are mendicants. Mendicants means beggars. The sixth meaning is those who are sages and the last meaning in this series, the seventh meaning is Munayaha referring to saintly persons or Saints. Then the word Nirgranta, here for the word Nirgranta, there are four meanings given. The first meaning is one who is liberated from nescience. Nescience means ignorance, one who is enlightened spiritually may be called nirgranta. The second meaning is one who has no connection with scriptural injunction. Granta can refer to scriptures, so nirgranta can refer to one who has no connection with scriptural injunctions, that is one who is freed from the obligations of the rules and regulations mentioned in the revealed scriptures like ethics, vedas, philosophy, psychology and metaphysics. In other words, this nirgranta in the second sense refers to fools, illiterate people, archins etc who have no connection with regulated principles. The third meaning of nirgranta is a capitalist and the fourth meaning of nirgranta is one who is penniless, one who is utterly poor.

**Key Quote:** "So this word urukrama specifically indicates the lord's incarnation as Vamana."
**Summary:** The lecture continues by defining 'Urukrama' and relating it to Lord Vishnu's incarnation as Vamana, highlighting the Lord's glorious activities and potencies in creating both the spiritual and material worlds.

Now the dictionary called shabdakosha, the affects me used in the sense of certainty counting building forbiddance and the word grantha is used in the sense of wealth thesis vocabulary etc. So the word nirgranta also is broken up into nirgranta and grantha. The word urukkrama means the one whose activities are glorious. Krama means step, so this word urukrama specifically indicates the lord's incarnation as one whose activities are glorious. Karma means step, so this word urukkrama specifically indicates the lord's incarnation as one who is prime abode with these affections and process go to our forum here is ah bombing descriptor words complying maybe vehicle organization or as Vamana. You would have heard of the name Vamana. The Lord appeared as a small Brahmachari boy and went to Bali Maharaj, asked for three steps of land and then when he actually had to take the measurement, he expanded himself and covered the whole universe by his immeasurable steps. So, it is said here Lord Vishnu is powerful and his activities are so glorious that he has created the spiritual world by his internal potency. He has created the material world by his material potency and by his all-pervading features, he is present everywhere as a supreme truth. And in his personal feature, he is always present in his transcendental abode of Goloka Vrindavana where he displays transcendental pastimes in all variegatedness. Now, Lord Vishnu's activities cannot be compared to anyone else's activities and therefore, the word Urukrama is applicable only to him.

### Itthambhoota Guna, transcendental bliss, devotional service, Krishna
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/B3vlla60gVE?t=590
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna is both attractive and very pleasing he is the most sublime abode of transcendental bliss"
**Summary:** The speaker explains 'Itthambhoota Guna' as transcendental bliss, contrasting it with Brahmananda and emphasizing the supreme attractiveness and pleasure derived from realizing and serving Lord Krishna through devotional service (bhakti).

Only to Lord Vishnu and nobody else. Now, there is another term that is used that's called Itthambhoota Guna. The last line of this verse, Itthambhoota Gunoharihi. In that last line, one term Itthambhoota Guna has got different meanings. The word Itthambhoota is transcendentally exalted because it means full of transcendental bliss. Itthambhoota means full of transcendental bliss. Before this transcendental bliss, the bliss derived from merging into existence of the absolute Brahmananda, what is called as Brahmananda, becomes like a piece of straw in comparison. Which means, Brahmananda or the joy of merging into the existence of the Supreme is insignificant in front of the transcendental bliss derived by realization or connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Vishnu. Now, here is a quotation from a scripture. This quotation clarifies this point. What is Brahmananda in comparison with the joy of devotional service? This quotation says, My dear Lord, O Master of the universe, since I have directly seen you, seen whom? seen the personality of God at Krishna, my transcendental bliss has taken the shape of a great ocean. Being situated in that ocean of transcendental bliss, I now realize all other so-called happiness like the water contained in the footprint of a car. It means very very very meager, very insignificant, very very little, all other happiness is very little. Now the special feature of Lord Krishna is that Lord Krishna is so exalted that he is more attractive than anything else and more pleasing than anything else. Krishna is both attractive and very pleasing. He is the most sublime abode of transcendental bliss. Krishna is the reservoir of unlimited transcendental bliss. By his own strength, he causes one to forget all other ecstasies. That is Krishna's special feature. Pure devotional service is so sublime that one can very easily forget the happiness derived from material enjoyment, happiness derived from material liberation and the happiness derived from mystic perfection. Thus the devotee is bound by Krishna's mercy and by Krishna's uncommon power and qualities. This is a result of realizing Krishna, of contacting Krishna, the personality of Godhead, of seeing Krishna, of rendering service to him. Some or the other get in touch with Krishna, the personality of Godhead and that's only possible through bhakti and no other way. But it's explained here even if somebody does not directly take to the process of bhakti, through so many other processes if they are progressive, they will come to the point of bhakti.

**Key Quote:** "So, here Suta Goswami is justifying that even liberated souls are attracted to Krishna because of his wonderful qualities."
**Summary:** Suta Goswami justifies why even liberated souls are attracted to Krishna due to his unlimited good qualities, as explained by Lord Chaitanya to Sanatana Goswami.

Just to refresh your memory, the meaning of that verse: all different varieties of Atmaramas, or those who take pleasure in the Atmarama, the life of the self, especially those engaged in self-realization, though freed from all kinds of material bondage, desire to render unalloyed devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This means the Lord possesses transcendental qualities and therefore can attract everyone, including liberated souls. If you remember, before this, there was a question raised by Saunakarishi to Suta Goswami, why did Sukadev Goswami, the great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, undertake the trouble of going through this vast literature of Bhagavatam from his father Vyasadeva, when he was already a liberated soul? So, here Suta Goswami is justifying that even liberated souls are attracted to Krishna because of his wonderful qualities. He is a reservoir of unlimited good qualities. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur says, and who are the varieties of different transcendentalists who get attracted to Krishna? And even non-transcendentalists get attracted to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna offers himself to his devotees because devotees don't accept anything from Krishna for the service they render to him."
**Summary:** The discussion focuses on Krishna's transcendental qualities, his unlimited nature, and his magnanimity in offering himself to his devotees because they don't seek anything in return.

So, that is described elaborately by Lord Chaitanya to Srila Sanatana Goswami. So, here continuing the description of the different meanings, the word guna means quality. The qualities of Krishna are transcendentally situated and are unlimited in quantity. All of the spiritual qualities are full of transcendental bliss. That is the nature of Krishna's qualities. Krishna's transcendental qualities of opulence, sweetness and mercy are perfect and full. As far as Krishna's affections are concerned, leaning toward his devotees is concerned, he's so magnanimous that he can give himself to his devotees. Why is this said like this here? Because even if Krishna wants to offer anything to his devotees, the pure devotees do not accept anything in return for the service they render to Krishna. So Krishna says, "I have nothing in my possession which I can give you, so I give myself to you." There is such a statement in these scriptures. Krishna offers himself to his devotees because devotees don't accept anything from Krishna for

**Key Quote:** "When the breeze carrying the aroma of Tursi leaves and saffron from the lotus feet of the lotus eyed personality of Godhead entered through the nostrils into the hearts of those sages, the Kumaras, they experienced a change in both body and mind."
**Summary:** Krishna's qualities attract devotees through beauty, mellows, and fragrance, exemplified by the Kumaras being attracted to Krishna by the aroma of Tulsi leaves offered to the Lord.

the service they render to him. Now Krishna has unlimited qualities, ittambhuta gunoharihi, that is being described here. Krishna has unlimited qualities. The devotees are attracted by his uncommon beauty, by his mellows. Mellow means the rasa that is exchanged in transcendental loving service and the fragrance. Thus they are differently situated in different transcendental mellows, devotees situated in different kinds of relationship with Krishna. Therefore Krishna is called all attractive. The name Krishna means, one of the meanings Krishna means, all attractive. He is completely attractive to everyone without exception. Now examples have been given by Lord Chaitanya. The minds of the four boy sages, Kumaras, Sanaka, Sanatana, Sanandana and Sanat Kumara were attracted to the lotus feet of Krishna by the aroma of the Tursi that had been offered to the Lord. Lord Vishnu or Narayana always is worshipped by offering Tursi mixed with Chandan. We call it Charan Tursi. So that is offered to Lord Narayana or Krishna or Vishnu always by the devotees. So the fragrance of that Tursi mixed with Chandan attracted the attention of the people. These are the four liberated sages, Kumaras. So that is explained further. In the Bhagavatam, there is a statement: When the breeze carrying the aroma of Tursi leaves and saffron from the lotus feet of the lotus eyed personality of Godhead entered through the nostrils into the hearts of those sages, the Kumaras, they experienced a change in both body and mind, even though they were attached to the inner world, even though they were attached to the inner world. This was Murabbi's impassional Brahman understanding.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "They do not have any attraction for anything material in this world."
**Summary:** The story of the Kumaras entering Vaikuntha, being stopped by Jaya and Vijaya, and subsequently cursing them is narrated.

There is a description in the 15th chapter of Srimad Bhagavatam that once these four Kumaras happened to be wandering without any particular aim because they were liberated sages. They do not have any attraction for anything material in this world. They are not interested in any material enjoyment, material power, material facilities, material opulence, they are not interested in any of those things. They are completely transcendentally situated. So while they were wandering, they happened to enter the Vaikuntha planet. Now how is it that could enter the Vaikuntha planet? Because they're liberated souls. Those who are conditioned, even by dint of yogic power, they cannot go outside the coverings of the universe. A conditioned soul cannot go outside the coverings of the universe. A liberated soul, by the mercy of the Supreme Lord, can even go to the spiritual planet, the Vaikuntha loka. So by chance, without any particular aim, the Kumaras who are wandering everywhere happen to enter the Vaikuntha loka. Now as soon as they entered the Vaikuntha loka, something happened. They were stopped by one of the, by a pair of door keepers, Jaya and Vijaya, who were guarding the doors of the entrance of the Vaikuntha palace of the Supreme Lord. So the Kumaras became very angry at the Vaikuntha loka. They were stopped by one of the, by a pair of door keepers, Jaya and Vijaya. Who were these door keepers? You are not fit to be living here, staying in this place where there is no duality. How come you are wrongly stopping somebody who is eligible to go? Because we have no particular desire or we have no particular attraction or no particular need for any enjoyment and you're stopping us, so you don't deserve to be in Vaikuntha. So the Kumaras cursed these two door keepers and

**Summary:** Lord Narayana pacifies the Kumaras, and they are captivated by his beauty and the aroma of Tulsi, leading them to become devotees.

exactly at the time Lord Narayana arrived at that door to his palace and he wanted to pacify this Kumaras. So the Kumaras, when they saw the beauty of Lord Narayana, they were immediately captivated by that beauty and they fell down prostrate to offer obeisances to the Supreme Lord. Now when they offered obeisances to the Lord's lotus feet, the aroma of the Tursi leaves mixed with chandan entered their nostrils and they experienced a, never before had they had an experience, they never before had. Though they were liberated, they experienced ecstasy both in body and mind by smelling that chandan, Tursi mixed with chandan. That's being described here. Even though they were attached to the impersonal Brahman understanding, that is the only realization they had before this. Now they were elevated to understand the personality courted with his uncommon features. So they became devotees of the Supreme Personality of God after this incident. Next it is described Shukadeva Goswami

### Shukadeva Goswami, Impersonal Brahman, Pastimes of the Lord, Srimad Bhagavatam

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Although I was fully situated in the transcendental position in impersonal Brahman realization, I was nonetheless attracted to the pastimes of Lord Krishna."
**Summary:** The lecture explains how Shukadeva Goswami, initially situated in impersonal Brahman realization, became attracted to Krishna's pastimes and studied Srimad Bhagavatam.

Swami's mind was carried away by hearing the pastimes of the Lord. So, it is said Shukadeva Goswami also was situated in impersonal understanding of the absolute truth, Brahman realization. But when he heard the pastimes of the Lord from his father Vyasadeva, when Vyasadeva compiled and was revising the Srimad Bhagavatam under the instruction of Narada, that is when Shukadeva Goswami got attracted to the personality of Godhead Krishna. So, Shukadeva Goswami's own words, it is described, Shukadeva Goswami is addressing Pariksit Maharaj, "My dear king, although I was fully situated in the transcendental position in impersonal Brahman realization, I was nonetheless attracted to the pastimes of Lord Krishna. Therefore, I studied Srimad Bhagavatam from my father." Vyasadeva is a statement by Shukadeva Goswami himself. And Suta Goswami also confirms this by offering his respectful obeisances to Shukadeva Goswami. Suta Goswami says, "I offer my respectful obeisances unto Srila Shukadeva Goswami, the son of Vyasadeva, and the destroyer of all sinful reactions. Being full in self-realization and bliss, he had no material desire. Still, he was attracted by the transcendental pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and out of compassion for the people in general. He described the transcendental historical literature called Srimad Bhagavatam." This is compared, this Bhagavatam is compared to the light of the absolute truth. Bhagavatam can enlighten us in the transcendental subject matter of the absolute truth. He described the personality of Godhead, Krishna, and his personal qualities, his personal activities, his personal form, his personal abode, his personal paraphernalia, his personal devotees.

**Key Quote:** "The gopis are completely captivated by the beauty of Krishna's transcendental form."
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by describing how the Gopis, the most beautiful women, are completely captivated by Krishna's beauty and have surrendered themselves to him.

That's what the Bhagavatam is all about. So, this is the way Krishna attracted the four Kumaras. Krishna attracted Shukadeva Goswami. Both of them were situated in impersonal liberation. Next, Lord Chaitanya describes, Lord Sri Krishna attracts the minds of all the gopis in Vrindavan with his beautiful transcendental bodily features. This is a statement by the gopis themselves. They are addressing Krishna, "Dear Krishna, We have simply surrendered ourselves as your maidservants, for we have seen your beautiful face decorated with tresses of hair, your earrings falling upon your cheeks, the nectar of your lips and the beauty of your smile. Indeed because we have been embraced by your arms, which give us courage and seen your chest, which is beautiful and broad, we have surrendered ourselves." The gopis are completely captivated by the beauty of Krishna's transcendental form. Now mind you, Gopis are the most beautiful women in the entire creation. Those Gopis are attracted to Krishna, so no ordinary person, not even any Devata, anybody can attract the Gopis mind. Only Krishna can attract. So that is the speciality of the Gopis, that's how they, they are devotees completely surrendered to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "This means that the Lord possesses transcendental qualities and therefore can attract everyone, including liberated souls."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the Atmarama verse and explains how even liberated souls are attracted to Krishna's transcendental qualities, mentioning examples like the four Kumaras, Shukadev Goswami, and the Gopis.

In this session we will be discussing, continuing the discussion about the Atmarama verse, the 10th verse of the 7th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Just to refresh your memory, the Atmarama verse, which is the famous one, we have been discussing earlier two sessions. This is the third session, I am continuing the discussion on this verse. आत्मा रामाश्यमुनयो निर्ग्रन्था अप्युरुक्रमे कुर्वन्ति अहीतुकिं भक्तिं इत्थं भूत गुणो हरिही. The meaning of this is, all different varieties of Atmaramas, Atmaramas are those who take pleasure in Atma or the spirit self, especially those established on the path of self-realization, though freed from all kinds of material bondage, desire to render unalloyed devotional service unto the personality of Godhead. This means that the Lord possesses transcendental qualities and therefore can attract everyone, including liberated souls. So, we already discussed how different personalities were attracted to Krishna, even though they were situated, some of them were situated in the impersonal liberation. For example, the four Kumaras and Shukadev Goswami. And I also mentioned in the previous session how the Gopis were attracted to Krishna. Now, I am going to talk about the Gopis.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's qualities are so very attractive, because somebody possesses some nice qualities that is attractive, then when we come across such a person, we become attracted to that person."
**Summary:** The speaker continues discussing Krishna's all-attractive nature, quoting Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and highlighting how even the queens of Dwaraka and the goddess of fortune are drawn to Krishna's beauty and qualities.

I am continuing the discussion about the other personalities attracted by Krishna. This is described by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to Sanatana Goswami. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, The queens in Dwaraka, headed by Rukmini, are also attracted to Krishna simply by hearing about his transcendental beauty and qualities. Simply by hearing about his transcendental beauty and qualities. This Atmarama verse is all about Krishna having unlimited transcendental qualities, attributes by which he attracts everyone. That's why he is called all-attractive. Krishna means all-attractive. He attracts everybody without exception. So, here is a statement in the Bhagavatam that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is quoting. O most beautiful Krishna, I have heard about your transcendental qualities from others, and therefore all my bodily miseries are relieved. If someone sees your transcendental beauty, his eyes have attained everything profitable in life. O infallible one, I have become shameless after hearing of your qualities, and I have become attracted to you. So, Krishna's qualities are so very attractive, because somebody possesses some nice qualities that is attractive, then when we come across such a person, we become attracted to that person. That's natural. But here, Krishna's attraction is so very powerful, that nobody else can possess qualities like Krishna to the extent that they may attract somebody more than Krishna. That is not possible. Further, Lord Chaitanya says, Lord Krishna attracts even the mind of the goddess of fortune

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Kalia being subdued by Krishna and the Nagapatnis' prayers, emphasizing the surprising fortune of Kalia to receive the dust of Krishna's lotus feet, a blessing even the goddess of fortune strives for.

simply by vibrating his transcendental flute. There is a statement in the Bhagavatam by the Nagapatnis. O Lord, we do not know how the serpent Kalia attained such an opportunity to be touched by the dust of your lotus feet. Kalia was chastised by Krishna. And because Kalia's wives, the Nagapatnis, were devotees of Krishna, Krishna spared the life of Kalia. Because the Nagapatnis otherwise would have become widowed. So, Krishna, on the request of the Nagapatnis, spared his life. But still, how did he get the dust of the lotus feet of Krishna on his head? What did Krishna do to subdue Kalia? He actually pounded Kalia's hoods. So, in the process, Kalia got the blessings of the dust of the lotus feet of Krishna. So, the Nagapatnis are expressing surprise. He is a very, he has a sinful background. That's how he took the body of a serpent with so much of venom in his body. And unnecessarily such venomous serpents bite others and kill them. Innocent people, innocent creatures. So, it's not a very good birth because of past sinful activities. In spite of that, in spite of possessing such a body, how did Kalia be fortunate enough to get the dust of the lotus feet of Krishna? That is what the Nagapatnis are expressing in their prayers to Krishna. They are telling to get the dust of the lotus feet of Krishna. The goddess of fortune performed austerities for centuries, giving up all of their desires and taking austere vows. Means it's not easy for someone to get the dust of the lotus feet of Krishna on their head. Indeed, we do not know how this serpent Kalia got such an opportunity, which even goddess of fortune, it is difficult to attain. How did Kalia get that? That is the surprise that the Nagapatnis express in their prayers to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "My dear Lord Krishna, where is that woman within the three worlds who would not be captivated by the rhythms of the sweet songs coming from your wonderful flute?"
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Krishna attracts everyone in the three worlds, including young girls, cows, birds, and even trees, highlighting the different relationships people in Vrindavan have with Krishna (motherly, servant, friend, father).

Next, Lord Chaitanya explains, Krishna attracts not only the minds of the gopis and the goddesses of fortune, but the minds of all the young girls in the three worlds as well. How is that? That is another statement in the Bhagavatam. My dear Lord Krishna, where is that woman within the three worlds who would not be captivated by the rhythms of the sweet songs coming from your wonderful flute? Who would not fall down from the past, though chastity in this way. Your beauty is the most sublime within the three worlds. Upon seeing your beauty, even cows, birds, animals and trees in the forest become stunned in jubilation. So, if such creatures like cows and birds can become captivated, what to speak of the girls in the three worlds, the women in the three worlds. So, the women of Vrindavan who are on the level of superior guardians are attracted to Lord Krishna maternally. That means as mother, in a motherly relationship. The men of Vrindavan are attracted as servants, friends and fathers. Mind you, this is the description that everyone is attracted by Krishna. Everyone. Therefore, the term Krishna all attractive applies only to the Supreme Personality of God, Krishna and nobody else. Further, it is described here. The qualities of Krishna captivate and attract everything, living and non-living. Even birds, animals and trees are attracted to Krishna's qualities. This is already mentioned in the previous verse.

### Hari, inauspiciousness, devotional service, love of Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "One meaning is that the Lord who is called as Hari takes away all inauspicious things from his devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker begins to explain the meaning of the name 'Hari' in the context of the Atmarama verse, focusing on how Krishna removes inauspiciousness from devotees and steals their minds with ecstatic love.

Now, coming to the word Hari. Although the word Hari has many different meanings, two of them are foremost. In connection with the usage of the word Hari in this verse, ittham bhuta guno hari hi. The Supreme Personality of Godhead who is also called Hari is full of so many nice qualities by which she attracts everyone. This is a reference to the verse in which the word Hari is used. Now, which sense the word Hari is used? One meaning is that the Lord who is called as Hari takes away all inauspicious things from his devotee. Hari means one who takes away, one who steals. So, what does Krishna take away that he is referred to as Hari? He takes away all inauspicious things from his devotees. Isn't it so nice? Of course, this doesn't refer to devotees who are already free from all bad qualities or all inauspiciousness. It refers to devotees who are on the path, just entering the path of pure devotional service and very quickly they become purified by coming in touch with the Supreme Lord Krishna. The second meaning of the word Hari in this context of its usage in this Atmarama verse is that he attracts the mind by ecstatic love for God. He steals away the mind of those devotees who are looking after love of Krishna and by giving them the love, reciprocating them with them in love. He attracts their mind. So, now the name Hari the way it is used in Atmarama verse Chaitanya Mahaprabhu explains When the devotee some or other always remembers the Supreme Personality of Godhead anywhere and everywhere Devotee means he always thinks of Krishna. Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita Devotees who are practiced always think of Krishna. Such devotees what happens? Lord Hari takes away life's four miserable conditions. What are the four miserable conditions?

**Key Quote:** "Krishna says I will protect you from all sinful reactions Do not fear"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on how Krishna, as Hari, takes away the four miserable conditions of life caused by sinful activities, explaining the gradations of sin and quoting the Bhagavad Gita to emphasize Krishna's promise to protect those who surrender, regardless of their past sins, listing illicit sex, intoxication, gambling, and meat-eating as the four basic sinful activities.

of life in this material world? So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport. The four miserable conditions are due to the four kinds of sinful activities known as 1. Pathaka 2. Urupathaka 3. Mahapathaka 4. Atipathaka. What do they mean? Pathaka means preliminary sin and Urupathaka means very great sin and Mahapathaka means greater sin and Atipathaka means the topmost sin. Among sinful activities there are gradations. So, based on the gradations there are four different gradations. Now doesn't matter whether somebody is committing sinful activities which are of lower grade or intermediate grade or very high grade. It doesn't matter. Krishna assures the devotee aham tvam sarva papebhya moksha itshyami mahashu jahan. That means if somebody surrenders to Krishna even if before surrendering he was very very sinful Krishna says I will protect you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear. This is the verse in the Bhagavad Gita aham tvam sarva papebhya moksha itshyami mahashu jahan. Now here Srila Prabhupada particularly explains the word sarva papebhya literally means all sinful reactions. Now here particularly Prabhupada is telling the word sarva papebhya indicates four kinds of sinful activities. Which are the four kinds? The four kinds of sinful activities which are classified as pataka, uru pataka, maha pataka and ati pataka. It doesn't matter how sinful a devotee had been before coming to Krishna consciousness Krishna takes away all the sinful reactions before, rather takes away the sinful reactions all kinds of sinful reactions when the devotee surrenders to Krishna. The four basic sinful activities Prabhupada is reminding us are summarized in the Bhagavad Gita as illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat eating. So Krishna takes away all the sinful reactions. So therefore he is called Hari. I will stop here.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This means that the Lord possesses transcendental qualities and therefore can attract everyone including liberated souls."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the Atmarama verse and explains how it highlights the greatness of Bhakti and Krishna's ability to attract various types of individuals, even liberated souls, through His transcendental qualities.

In this session, we will continue discussing the same verse, the tenth verse of the seventh chapter of the first canto, Srimad Bhagavatam, the famous Atmarama verse. So today is the fourth part of the meaning of this Atmarama verse as explained by Lord Chaitanya to Srila Sanatana. This verse helps us appreciate the greatness of Bhakti, the process of devotional service. How different varieties of personalities, living beings, some or the other, when they take to devotional service by coming in contact with a pure devotee, by coming in contact with Krishna, by coming in contact with any devotional paraphernalia, they begin devotional service and Krishna attracts them through so many different ways, and that is what is being described here, and they become pure devotees completely dedicated to serving Krishna with love. So the verse is, Atmaramas chamunayo nirgrantha apyurukrame kurvanti ahaitu keem bhaktim ittham bhuta guno hari hi. The meaning of this verse as directly translated, all different varieties of Atmaramas, especially those established from the path of self-realization, though freed from all kinds of material bondage, desire to render self-realization to the service, to the personality of Godhead. This means that the Lord possesses transcendental qualities and therefore can attract everyone including liberated souls.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna says the nature of pure devotional service is such that, even if somebody who begins devotional service is having some contamination in the heart, all that is completely nullified by the fire of devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on how Krishna attracts different individuals and how devotional service purifies the heart, removing sinful activities and contamination.

So in the last three sessions, we had heard the different meanings of the Atmarama verse pertaining to how Krishna attracts by his qualities, even the impersonalists like those situated in impersonal liberation like Shukadev Goswami, like the four Kumaras, Krishna attracts the Gopis, Krishna attracts the Queens of Dwaraka, Krishna attracts all young girls all over the universe, and animals. So nobody is without attraction for Krishna. That's why Krishna, all-attractive, is the suitable, most appropriate name for the Supreme Lord, who is all-attractive to everyone without exception. So continuing the description, the description of the varieties of Atmaramas who become attracted to Krishna and begin to render pure devotional service to Krishna. So here the description is continuing, as all fuel is burnt to ashes by a full-fledged fire, all sinful activities are totally erased when one engages in devotional service to Me. This is a statement from the Bhagavatam 11th canto when Krishna is instructing Uddhava. Krishna says the nature of pure devotional service is such that even if somebody who begins devotional service is having some contamination in the heart, all that is completely nullified by the fire of devotional service.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "When the devotee is freed from all sinful material activities, Krishna attracts his body, mind and senses to perform devotional service to him."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how devotional service removes impediments and ignorance, leading to enlightenment and attraction to Krishna, ultimately causing detachment from the four principles of material success: Dharma, Artha, Karma, and Moksha.

In this way, when all sinful activities are vanquished by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one gradually vanquishes all kinds of impediments on the path of devotional service, as well as the ignorance resulting from these impediments. In the path of Bhakti, these material contaminations are obstacles. Now as one goes on rendering devotional service to Krishna, the heart becomes cleansed automatically without separate endeavour, and impediments are all gone, the obstacles are removed. And when the obstacles are removed, even the ignorance is vanquished. One becomes enlightened from within automatically without separate endeavour. After this, one totally manifests his original love of Godhead through devotional service in nine different ways, hearing, chanting, remembering, etc. When the devotee is freed from all sinful material activities, Krishna attracts his body, mind and senses to perform devotional service to him. See, as long as there is material contamination, we have attraction for so many material things. But when the material contamination is gone, we get attracted to Krishna. And Krishna attracts our total being, our body, our mind, our words, everything completely. Krishna attracts. And thus it is described, Krishna is very, very merciful and his transcendental qualities are very attractive. He is full of so many transcendental qualities. Now further, Lord Chaitanya explains, when one's mind, senses and body are attracted to the transcendental qualities of the Supreme Lord Hari, one gives up the four principles of material success. What are the four principles of material success? Dharma, Artha, Karma, Moksha. Dharma means religious performance. Artha means economic development. Karma means sense gratification. And Moksha means liberation.

### absolute truth, brahma, krishna

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Absolute truth is truth in all phases of time, under all circumstances, in all conditions."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the concept of absolute truth (Brahma) and identifies Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the absolute truth that exists in all phases of time.

So, generally people who are pious in this material world, they are interested in four goals of a civilized human being, mentioned in the Shastra: Dharma, Artha, Karma, Moksha. But Bhakti is greater than these four Purusharthas. Bhakti is called the Panchama Purushartha, the fifth goal of a human being, of a living being. So, when a devotee becomes attracted by Krishna and begins to render devotional service, automatically such a devotee loses interest in Dharma, Artha, Karma, Moksha. Those four Purusharthas don't interest the devotee anymore. Completely, the devotee rises above these four Purusharthas. Now, the next set of meanings that Lord Chaitanya explains. The word Brahma indicates the Samambonam, the absolute truth, which is greater than all other truths. In this material world, whatever we know as truth is called relative truth. And Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the absolute truth. What is absolute truth? Absolute truth is truth in all phases of time, under all circumstances, in all conditions. Whereas relative truth is not truth in all phases of time. It is the original identity, Brahma means the original identity, and there can be nothing equal to that absolute truth. So, there is a definition of this absolute truth as Brahma in the Vishnu Purana. It is stated there, I offer my respectful obeisances to the absolute truth, the Samambonam. He is the all-pervasive, all-increasing subject matter for the great yogis. He is changeless, and he is the soul of all, the soul of all souls, the super soul, the supreme soul. Actually, the proper meaning of the word Brahma is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is one without a second, and without whom nothing else exists.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Through all these changes, the changeless reality is Krishna, the Supreme Lord. Only He remains unchanged."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to establish Krishna as the absolute truth, emphasizing His eternality and unchanging nature in contrast to the constantly changing material world and the bodies of living entities.

This is substantiated in so many different parts of the Vedic literature. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is quoting one verse, That absolute truth without a second is Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the Supreme Truth in the past, present and future. That is the evidence of all revealed scriptures. In the Bhagavatam it is stated, Prior to the cosmic creation, only I exist and no phenomena exist, either gross or subtle or primordial. Why do we say Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead? Because Krishna existed as Krishna before the creation even began. Krishna remains through the creation as Krishna. And after the creation, everything is annihilated in this material world. Krishna remains as Krishna. Therefore, Krishna is the Absolute Truth in all phases of time, in all conditions of existence. After creation only, I exist in everything. And after annihilation only, I remain eternally. What about the created beings? Aren't they the same? Aren't they also existing after the creation, through the creation? They exist not in the different bodily forms, not in the different types of material bodies they accept. No. Those are all temporarily given to them according to their desires for enjoyment, according to their karma, according to their association with the gunas, so many things. They keep on changing, changing, changing. Through all these changes, the changeless reality is Krishna, the Supreme Lord. Only He remains unchanged. The living entities are accepting different bodies. Material nature is constantly undergoing change. It is called Shara, constantly changing. And the living entities are simply bewildered by the material influence of the three modes, continuously changing. Whereas Krishna is the unchanging, constant, eternal reality through all these changes

**Key Quote:** "The absolute truth is the same, but according to the process by which one understands Him, He appears in three forms, as Brahman, Paramatman and Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by defining Atma and Hari as Krishna, and explaining the three paths to attain Krishna: philosophical speculation (jnana), mystic yoga, and devotional service (bhakti), and how the absolute truth is realized differently through each path as Brahman, Paramatma, and Bhagavan.

in the material world. The word Atma indicates the highest truth, Krishna. He is the all-pervasive witness of all and He is the Supreme form. Now the word Brahma indicates the supreme absolute truth and the highest understanding of that truth is Krishna. The word Atma also indicates the highest truth, Krishna, who is all-pervasive witness of everything and He is the Supreme form. And Hari, the word Hari, indicating the personality of Godhead, is the all-pervasive original source of everything. He is therefore the super-soul of everything. Now Chaitanya Mahaprabhu explains there are three ways to attain the lotus feet of the absolute truth, Krishna. There is a process of philosophical speculation, the jnana marga. There is the practice of mystic yoga, that is the ashtanga yoga system. And there is the process of bhakti, the execution of devotional service. Each of these have different characteristics. Now Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says the absolute truth is the same, but according to the process by which one understands Him, He appears in three forms, as Brahman, Paramatman and Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I will stop here. We will discuss more in the next session.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna attracts everyone because he has got unlimited transcendental qualities."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the Atmarama verse and discusses how Krishna's transcendental qualities attract even liberated souls, purifying and enlightening those who engage in devotional service.

In this session, we continue discussing the same verse, the 10th verse of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, the famous Atmarama verse. Suta Vacha Atmaramas Chamunayo Nirgrantha Apyurukrame Kurvanti Ahitu Keem Bhaktim Ittham Bhuta Gunoharihi All different varieties of Atmaramas, especially those established on the path of self-realization, though freed from all kinds of material bondage, render unalloyed devotional service to the personality of Godhead. This means that the Lord possesses transcendental qualities and therefore can attract everyone, including liberated souls. So Krishna attracts everyone because he has got unlimited transcendental qualities. Continuing the discussion from the previous session, in the previous session we heard how Krishna actually purifies anybody who takes to devotional service. So they become free from all sinful reactions, and all their impediments are removed and they are enlightened, and they become attracted to the transcendental form of Krishna, transcendental features of Krishna, transcendental qualities of Krishna, and they become pure devotees, completely dedicated, and they become a creator for Krishna's service.

**Key Quote:** "But through devotional service one realizes Krishna, the personality of Godhead Bhagavan."
**Summary:** The lecture explains the three processes of realizing the Absolute Truth: philosophical speculation (Brahman), mystic yoga (Paramatma), and devotional service (Bhagavan), emphasizing that devotional service leads to the highest realization.

Now, Krishna is realized through three processes, the Absolute Truth. Krishna means the Absolute Truth is realized through three processes: the process of philosophical speculation, the process of performing Ashtanga, you call it a mystic yoga process, and the process of devotional service. So Lord Chaitanya has learned this. So Lord Chaitanya is now explaining, although the words Brahma and Aatma indicate Krishna, their direct meanings refer only to the impersonal Brahma and the super soul respectively. Brahma means impersonal Brahman. Atma means the super-soul in the heart of every living being. So why the distinction is being made now is, because if one follows the path of philosophical speculation, Gyanamarga, the Absolute Truth manifests Himself as impersonal Brahman. That means through the Jnana Marga one cannot realize Krishna simply by following the Jnana Marga. The topmost possible realization of the Absolute Truth through Jnana Marga is only the impersonal Brahman. If one follows the path of Mystic Yoga, Ashtanga Yoga system, he manifests himself as a Supersoul. So through Ashtanga Yoga only the Paramatma can be realized, only the Paramatma. But through devotional service one realizes Krishna, the personality of Godhead Bhagavan. In the Bhagavatam it is explained there are three features: the Absolute Truth, the impersonal Brahman, the localized Paramatma or the Supersoul, and ultimately the personality of Godhead Bhagavan. So among these three features, realization of Bhagavan, the personality of Godhead is the highest realization and that includes the other two realizations of Brahman and Paramatma.

**Key Quote:** "By spontaneous devotional service one attains the original personality of Godhead Krishna and by the Regulative process one attains the expansion of the Supreme personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between spontaneous and regulative devotional service, highlighting that spontaneous devotion in Vrindavan leads to Krishna, while regulative practice leads to expansions of the Supreme Lord.

So now Lord Chaitanya explains there are two kinds of devotional activity: spontaneous and regulative. By spontaneous devotional service one attains the original personality of Godhead Krishna and by the regulative process one attains the expansion of the Supreme personality of Godhead. Krishna is present as Krishna and Krishna is also present in his various forms as Narayana, Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Narasimha, Vamana etc. etc. So many other forms. All are Krishna only, the same Supreme person. But there are still some differences. So Lord Chaitanya says by executing spontaneous devotional service in Vrindavan one attains the original Supreme personality of Godhead Krishna. The nature of devotional service in Vrindavan is that it is spontaneous. Spontaneous means they don't have to follow the rules and regulations. They have somehow attraction for Krishna to a degree that they only think of Krishna all the time. Their heart is completely filled with thoughts of Krishna. Their mind is absorbed in Krishna. They have become mad after Krishna, almost like mad people. They are not mad. They are very intelligent. They are very conscientious. But they are so much absorbed in thought of Krishna. So that is spontaneous devotional service in Vrindavan.

**Key Quote:** "The Supreme personality of Godhead Krishna the son of Mother Yashoda is accessible to those devotees engaged in spontaneous loving service."
**Summary:** The lecture quotes Shukadeva Goswami, emphasizing that Krishna is most accessible through spontaneous loving service, not through mental speculation or austerities.

And Lord Chaitanya quotes a verse from the Bhagavatam. This verse is spoken by Shukadeva Goswami. Shukadeva Goswami tells Pariksit Maharaj after describing one past time of Krishna being bound to Krishna, Krishna being bound by the rope of Mother Yashoda. Krishna submits himself to his devotee Mother Yashoda. So Shukadeva Goswami says the Supreme personality of Godhead Krishna the son of Mother Yashoda is accessible to those devotees engaged in spontaneous loving service, but he is not as easily accessible to mental speculators, to those striving for self-realization by severe austerities, or to those who consider the body the same as the self. So other processes other than spontaneous devotional service cannot help one realize Krishna the Supreme personality of Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "By executing regulative devotional service one becomes an associate of Narayana and attains the Vaikunthalokas, the spiritual planets and the spiritual sky."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that regulative devotional service leads to association with Narayana and attainment of the Vaikuntha planets, while spontaneous devotion is characterized by tears, jubilation, and inherent spiritual qualities.

Now what about regulative devotional service? Regulative devotional service is following the rules and regulations of Bhakti very strictly. By executing regulative devotional service one becomes an associate of Narayana and attains the Vaikunthalokas, the spiritual planets and the spiritual sky. There are two kinds of spiritual planets: One is Goloka Vrindavana, Krishna's personal abode, and the other set of spiritual planets, are the Vaikunthalokas, where the Supreme Lord as Narayana is the predominator, is the Lord of Vaikuntha, Vaikunthapati. Now the explanation further about spontaneous devotional service. Those who discuss the activities of Lord Krishna are on the highest platform of devotional life, and they evince the symptoms of tears in the eyes and bodily jubilation. Very naturally they experience bhava, spiritual emotions. Such persons discharge devotional service to Krishna without practicing the rules and regulations of the mystic yoga system. You see, they possess all spiritual qualities. This is spoken by Brahma, and they are elevated to the spiritual world beyond the material world.

### devotee categories, desire, bhakti yoga, independence of devotional service

**Verse References:** BG 7.16
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Devotional service, however, is so strong and independent that it can give one all the desired results."
**Summary:** The lecture categorizes devotees based on their desires (desireless, liberation-seeking, materially desiring) and emphasizes that even with ulterior motives, devotional service is powerful enough to grant all desired results.

Now, among devotees, Chaitanya explains, Lord Chaitanya explains, the devotees are divided into three categories: Akama, those who are desireless, means they don't have any material desires. Then there are some who are moksha kama, those who desire liberation, and sarva kama, those who have desire, material perfection. So it is said in the Bhagavatam, one who is actually intelligent, although he may be a devotee free from material desires, a karmi desiring all kinds of material facilities, or a jnani desiring liberation, should seriously engage in bhakti yoga for the satisfaction of supreme peace. That is what the Indian personality has called it. So the meaning of the word udaradhi is buddhiman, intelligent or considerate. Because of this, even for one's own sense gratification, one engages in the devotional service of Lord Krishna. Actually, devotional service is meant for giving us bhakti. Let us say somebody takes to devotional service but their goal is not bhakti. Their goal is some material gain or their goal is liberation. Then what happens? Something very, very interesting happens. The other processes of self-realization cannot yield results unless they are associated with devotional service. Devotional service, however, is so strong and independent that it can give one

### devotional service, Dhruva Maharaj, Krishna's kindness, detachment

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is so kind that when a devotee foolishly desires some material gain, Krishna gives himself to the devotee and he attracts the devotee so very much."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the story of Dhruva Maharaj to illustrate how Krishna, out of kindness, attracts devotees even when they initially desire material gains, ultimately leading them to detachment and pure devotion.

all the desired results. So this is substantiated in the Bhagavad Gita where Krishna says, O best among the Bharatas, Arjuna, four kinds of pious people render devotional service unto me, the distressed, the desirer of wealth, and he who is searching for the knowledge of the Absolute. Now, there is an example of somebody who desires money or wealth and takes to devotional service. Dhruva Maharaj is an example. What happened? He desired to have a kingdom greater than his father's and he was directed by his mother, you worship Vishnu. So he began to worship Vishnu. When merciful Lord Krishna understands that a foolish devotee desires material prosperity, he gratefully gives him shelter of his lotus feet. In this way, he can fend off all his ambitions. That's what happened to Dhruva Maharaj. It is said that Dhruva Maharaj has become a Bhikkhus and has begun to worship Supreme Lord Krishna. That's what happened to Dhruva Maharaj. He began to worship Supreme Lord Vishnu and Vishnu gave him darshan. Now when Vishnu gave darshan, Dhruva thought, I am doing all these austerities to ask from the Lord for what, a kingdom in this material world, that he compared to a piece of broken glass. He is looking for a piece of broken glass, foolishly, by doing devotional service, worshipping Vishnu. But when Vishnu appeared and gave him darshan, then he thought after seeing Vishnu, when I have got diamonds, why will I be interested in a piece of broken glass? So, Dhruva Maharaj told Vishnu, when Vishnu said, yes, what is the boon you want from me? So, Dhruva Maharaj said, when I obtained you, my dear Lord, I am not interested in asking any other benediction from you, I don't want any other benediction. It is like a person who has got diamonds. Why will he be interested? So, Krishna is so kind that when a devotee foolishly desires some material gain, Krishna gives himself to the devotee and he attracts the devotee so very much. The devotee completely forgets or considers the divine insignificant any other material gain that he might have been interested in before he began Bhakti. So this is Krishna's way of attracting a devotee who may not know the real goal of Bhakti but still nevertheless renders devotional service to Krishna even with a desire for some material gain.

**Key Quote:** "Even though those who begin devotional service with a material motive are considered to be engaged in mixed devotional service, but gradually they give up all material desires and they are elevated to the platform of pure devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how individuals with pious backgrounds and even those with material motives can gradually purify themselves and attain pure devotional service through the mercy of the Vaishnavas and Krishna.

We continue the discussion. This is a discussion from the previous session on the same verse, Atmarama verse. I will directly go to the other meanings or explanations of the Atmarama verse. It was described in the previous session that four kinds of pious people begin to render devotional service to Krishna because they have a pious background. They are apt to be devoted to Krishna. They are apt to surrender to Krishna. So Lord Chaitanya explains, because they have a pious background, all four types of people are to be considered greatly fortunate. Such people gradually give up material desires and become pure devotees. How does it work? Lord Chaitanya says, one is elevated to the platform of devotional life by the mercy of the Vaishnava, the bona fide spiritual master, and by the special mercy of Krishna. On that platform, one wants to give up all material desires and one gives up the association of unwanted people also. Thus one is elevated to the platform of pure devotional service. Okay. Even though those who begin devotional service with a material motive are considered to be engaged in mixed devotional service, but gradually they give up all material desires, they give up unwanted association and they are elevated to the platform of pure devotional service.

**Key Quote:** "When merciful Lord Krishna understands that a foolish devotee desires material prosperity, he gratefully gives him shelter off his lotus feet."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna, unlike devatas, considers the devotee's ultimate benefit and may not grant material desires if they are detrimental, instead offering shelter at His lotus feet to purify the devotee.

What happens to the platform of pure devotional service? When they come to the platform of pure devotional service, something very wonderful happens. When merciful Lord Krishna understands that a foolish devotee desires material prosperity, he gratefully gives him shelter off his lotus feet. In this way, the Lord covers the devotee's undesirable ambitions. See, another characteristic of Krishna. Whenever Krishna is in a position to fulfill one's desire, he undoubtedly does so, but he does not avoid anything which after being enjoyed will cause one to petition him again and again to fulfill further desires. Sometimes people ask, what is the difference between worshipping a devata for some material benefit and worshipping Krishna for the same material benefit? There is a world of difference. There is a big, big difference. That is what is being said here. If somebody worships a devata for some material benefit, if it is according to scriptural direction he is doing it, then the devata will award the particular benefit without any consideration whether it is good for the person whom he is awarding or not good. Devata will simply award it. That's all. According to, strictly the laws of material nature as stated in the scriptures. Now, when Krishna is worshipped by a devotee, by somebody who wants material benefit, then Krishna considers whether the benediction that he is asking from me, whether it is good for the devotee or not. Krishna has that consideration. If it is not good, Krishna will not award him that particular material benefit. Instead, Krishna purifies that devotee. So, it is said here, when one has other desires other than bhakti, but at the same time such a person engages in Krishna's service, Krishna forcibly gives one shelter at his lotus feet, where one will forget all other desires.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna forcibly gives shelter to such a devotee at his lotus feet. And that will make the devotee forget about all material nonsense, all material benefits."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of asking for poison, the speaker contrasts Krishna's protective kindness with the devatas' willingness to grant material desires, which ultimately lead to further entanglement in the material world.

See, this is Krishna's special mercy. Krishna is so very kind. I am foolishly going and asking Krishna, give me some poison. Actually, what should I be asking from Krishna? Nectar. But I do not know. Poison is actually not good for me. I think poison is something very nice. I am mistaken. Poison is like nectar. So, Krishna, will he simply give poison because you are asking for poison? No, never. What about devatas? You go and ask devata some poison. Will devata give? Yeah, he will give. He never refuses. When you are within the, you are following the scriptural injunctions and it is given the shastras, this devata can avoid this material benefit, some other devata can avoid some other material benefit. These material benefits are simply entangling the person more and more and more. The very cause of all our miseries is material existence, entanglement in material existence. And foolish people, what do they do? They think that if we worship some devata and gets more material benefit, oh, we can become free from all problems. What they don't realize is material benefits are of the nature that they further entangle you to make you suffer more and more and more and more material miseries. Neither the devatas will refuse you some material benefit that you may ask if you follow all the rules, nor you yourself can realize that I am becoming more and more entangled. I am not getting free from this entanglement. I am not able to put an end to my miseries in this material world. Whereas, when somebody worships Krishna and goes and asks for some material benefit, Krishna will forcibly give shelter to such a devotee at his lotus feet, and that will make the devotee forget about all material nonsense, all material benefits. Forget about it. And he becomes... What happens?

**Key Quote:** "Such a devotee actually becomes elevated to Krishna Consciousness and he will only want Bhakti and nothing else."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that by worshipping Krishna and receiving shelter at His lotus feet, a devotee forgets material desires and becomes elevated to Krishna Consciousness, desiring only bhakti. He then introduces the concept of Gyanam Arga and two kinds of worshippers.

Such a devotee actually becomes elevated to Krishna Consciousness and he will only want Bhakti and nothing else. The nectar, nectar of devotion. Bhakti, Rasa, Amrita. Now, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu begins to explain that those who are following the Gyanam Arga, if they come in contact with a pure devotee or some or the other take to devotional, pure devotional service, then they give up their desire for liberation, they give up their desire for any material gain, and they simply become interested in pure devotional service. So, Lord Chaitanya explains, there are two kinds of worshippers on the path of philosophical speculation. One is called a Brahma Upasaka, a worshipper of the impersonal Brahman, and the other is called Moksha Kamshi or one who desires liberation. Two kinds of people on the Gyanam Arga.

**Key Quote:** "When one actually begins devotional service, even for the sake of attaining some Brahman realization, still, one in devotional service is attracted away from the impersonal Brahman."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the three types of worshippers of the impersonal Brahman and explains that even those who begin devotional service with the aim of Brahman realization are ultimately drawn away from it and awarded a transcendental body to serve Krishna directly.

Two kinds of worshippers. Now, among the worshippers of the impersonal Brahman, there are three types of people: the beginner, the one whose thoughts are absorbed in Brahman, and the one who has actually attained liberation by merging into impersonal Brahman. So, three kinds of people who are worshippers of impersonal Brahman. Now, without a tinge of devotional service, simply by following the path of philosophical speculation, one cannot attain the Brahman platform. One cannot be elevated to transcendence, not possible. So, when one actually begins devotional service, even for the sake of attaining some Brahman realization, still, one in devotional service is attracted away from the impersonal Brahman. Such a person is awarded a transcendental body to engage in Lord Krishna's service directly. See what happens with devotional service. When a devotee gets a spiritual body, he can remember the transcendental qualities of Krishna simply by being attracted to Krishna's transcendental qualities. Ittham bhuta guno hari. Krishna is full of transcendental qualities. Any one quality the devotee gets attracted, he becomes a pure devotee engaged directly in devotional service to Krishna. He starts off as an impersonalist worshipping the impersonal Brahman, but then to attain success in that worship, he has to mix some devotional service. So, when he begins to do some devotional service, then all these things happen. He is taken away from the goal of impersonal Brahman and is awarded a spiritual body. In spiritual body, he becomes aware of Krishna's transcendental qualities and gets attracted and becomes a pure devotee directly engaged in Krishna's service.

**Key Quote:** "Even a liberated soul merged in the impersonal Brahman is attracted to the pastimes of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes a statement that even liberated souls are attracted to Krishna's pastimes and emphasizes the importance of hearing about Krishna from pure devotees to experience a revolution in the heart.

So, there is a quotation that supports this particular explanation by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. This quotation is that even a liberated soul merged in the impersonal Brahman is attracted to the pastimes of Krishna. He thus installs a Deity and renders the Lord devotional service. See, the situation of being merged in the impersonal Brahman is very very dull, very unattractive after the initial excitement that is there in the beginning. So, then such a person, it is said, if he is fortunate to hear about the pastimes of Krishna from a pure devotee, then he becomes attracted to the pastimes of Krishna. Krishna's pastimes are supremely attractive to everyone, but one has to hear that from the right source. Then the attraction is very very much powerful and one becomes a pure devotee. Then what about those engaged in mystic yoga practice? The example is given of the Navayogendras. From their very births, the nine great mystic yogis, Navayogendras, were impersonal philosophers of the absolute truth. They knew the absolute truth only as impersonal Brahman. They did not know about the personality of God. But because they heard about Lord Krishna's qualities from Lord Brahma, Lord Shiva and the great sage Narada, all the three are great devotees. Brahma is a great devotee, Shiva is a great devotee, Narada is a great devotee. So, these Navayogendras, they heard about Krishna's qualities from these three great devotees. They also became Krishna's devotees. See, association with devotees in which they hear about Krishna's transcendental qualities. Anything one hears about Krishna from the pure devotees is going to bring about a revolution in the heart.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of the Navayogendras, who were initially impersonal philosophers, to illustrate how hearing about Krishna's qualities from great devotees like Brahma, Shiva, and Narada led them to become devotees of Krishna and seek His association.

So, that is being explained here. In the 11th canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, there is a full chapter, there is a full description of the devotional service of the nine yogendras, Navayogendras, who rendered devotional service because they were attracted by the Lord's transcendental qualities. These Navayogendras, when they heard about Krishna's transcendental qualities from Brahma, Shiva and Narada, even though they were situated in understanding of the Vedic knowledge, understanding of the impersonal Brahman from Vedas, they became attracted to Krishna and they wanted to enter Dwaraka. In this way, they finally ended up in the place known as Rangakshetra, Sri Rangam. They ended up that place. So, I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Among the transcendentalists, there are three different categories of transcendentalists according to the process of transcendental realization they may accept."
**Summary:** Lord Chaitanya explains the Atmarama verse and categorizes transcendentalists based on their chosen path: Jnana Marga, Ashtanga Yoga, and Bhakti Yoga.

We are continuing to describe the Atmarama words as explained by Lord Chaitanya to Srila Sanatan Goswami. This Atmarama word says that all different varieties of Atmarama, all different varieties of self-satisfied personalities, even though they are freed from material bondage, they engage in pure devotional service to Krishna because Krishna is full of transcendental qualities which are very, very attractive. Among the transcendentalists, there are three different categories of transcendentalists according to the process of transcendental realization they may accept. So this was mentioned in the previous session. Those who follow the Jnana Marga, the path of philosophical speculation, they are actually one category of transcendentalists, who desire liberation by merging into the impersonal Brahman. Then the second category of transcendentalists are those who follow the path of mystic yoga, Ashtanga yoga, meditation, and they desire to realize the absolute truth as Paramatma, because they meditate on the form of the Lord, Paramatma in the heart. And the third category of transcendentalists are the devotees, or those who follow bhakti yoga, devotional service, and they directly engage in devotional service to Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Bhagavan feature of the absolute truth.

**Key Quote:** "Because without a devotional service, one cannot get liberation ultimately."
**Summary:** Lord Chaitanya describes how even those desiring liberation engage in devotional service to Krishna, and how association with devotees can lead one to give up the desire for impersonal liberation.

So now Lord Chaitanya is describing the first category of transcendentalists, those who wish to merge into the impersonal, are also divided into three further subcategories: Those desiring to be liberated, those who are already liberated, and those who have realized Brahman. Now Lord Chaitanya further says, there are many people within this material world who desire liberation, and for this purpose, they render devotional service to Krishna. Why is it that those who desire liberation render devotional service to Krishna? Because without devotional service, one cannot get liberation ultimately. So in the Bhagavatam it is explained, those who want to be relieved from the reality, who want to be relieved from the clutches of the material energy, they give up worship of the various devatas, demigods. These demigods have fearful bodily features, ghorarupam, such peaceful devotees who are not envious of the demigods, worship the different forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana. Again it is said, there may be some people who are attached to demigod worship, but if such people associate fortunately with the devotees of the Supreme Lord, then their dormant devotional service and appreciation of the Lord's qualities gradually awakens within their hearts. In this way, they also engage in Krishna's devotional service and give up their desire for liberation and also give up the desire to merge into the existence of the impersonal Brahman. So the association of devotees is a very, very powerful factor for people to understand

**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the power of association with devotees, citing the example of Saunaka Rishi giving up the desire for liberation after associating with Narada Muni and engaging in Krishna's devotional service.

the greatness of bhakti. Now the association of devotees is particularly praised in many scriptures. One such scriptural quotation is cited by Lord Chaitanya. This scriptural quotation says, Although there are many faults in this material world, there is one good opportunity. What is that? The association with devotees. Such association brings about great happiness. Due to this good quality, our strong desire to achieve liberation by merging into the Brahman effulgence has become weakened. What happens is somebody has got a desire to attain liberation by merging into the impersonal Brahman, but they associate with devotees and experience in devotional association a different quality of spiritual happiness due to devotional service. Then they give up this desire for liberation because that happiness of devotional service is so much greater and so much a satisfaction and so much nicer that automatically they lose interest in liberation. Now here is another example given by Lord Chaitanya. By associating with the great saint Narada, Saunaka and other great sages gave up the desire for liberation and engaged in Krishna's devotional service. This Saunaka Rishi, was the leader of some great sages who assembled in a holy place called Naimisharanya in order to engage in a thousand year sacrifice. Now in the beginning, their aim was liberation. But after association with the great saint Narada, who was himself a great devotee, these Saunaka Rishis, they gave up the desire for liberation

and became engaged in Krishna's devotional service. Another instance is being mentioned by Lord Chaitanya here. Simply by meeting Krishna or receiving Krishna's special favour, one can give up the desire for liberation. How does that happen? Being attracted by the transcendental qualities of Krishna, one can engage in Krishna's service. Krishna's service should not be mistaken to be something like service rendered to another person in this material world. In material world, service means it is something not so very desirable, but is something which is unavoidable. Just like people render service to get some money, to get some material benefit, to get some favour, to learn something new. So, so many different reasons in this material world, people are engaged in service of another person. But serving Krishna is never to be mistaken like service rendered to another person in the material world. Krishna's service is something which is very, very pleasing to the heart. It is natural. It is due to the strong attraction by Krishna's transcendental qualities which are innumerable. And therefore, Krishna is able to attract different categories of persons who may have attraction for different transcendental qualities of Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "I have wasted so much time trying to become self-realized through impersonal cultivation."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the experience of someone visiting Dwaraka Dham and being overwhelmed by Krishna's bliss, realizing the futility of impersonal Brahman realization and its inherent difficulties.

This is an instance of somebody who happened to visit Dwaraka Dham, where Krishna was ruling as the king of Dwaraka, Dwaraka Disha. So this personality is describing his experience. In this Dwaraka Dham, I am being attracted by the supreme personality of God, Krishna, who is personified spiritual bliss. See, Krishna is no ordinary person. Krishna is the Supreme Lord who is full of transcendental bliss, spiritual bliss, ānanda-maya. The Vedanta Sutra says, ānanda-mayo abhyāsāt. Krishna is full of ānanda. And simply by seeing Krishna, one can feel that great happiness which is characteristic of Krishna's personality. Simply by seeing him. It's so pleasing to the senses, to the mind, to the heart, seeing Krishna. Then this devotee, this personality who is feeling great happiness by simply seeing Krishna in Dwaraka Dham, he began to think, I have wasted so much time trying to become self-realized through impersonal cultivation. Before one comes to know what is the real nature of Krishna's personality, one may be engaged in Brahman realization, impersonal Brahman realization. But that is so tedious. In the 12th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains, kleśo adhikatarasteśāṁ avyaktāsaktaśetasām. Avyaktā is the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth, the impersonal Brahman. And those who are not having knowledge of Krishna, they engage in such a... meditation or worship or cultivation of knowledge of impersonal Brahman. And that is very, very tedious. kleśo adhikatarasteśāṁ avyaktāsaktaśetasām It is very, very tedious. It is filled with so many difficulties. So therefore this personality in Dwaraka Dham, after just seeing Krishna's beautiful, pleasing, form, transcendental form, became so much filled with happiness, that thought, why was I wasting time trying to become self-realized through impersonal Brahman method?

So like this, different varieties of personalities, even though they may be engaged in self-realization, through other methods than bhakti, they somehow or the other, by contact with a pure devotee, by contacting Krishna, by associating with devotees, by mercy of Krishna, so many different ways, they become attracted to Krishna and they naturally engage in Krishna's service, to reach the perfection of devotion.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the concept of Atmaramas and explains that even those liberated through other processes cannot sustain liberation without devotional service due to the soul's inherent need for activity, which finds its perfect expression in service to Krishna.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet In this session also, we will continue the discussion of the Atmarama verse. Different varieties of Atmaramas, they get attracted to Krishna, they begin to render devotional service, and they achieve the perfection of devotional service. Now, the important point here is that even though somebody may be liberated by some other process other than devotional service, they cannot sustain themselves in liberation without engaging in devotional service. The nature of the soul is to be always active. The soul cannot be without activity. Though somebody may try to be inactive for some time, very soon that person who is inactive is forced to begin activity. So, the explanation is given here by Lord Chaitanya: those who are liberated by devotional service become more and more attracted by the transcendental qualities of Krishna and engage in his service. Bhakti means devotional service. Prabhupāda did not translate bhakti as devotion. He translates bhakti as devotional service, indicating that bhakti means activity, but not ordinary activity, not material activity. It is completely spiritual activity. What kind of spiritual activity is it? It is service to Kṛṣṇa, serving Kṛṣṇa, and that is

not the same as material service rendered to some material person in this world, no. Now, Lord Caitanya is telling, those who are liberated by the speculative process, philosophical speculation, jñānāmārtha, eventually fall down again due to offensive activities like Sne properties. Now there is a statement in the Srimad Bhagavatam which says this, how those who are not engaged in devotional service of Krishna, even though they are liberated, they fall down. They don't sustain their existence on the liberated platform. So what is that statement in the Bhagavatam? O Lotus-eyed one, this is a prayer offered by the Devatas to Krishna when he was in the womb of Mother Devaki, and the Devatas were offering wonderful prayers to Krishna in the womb of Devaki, Garbhastuti, it's called, 10th canto, 2nd chapter. So there it is said by the Devatas, O Lotus-eyed one, they are addressing the Supreme Lord Krishna. Those who think they are liberated in this life but are without devotional service to you are of impure intelligence. Although they accept severe austerities and penances and rise to the spiritual position, to impersonal Brahman realization, they fall down again because they neglect to worship your lotus feet. There has to be some engagement after liberation. If there is no engagement after liberation, due to inactivity, one becomes very much disturbed in the mind. And eventually, such a person, without taking shelter of Krishna's lotus feet, cannot engage in the spiritual process. This is the statement in the Bhagavatam. One cannot engage in spiritual activity. So what does the person do?

The person will come down to material activity and that's called a fall down. Now, in the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna explains what is the position of a person who is transcendentally situated on the Brahman platform. What is the actual position? Krishna says, One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. Brahma bhuta prasamna atma He never laments or desires to have anything. He is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state, he attains pure devotional service unto me. This is a progressive transcendentalist who comes to the Brahman platform and then is able to experience freedom from lamentation and hankering and is able to see with spiritual vision equality of law and living beings even though they may be situated in different bodies. They are ultimately spiritual beings. Such a person, such a person becomes completely joyful and realizes the Supreme Brahman. Brahman realization may also mean that I am of the same quality as the Absolute Truth. I am also Brahman. Aham Brahmasmi. But when one is factually situated on the transcendental platform through gradual elevation through spiritual processes, when one actually comes to the transcendental platform, one is able to realize the Supreme Brahman distinctly, the Lord different from the individual soul, the Supreme Personality of God. And in that state one attains pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord. One becomes a devotee.

**Key Quote:** "We are originally Krishna conscious beings...Material existence means fear."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses attaining one's constitutional position as a Krishna conscious being through devotional service, leading to a transcendental body and liberation from material bondage, contrasting this with the fear inherent in material existence under the influence of maya.

And what happens? One who has attained his constitutional position by strength of devotional service, what is his constitutional position? We are originally Krishna conscious beings. So that is called our constitutional position. And by strength of devotional service one is able to attain a transcendental body even in this lifetime. Jeevan Mukta. Liberated from material bondage and attains a transcendental form. What is a transcendental form? That is actually our original spiritual form which is actually covered presently by this material body and mind, material mind. So by elevating to the spiritual platform through devotional service one attains a transcendental body. And being attracted by Lord Krishna's transcendental qualities one fully engages in service at his lotus feet. Krishna's lotus feet is the ultimate shelter for everyone. Krishna accommodates everybody. But to aim at the lotus feet of Krishna is possible only by engaging properly in devotional service to Krishna. Then further Bhagavatam explains the position of a person in this material world who opposes Krishna consciousness, due to this material influence one becomes conditioned and fearful due to the influence of maya. Material existence means influence of maya, the material energy. And that influence is such that one becomes fearful. Material existence means fear. Bhayam. It is a concomitant factor of material existence. That means in the material existence under the influence of maya one cannot avoid fear.

**Key Quote:** "Indeed there is no other way to get factual liberation from maya other than executing faithfully bhakti yoga devotional service to Krishna...those who have surrendered unto me...They can easily cross beyond the influence of this material energy."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that liberation from maya is only possible through devotional service to Krishna, quoting the Bhagavad Gita to illustrate that surrendering to Krishna allows one to overcome the influence of material energy.

People sometimes they say I am fearless. I am bold. But that is all under the illusion that I am safe or I am powerful. I am happy. I have got good protection against all dangers etc. But all these are a temporary position. It is a temporary position because maya is constantly changing. Adibhutam charo bhavah. And in this changing situation suddenly some material calamity, natural calamity may afflict a person who is otherwise thinking I am very safe. Or suddenly some enemy may attack. Suddenly something may happen which can change our situation. A person has a heart attack and completely becomes fearful. Now what is to be done? So by executing devotional service faithfully one is liberated from maya. Indeed there is no other way to get factual liberation from maya other than executing faithfully bhakti yoga, devotional service to Krishna. Krishna also says in the Bhagavad Gita in the seventh chapter fourteenth verse he says this divine energy of mind consisting of the three material modes of nature, three guna sarto guna, rajo guna, tamo guna, they are the components of the influence of the material energy called maya which influences us in such a way that we cannot overcome the material influence by our own strength, by our own endeavor, not possible. daivi he sha gunamayi mamamaya duratyaya But Krishna also says those who have surrendered unto me mam eva ye prapadyante maya metam tarantite They can easily cross beyond the influence of this material energy.

### liberation, devotional service, speculative knowledge, lotus feet of Krishna

**Key Quote:** "Liberation is possible only by devotional service...devotional service unto the Supreme Lord is the only auspicious path...Real liberation is taking shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna and being fixed in devotional service to him."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that true liberation is only attainable through devotional service to Krishna, contrasting it with the fruitless endeavors of speculative knowledge and emphasizing the importance of taking shelter of Krishna's lotus feet.

So the conclusion of all these statements is that one cannot attain liberation without rendering devotional service. Liberation is possible only by devotional service. Technically somebody may think I am liberated by merging into impersonal Brahman or technically somebody may think I am liberated by meditating on Paramatma but factual liberation, real liberation, complete liberation, perfect liberation is possible only by becoming fixed up in devotional service. So there is a statement like that in the Bhagavatam also which says devotional service unto the Supreme Lord is the only auspicious path. If one gives it up simply for speculative knowledge or the understanding that these living beings are spirit souls and the material world is false then such a person undergoes a great deal of trouble. He only gains troublesome and inauspicious actions. His actions are like beating a husk that is already devoid of grain. His labor becomes fruitless. This is a statement by Lord Brahma when he offers prayers to the Supreme Lord Krishna. Somebody may think this material world is false. We have nothing to do with this material world and engages in cultivation of knowledge through spirit. We engage in cultivation of knowledge through speculation. And through this method they may think I have become liberated because I have realized I am Brahman and I have merged myself into the existence of Brahman as the Absolute Truth. So such people they are actually simply undergoing so much of difficulty due to severe austerities. They do not get real liberation by such a process. Real liberation is described in that term, taking shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna and being fixed in devotional service to him. That is real liberation. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "So Narada Muni told this hunter, can I beg from you one thing?"
**Summary:** Narada Muni encounters a cruel hunter, Mrigari, and begins to instruct him on the consequences of his actions, specifically the unnecessary pain he inflicts on animals.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udhirayet. In this session also we will continue discussion of the Atmarama verse. Lord Chaitanya tells a very nice story of how a hunter, cruel hunter, a very, very uncivilized person, how he became a great devotee by the association of Srila Narada Muni, the greatest devotee of the Lord. Once upon a time, the great saint Narada, after visiting Lord Narayana in the Vaikuntha, went to Prayag. Prayag is that holy place, Allahabad, where there is a sangam, a confluence of three rivers, Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati. And it's a very, very holy place. And he saw a deer which was lying on the path through the forest, and this deer was pierced with an arrow. It had broken legs, and it was crying out of pain. That arrow had pierced its body, and it was crying out of pain. He went a little ahead and saw another boar which was pierced. It was pierced by a similar arrow. Its legs were also broken. It was also crying out in pain. And further he went, saw a rabbit also, same way it was suffering. With the arrow pierced, legs are broken, it is crying in pain. So Narada Muni, he was pained to see at heart. All these living. All these living beings are suffering so much. Then he saw a hunter hiding behind one tree. He was having so many arrows. And he was ready to kill more animals. This hunter was having a black complexion, a dark complexion. He had reddish eyes. And he appeared very, very fierce. He was like the superintendent of death. He was like the superintendent of death. Yamarath standing there with bow and arrows in his hands to kill so many more animals. Now Narada Muni, he left the path which was there in the forest. And he went to the hunter who was hiding behind a tree to kill more animals. And as soon as Narada Muni approached the hunter, so many animals, they started running away. The hunter, he wanted to chastise Narada Muni with abusive language, that you spoiled my whole arrangement for killing animals. But when Narada Muni came closer to the hunter, due to Narada Muni's divine association or divine presence, that hunter restrained his tongue and did not abuse Narada Muni. He said, oh great saintly person, why are you leaving the general path and you are approaching me in this forest? Simply by seeing you, all the animals I was hunting have now run away. You have disturbed my occupation. So Narada Muni replied to this hunter, I have come to you to clear one doubt that is there in my mind. So Narada Muni asked that hunter, those animals which are half killed, three animals I saw. I saw a deer, I saw a boar, I saw a rabbit. Were you the one who actually shot those arrows and half killed those animals? The hunter replied, yes. Narada Muni inquired from this hunter, why are you not killing those animals completely? You are half killing them by piercing one arrow which does not fully kill them. Why are you doing like this? Then the hunter replied to Narada Muni, my name is Mrigari. Mrigari means I am the enemy of the animals. My father taught me how to kill in this way, half kill animals by piercing one arrow. And this hunter is telling Narada, when I see animals suffer due to pain, then I become very happy. So Narada Muni told this hunter, can I beg from you one thing? The hunter said, yes. What do you want? You want the skin of some animals, tiger skin, deer skin, I can give you. Narada Muni said, no, no, no. I do not want any skin from you. I want to request you that kindly don't half kill animals. You kill them completely, fully kill them. Don't half kill animals. So the hunter asked, what's the difference between half killing and fully killing the animals? So Narada Muni replied that when you half kill the animals, they suffer so much more pain than if you were to fully kill the animals. See, as a hunter, your business is to kill animals. Now that's an offense on your part, killing animals. But if you unnecessarily give them so much more pain by half killing them, you incur very great sin. So this is Narada Muni's divine influence on the hunter.

**Summary:** The hunter inquires about how to become free from sinful reactions, and Narada Muni offers a path to liberation, requiring him to give up his bow and trust in Narada Muni for sustenance.

So then the hunter began to inquire further. So in what way is this greater sin? So Narada Muni said, these animals who are half killed by you, when they are getting unnecessary pain because you have not fully killed them, in your next life, they will kill you and give you so much suffering that is waiting for you. So by the association of Narada Muni, this hunter became convinced, yes, yes, what I am doing is very, very wrong. I have to suffer so much. I've killed so many animals and given them so much pain. So he became afraid. Then he said, you see, I have been taught this killing business from my childhood. Now I have accumulated so much of sin. How am I going to become free from these sinful reactions? See, this is the advantage of holy association, association with a pure devotee. One becomes purified and one becomes enlightened. And this hunter is inquiring, how can I become free from sinful reactions? So Narada Muni said, if you are interested, I will find a way how you can become liberated. But before that, will you do what I say? Hunter said, yes, yes. Narada Muni said, throw away this bow, break it and throw it away. Then I will tell you what next you should do. So the hunter said, if I break my bow, how will I maintain myself? I have no other means of subsistence. So Narada Muni said, don't worry. I will supply you food every day. You don't worry about food, how you are going to get food. You throw that, break that bow and throw it away.

So then Narada Muni's assurance, the hunter actually broke his bow and threw it away. Then Narada Muni said that you return home. You distribute whatever riches or wealth you have to brahmanas, to saintly persons. And then you and your wife should leave home taking only some minimum clothes to wear. That's all. Then you go to the river and there you construct a small cottage and grow one tulsi plant in the bank of the river. Then you should daily circumambulate tulsi by offering water and you should chant the Hare Krishna mantra continuously. I will send you sufficient food every day and you take as much as you want. There is no restriction I am imposing. Then after that, Narada Muni, he went to those three animals, pulled out the arrow that was struck in their body and then with his gentle touch, he actually nicely massaged the wounded portion and the animals immediately got up, felt relief and ran away from the place. Then the hunter was impressed. Oh, Narada Muni saved those three animals which were half dead, half killed. So he was understruck. This saintly person is an extraordinary saint. So he paid his respects to Narada Muni, bowed down and went home. Then after going home, Narada Muni of course left that place and went away. Then this hunter exactly followed the instructions of Narada Muni and news spread in the surrounding villages that this hunter, cruel hunter has become a great Vaishnava. He is sitting in front of a tulsi plant, he is chanting holy name and he is watering the tulsi and he has given up this business of killing animals.

So, so many people started coming to see him. They would bring some grains, some fruits, some edibles like that. Then this hunter, former hunter turned devotee, he was wonderstruck. Narada Muni is sending so much for me. And he would, with his wife, he would chant, he would accept little food and he would go on chanting, as instructed by Narada Muni. Then a year passed and Narada Muni was with another saint, Parvata Muni. So Narada, while travelling with Parvata Muni, he said, when he came in the vicinity of Prayag, he said, let us visit one former hunter's place and let me see what he is doing. I instructed him to stop killing animals and chant Hare Krishna. Let us see what he is doing. So as they started approaching the hut, the cottage of that former hunter turned devotee, they could see the hunter is approaching them. And as he was approaching them, he was carefully examining the ground. And what was he doing? There were so many ants which were running here and there on the path. So he took his cloth and gently, you know, moved the ants away from his path so that he will not stamp on the ants and kill them. So seeing this, Parvata Muni was astonished.

**Key Quote:** "But a liberated soul does not have any reaction. So there are higher purposes for which such liberated souls appear in the world."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the rare birth of a liberated soul like Shukadeva Goswami, explaining that Vyasadeva impressed upon the child the synopsis of Bhagavatam so that the child could be made attached to the transcendental activities of the lord.

Even within the womb of his mother, such a birth is very, very rare. Generally, we take birth because we are forced by the laws of nature to take birth in order to square up our karmic reactions from the previous life or previous lives. But a liberated soul does not have any reaction. So there are higher purposes for which such liberated souls appear in the world. Srila Vyasa Deva knew that the child after his birth would not stay at home. Vyasa Deva is a Trikalanya. He knows past, present and future. So he knew the future. He did not stick with the future. He did not seek the present or future. His very deliverance is an papa and the future of this child was that he would not stay at home. As soon as he would be born, he would just leave home and go away. Therefore, Vyasa Deva impressed upon the child the synopsis of the Bhagavatam so that the child could be made attached to the transcendental activities of the Lord, especially describing the personality of goddess activities, qualities, forms, names, paraphernalia.

who appeared as the son of yasa as a liberated soul, the child was still more educating in the subject of the Bhagavatam by recitation of the actual poems, the actual verses of the Bhagavatam. The idea is that, why is Prabhupada telling this, quoting from the Brahma Vaivarta Purana? The idea is that generally the liberated souls are attached to the feature of impersonal Brahman with a monastic view of becoming one with the Supreme Whole. This is the impersonal Brahman understanding. The aim of such impersonalists is that they want liberation by merging their self into the Supreme Whole as impersonal Brahman. But by the association of pure devotees like Vyasa Deva, even the liberated soul becomes attracted to the transcendental qualities of the Lord. This is what was elaborately discussed in the previous verse, the 10th verse, the Atmarama verse. By the mercy of

And by the mercy of Vyasa Deva, Srila Shukadeva Goswami was able to narrate the epic of Srimad Bhagavatam. And by the mercy of Vyasa Deva, Srila Shukadeva Goswami was able to narrate the epic of Srimad Bhagavatam. The transcendental qualities of the Lord are so attractive that Srila Shukadeva Goswami became detached from being completely absorbed in impersonal Brahman and positively took up the personal activity of the Lord. This we have elaborately discussed in the previous verse. The transcendental qualities of the Lord. The transcendental qualities of the Lord are millions and billions of times more attractive than the features of the impersonal Brahman. The impersonal Brahman understanding is in neutral stage. Lowest is the material conception, where one thinks in terms of material enjoyment, material pleasure, material gain, material paraphernalia, material existence, material pleasures, that is sense gratification, etc. Material enjoyment in upper planets. But none of these are free from the material miseries, fundamental miseries, janma, mrityu, jara, vyadi, dukkha, dopa, etc.

**Key Quote:** "After one comes to know of the personal feature, you will think, why was I wasting time with this impersonal feature?"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth as a neutral stage and explains that realizing the personal feature of the Lord brings more transcendental bliss.

So, above the material conception is the impersonal conception of the absolute truth. And that is the neutral stage where one is free from the material miseries, or material concept of life. But one has not yet perfected the realization of the Absolute Truth to the highest degree. So, if somebody mistakes the Absolute Truth to be only impersonal Brahman, then they cultivate that knowledge and they somehow try to seek satisfaction of realization of the impersonal feature. There is no variety, spiritual variety is lacking. There is no material inebriety or material defect in this realization of the Absolute Truth as impersonal Brahman. But there is no spiritual variety, spiritual variety. So, Srila Prabhupada says, practically he was thrown from the impersonal conception of the Absolute, thinking within himself that he had simply wasted so much time in devoting himself to the impersonal feature of the Supreme. After one comes to know of the personal feature, you will think, why was I wasting time with this impersonal feature? Why do they feel like that? Because he realized more transcendental bliss with the personal feature.

**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Rupa Goswami from Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu to illustrate the vast difference in transcendental bliss between realizing the personal feature of the Lord and merging into the impersonal Brahman.

Srila Rupa Goswami says that the happiness derived by merging into the impersonal Brahman, the feature of the Absolute, if the happiness of that merging can be compared to an ocean, then that transcendental bliss derived from realizing the personal feature is billions and trillions of times greater than the personal feature. Billions of times more. I'm sorry, it's the other way round. If the transcendental bliss derived from the personal feature, understanding or realizing the personal feature is compared to an ocean, then the transcendental bliss of merging into the impersonal Brahman is billions and trillions of times greater than the impersonal, not even equal to one drop, it is much, much less than that, very insignificant.

The devotees are always absorbed in thought or remembrance or discussion, either hearing or describing in association with other devotees who similarly relish the personal feature. So therefore, such devotees who relish the personal feature, they don't very much like the impersonalists, and impersonalists who desire to become one with the supreme are unable to evaluate the devotees of the Lord. The impersonalists think these devotees of Krishna, they are sentimentalists because the impersonalists want to eliminate all material variety.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna as a supreme personality of Godhead even when he takes birth in this material world it is transcendental. Janma Karma Chame Divyam."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's pastimes are transcendental, even when they appear material, and that liberated souls like Nanda Maharaj participate in these pastimes, contrasting this with the impersonalists' inability to appreciate such devotion, and concluding that personal and impersonal realizations don't go together.

superhuman devotees discuss, "Oh, Krishna, he was crawling on his knees in the yard of Nanda Maharaj and Nanda Maharaj was absorbed in fondling this child." So they think, what have we got to do with some child and some father fondling the child? They think this is all material description. What they don't realize is Krishna as a supreme personality of Godhead, even when he takes birth in this material world, it is transcendental. Janma Karma Chame Divyam. It is not like the birth of ordinary living entities, conditioned souls. It's not like that. Nanda Maharaj, when he appears in this world to participate in Krishna's pastimes, he is totally liberated soul. He's not a conditioned soul. He has no attraction for any material dealings. He has absolutely no attraction for material dealings. Neither Krishna is interested in any material dealings. So Nanda Maharaj's attraction for Krishna is completely transcendental. That is what Srila Prabhupada is telling here. The impersonalists are unable to evaluate the devotees of the Lord. Thus from time immemorial, these two categories of transcendental pilgrims have sometimes been competitors. They like to keep themselves separate from each other because ultimately impersonal and personal realizations don't go together. So, Shukadeva Goswami, he became attracted to devotees after realizing the personal feature and naturally he would keep away from the

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (1.7.12) that will be discussed, focusing on Suta Goswami's intention to narrate Krishna Katha through the stories of King Parikshit and the Pandavas.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Janmadhyasya Yatonvaya Ditaratash Chartheshabhignya Svarat Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tatho Jaya Mudhirayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the twelfth verse of the seventh chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, Parikshito Atharajarsher Janma Karma Vilapanam Samsthamcha Panduputranam Vakshye Krishna Kathodayam. The meaning of this verse is, Suta Goswami addressed the rishis headed by Saunaka. What did Suta Goswami tell the sages? Now I shall begin the transcendental narration of the Lord Sri Krishna and topics of the birth activities and deliverance of King Parikshit, the sage amongst kings, as well as topics of the renunciation of the worldly order by the sons of Pandu.

**Key Quote:** "What is the connection between Pandavas renouncing this world and Krishna Katha and again what is the connection between Pariksit's birth activities and deliverance with Krishna Katha"
**Summary:** The speaker questions the connection between the stories of the Pandavas and Parikshit and Krishna Katha, setting the stage for Srila Prabhupada's explanation.

See, Suta Goswami began telling the sage Sunaimishanya in the third chapter. After answering their initial six questions, Suta Goswami started telling them, "I see that you are very eager to hear about Krishna. So, best is that I narrate the Srimad Bhagavatam because Bhagavatam is Krishna Katha." Therefore, Suta Goswami said, here he is telling, "I shall begin transcendental narration of the Lord Shri Krishna," and how will he begin such a narration of Krishna Katha by narrating topics of the birth activities and deliverance of King Pariksit, the Raja Rishi, as well as topics of the renunciation of the worldly order by the sons of Pandu. By the Pandavas' renunciation, what is the connection between Pandavas renouncing this world and Krishna Katha? And again, what is the connection between Pariksit's birth activities and deliverance with Krishna Katha?

**Key Quote:** "Any historical fact old or new which has a connection with the activities of the Supreme Lord Krishna is to be understood as a transcendental narration of the Lord Shri Krishna"
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's perspective that any historical fact connected to Krishna's activities is transcendental.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains this very important point in the purport. Srila Prabhupada says, "Lord Krishna is so kind to the forefathers of the world that he is so kind to the forefathers of the world that he is so kind to the forefathers of the world that he is so kind to the forefathers of the world that he is so kind to the forefathers of the world that he is so kind to the forefathers of the world that he is so kind to the forefathers of the world that he is so kind to the forefathers of the world that he is so kind to the forefathers of the world that he is so kind to the forefathers of the world that he is so kind to the forefathers of the world that he is so kind to the forefathers of the world that he is so kind to the forefathers of the world that he is so kind to the forefathers of the world that he is so kind to the forefathers of the world that he is so kind to the forefathers of the world that he is so kind to the forefathers of the world that he is so kind to the forefathers of the world that he is so kind to the forefathers of the world that he is so kind world transcendental appearance he also takes part with all kinds of living entities in daily activities which appear like ordinary activities but which are completely transcendental." So, Srila Prabhupada says, "Any historical fact, old or new, which has a connection with the activities of the Supreme Lord Krishna is to be understood as a transcendental narration of the Lord Shri Krishna." Narration about the activities of Krishna or any fact, historical fact, in connection with Krishna's activities is actually a transcendental narration of Krishna only.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Without Krishna all the supplementary literatures like the Puranas and Mahabharata are simply stories or historical facts but with Krishna in connection with Krishna they become transcendental"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the transcendental nature of Srimad Bhagavatam, emphasizing that it is centered around the activities of Lord Krishna, making it the 'spotless Purana'.

Only without Krishna, all the supplementary literatures like the Puranas and Mahabharata are simply stories or historical facts, but with Krishna, in connection with Krishna, they become transcendental. The same historical narrations which are in relationship with Krishna become transcendental narrations, and without this Krishna, they are all material facts, material histories, that's all. When we hear the activities of the devotees of Krishna in relationship with Krishna, we at once become transcendental, related with Krishna, immediately the connection, spiritual connection, is established. So, Srimad Bhagavatam is also a Purana. Purana means that which contains a very ancient history. But the special significance of this Purana, Bhagavata Purana, is that the activities of the Lord are central and not just supplementary historical facts.

The activities of Lord Krishna are central in this Purana, particularly. Srimad Bhagavatam is thus recommended by Lord Sri Krishna, sorry, Srimad Bhagavatam is thus recommended by Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu as the spotless Purana. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu called this Amala Purana, spotless Purana. That means in this Purana, there is nothing material, no material subject matter. Birth, activities of Parikshit Maharaj, this is not material description because the central topic is the activities of Krishna. Everything is centered around the activities of Krishna. Every narration, you will find there is some relationship with activities of Krishna, connection with activities of Krishna. Without such connection with Krishna, none of these narrations are spiritual,

**Key Quote:** "There is a class of less intelligent devotees of Bhagavata Purana who desire to relish at once the activities of the Lord narrated in the 10th canto without first understanding the primary cantos."
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the common misconception of skipping to the 10th canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, emphasizing the importance of understanding the preceding cantos as they are all spiritually significant and centered around Krishna.

they are simply material. Now, here is an important point Prabhupada is stressing: "There is a class of less intelligent devotees of Bhagavata Purana who desire to relish at once the activities of the Lord narrated in the 10th canto without first understanding the primary cantos." See, Bhagavatam is presented by Vyasa Deva systematically in 12 cantos. 12 cantos, 1st canto, 2nd canto, 3rd canto. We are in the 1st canto now. Like this, there are 12 cantos. Each canto is very big. Each canto contains several chapters. Each chapter contains several verses. And each verses got so much of depth. We just went through the Atmarama verse. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu gave 61 meanings of the Atmarama verse. Of course, I didn't describe all the 61 meanings, but I described some of them. Like that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu points out there is so much depth in the Srimad Bhagavatam. This is the spotless Purana because it contains narrations of the activities of Krishna which are central to everything discussed in the Srimad Bhagavatam. So, it's not that the 10th canto which specifically describes Krishna's appearance and activities as the original personality of God alone is important. No. Every single canto of Bhagavatam, beginning from the 1st canto, is having spiritual description.

**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that Krishna appears in various forms and incarnations, and the activities of his pure devotees are also 100% spiritual.

Descriptions of spiritual potency centered around the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna only. Krishna appears not only in his original form as Krishna. He also appears in his various forms. He also appears in his various forms. He also appears in his various forms. Transcendental forms of incarnation, Rama, Narasimha, Varaha, Matsya, Kurma, and so on. All those descriptions are there. And not only he himself, but his devotees, his pure devotees, the Pandavas, Parichit Maharaj, Shukadeva Goswami. Shukadev Goswami, all pure devotees' activities, their narrations, their histories, their descriptions, everything is 100% spiritual.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Devotees are never without Krishna. And Krishna is never without devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that all cantos of the Srimad Bhagavatam are equally important and that devotees are always connected to Krishna.

So, Srila Prabhupada clarifies, these people who jump to the 10th canto without reading or hearing or studying the first 9 cantos, they are under the false impression that the other cantos are not concerned with Krishna. That's what these foolish people think. And thus, more foolishly than intelligently, they take to the reading of the 10th canto. They directly jump to the 10th canto. They say, "We have nothing to do with Pandavas and Parikshit and Prithu Maharaj and Pracheya. All that we are not interested. We are only interested in Krishna, Krishna Leela." But actually, these readers are specifically told herein that the other cantos of the Bhagavatam are as important as the 10th canto. That's why, what does Suta Goswami tell the sages in this verse? Suta Goswami says, I am going to narrate the history of the birth, the activities, and deliverance of King Parikshit, as well as the topics of renunciation of the Pandavas. Now, what has that got to do with Krishna Katha? That is what exactly we have to do. We have to understand that devotees are never without Krishna, and Krishna is never without devotees. Neither does Krishna perform activities alone, nor do devotees perform any activity alone without Krishna. So, devotees are always situated in Krishna consciousness, and Krishna is always doing everything in relationship to Krishna. And Krishna is always involved in joint devotion to...

**Key Quote:** "Talks about the devotees talks about krishna in relationship with the devotees or talks about the devotees in relationship with krishna everything is krishna katha"
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that any discussion about Krishna or his devotees is Krishna Katha, emphasizing their inseparable connection.

Vyasa Deva, the author, is preparing the reader to better appreciate Krishna's transcendental activities in the tenth canto by describing the activities of Krishna's pure devotees and Krishna's incarnations in nine cantos, systematically develops the subject matter. So, Sridhar Prabhupada concludes by telling, Krishna and his pure devotees like the Pandavas are on the same plane, spiritual platform, pure devotional platform. Krishna is not without his devotees. Of all the rasas, Krishna is described as akhila rasamruta sindhu. He is full of varieties of rasas and his ocean of all rasas, and the pure devotees like Pandavas are not without Krishna. They are never without Krishna. So, the devotees and the Lord are interlinked, and they can never be separated, never. Therefore, talks about them all are Krishna Katha, talks about the devotees, talks about Krishna in relationship with the devotees, or talks about the devotees in relationship with Krishna, everything is Krishna Katha.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verses from Srimad Bhagavatam describing the aftermath of the Kurukshetra war, focusing on Duryodhana's death and Ashwatthama's sinful act of killing Draupadi's sons.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Jai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tatho Jaya Mudireyate In this session, we'll be discussing from the 13th and the 14th verses of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Sriman Bhagavatam.

The meaning of these two verses is also given together by Srila Prabhupada. When the respective warriors of both camps, namely the Kauravas and the Pandavas, were killed on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, and the dead warriors obtained their deserved destinations, and when the son of Dhritarashtra fell down, left behind, and died in the battle, lamenting, his spine broken, being beaten by the club of Bhimasena, the son of Dronacharya Ashwathama, beheaded the five sleeping sons of Draupadi and delivered them as a prize to his master, foolishly thinking that he would be pleased. Duryodhana, however, disapproved of the heinous act, and he was not pleased.

**Key Quote:** "Both these battles are significant because in both the battles, the Supreme Lord is personally present"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the significance of the Kurukshetra and Ramayana battles, highlighting the presence and roles of Lord Krishna and Lord Ramachandra, emphasizing Kurukshetra as a Dharma Yudha.

In the least. So Suta Goswami begins the narration of the Sriman Bhagavatam, beginning with the topics of the renouncement of the Pandavas and the birth activities and deliverance of King Pariksha. So first of all, he is beginning from the point where the end of the Battle of Kurukshetra, that famous battle. In our history of Greater India, there are two famous battles. One is the battle of the Ramayana between Lord Ramachandra and Ravana. And the other is the battle between the Pandavas and Kauravas as described in the Mahabharata. Both these battles are significant because in both the battles, the Supreme Lord is personally present, though in the battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna was not fighting, but his presence is significant. And in the battle of Ramayana, Lord Ramachandra is directly engaged in the battle, playing the role of a Kshatriya. Of course, Krishna was also playing the role of a Kshatriya on the battle when he was present on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. But because he wanted the battle to be a little bit more peaceful, he wanted the battle to go on in a fair manner, nobody could match the strength and the Kshatriya abilities of Krishna because Krishna is a supreme personality.

**Key Quote:** "And those who died seeing Krishna on the battlefield, they attained their Svarupa, their original constitutional position in the spiritual world."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the benefits of dying in a Dharma Yudha, explaining that warriors attain heavenly planets and those who see Krishna attain their original spiritual form.

But here, the description is that Krishna, the fighting was going on for 18 days and whoever was killed on the battlefield, in this battle of Kurukshetra, the dead warriors obtained their deserved destinations. We should always remember this is a Dharma Yudha. It is a battle fought according to religious principles. So in such a Dharma Yudha, whoever dies fighting, a Kshatriya who dies fighting in this battle, whichever party they belong to, it doesn't matter. They will at least be promoted to heavenly planets. Guaranteed elevation in their status in life. And those who died seeing Krishna on the battlefield, they attained their Svarupa, their original constitutional position in the spiritual world. They were directly promoted to the spiritual world. This is what Srila Prabhupada explains in a discourse given on these two verses. So a Dharma Yudha is not at all bad. In fact, it is spiritually beneficial for everyone. And that is exactly what Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita also. While Arjuna at the beginning of the battle of Kurukshetra refuses to fight, Krishna tells him this is a Dharma Yudha and you are a Kshatriya. It is your duty to fight in this Dharma Yudha. Either you die on the battlefield while fighting and you attain minimum the heavenly planets or you enjoy a flourishing kingdom if you win this battle. In either case, there is no loss for Arjuna, for the partners. So here it is described. The warriors who were killed on the battlefield of Kurukshetra attained their deserved destinations. Minimum is promotion to heavenly planets. And others who were fortunate enough to die while dying, they were able to see Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They got their Svarupa.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's intervention is not partiality on his part. Krishna has got a transcendental objective."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the fight between Duryodhana and Bhima, Krishna's intervention, and the reasons behind Krishna wanting the Pandavas to win, emphasizing the need for a God-conscious ruler.

And in the end, there was a fight between Duryodhana and Bhimasena. So they were fighting with a club in the hand. One on one they were fighting. And Krishna was there present to guide Bhima. Krishna was there to guide Bhima, that this Duryodhana, it's not easy to defeat him or Bhima. It is said that though both were expert in fighting with the club, still Bhima had more bodily strength as compared to Duryodhana. And Duryodhana had better skill in fighting with the club. So actually the fighting would have gone on for many many days, a very long time, had it not been for the intervention of Krishna. We should always remember Krishna's intervention is not partiality on his part. He is not partial to the part of us. Krishna has got a transcendental objective. Krishna wants this battle of Kurukshetra for some very important reasons. One is that the burden of the earth had to be brought down, reduced. And the second reason is that Krishna wants a God conscious Kshatriya, like Yudhishthira to rule the whole world, because the purpose of Kshatriya, because the purpose of this material creation, is that people are guided towards ultimate liberation from material bondage. And a king like Yudhishthira who is Krishna conscious, he is the perfect ruler to guide the citizens towards spiritual emancipation.

**Key Quote:** "Duryodhana however was not at all pleased. Because it is totally unlawful."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the narrative, detailing how Bhima defeated Duryodhana by striking below the waist, and how Ashwatthama's killing of Draupadi's sons was disapproved by Duryodhana.

So Krishna wanted the Pandavas to win this battle. And it was not easy to defeat, for Bhima to defeat Duryodhana. But still when Krishna advised or indicated to Bhima that you have to actually use your club to beat Duryodhana below the waist. Now beating below the waist is against the rules of Kshatriya conduct in Dharma Yudha. But still because Krishna indicated to Bhima, Bhima did that, and Duryodhana fell down when he was hit below the waist, and his spine was broken. And after that of course Duryodhana died. At that time when he had just fallen down due to that fighting, the son of Dronacharya, Ashwatthama, he in order to please Duryodhana, Ashwatthama was fighting on the side of the Kauravas, so he beheaded the sleeping sons of Draupadi. Draupadi had five husbands, the five Pandavas. So she had one son through each of the Pandavas, and she had five sons. So all of them were killed totally unlawfully by Ashwatthama. And he brought those five heads to prove that he has killed them, and he delivered them to Duryodhana. Duryodhana however was not at all pleased because it is totally unlawful, and he disapproved of the sinuous act. That is what this verse describes. He was not at all pleased by this. He condemned Ashwatthama for unlawfully killing the five sons of Draupadi.

Now this is where the Bhagavatam begins. Narration of Bhagavatam begins. We already have Krishna's instructions to Arjuna, and to Arjuna and to all of us, the Krishna Katha in the form of Bhagavad Gita before the beginning of the battle of Kurukshetra. And the Krishna Katha given in the form of Bhagavatam is beginning from the end of the battle of Kurukshetra. So we will hear the narration of the Bhagavatam, how it is connected to Krishna consciousness, in the further verses. I will stop here.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of the lecture, focusing on Draupadi's grief after the death of her sons and Arjuna's attempt to console her.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 15th and the 16th verses of the 7th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. First, the 15th verse: Mata Shishunam Nidhanam Sutanam Nishamya Ghoram Paritapyamana Tadarudad Vashpakala Kulakshi Tam Santwayan Ah Kiritam Mali. The meaning of these words: Draupadi, the mother of the five children of the Pandavas, after hearing of the massacre of her sons, began to cry in distress with eyes full of tears. Trying to pacify her in her great loss, Arjuna spoke to her thus. So, in these words, Arjuna is referred to as Kiritamali.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Arjuna's vow to Draupadi to avenge the death of her sons by killing Ashwatthama.

And Arjuna is trying to pacify Draupadi. It's natural for the mother who has lost all her five children, not while they were fighting in the battle, but when they were unlawfully killed when they were sleeping. It is totally against Kshatriya conduct. So naturally a mother will feel very much, too much discharge due to the loss of her all five sons. And what Arjuna spoke to Draupadi to pacify her is there in the next, the 16th verse: Tadashuchaste Pramarjami Bhadre Yatكرam Am Comedy밧시 Yad Brahma Bandho Shira Atatayinaha Gandiva Muktair Vishikhair Upahare Thvakramya Yatsnasya Siddhagdha Putra. The meaning of this 16th verse: O gentle lady, here is Arjuna pacifying Draupadi, O gentle lady, when I present you with the head of that Brahmana, after beheading him with arrows from my Gandiva bow, I shall then wipe the tears from your eyes and pacify you. Then, after burning your son's bodies, you can take your bath standing on his head.

**Key Quote:** "That means he's not a Brahmana. He is not qualified as a Brahmana. He doesn't have the qualification of a Brahmana. He is called Brahma Bandhu"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the term 'Brahma Bandhu' and its application to Ashwatthama, emphasizing that birth in a Brahmana family does not automatically qualify one as a true Brahmana.

So these are the words spoken by Arjuna to pacify Draupadi, that Arjuna. He understands that Ashwathama is the son of his teacher Dronacharya. So the consideration that he is the son of his teacher, that consideration is lost when he has behaved in a very wrong way. And Arjuna is specifically referring to Ashwathama, the son of Dronacharya, as Brahma Bandho. That means he's not a Brahmana. He is not qualified as a Brahmana. He doesn't have the qualification of a Brahmana. He is called Brahma Bandhu. These terms are used in the Vedic literature, Dvija Bandhu or Brahma Bandhu. Brahma Bandhu is one who has taken birth in a Brahmana family from a Brahmana father, but he himself does not qualify as a Brahmana, so such a person is called a Brahma Bandhu, or anyone being born in a family of Brahmana, Chhatri, or Vaishya called Dvija, they all have a second birth, but they don't qualify to themselves come to the status of Dvija, so such a person is referred to as Dvija Bandhu. In this case, Dronacharya was a Brahmana, his son Ashwathama behaved not like a Brahmana.

**Key Quote:** "An enemy who sets fire to the house, one who administers poison, one who attacks all of a sudden with deadly weapons, plunders wealth or usurps agricultural fields or entices one's wife is called an aggressor."
**Summary:** The speaker defines an aggressor (attatayinah) according to scriptures, citing Srila Prabhupada's purport, and states that such an aggressor deserves punishment.

So he is called a Brahma Bandhu, and he is also, he is an aggressor. So that is explained in the purport by Shri La Prabhupada: an enemy who sets fire to the house, one who administers poison, one who attacks all of a sudden with deadly weapons, plunders wealth, or usurps agricultural fields, or entices one's wife is called an aggressor. He is called an attatayinah, an aggressor. Such an aggressor, though he be a Brahmana or a so called son of a Brahmana, has to be punished in all circumstances. Punishment is due to such a aggressor, attatayinah.

**Key Quote:** "Even if somebody is enemy Kshatriya code of conduct is Kshatriya should invite challenge the enemy and they should have a fight in a proper place according to the code of conduct for Kshatriyas"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Arjuna's dilemma in the Bhagavad Gita and the Kshatriya code of conduct, emphasizing that even in enmity, certain actions like setting fire to a house are unjustifiable.

In the Bhagavad Gita also, this reference is made by Arjuna. In the Bhagavad Gita also, this reference is made by Arjuna that even if somebody like Bhishma and Drona may attack me, I don't want to retaliate because they are worthy of my respect, even though they are aggressors, I don't want to retaliate. This is Arjuna's position as described in the first chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. Similarly here, Arjuna is referring to the son of Dronacharya, Aswathama, as Brahma Bandhu and as attatayinah. He is an aggressor and he is not qualified Brahmana. So such an aggressor, who is called an aggressor, now here, different different situations under which somebody may be called an aggressor: an enemy who sets fire to the house. Even if somebody is enemy, Kshatriya code of conduct is Kshatriya should invite, challenge the enemy and they should have a fight in a proper place according to the code of conduct for Kshatriyas. So even if there is some enmity, that doesn't justify setting fire to the house of the enemy, you know, because in that house the other family members are also staying, so they don't deserve to be killed or they don't deserve to be harmed in any way.

**Key Quote:** "Such aggressors according to Shastra have to be punished and there is no sin involved in giving them punishment"
**Summary:** The speaker continues to define different types of aggression and reiterates that punishing aggressors according to the scriptures is not sinful.

That is very important consideration. So how can a Kshatriya who knows the principle set fire to somebody else's house? He becomes immediately an aggressor if he does this, or somebody who administers poison. Enemy is killed in a proper battle, not killed by other methods, administering poison like this, beheading the children who are sleeping so that they don't have an opportunity to defend themselves. So that is not at all acceptable. Administering poison, beheading somebody who is sleeping, this is not acceptable, or somebody who attacks all of a sudden with deadly weapons, that means immediate death, somebody attacks, that is also unlawful, completely unlawful and such a person is an aggressor. One who plunders wealth, there is no provision in Kshatriya code of conduct for taking away forcibly the enemy's wealth, no, they cannot, or enticing one's wife, the enemy's wife, he cannot entice, that is completely wrong for a Kshatriya, it is completely wrong. So such aggressors according to Shastra have to be punished and there is no sin involved in giving them punishment.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Arjuna was aware of Ashwatthama's Brahmana lineage but still vowed to punish him for his heinous act, comparing Ashwatthama's actions to that of a butcher.

Hmm, when Arjuna promised to behead the aggressor named Ashwatthama, he knew well that Ashwatthama was the son of a Brahmana. It is not that Arjuna was not conscious that Ashwatthama was the son of a Brahmana, he was very much aware, but then he told Draupadi, I am going to cut off the head of this Ashwatthama because that is what he did to the five sons of Draupadi when they were asleep, he cut off their heads. Now here Arjuna is directly going to challenge Ashwatthama and take action against him. Hmm, so Arjuna knows very well Ashwatthama was the son of a Brahmana, still he is promising Draupadi I am going to cut off his head. Hmm, now Prabhupada says here the so called Brahmana acted like a butcher, like butcher kills some innocent animal, the animal cannot even defend itself. Hmm, so similarly this Ashwatthama has killed those five sleeping sons of Draupadi like a butcher only cutting off the head. Hmm, there is no question of sin in killing such a Brahmana son who proved to be a villain. This Ashwatthama proves to be totally unqualified for being shown any mercy.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by highlighting the significance of the discussion in the Bhagavatam and reiterates the principle that even a Brahmana deserves punishment for misbehavior, emphasizing the importance of conduct over birth.

Hmm, so this instance that is described here in the Bhagavatam, in the beginning of the Bhagavatam, the narration begins, Suta Goswami is narrating the history, it is very significant and this discussion will be held in great detail about, is it proper for Arjuna to kill Dronacharya's son, what kind of punishment does he deserve under the circumstances and what are all the different considerations for either punishing him or for excusing him and not giving him certain punishment, so many considerations and all those will be systematically presented by Vyasa Deva, the author of this Bhagavatam very nicely, but in general the principle is even if somebody is a Brahmana, if he misbehaves then he deserves to be punished in accordance with the kind of violation he has done. Hmm, so that is always a important consideration in spite of the person being a son of a Brahmana or being a Brahmana himself. Brahmana has to be very very careful how he conducts himself, so I will stop here.

**Key Quote:** "Arjuna, who is guided by the infallible Lord as friend and driver thus satisfied the dear lady by such statements Arjuna satisfied Draupadi then he dressed in armor and armed himself with furious weapons and getting into his chariot he set out to follow Ashwatthama the son of his martial teacher"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of the verses, focusing on Arjuna's pursuit of Ashwatthama and Krishna's role as an infallible guide, explaining the meaning of 'Achyutaa'.

In this session, we will be discussing the 17th and 18th verses of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. From this chapter, the narration of the Bhagavatam by Suta Goswami begins, and the particular incident that is being discussed in this chapter is the son of Drona punished, Ashwatthama is being punished because he beheaded the sleeping sons of Draupadi, the slave of Drona. So the 17th verse: Iti-priyaam Valgvi chitra jal payi Sasaantva itva chut緊 mithra Soottha Anvaadyravat damshita ugradhanva Kapitvajo guru putram ratvena. The meaning of this verse is: Arjuna, who is guided by the infallible Lord as friend and driver, thus satisfied the dear lady by such statements. Arjuna satisfied Draupadi, then he dressed in armor and armed himself with furious weapons, and getting into his chariot, he set out to follow Ashwatthama, the son of his martial teacher. So Ashwatthama had been rejected even by Duryodhana. Duryodhana did not appreciate this unlawful act of Ashwatthama, and Ashwatthama was actually conscious that his life is in danger, so he had gone away somewhere. So Arjuna, who was having Krishna as his friend and driver, here Krishna is described as Achyutaa, infallible Lord. What is the meaning of infallible? He never falls down from his transcendental position.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of 'falling down' from a spiritual platform and contrasts it with the unwavering transcendental position of the Supreme Lord and his devotees.

unless he is in deep trance state. Like we, the living entities who desire to enjoy materially, we give up that spiritual platform on which we are eternally situated in our relationship with Krishna. We give up that and we come to the material platform, so this is called a fall, a fall down, whereas the Supreme Lord and his pure devotees, they never fall down. Even though they come to the material world, they are always transcendentally situated, whether in the material world or in the spiritual world, or any situation, any time, any place, they are always transiently situated. So Arjuna was guided by the infallible Lord, the Supreme Lord, who is never subject to any deterioration.

**Summary:** The speaker continues the narrative, describing Ashwatthama's fear and flight from Arjuna, drawing a comparison to Brahma fleeing from Shiva.

He, Arjuna, satisfied Draupadi by making significant statements. Now, in order to punish Ashwathama, Arjuna has dressed himself in armor and armed himself with furious weapons, and he got into his chariot, he set out to follow Ashwathama. The 18th verse: The meaning of this verse is: Ashwathama, the murderer of the princess, seeing from a great distance Arjuna coming at him with great speed, fled in his chariot panic-stricken just to save his life as Brahma fled in fear from Shiva. So Arjuna is trying to capture Ashwathama to punish him, but Ashwathama, on seeing that Arjuna is coming to capture him, Ashwathama is himself going in his chariot running away from Arjuna just to save his life.

**Key Quote:** "Kaha means Brahma who once became elude by his daughter and became a woman and began to follow her This infuriated Shiva Who attacked Brahma with his trident Brahma fled in fear of his life"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the reference to Brahma fleeing from Shiva, recounting the story of Brahma's illusion and Shiva's anger, as described in the Puranas.

Ashwathama running away in fear. The comparison is made just as Brahma ran away in fear of Lord Shiva. Now Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport that the word Kaha that is used in the last line of this 18th verse. Now here the word Kaha refers to Brahma. Or if it is read as Yathar Kaha, then Arkaha refers to Surya or the sun god. So both those meanings are taken and explained by Prabhupada. According to the reading matter, either Kaha or Arkaha, there are two references in the Puranas. The Acharyas never speculate. They always refer the Shastra and clarify such matters. So there is a reference for Kaha, and there is also a reference for Arkaha. Arkaha refers to the sun god, and Kaha refers to Brahma. So it is said with respect to Kaha being used in this verse, Kaha means Brahma, who once became elude by his daughter and became a woman and began to follow her. This infuriated Shiva, who attacked Brahma with his trident. Brahma fled in fear of his life. This is described in the Puranas elsewhere, that once Brahma became elude by his own daughter. That is the power of the illusory energy, that such an exalted personality as Brahma, even he became illusioned by the sight of his beautiful daughter. He started following her in order to enjoy with her. So that act of Brahma infuriated Shiva. Shiva became very angry. Shiva is also appearing as the son of Brahma, so he became very angry at Brahma. He became very angry at Brahma, his own father, in terms of the birth Shiva has taken. But he became angry at Brahma and he went to attack Brahma with his trident. Shiva carries one instrument called Trishur. With that he attacks those who are unlawful, those who are unnecessarily giving trouble to saintly persons. So they deserve to be punished. So Shiva became angry against Brahma for the act of Brahma running behind his daughter and Shiva decided to punish this

**Summary:** The speaker provides an alternative interpretation of the verse, referencing the story of the sun god and the demon Vidyunmali from the Vaman Purana, again highlighting Shiva's anger.

person. Brahma began to run away from Shiva fearing his life. Another reference is Arkaha. Arkaha refers to the sun god. So there is a reference to this in the Vaman Purana. Srila Prabhupada quotes from Vaman Purana. There was a demon by the name Vidyunmali who was gifted with a glowing golden airplane which traveled to the back of the sun. So there is this Vidyunmali who is a demon and he received a gift and that gift was a glowing golden airplane. So Vidyunmali decided to utilize this glowing golden airplane by traveling to the back of the sun and night disappeared because of the glowing effulgence of this plane, aeroplane. Aeroplane was very brilliantly shining. So because of that shining of the aeroplane there was no night. So Shiva saw then what happened, sun god, he became angry against this Vidyunmali that you are disturbing the arrangement of day and night. So what did the sun god do? With his rays he melted the plane in which Vidyunmali was traveling. Now Shiva observed this. He became very very angry against sun god. Then Shiva attacked the sun god and sun god in order to escape from his abode. He became very very angry against the sun god and he wore aூbhi one day. Shiva he ran away and fell at Kashi or Varanasi. And the fame and the place became famous as Lolarka. So these type of descriptions are given in the puranas but we have to hear and understand the import of such descriptions with reference to the context in the world, which gives us a lot of information in the world. For example this description of the planet house. In the short description of the sun god has mentioned that the sun god is famous for his Original form.

**Summary:** The speaker connects the stories to the present context, emphasizing the natural instinct to save oneself and the importance of taking shelter of Krishna for true protection.

This description of the sun god is known only as the sun god who was in God in ancient times. There is another description that says in this scripture, to the context in which it is described. Now in this situation, how Ashwatthama is running away from Arjuna, therefore these comparisons are being made. When life is in danger, they'll do anything to save themselves or save their life. That's natural for any human being, but in the course of escaping, whether they really be able to save their life, that is not assured or that's not guaranteed. Of course, the Bhagavatam advises everyone, take shelter of Krishna. Even Bhagavad Gita also advises, take shelter of Krishna. Once somebody takes shelter of Krishna, then they need not fear anyone or anything else, any other danger. No, but it's not easy to approach Krishna. Only pure devotees can approach Krishna, and others have to engage in some confidential service to the Supreme Lord Krishna by which Krishna is attracted to the devotee, otherwise approaching Krishna is not

possible for everyone. So therefore it is said here that the sun god who was trying to escape the wrath of Shiva, the anger of Shiva, he fell down in Kashi. And so this sort of incidents help us understand that material world elsewhere proper explains every step there is danger and the safest place for us is the spiritual world, the spiritual platform in which there is no danger, there is no difficulty, there is no death, there is no material influence like that.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Ashwathama using the Brahmastra, explaining the context of Arjuna chasing him and Ashwathama's desperation.

In this session we will be discussing from the 19th verse of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatham. Yadasharanam Atmana Aikshata Shranthavajinam Astram Bramma Shiro Mene Atma Tranam Vij atom Jaha. The meaning of this verse is: When the son of the Brahmana Ashwathama saw that his horses were tired, he considered that there was no alternative for protection outside of his using the ultimate weapon, the Brahmastra, or the nuclear weapon. So Arjuna, from the previous few verses, Arjuna when he heard that Draupadi's five sleeping sons were beheaded by Ashwathama, Arjuna pacified Draupadi and told her that, "I am going to punish him and in that way I will actually pacify you." So Arjuna armed himself and he started on his chariot to chase this Ashwathama. Ashwathama saw that Arjuna is coming very, very close and he was going away on his horse, so on his horses, I mean on his chariot which was drawn by horses, now the horses became tired and they would not move any further. Then Ashwathama thought that his life is in danger now, so he considered using the ultimate weapon, the Brahmastra, for

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that the Brahmastra is like a nuclear weapon, possessing immense power and radiation, despite being powered by mantra.

Even though this Brahmastra works on the power of mantra, the power of mantra is applied, even though this Brahmastra works on the power of mantra, even though this Brahmastra works on the power of mantra, still it is like modern-day nuclear weapon. That means there is intense amount of radiation which this astra gives out, so that will be described in the later verses, but here Prabhupada is helping us understand this Brahmastra is

**Summary:** The speaker explains that being a Brahmana is not hereditary but based on qualification, and Ashwathama is referred to as the son of a Brahmana because he lacks the necessary qualities.

like a nuclear weapon. The word vij RT from Bridgeana to Brahmastra allashti in Indian language is equal to three words. So that is the basic time to beforded by dharmayani. Atmajah is significant here because Ashwathama, although the son of Dronacharya, was not exactly a qualified Brahmana. Dvija means Brahmana. Atmajah means the son. So son of the Brahmana. He is not referred to directly as a Brahmana, but he is, Ashwathama is referred to as the son of a Brahmana. Srila Prabhupada explains why is this so? The most intelligent man is called a Brahmana, and it is not a hereditary title. It's not a hereditary title. That means the son of a Brahmana does not automatically become a Brahmana. No. He has to qualify. Ashwathama was also formerly called the Brahmabandhu or the friend of a Brahmana. Being a friend of a Brahmana does not mean that one is Brahmana by qualification.

**Key Quote:** "A Brahmana naturally is endowed with some characteristics by which he is called a Brahmana."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the qualities of a Brahmana as described in the Bhagavad Gita, contrasting it with the modern misconception of Brahmanas being determined by birth.

Brahmana in the strict sense of the term being used for somebody means the person has got the qualifications of a Brahmana. In the Bhagavad Gita, in the Bhagavad Gita this is mentioned: Shamo Dhamo Tapasyaucham Shanti Rajyavam Evacha Gyanam Vigyanam Astikyam Brahma Karma Swabhavajam. A Brahmana naturally is endowed with some characteristics by which he is called a Brahmana. So nine qualities by which Brahmanas work are specifically enumerated in the Bhagavad Gita in the 18th chapter. Hmm. Here Ashwathama because he is not having the qualifications, therefore he cannot be called a Brahmana. Therefore earlier he was referred to as Brahmabandhu, and in this verse he is referred to as Dvijatmaja, the son of a Brahmana. Earlier he was called the friend of a Brahmana. A friend or a son of a Brahmana, well fully qualified can be called a Brahmana and not otherwise. So somebody to be called as a Brahmana should have the qualification, unlike in modern times. Simply somebody is taken birth in a Brahmana family, therefore they are called Brahman, but that is not correct. That is not the proper way in which somebody should be called as a Brahmana.

Unless one is born as a Brahmana. Unless one is born as a Brahmana. Unless one is born as a Brahmana. Unless one is born as a Brahmana. Unless one is born as a Brahmana. Unless one is born as a Brahmana. Since Ashwathama's decision is immature, he is purposely called herein the son of a Brahmana. He shouldn't have used the ultimate weapon, the Brahmastra, but because he immaturely decided to use that, he is being referred to as Dvijatmaja, son of a Brahmana.

**Key Quote:** "One is identified as a Brahmana or any particular varna, Kshatriya or Vaishya, based on lakshana, based on characteristics."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Vedic system identifies individuals based on their characteristics (lakshana) rather than birth, citing the Bhagavatam.

Son of a Brahmana. So Srila Prabhupada explains in another place that the Vedic system is, one is called as a Brahmana only if he has the lakshana, the characteristics of a Brahmana. And in the Bhagavatam it is clearly declared: Yasyaya lakshanam proktam pumso varna abhivyanjakam, Yad anyatra pi drishyeta, Tattenaiva vinirdhishet. One is identified as a Brahmana, or any particular varna, Kshatriya or Vaishya, based on lakshana, based on characteristics. If a person has the characteristics of a Vaishya, he should be addressed as a Vaishya, or known as a Vaishya. If somebody has the qualities of a Kshatriya, he should be known as a Kshatriya. But without the qualities, without the qualifications, lakshana, characteristics, how can you refer somebody wrongly as a Brahmana or a Kshatriya, whatever. And specifically this verse of the Bhagavatam, the 7th canto, Yad anyatra pi drishyeta, if somebody is born in a Brahmin family, but he doesn't have the characteristics of the qualities of a Brahmana, let's say he has got the qualities of a Vaishya, then Tattenaiva vinirdhishet, he should be designated as a Vaishya because he has got the qualities of a Vaishya, even though he is born in a Brahmana family. That is what the

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of acting and having the characteristics of a Brahmana, and that referring to someone as the son of a Brahmana is acceptable if they lack these qualities, highlighting the need for training, education, and culture.

verse says. So lakshana means symptoms. One must act as a Brahmana. One must have the characteristics of a Brahmana. If he does not have those characteristics, there is no harm in referring him as the son of a Brahmana, Dujatmaja, because his father is qualified Brahmana. Ashwatthama's father is Dronacharya. Dronacharya is qualified, highly qualified. He was expert, expert Brahmana. So Ashwatthama is not similarly having the characteristics like Dronacharya. Therefore Ashwatthama, it is proper to refer him as Dujatmaja. So here Srila Prabhupada explains, anyone can claim, "My father is a great person," but he cannot pass off as a great man just because he is a son of a great man. No. Simply because his father is very highly qualified, doesn't mean he necessarily would have acquired all the father's qualifications, unless he is trained. Training is required, education is required, culture is required. All that is required. It doesn't simply come off. Automatically there is no such transfer of qualities.

**Key Quote:** "Just like somebody's father is a great heart surgeon. If the son is not qualified as a heart surgeon. How can the son be referred to as a great heart surgeon. It is not proper."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a heart surgeon to illustrate that one cannot claim to be like their qualified father without possessing the same qualities, and explains how Draupadi advised Arjuna to spare Ashwathama's life out of compassion for his mother.

No. From a social point of view, Prabhupada says, we sometimes give respect to somebody just because he happens to be the son of a great person. So we give him respect. That is also okay, giving respect, but he cannot claim that he is like the father. Just like somebody's father is a great heart surgeon. If the son is not qualified as a heart surgeon, how can the son be referred to as a great heart surgeon? It is not proper and it is not to be referred that way. Similarly, even though the father is a great brahmana, the son should not be referred to as a great brahmana. So it will be described in the later portion of this chapter that because he happened to be, Ashwathama happened to be the son of a great personality, Dronacharya, so he was excused from capital punishment. He was excused from being killed. So Arjuna decided not to kill him. Even later on it will be described because he happened to be, the consideration was, Guru putra, he is the son of my teacher. If he dies, this Ashwathama is killed because of the mistake he has done. He deserves to be killed, but if he is killed, his mother, whose Dronacharya's wife, will be unhappy. So it is Draupadi who advised Arjuna, "Don't kill Ashwathama, because then her, his mother, Ashwathama's mother, will be unhappy. She is innocent. She is not at fault." So he spared his life. That is what Draupadi said.

**Key Quote:** "The Brahmastra could be the only way he could protect himself. Now Brahmastra is to be used in a very very very extraordinary circumstance. It is the last weapon somebody may use."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Ashwathama's use of the Brahmastra and its effects, comparing it to a nuclear weapon, and explains how Krishna advised Arjuna to counteract it, contrasting it with the lack of counteraction for modern nuclear weapons.

Now he was running on the back of a horse, but when he saw that Arjuna is coming nearer, he thought that the Brahmastra could be the only way he could protect himself. Now Brahmastra is to be used in a very, very, very extraordinary circumstance. It is the last weapon somebody may use. And Draupadi explains it is similar to the modern nuclear weapon. It releases lot of radiation. When Ashwathama actually, the description will be there later on, Ashwathama releases Brahmastra, there was so much radiation, people were feeling terrible heat, and Arjuna inquired from Krishna, "What is the cause for this terrible heat spreading everywhere?" So Krishna informed, "This heat is due to Ashwathama releasing the Brahmastra." Krishna, Krishna is the supreme lord, the paramatma, the super soul in everyone's heart. He knows. So Krishna informed Arjuna and Krishna also informed Arjuna, "Now you counteract this Brahmastra by releasing another Brahmastra to neutralize." Formerly they had this knowledge, if I throw one kind of weapon, somebody else may neutralize that weapon by throwing another weapon, counteraction. But Prabhupada points out, now they have this nuclear weapon, but there is no system of counteracting it. They do not have any counteraction.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the regulated warfare of Kshatriyas, including the use of different weapons and their counteraction, contrasting it with the lack of principles and regulations in modern warfare, and concludes the lecture with gratitude and Hare Krishna.

And even Kshatriyas, when they would fight, if one Kshatriya releases a particular weapon, just like a fire weapon, may be counteracted by a water weapon. This is unknown in modern science. It is unknown. There were weapons, not only fire weapons, there were water weapons, there were wind weapons, and there were of course the arrows made of earth, earthly element, like that. There were different kinds of weapons and they were expert in counteracting a particular weapon. And also formerly when a battle is being fought, then if the opposite party, the Kshatriyas killed, that is the end of the battle. There is no more fighting. So that was the system. It was highly regulated, but now modern warfare is not so much based on principles and regulations, but Kshatriyas used to be regulated. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "It can destroy a whole universe that is the kind of power this Brahmastra has."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of Srimad Bhagavatam 1.7.20, focusing on Ashwathama's use of the Brahmastra and its destructive power.

Athopas Prishya Salilam Sandadhetat Samahitah Ajanan Api Samharam Prana Krishra Upasthite. The meaning of this verse as translated by Srila Prabhupada: Since his life was in danger, he touched water in sanctity and concentrated upon the chanting of the hymns for throwing nuclear weapons, although he did not know how to withdraw such weapons. So, the description is that Ashwathama, when he realized his life was in danger after he had beheaded the five sleeping sons of Draupadi, and he wanted to please his master Duryodhana, and Duryodhana was not at all pleased with this act of Ashwathama, and Arjuna, when he learned from Draupadi that Ashwathama has killed her sons, five sleeping sons, then Arjuna vowed to punish this Ashwathama. So, Arjuna started chasing Ashwathama, and Ashwathama was trying to escape, but his horse became tired. On the horseback, his horse became tired, and he realized he can't go any further, and Arjuna is chasing on a chariot, and Arjuna is accompanied by Krishna, who was acting as the Sarathi, the chariot driver of Arjuna. This towards the end of the battle of Kurukshetra. So, this verse describes that this Ashwathama, since his life was in danger, he decided to use the ultimate weapon, the Brahmastra, to protect his son from the evil of the Kurukshetra, and he decided to use the ultimate weapon, the Brahmastra, to protect himself, and he did not have complete knowledge of using this Brahmastra weapon. He knew how to release this weapon, but he did not know how to withdraw it, so he didn't have complete knowledge, and it is, it is like a nuclear weapon. Srila Prabhupada explains this Brahmastra is like a nuclear weapon, it has got tremendous amount of radiation that is generated. And what is the kind of power of this Brahmastra?

**Summary:** The lecture explains the science behind mantra weapons, emphasizing the importance of purification and proper technique.

It can destroy a whole universe, that is the kind of power this Brahmastra has. Of course, this Brahmastra is a weapon that is released by a chanting mantra. This science is unknown in the modern times. This science of utilizing a particular sound to generate an effect. So, how did he release this weapon, this Ashwatthama? He touched water in sanctity. The Sanskrit says that Upasprishya Salilam. Salilam means water. He touched water. And how did he do it? He did it in sanctity. So, there is a certain procedure for using this weapon, which is a mantra weapon. So, chanting the mantra requires that one has to purify oneself by touching water, and then chanting that mantra. Now, the chanting is not simply some casual vibration of the tongue, no, it is the technique of chanting this mantra by a qualified chanter. Now, this is the science that is not known in modern times, but it was, it is there even now, it's there, and it was certainly used in the times of the Battle of Mahabharata, battle of Kurukshetra 5,000 years back. It is described in the Ramayana, it is described in the Mahabharata, described in the Puranas how to use mantra weapons, different kinds of mantra weapons.

**Key Quote:** "Even if he let us say was trying to use it against arjuna he should have known how to release it the the the weapon the brahmastra strikes arjuna and comes back but he did not know how to withdraw"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Ashwathama's incomplete knowledge of the Brahmastra and the potential consequences of its improper use.

So, mantra weapons were used in those times, and they used to learn how to use it from the expert. You can learn this from the expert provided you follow the instructions. So, this Ashwathama sandhade tatsamahitah, he chanted the hymns. Sandhade means he chanted the hymns. Even when we practice chanting, we should know that Amitabha is with us. So, yeah, the mantra will come in our mind. After it comes in our mind, the mind wants to know what is transformation, whatever is the intention of manifestation, and what is the three things that make the first step, it is coming in our form. So, again the mantra will come into your mind. sound vibration, but here it's also said ajanan api samharam, he did not know how to withdraw this. Samara means to withdraw, he did not know how to withdraw this weapon, but still he decided to use this weapon to save himself, and the reason is prana krishre upasti te, when his life was in danger. Prana krisra means this life was in danger, and in such a situation he decided, even though he did not know the complete usage of this weapon, he decided, even though he did not know the complete usage of this mantra weapon, he did not know completely how to use it, because he was able to release it but not withdraw. So, formally they even knew how to withdraw the weapon after its particular use. Let's say the weapon has to strike one particular target, and then after it has destroyed a particular target, then withdraw the weapon. So, that is the, that is the complete usage, a proper usage of that weapon, but this Ashwatthama did not know how to withdraw. Even if he, let us say, was trying to use it against Arjuna, he should have known how to release it, the weapon, the Brahmastra strikes Arjuna and comes back, but he did not know how to withdraw, so the damage it will do will be much, much, much, much more than the intended purpose.

**Summary:** The lecture criticizes Ashwathama's unscrupulous behavior and contrasts modern gross methods of material manipulation with more subtle ancient techniques.

But still this Ashwatthama was not really a principled person, he was unscrupulous, so he was, because his life was in danger, somehow save himself now, and without even really being bothered about the destruction this can do. So, we'll see in the later verses what all happens. Now, Srila Prabhupada explains the subtle forms in the purport, the subtle forms of material activities finer than grosser methods of material manipulation. Right now in modern times, we only know gross method of using matter. Just like fire weapons, they are fired from a missile or from a gun, and then the ammunition is striking a target, and it is mainly the manipulation of the element called fire, fire weapons. Formerly they used to have water weapons, they used to have wind weapons. So, that is unknown in modern time, they do not have any water weapons or wind weapons, because a fire weapon can be counteracted by a water weapon. So, that is unknown in modern times. Now, there is something beyond even this gross usage of fire weapons or water weapons or wind weapons. That is Prabhupada

**Key Quote:** "Just by chanting the mantra, mantra means the power of sound."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the subtle sound vibration of the Brahmastra with the spiritual sound vibration of the Hare Krishna mantra, emphasizing the importance of chanting purely and learning from an expert.

explains subtle forms of material activities are affected through purification of sound. Just by chanting the mantra, mantra means the power of sound. But, it is chanted by using a particular technique. Prabhupada calls it here purification of sound, just like we are engaged in chanting the Hare Krishna mantra. This Hare Krishna mantra is a spiritual sound vibration. It is not even a subtle sound. It is a mantra of incorrect meaning. A mantra means a purification of sound. This mantra is a spiritual sound vibration. It is not even a subtle sound, it is a mantra is a spiritual sound vibration. It is not even a subtle sound, it is a mantra spiritual sound. Now, spiritual sound is beyond gross and subtle matter, it is beyond gross and subtle matter, but here what is being talked of as the use of Brahmastra is a subtle sound vibration utilized to generate this astra, this weapon, release this weapon, and there is a technique of using another mantra for withdrawing it. That mantra this Ashwatthama did not know. So, Prabhupada tells, if the power of a subtle sound is so much that it can be used to generate a Brahmastra which is equivalent of a nuclear weapon, it is capable of massive destruction, it has got so much destructive power, so then we can hardly imagine what is the power of the spiritual sound vibration of properly chanting Hare Krishna. If you chant Hare Krishna right, you will learn to chant Hare Krishna from Shriyeila Prabhupada who is the expert spiritual master. So, Prabhupada says to chant Hare Krishna effectively, we should learn how to chant offencelessly. We should chant the Hare Krishna mantra avoiding the 10 kinds of offences, dasha with the aparatha wait a while. So, we have to learn, we have to practice, we have to learn and practice how to chant Hare Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "It can nullify millions of lifetimes of sinful reactions that a person might have committed"
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by highlighting the immense spiritual benefits of chanting the Hare Krishna mantra purely, including the nullification of sinful reactions and the attainment of Krishna Prema.

Because you chant Hare Krishna purely, it has the power to nullify all the sinful reactions of your millions of lifetimes, that is the power of chanting Hare Krishna, and that's not the complete power. I'm just telling you one effect of purely chanting Hare Krishna, one effect. What is that? It can nullify millions of lifetimes of sinful reactions that a person might have committed. It doesn't matter how much sinful reactions the person has got, everything, all sinful reactions hundred percent nullified just by once chanting purely. But the real benefit of chanting Hare Krishna is not just nullifying the offense, the sinful reactions, it is actually able to give us Krishna Prema, the highest perfection of spiritual life itself. It awakens our Krishna Bhakti, Krishna Prema, and we are able to establish our loving relationship with Krishna. So that is the real ultimate benefit of chanting Hare Krishna purely.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, only you are competent to instill fearlessness in the hearts of your devotees."
**Summary:** Arjuna's statement highlights that only devotees of Krishna can achieve fearlessness and liberation from material miseries.

In this session we will be discussing from the 21st and 22nd verses of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. So the 21st verse, ततप् प्रादुष्कृतं तेजः प्रचंडं सर्वतोधिषं प्राणापदं अभिप्रेक्ष विष्णुम् जिष्णुर् वाचः। The meaning of these words, विष्णुम् जिष्णुर् वाचः। विष्णु is Lord Krishna, जिष्णु is Arjuna. So Arjuna began to address Krishna upon seeing that glaring light spreading in all directions and he thought his own life is in danger. The next words, the 22nd words, अर्जुन वाचः। What did Arjuna tell Krishna? कृष्ण कृष्ण महाबाहो भक्तानाम् अभयन्दुष्कृष्ण। त्वमेको दह्यमानाम् अपवर्गोशि संसृतेः। The meaning of these 22nd words. अर्जुन वाचः। Arjuna said, ओ मैं लोड श्री कृष्ण। कृष्ण कृष्ण महाबाहो। यु अर्जुन वाचः। तुम्हे को दह्यमानाम् अपवर्गोषि संसृतेः। Therefore, only you are competent to instill fearlessness in the hearts of your devotees. Everyone in the flames of material miseries can find the path of liberation in you only.

**Key Quote:** "All others who are not devotees, who are not devotees of Krishna, they are always in a situation where any time there can be fearlessness."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the four characteristics of material existence: eating, sleeping, fearing, and mating, emphasizing the constant presence of fear for non-devotees.

So, by Arjuna's statement, we can understand what is the position of a devotee. Only a devotee is fearless in this material world. All others who are not devotees, who are not devotees of Krishna, they are always in a situation where any time there can be fearlessness. There is no cause for fear of some danger, due to some danger, material danger. And Krishna is the unlimited Supreme Lord. Therefore, only Krishna can give complete protection to anyone who takes shelter of him. But who takes shelter of Krishna, it's only his devotees. Non-devotees, they may think that they are safe, or they have some different arrangements for their safety, for their protection. But actually, in this material world, there are four characteristics of material existence. There are four characteristics of material existence: Ahara, Nidra, Bhaya, Maithunam, Jaa. Everyone is in need of food for their subsistence. Ahara, Nidra, they are required to take some rest, sleep. And Bhaya, there is always fear due to some danger, one form or the other. So many different kinds of dangers are there in this world. And Maithunam, the demand for sex, sex indulgence.

**Summary:** Krishna is the giver of fearlessness to his devotees, as Arjuna experienced during the Kurukshetra war.

So, these four things are common for all living beings who have taken birth in this material world under the laws of karma. So, that fear factor is always there. But Krishna is Bhaktanam Abhayankara. He is the giver of fearlessness. He awards fearlessness to whom? To those who take his shelter, his devotees. Everyone in the flames of material miseries can find the path of liberation in you only. So, Shrida Prabhupada explains, Arjuna was aware of the transcendental qualities of Lord Sri Krishna as he had already experienced them during the Kurukshetra war in which both of them were present. Even though Krishna was not fighting in that battle, he agreed to become Arjuna's chariot driver, to guide Arjuna. And the Pandavas, of course. Not just Arjuna alone, all the Pandavas.

**Key Quote:** "Because the Pandavas had Krishna as their guide, they were able to cross this most dangerous ocean."
**Summary:** Shankaracharya's analogy of the Kurukshetra battlefield as a dangerous ocean illustrates how Krishna's guidance enabled the Pandavas to overcome the Kauravas' superior strength.

So, Arjuna had already experienced how in spite of big, big generals on the opposite side. This is very nicely described by Shankaracharya. He says, Bhishma Drona, Tata Jayadrata Jala, Gandhara Neelotpala, Shalya Grahavati, Kripenavahini, Karnena Velakula, Ashwathama Vikarana Ghoramakara, Duryodhana Avarthini, Soktirna Kalu Pandavai Rananadi, Kaivartaka Keshavaha. The Pandavas, in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, they did not have much strength, military strength as compared to the Kauravas. Of course, Bhima and Arjuna were very, very, very powerful fighters. They were maharathis. But on the opposite side, on the Kaurava side, there were so many maharathis. And among them, Bhishma and Drona, the topmost. Among all those present at that time, the topmost maharathis were on Kaurava's side, Bhishma and Drona. And not only that, Karna and Ashwathama, Vikarna, Duryodhana. So, in this verse, it is listed all these great fighters. Maharathis, chariot fighters, single-handed, they could face thousands of other warriors. They could kill in a combat, military combat. So, in spite of so much of strength on the Kaurava side, because the Pandavas had Krishna as their guide, they were able to cross this most dangerous ocean. Shankaracharya compares the battlefield to an ocean. And the Pandavas, they had to cross this dangerous ocean full of all kinds of sharks, all kinds of whirlpools, all kinds of crocodiles. Imagine, a person has to cross a water body, which is like an ocean. The vastness of the army strength of the Kauravas. In spite of that, because Krishna was their guide. Therefore, they crossed without being vanquished by the Kaurava army.

**Summary:** Arjuna's experience confirms Krishna's role as the source of fearlessness for devotees, who are always protected by the Lord.

So, Arjuna has already got experience how Krishna protected the Pandavas very nicely. Therefore, Arjuna's version of Lord Krishna is authoritative. Krishna is almighty and is especially the cause of fearlessness for the devotees. Krishna is the cause of all fearlessness for the devotees. A devotee of the Lord is always fearless. There's another song written by Govinda Das Thakur. He says, my dear mind, always sing the glories of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Nanda Nandana. Krishna has got many names of which this name Nanda Nandana, the beloved son of Maharaj Nanda. Shri Nanda Nandana, Abhaya Charanaravindare. Because, his lotus feet is the cause of fearlessness. One who takes shelter of Krishna's lotus feet can be fearless in this material world. So, here Prabhupada says, a devotee of the Lord is always fearless because of the protection given by the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna alone can extinguish this forest fire of material existence."
**Summary:** Material existence is compared to a forest fire, which only Krishna's mercy can extinguish.

Material existence is something like a blazing fire in the forest. What does Arjuna say here? That, Tvam eko dahyamananam. Material world is sometimes compared to a forest fire. Supposing somebody is in the middle of a forest. And suddenly, there is a forest fire. And that fire spreads very, very, very quickly because, especially if it is summer, and the wood is dry, the trees, it will spread very quickly. And what if a person is caught up in the middle of a forest fire? Every direction he sees, he sees a blazing fire. So, is there a possibility he can escape? Yes, only one possibility. Only if there is a big rainfall which pours down heavily from the sky and then extinguishes this forest fire. See, it is not easy to extinguish a forest fire. Only a huge rainfall from a dense rain cloud which pours down completely extinguishes the forest fire. Then a person is safe. So, Krishna alone can extinguish this forest fire of material existence. Only Krishna can extinguish.

**Summary:** The spiritual master, like Krishna, rescues conditioned souls from the suffering of material existence, showering mercy like rainfall to extinguish the fire.

And he extinguishes by the mercy of rainfall. Same, similar prayer we offer to the spiritual master. samsara-davanala-lidha-loka-tranaya-karunya-ghanaghanatvam The spiritual master comes to this world, just like Krishna comes, to rescue the conditioned souls who are suffering in the blazing fire of material existence. Material existence is like filled with so many miseries. That is the nature of material existence. Therefore, it is also said, manashashtanindriyani prakrutisthani karshati In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says living entities are simply engaged in a struggle for existence. So, that struggle for existence can be put to an end immediately if we take shelter of lotus feet of Krishna, who can actually shower. Or the lotus feet of Krishna's representative, the bona fide spiritual master, the pure devotee spiritual master, Srila Prabhupada. Take shelter of Prabhupada's lotus feet. Vande gro Sri Charanaravindam. So, we take shelter. Take shelter of Prabhupada's lotus feet. Then Prabhupada also can bring down the shower of mercy of Krishna, because he is always in touch with Krishna. So, he can bring down the mercy rainfall, which will extinguish this blazing fire of material existence.

So, we should actually take shelter of Krishna. Like Arjuna is teaching us through this prayer. Arjuna thought his life was in danger when he suddenly saw. Actually, this was the Brahmastra that was released by Ashwatthama to protect himself. But Arjuna did not know that, that the cause of that radiation suddenly he saw is spreading everywhere. And his own life in danger. He did not know what is the cause. So, he is addressing Krishna. Only you can protect me. You can save my life. Where is this? He is going to ask him the next words while addressing Krishna. Where is this radiation coming from? My dear Lord, I do not know. Please, can you tell me? And of course, Arjuna has taken shelter of Krishna completely as a devotee. But we should also learn how to take shelter of Krishna and thereby be saved from the dangers of material existence. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Helping us understand who is Krishna or what is Krishnas position"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Arjuna's role as a devotee and how he helps us understand Krishna's position as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

These are words spoken by Arjuna. Arjuna is seeing suddenly a radiation emitting from some source, and it is spreading all over the sky. And he is inquiring from Krishna, what is this radiation that is spreading? Now, before he actually puts forward his actual question, as a devotee, he is helping us understand who is Krishna, or what is Krishna's position. So he is describing that Krishna's position is that of the supreme personality of Godhead. What does that mean? So he has stated in this specific description here, Adhyaha Purusha Sakshat Sakshat Eeshwaraha.

**Key Quote:** "As far as the absolute truth is concerned, 1 plus 1 equal to 1, 1 minus 1 is also equal to 1"
**Summary:** The speaker explains Krishna's position as the original personality of Godhead and how He expands Himself without diminishing His potency, using the analogy of absolute truth.

Prakriteparaha, like that. So Srila Prabhupada explains elaborately in the purport what is Krishna's position. So the first point here is Krishna is the original personality of Godhead. Original because every other form of God is an expansion of Krishna's original form. That's why Krishna is called original personality of Godhead. And he expands himself all over the creations. Krishna expands, therefore Krishna is present everywhere throughout the creation because he expands himself. Expansion means his power is not diminished. His original form is all powerful. The expanded form is also all powerful. Now this is difficult for us to understand, but Srila Prabhupada says in a very simple way, as far as the absolute truth is concerned, 1 plus 1 equals 1. 1 minus 1 is also equal to 1. That means the Supreme Lord is present with all his potencies. When he expands into another form, then the original form has all the potencies. The expanded form also has all the potencies. So when he expands into another form,

**Key Quote:** "Simply by surrendering to the lotus feet of Krishna, we become free from the influence of maya"
**Summary:** The speaker quotes the Bhagavad Gita and Chaitanya Charitamrita to explain how surrendering to Krishna frees one from maya and ignorance, using the analogy of the sun dispelling darkness.

The expanded form also has equally got all the potencies. So this is only possible for the Supreme Lord because he is the absolute truth. Now Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport. First of all, Prabhupada quotes the Bhagavad Gita. He says, the Lord states in the Bhagavad Gita that the one who surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Lord can get released from the clutches of nescience. Ma mevaye prapadyante maya metam tarantite. So simply by surrendering to the lotus feet of Krishna, we become free from the influence of maya, because of which we get out of the clutches of ignorance, nescience. So further, Srila Prabhupada is quoting the Chaitanya Charitamrita and saying Krishna is just like the sun, and maya or material existence is just like darkness. Krishna suryasama mayahoy andhakar. Wherever there is light of the sun, darkness or ignorance at once vanishes. So therefore, it is now explained here, the best means to get out of the world of ignorance is suggested here.

**Key Quote:** "From him all other personalities of Godhead expand"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that all other personalities of Godhead expand from Krishna, differentiating between Swamsa (the Lord himself) and Vibhinamsa (separated expansions like living beings).

What is that best means? That the Lord is addressed herein as the original personality of Godhead. From him, all other personalities of Godhead expand. From him, from the original personality of Godhead, Krishna, all other personalities expand. The all pervasive Lord Vishnu is Lord Krishna's plenary portion or expansion. Vishnu, who is all pervading in this material world, he is an expansion of Krishna. As I told earlier, Krishna expands means Krishna as the original person always remains without any diminishing potency. The Lord expands himself in innumerable forms of Godhead and living beings. Even we living beings are expansions of the Lord, but we are called Vibhinamsa. We are separated expansion. And the forms of the Supreme Lord as Vishnu Tatva, Rama, Narasimha, Varaha, they are called Swamsa.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Sri Krishna is the original primeval Lord from whom everything expands"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna is the source of everything, including all energies, and quotes the Bhagavad Gita to support this point.

Swamsa means the Lord himself with all his potencies expands in many forms. So the Lord expands himself in innumerable forms of Godhead and living beings along with his different energies. Now, at any time, the Lord is never without his energy. Energies are always present eternally as the energy, and the Lord is always present as the Lord. And the Lord is always the controller of all the energies. But Sri Krishna is the original primeval Lord from whom everything expands. So that original form from whom everything expands is Krishna. Krishna says this in the Bhagavad Gita, Aham sarvasya prabhavo Matta sarvam pravartate. Krishna says, I am the source of all, everything in existence, and therefore from me only everything emanates. That's what Krishna says.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the all-pervasive feature of the Lord is a partial representation and that Krishna, as the Supreme Lord, is beyond the actions and reactions of material nature.

Matta sarvam pravartate. The all pervasive feature of the Lord experienced within manifested world, this world we are talking about, the all pervasive feature of the Lord is also a partial representation of the Lord. It's a partial representation because the original personality of Godhead is actually the Supreme Lord himself. Therefore, Paramatma is included within him. Paramatma is included within the Bhagavan feature. Within the Vishnu Tatva, Paramatma feature is included. He is the absolute personality of Godhead. He means here Krishna. Krishna is the absolute personality of Godhead. He has nothing to do with the actions and reactions of the material manifestation. In this material world, constantly there is some interaction between the gunas, producing actions and reactions both. But Krishna is not within this material nature. He is far above the material creation.

**Key Quote:** "Light exists independent of darkness, but darkness is absence of light"
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of darkness and light to explain that Krishna is full of bliss and transcendental variegatedness, independent of material existence.

Darkness is a perverse representation of the sun, and therefore the existence of darkness depends on the existence of the sun. When we say darkness exists dependent upon the sun means when the sun is shining in the sky, there is no possibility of darkness. When the sun goes out of our vision, then there is darkness. But even that darkness, when the sun is gone to the other side, still that darkness can immediately be dispelled as soon as the moon rises. The sun sets on the horizon and the moon rises. Now that moonshine can immediately dispel the darkness. So that is to be also understood, that existence of darkness depends on sun or light, but existence of light doesn't depend on darkness. Light exists independent of darkness, but darkness is absence of light. This has to be carefully understood. The sun is never without any trace of darkness. Similarly, the absolute personality of Godhead beyond the material existence is always full of bliss. He is not only full of bliss, but also full of transcendental variegatedness. He is full of spiritual variety. Transcendence is not at all static,

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is also simultaneously controller of this material energy by his omnipotence"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna is independent of material nature and its modes, yet He controls the material energy through His representatives.

But full of dynamic variegatedness. And Krishna is also distinctly different from the material nature. It is the material nature which is complicated by the interactions of the three gunas. Therefore, Krishna being totally independent of this material modes or material existence, he is independent of that. Therefore, Krishna is absolute. Krishna has many, many energies, and through these energies only he creates, maintains, destroys the whole material world. He does that. In Krishna's personal abode, there is no creation, there is no matter, there is no material defects. That is particularly explained in the Bhagavad Gita specifically, that Krishna is free from all these material energy, material manifestation. Krishna is free, completely free from that. But Krishna is also simultaneously controller of this material energy. By his omnipotence, he simultaneously is aloof from this material energy, and he also controls it through his representatives, the three directors of the gunas. He controls through them.

### Krishna's incarnation, Causeless mercy, Material qualification
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/emvbgY9Uu2A?t=56
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The personality of God is Sri Krishna out of his causeless mercy."
**Summary:** This segment explains that Krishna incarnates out of causeless mercy, not influenced by material qualifications, and cannot be attracted through material means.

This session will be discussing from the 24th verse of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Sa eva jeeva lokasya maya mohita cheta saha vidhatsye svayena viryena shreyo dharmadi lakshanam. The meaning of this verse is, and yet, though you are beyond the purview of the material energy, you execute the four principles of liberation, characterized by religion, and so on, for the ultimate good of the conditioned souls. This is a very important verse which explains when Krishna incarnates, if somebody looks at Krishna, they may be unable to recognize him as the Supreme Lord because he appears like another ordinary person. He appears like another created being, but he is not. He is not a created being. He is not an ordinary person. He is the Supreme Lord. That we explained by Prabhupada in the purport. Prabhupada says, "The personality of God is Sri Krishna. Out of his causeless mercy..." Krishna's mercy is described as causeless. That means there is no material cause for that mercy. There is no material cause. So therefore, to attract the attention of Krishna, or to get Krishna's mercy, we cannot do that. We cannot expect to get that mercy by having some material qualification, having some material opulence, having some material power, or having some material punya. We cannot expect to get any mercy from the Supreme Lord.

### Devotional service, Pure devotee, Transcendental situation

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "If you want his mercy, you have to render devotional service."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that Krishna is pleased by devotional service and taking shelter of a pure devotee, highlighting the transcendental position of both the Lord and His devotees.

No. So it is explained here, then why is it called the Supreme Lord? It is called causeless. It is causeless because the Lord does not consider any material attributes when he has to shower his blessings or mercy upon somebody. He is simply pleased by devotional service. If you want his mercy, you have to render devotional service. If you want his mercy, you take shelter of the pure devotee who is himself under the complete shelter and protection of the Supreme Lord. So these are all secrets of Bhakti revealed in the scriptures like Bhagavatam. So here it is told by Prabhupada, "The personality of God is Sri Krishna. Out of his causeless mercy, descends on the material world without being influenced by the material modes of nature." Krishna comes down from the spiritual world. He comes to this material world, but he is never influenced by the material modes of nature. That means he is not subject to Sattva Guna, or Rajya Guna, or Tama Guna, or any combination. No. Then he is always transcendentally situated, Shuddha Sattva. Even the pure devotees who are coming from the spiritual world, even they are transcendentally situated. They are also transcendentally situated. That is the position of the devotee.

### Material manifestation, Causeless mercy, Reclaiming fallen souls

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "He descends out of his causeless mercy only to reclaim the fallen souls."
**Summary:** This segment explains that Krishna is beyond the material world and descends out of causeless mercy to reclaim fallen souls who desire material enjoyment.

That is also the position of the Lord. So Srila Prabhupada further says, "Krishna is eternally beyond the material manifestation." Material manifestation means material creation, material planets, material universe, or universes, because there are many material universes. So material universe, all these are actually beyond. He is beyond this material world, even though he comes to this material world and appears to be like an ordinary person engaged in some ordinary activities. Apparently he looks like he is also under the modes, but he is never under the modes. He is never influenced by the material energy. He is not affected by the three gunas. He descends out of his causeless mercy only to reclaim the fallen souls. See, this is the reason why he comes. He has got a specific purpose. What is that? To reclaim the fallen souls. That means the fallen souls have come to this material world because of having a desire to enjoy materially. That's all. Therefore Krishna comes to save them, to rescue them.

### Illusory energy, Spiritual enlightenment, Conditioned souls

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The lord comes to reclaim the fallen conditioned souls."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how the illusory energy captivates fallen souls, leading them to make plans for material enjoyment, and how the Lord arranges for them to take shelter of His lotus feet and become spiritually enlightened.

Because even if we make plans for enjoying in this material world, we will always be unsuccessful. We are not meant to achieve success through some different methods suggested in the scriptures. No, we are not meant to do that. All those different aspects of illusion in this material world, because of which somebody thinks, "I can enjoy, I can become the lord," that is due to the influence of the illusory energy. And accordingly, the Supreme Lord also makes his arrangement for someone to actually take shelter of his lotus feet and also become free from the influence of the material energy, come out of the illusory influence. So then one becomes actually spiritually enlightened, and then spiritual awakening happens. Of course, these all go step by step, but the fact is the Lord comes to reclaim the fallen conditioned souls. He wants to take them back to his personal abode. So therefore, it is described here, these fallen souls are captivated by the illusory energy. They are completely captivated by the illusory energy. They are making so many plans, and they even think that they are safe within this material world. They forget what is the real nature of the material world.

### Kindness of the Lord, Reclaiming fallen souls, Purpose of Incarnation

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The supreme lord who incarnates for the sake of reclaiming the fallen conditioned souls, He is very very kind to these fallen souls."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the Lord's kindness in incarnating to reclaim fallen souls and making arrangements for them to turn their attention towards Him, glorifying Srila Prabhupada and previous acharyas for the same mission.

So the Supreme Lord who incarnates for the sake of reclaiming the fallen conditioned souls, he is very, very kind to these fallen souls. So he makes so much of arrangements so that somehow the souls will turn their attention towards the Lord, who is present in our heart as Paramatma, who comes from time to time in the form of incarnation visible to the common people. Like that, the Lord has got so many different ways in which he actually has made arrangements to reclaim the fallen conditioned souls. We say that Premadwani, that Jai Om Vishnupad Paramahamsa Parivrajakacharya His divine grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. We are glorifying Srila Prabhupada because Prabhupada has come for the same purpose. Prabhupada has come for reclaiming the fallen conditioned souls. So we glorify the previous acharyas. They also come to this world for the same purpose. We glorify the river Ganga. Why? Because Ganga's appearance in this material world is for the purpose of purifying the conditioned souls so that they become eligible to go back to the spiritual world. You see, same mission. River Ganga, river Yamuna, Ganga mai ki jai, Yamuna mai ki jai. Then Bhakti Devi ki jai, Tursi Devi ki jai. Tursi has appeared in this world again for the same purpose for which the Lord comes to reclaim the conditioned souls.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "By seeing Tursi, one becomes purified in the heart."
**Summary:** This segment explains how Tulsi assists in reclaiming conditioned souls through purification, and how the material energy influences them to seek enjoyment in material nature under false pretenses.

How does Tursi assist the Lord in this reclaiming the conditioned souls? That simply by seeing Tursi, one becomes purified in the heart. Then what is the result of purification? One can easily take to devotional service and prepare oneself to go back to God. Like that, all the different personalities mentioned in the Prema Dvani are actually assisting the Lord in his mission of reclaiming the fallen conditioned souls. Now, the conditioned souls, they are attacked by the material energy. Attacked means they are influenced. Material energy influences, the illusory energy influences them. So under the influence, they simply want to enjoy material nature. Under false pretext, they make big, big plans for enjoying, exploiting the resource of material nature. But material nature cannot be the source of pleasure, the source of enjoyment, never, because by its inherent characteristic, material energy is actually illusory energy, always presenting something which looks like real, but actually is not real. That is an illusion.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Our real enjoyment is in the spiritual world."
**Summary:** This segment highlights that material energy presents illusion, and real enjoyment lies in the spiritual world with Krishna, emphasizing the importance of faith in the Acharya for purification and liberation.

So Prabhupada says, "The living entity is unable to enjoy in this material world because in essence the material energy is simply presenting illusion, presenting illusion." Our real enjoyment is in the spiritual world. Our real enjoyment is spiritual. Our real enjoyment is in association with Krishna. We belong to Krishna. So therefore, when we understand these facts, we develop faith in the words of the Supreme Lord. We develop faith in the words of the Acharya, and when we take shelter of the Acharya, then we are easily able to purify ourselves and become eligible to get out of this illusory energy, to go to the spiritual world in our eternal position, eternal existence, full of bliss and knowledge, like the Lord is situated, full of bliss and knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "Originally everyone is a servant of Krishna."
**Summary:** This segment explains that everyone is originally a servant of Krishna but forgets this truth when desiring material enjoyment, and the Lord's all-merciful nature is exhibited when He comes to reclaim fallen souls.

Further also, Prabhupada says, "Originally everyone is a servant of Krishna, but one forgets this truth when one desires to enjoy the material world, and when one thinks of enjoying, though there is lot of promise, but actually only one in illusion will think this material world as real, as something really enjoyable." No, it is never enjoyable. It is never real. So it is said here, "The all-merciful nature of the Lord is exhibited when he simply comes for the sake of reclaiming the fallen conditioned souls." So that is the way the Lord displays his all-merciful nature.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 25th, 26th, and 27th verses of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. So the 25th verse is as follows: Tathayam Chavataraste Bhuvabhara Jehirshaya Svanam Chananya Bhavanam Anudhyanaya Chasasya Sakrit. The meaning of this verse is: Thus you descend as an incarnation to remove the burden of the world and to benefit your friends, especially those who are your exclusive devotees and are wrapped in meditation upon you.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord is everyone's father, aham bijapratapitah that's what Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, he is the seed-giving Father of all living entities."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the Lord's relationship with all beings, emphasizing that while He is equal to everyone, He is more inclined towards His devotees, who are considered His kinsmen.

These are words spoken by Arjuna. Arjuna has seen a glare in the sky, a radiation, and he wants to ask Krishna what is the source of this radiation, and before that, he is offering prayers. So in this prayer, this particular prayer Arjuna is offering, he is describing Krishna's descent as Avatara. You descend as an incarnation to remove the burden of the world. When the world is overburdened by the miscreants, those who are law-breakers, when the world is overburdened by those who are the leaders of God, then and are wrapped in meditation upon you, the devotees are entirely dependent upon Krishna for everything. They have no other dependence. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, it appears that the Lord is partial to his devotees. It appears like that, but actually, the fact is, He is not partial, but the fact is, everyone is related with the Lord. Everyone has got a relationship with the Lord. It's not just the devotees alone who have a relationship. He is equal to everyone. That is the meaning of Supreme Lord. He is equal to everyone, yet he is more inclined to his own men and devotees. He is more inclined to his own men, that is, who are his own men? Devotees. The Lord is everyone's father, aham bijapratapitah. That's what Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita. He is the seed-giving Father of all living entities. So therefore, it is described here by Srila Prabhupada, the Lord is everyone's Father, no one can be his father, and yet no one can be his son. This relationship, what we understand in the material world, somebody's father or somebody's son, that kind of relationship doesn't apply to Krishna. So,

**Key Quote:** "This is his transcendental pastime, it is pastime, this is Leela and it has nothing to do with mundane ideas of relations, fatherhood or anything like that."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that Krishna's relationships and pastimes are transcendental and should not be understood through a material lens, as the Lord is above the modes of material nature.

Srila Prabhupada further explains, his devotees are his kinsmen and his devotees are his relations. This is his transcendental pastime, it is pastime, this is Leela, and it has nothing to do with mundane ideas of relations, fatherhood, or anything like that. Materially, we know somebody is my father, somebody is my son, somebody is my friend, somebody is my relative. Those kind of material ideas should not be carried in our mind when we try to understand Krishna's incarnation or descent in this world. As mentioned above, the Lord is above the modes of material nature. He is always transcendental to the modes. And thus there is nothing mundane about his kinsmen and relations in devotional service. Nothing material. Everything is completely transcendental. So therefore, it is described as a transcendental pastime.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces verse 26, focusing on Arjuna's question about a dangerous effulgence and highlighting the importance of offering prayers before addressing the Lord, even for intimate friends.

The 26th verse is. Now Arjuna is stating what is the problem, that the meaning of this verse. O Lord of Lords, he has addressed Krishna as Deva Deva. He is the Lord of Lords. Krishna is Lord of Lords. How is it that this dangerous effulgence is spreading all around? Where does it come from? I do not understand it. So this is what Arjuna's question is to Krishna. Suddenly Arjuna has seen this dangerous effulgence spreading everywhere, and he does not know the source. So he is asking Krishna, please tell me what is the source of this? So Srila Prabhupada says in the Purport, anything that is presented before the personality of Godhead should be so done after due presentation of respectful prayers. That is the proper etiquette. Krishna is not an ordinary person. So before one wants to ask anything, one has to offer prayers to the Lord. That is the standard procedure. And Shree Arjuna, although an intimate friend of the Lord, is observing this method for general information. Arjuna is actually a very, very close friend of Krishna, but still, he's following the etiquette that a devotee should follow when addressing the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "Know from me that this is the act of the son of Drona. He has thrown the hymns of nuclear energy, Brahmastra, and he does not know how to retract the glare."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces verse 27, explaining Krishna's response about the Brahmastra released by Ashwathama, comparing it to a modern nuclear weapon and emphasizing its creation through subtle sound (mantras).

prayers had to be offered. The 27th verse, Shri Bhagavanuvacha, now the Lord's response to Arjuna's question. Shri Bhagavanuvacha, Vethedam Drona Putrasya Brahamam Astram Pradarshitam, Naivasam Veda Samharam Pranabhadha Upastite. The meaning of this 27th verse, the supreme personality of God had said, know from me that this is the act of the son of Drona. He has thrown the hymns of nuclear energy, Brahmastra, and he does not know how to retract the glare. He has helplessly done this being afraid of imminent death. When Arjuna started chasing Ashwathama and Ashwathama's horses became tired, then Ashwathama thought that his life is in danger, and just to save himself, he resorted to the ultimate weapon, the Brahmastra, which should normally not be used under such circumstances. But he did not care for the rules, regulations. He simply decided how to release that Brahmastra. Regarding the Brahmastra, Srila Prabhupada explains, the Brahmastra is similar to the modern nuclear weapon manipulated by atomic energy. The atomic energy works wholly on total combustibility, and so the Brahmastra also acts. So, in terms of the effect, the Brahmastra is similar to the nuclear weapon. It creates an intolerable heat similar to atomic radiation, this Brahmastra. But the difference is that the atomic bomb is a gross type of nuclear weapon, whereas the Brahmastra is a subtle type of weapon

**Summary:** The speaker distinguishes between the subtle material science used to create the Brahmastra and the transcendental nature of spiritual mantras like Hare Krishna, highlighting the limitations of modern science.

produced by chanting hymns. How was this Brahmastra produced? Simply by chanting mantra. And Srila Prabhupada says, further, it is a different science. And in the days gone by, such science was in the land of Bharatvarsha, but I'm sorry, the subtle science of chanting hymns is also material. This Brahmastra is released by a subtle method of chanting a mantra, but it is a material phenomenon. Even though it is a subtle science of chanting hymns, which is a material effect, it has yet to be known by the modern material scientists. Modern-day material scientists do not know how to manipulate subtle sound and produce such a Brahmastra. They do not know. Subtle material science is not spiritual, but it has a direct relationship with the spiritual method, like in spiritual method mantras are chanted, and even subtle material science takes help of chanting of mantra, but still, this is completely material, this chanting for the sake

**Key Quote:** "A chanter of hymns knew how to apply the weapon as well as how to retract it see that is the special thing about this the science of subtle sound that they knew how to release it and how to withdraw it also retract it that was perfect knowledge"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts spiritual chanting with the material use of mantras for weapons, emphasizing that true knowledge includes both application and retraction, which Ashwathama lacked, making his use of the Brahmastra improper and irreligious.

whereas the chanting of mantras for spiritual purposes is completely transcendental to all material, to transcendental to gross and subtle matter, just like we chant Hare Krishna, it's completely spiritual. It is not a material phenomenon. It's a transcendental vibration. It has got a spiritual effect. Then further, Sri Aparvapa says, a chanter of hymns knew how to apply the weapon as well as how to retract it. See, that is the special thing about this, the science of subtle sound, that they knew how to release it and how to withdraw it also, retract it. That was perfect knowledge, but the son of Dronacharya, Ashwathama, was the one who knew how to release it and how to withdraw it also, retract it. That was perfect knowledge, but the son of Dronacharya, Ashwathama, who made use of the subtle science did not know how to retract. That was mentioned earlier itself, that he did not know how to retract. He applied it being afraid of his imminent death, and thus the practice is not only improper but also irreligious. So Ashwathama has improperly used this Brahmastra, and it is also described here as

**Summary:** The speaker details Ashwathama's transgressions, starting with the beheading of Draupadi's sons, highlighting his violation of religious principles and the consequences he faces, including Krishna's impending punishment and Arjuna's role in retracting the Brahmastra.

irreligious. It is against the principles of religion. As the son of a Brahmana, he should not have made so many mistakes. It all began with what? Ashwathama beheading the sons of Draupadi while they were sleeping, totally irreligious, totally against all the codes of Dharma Yudha, but after that, he realized that Arjuna is going to actually punish him for it, so he tried to escape, but he could not escape, and now he is trying somehow to save himself by this Brahmastra, so he made so many mistakes, and for such gross negligence of duty, he was to be punished by the Lord himself. Krishna himself would punish this Ashwathama. So this is the description here is in these three verses. Now Arjuna has come to know it is Ashwathama who has released the Brahmastra, and Krishna is now going to direct Arjuna to actually retract that Brahmastra which was released by Ashwathama because Ashwathama did not know how to retract it.

So Krishna will now instruct Arjuna to do it. See, Arjuna was having proper knowledge of this Brahmastra, how to use, how to release, and how to retract both. Now Arjuna is going to retract the Brahmastra. That's the next few verses describing this entire incident. There are a lot of lessons to be learned from this particular incident being described here in the beginning of the Bhagavatam when Suta Goswami is narrating the events leading to Pariksit meeting with Shukadev Goswami where he inquired about this subject matter of Bhagavatam.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, Suta Goswami decided that he is going to speak the narrate the Bhagavatam which he heard from Sukadeva Goswami when Sukadeva Goswami was speaking to Parikshit Maharaj."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the context of Suta Goswami narrating the Bhagavatam to the sages, highlighting their eagerness to hear about Krishna and the events following the Battle of Kurukshetra, specifically the actions of Ashwatthama.

That is the beginning of the first chapter of this canto opening. So the topics have been developed up to this point that the sages of Naimisha Ranya were very eager to hear about Krishna. Therefore, Suta Goswami decided that he is going to speak the... narrate the Bhagavatam which he heard from Sukadeva Goswami when Sukadeva Goswami was speaking to Parikshit Maharaj. So that will come in the second canto. But in the first canto when Suta Goswami says because you are very interested in hearing about Krishna let me narrate the Srimad Bhagavatam to you which is exclusively describing Krishna... recommends for those who want to develop their Krishna consciousness very very quickly, then you should hear or read or study these two scriptures Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam. So, in the Bhagavatam the opening of the description of the topics of Krishna begin with the end of the Battle of Kurukshetra. And what happened this incident particularly that the sleeping sons of Draupadi were beheaded by Aswatthama, the son of Dronacharya. And it is stated that the sleeping sons of Draupadi were beheaded by Aswatthama, the son of Dronacharya, and it is totally against the principles of Dharma Yuddha. So, now when Arjuna came to know about it, he wants to punish this Ashwatthama. So, Arjuna has chased Ashwatthama. Ashwatthama's horses have become tired when he tried to escape and he raised the Brahmastra. He doesn't know how to retract it. And now, Arjuna has asked Krishna, what is the source of this intense radiation that is spreading everywhere? What is the source of this? What is the cause of this? And Arjuna, of course, has offered nice prayers to Krishna. And now Krishna is replying

**Key Quote:** "O Arjuna, only another Brahmastra can counteract this weapon. Since you are expert in the military science, subdue this weapon's glare with the power of your own weapon."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Krishna's instructions to Arjuna regarding the Brahmastra released by Ashwatthama, emphasizing Arjuna's expertise in military science and the power of the Brahmastra.

in this 28th verse, The meaning of this verse is, O Arjuna, only another Brahmastra can counteract this weapon. Since you are expert in the military science, subdue this weapon's glare with the power of your own weapon. In the previous verse, Krishna had explained the source of this radiation as the Brahmastra released by Ashwatthama in order to save his life, his own life. And Krishna also informed Arjuna, this Ashwatthama doesn't know how to retract this. So, it's very dangerous, this radiation of the Brahmastra he has released. So, only another Brahmastra can counteract this radiation. So, only another Brahmastra can counteract it, because he does not know how to retract it. So, you should actually subdue that weapon, that Brahmastra released by Ashwatthama by releasing another Brahmastra, because you know the science. So, Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport, For the atomic bombs, there is no counterweapon to neutralize the effects. We have heard of atomic bomb, and particularly at the end of the Second World War, America bombed Japan, and there was so much of destruction, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, so much. And the after effects were horrible. But this Brahmastra, even though it has the power to neutralize the effects, it has the power to neutralize the effects. So, it is a very powerful weapon. Like an atom bomb, of course, the power of Brahmastra is many millions of times more than that of the atom bomb. But Brahmastra can be targeted at a very specific target, can be released to destroy a particular target only. That is the complete science of this bomb. So, it is a very powerful weapon.

A Kshatriya should know this Dhanurveda, should learn this because for maintaining law and order, this violence is required and it has to be very, very carefully utilized. Kshatriyas were very responsible. The Brahmanas, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas were very, very responsible, very intelligent in their own fields and they were trained up, they were trained up in a Gurukul to properly learn and also responsibly utilize this knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "Hearing this from the personality of Godhead, Arjuna touched water for purification and after circumambulating Lord Sri Krishna, he cast his Brahmastra weapon to counteract the other one."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts atomic bombs with Brahmastra, emphasizing the ability to counteract the latter, and describes Arjuna's actions following Krishna's instructions, as narrated by Suta Goswami.

The lay of knowledge to really know the truth. So, Atomic Bombs, it's very rude. Once it is released, there is no counteraction to neutralize the effect of that. But by certain signs, the action of a Brahmaswara can be counteracted. And those who were expert in military science in those days, could counteract the Brahmaswara, those who were expert in military science, Arjuna was expert. This how to release the Brahmastra he did not know how to counteract it or how to retract it he didn't know whereas Arjuna he knew completely how to use the Brahmastra so therefore Krishna is instructing Arjuna you should counteract this Brahmastra released by Swarthama by releasing another Brahmastra Srila Prabhupada says the son of Dronacharya did not know the art of counteracting the weapon and therefore Arjuna was asked to counteract it by the power of his own weapon Arjuna was asked to do it because Arjuna knew how to do it so this Dhanurveda is a very very advanced science of using weapons and it is a subtle science because simply by chanting a mantra after sanctifying oneself by touching water one can actually release different types of astras against different targets and very very specific and precise in fact the astra will go and search out for the target wherever the target is so that is the power of the astra this weapon which is released by mantra it is This unknown, this science is unknown, yet unknown to the modern scientists. They do not know this. And in the 29th verse, Suta Goswami is narrating this to the Sages of Nainisharanya. Suta Goswami is telling what happened next. Shrutva Bhagavata Proktam Falguna Paraviraha Falguna refers to Arjuna. Sprishtva Apahatam Parikramya Brahamam Brahmastram Sandadhe The meaning of this 29th verse, Sri Suta Goswami said, Hearing this from the personality of Godhead, Arjuna touched water for purification and after circumambulating Lord Sri Krishna, he cast his Brahmastra weapon to counteract the other one. So, Arjuna, following Krishna's direction, instruction, he did exactly what Krishna told him. Krishna told him, release another Brahmastra to counteract the one released by Ashwathama. So, Arjuna did that.

**Summary:** The speaker praises the wealth of knowledge in the Vedas and Puranas, highlighting the power of the Brahmastra and Krishna's guidance to Arjuna to neutralize its effects, ending with a thank you and Hare Krishna.

Now, Srila Prabhupada also praises, the wealth of knowledge in the Vedas and Puranas. Every branch of knowledge relevant for human society is there in the Vedas and Puranas. And it is perfect knowledge coming from the perfect source, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Originally, the Vedas and Puranas were handed down to Brahma at the beginning of creation. Tene Brahma hrudaya adikavaye muhyantiyat surayaha In the beginning of Bhagavatam, it is described, Brahma received this knowledge and it is coming down in parampara. So, this knowledge is perfect knowledge. See how now, Arjuna is going to counteract that Brahmastra, that Brahmastra was released by. Because, the Brahmastra's power is that it can destroy a whole universe. Not just this atomic bomb, at most it can destroy one planet. But, a Brahmastra can destroy the whole universe. Millions of planets it can destroy. So, it is, if he has released it without aiming at any specific target, this foolish Ashwatthama, then Krishna is actually telling Arjuna, counteract it and neutralize the effect of the Brahmastra. So, that no damage will be done at all. That is the idea. Nobody will be harmed by that when Arjuna counteracts it and retracts both of them. And that's what will be described in the next verse.

Vyasa Deva concentrated his mind in that transcendental place of meditation. If you remember, in the previous session, we discussed about that place, Samyaprasa, where Vyasa Deva's Ashramam Prasadeva place gave ashram was located on the western bank of the river Saraswati, and the place is the most suitable for spiritual activities. So there, Vyasa Deva sat down for concentrating his mind in meditation on the supreme Lord. Text number four, the fourth verse in the same chapter, seventh chapter, first canto of Bhagavatam: Bhakti Yogena Manasi Samyak Pranihi. The meaning of this verse is thus: he fixed his mind perfectly, engaging it by linking it in devotional service or bhakti yoga without any tinge of materialism, and thus he saw the absolute personality of Godhead along with his external energy which was under full control. What did Vyasadeva see or have vision of in the meditation? He was able to see both the Supreme Lord Krishna along with Krishna's external energy, Maya, which was under full control, tadapashrayam, under full control. So, Srila Prabhupada has given a very

**Summary:** The speaker explains that perfect realization of the Absolute Truth is possible only through bhakti yoga, referencing the Bhagavad Gita to support this point and contrasting it with impersonal Brahman realization.

long introduction to this verse. Perfect vision of the absolute truth is possible only by the linking process of devotional service. Yoga means a linking process. Right now, our present condition is we are forgetful of our relationship with the supreme, of our link with the Supreme Lord Krishna, so to reestablish that forgotten relationship or revive that lost connection is the process of yoga. Among the different process of yoga, to have complete vision of the Absolute Truth as the Supreme Personality of God, Krishna, is only possible by Bhakti. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita, Bhaktiamam Abhijanati. Only by Bhakti we can have vision of Krishna or know Krishna or realize Krishna. There is no other process. This also confirmed in the Bhagavad Gita. One can perfectly realize the Absolute Truth only by the process of devotional service, and one can enter into the kingdom of God by such perfect knowledge. This is what Bhagavad Gita says: Bhaktiamam Abhijanati Yavanyas Chasmi Tatvatah. Tatomam Tatvatah Vishatetad Anantaram. One can enter into the kingdom of God, kingdom of Krishna, after perfectly getting knowledge about the Absolute Truth as the Supreme Personality of God, Krishna. Imperfect realization of the Absolute by the partial approach of impersonal Brahman or localized Paramatma does not permit

But this realization of the Absolute Truth as impersonal Brahman or localized Paramatma does not permit a the transcendentalist to enter into the kingdom of God. Shri Narada advised Vyasa Deva to become absorbed in transcendental meditation on the personality of Godhead and his activities. Specifically, Narada instructed Vyasa Deva that the activities of the Supreme Lord, Haricharya, are completely transcendental, enlivening to the Self, and they can bring about complete satisfaction of the Self while they can enlighten anyone about the Absolute Truth as the Absolute Personality of Godhead, the highest realization of the

**Summary:** The speaker explains that realizing the Absolute Truth as Bhagavan (Krishna) includes realizing Brahman and Paramatma, emphasizing that Bhagavan is the complete realization.

Absolute Truth. So, Srila Vyasa Deva did not take notice of the effulgence of Brahman because that is not absolute vision. The realization of the Absolute Truth as Bhagavan includes realization of the Absolute Truth as Brahman and Paramatma. Bhagavan is complete realization, whereas Brahman or Paramatma is incomplete realization. This is explained in beginning of the Bhagavatam itself. The absolute vision is the personality of Godhead, as is confirmed in the Bhagavad Gita, Vasudeva Sarvamiti. In the Bhagavad Gita, this is explained. In the Upanishads also, it is confirmed that Vasudeva, the personality of Godhead, is covered by glowing golden, glowing Hiranmayena Patrena, veil of impersonal Brahman. In the Isha Upanishad, it is stated Hiranmayena Patrena satyasya Api hitam. Syajnibayurapha dē sister maya Krishnye alternates the Nairanbur-kirtan is removed by the mercy of the Lord.

Similarly, the Supreme Lord Krishna, his effulgence, personal effulgence is the Brahmajyoti. That Brahmajyoti doesn't enable anybody who is focused on the Brahmajyoti alone to be able to see the Supreme Lord Krishna. The absolute is mentioned here as Purusha or person, Apashyat Purusham Purnam, Purna Purusha, the supreme or the perfect or the complete personality.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces Krishna's energies, focusing on the internal and external energies, and explaining that the external energy keeps living entities in ignorance.

the Purusha is confirmed as eternal original person. In 10th chapter, it is said very clearly, it is described in the Bhagavad Gita. The absolute personality of Godhead is the perfect person. Why is this being described in so detail? It's because the subject of the Bhagavad Gita is the perfect person. Why is this being described in so detail? It's because the subject matter of the Srimad Bhagavatam is Krishna, the supreme personality of Godhead, who is the absolute personality, the absolute truth in the highest realization or highest aspect of the absolute truth. The complete perfect aspect of the absolute truth. Now that Supreme person Krishna has manifold energies. She has many, many, many varieties of energies, out of which the internal, external, and marginal energies are specifically important. Three categories of energies are very important. The energy mentioned here is the external energy, as will be clear from the statements of her activities. Energy is feminine. The Supreme Lord is the only masculine personality. Energy is feminine. And how do we know that the energy is specifically the external energy? By the statement of her activities that we described in the next few verses. The internal energy is there along with the absolute person as moonlight is there with the moon. Internal energy is always feminine. This is the Supreme Lord. The external energy is compared to darkness because it keeps the living entities in the darkness of ignorance.

**Key Quote:** "The external energy is the inferior energy. It is responsible for ignorance."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the two types of Maya, the external (inferior) and internal (superior/spiritual), explaining their effects on living beings.

The word apashrayam suggests that this energy of the Lord is under full control. This maya is the external energy which is the cause of the living beings to be in the darkness of ignorance. And when one realizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then one comes to the light of knowledge, spiritual knowledge, transcendental knowledge. The internal potency or superior energy is also called maya, but it is spiritual maya. There are two kinds of maya or energies of the Supreme Lord. The external energy is the inferior energy. It is responsible for ignorance. And the superior energy, the spiritual energy, yoga maya, is actually always of the characteristic of knowledge, spiritual knowledge, spiritual enlightenment. This energy, internal energy or spiritual energy is exhibited in the absolute realm, in the spiritual world. When one is under the shelter of the internal potency, the darkness of ignorance, material ignorance is at once dissipated. Just like when you are in a dark room, you come to light, immediately darkness is dispelled. Light dispels darkness immediately. There is no possibility of darkness when there is light. Even those who are atma, rama or fixed in trance, take shelter of this maya, spiritual energy, internal energy. So, devotional service or bhakti yoga is the function of the internal energy.

**Key Quote:** "Devotional service or bhakti yoga is the function of the internal energy."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing that devotional service is a function of the internal energy and that realization of Krishna leads to unlimited transcendental bliss, ending with Hare Krishna and copyright information.

This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita: Mahatma Anastumam Partha Daivim Prakritimashritaha Bhajanti Ananya Manaso Gyatva Bhutadim Avyayam. Ananya Manaso Bhajanti. They engage in devotional service under the influence of the internal energy or the divine energy of the Supreme Lord, which is a spiritual energy. One under the shelter of the spiritual energy engages in devotional service. Such internal energy is even superior to the spiritual bliss attainable in the conception of impersonal Brahman. The impersonal Brahman is subordinate to the personality of Godhead. Similarly, the bliss derived by realizing the impersonal Brahman is very insignificant compared to the ocean of transcendental bliss by realizing the personality of Godhead, Krishna, the absolute personality of Godhead, Krishna. That is going to be elaborated in the Srimad Bhagavatam. This is the main subject of the Bhagavatam, Krishna. And realization of Krishna is realization of the unlimited transcendental bliss under the shelter of the spiritual potency of Krishna. I will stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.

### Brahmastra, Cosmic Annihilation, Atomic Energy

**Key Quote:** "But the heat produced by the Brahmastra can destroy the whole cosmic situation."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the power of the Brahmastra described in the Srimad Bhagavatam and compares it to atomic energy, emphasizing its capacity for cosmic annihilation.

In this session we will be discussing from the 30th and the 31st verses of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Samhatya Anyonyam Ubhayoho Tejasi Sharasamvrute Aavrtya Rodhasi Khamcha Vavridhate Arka Vaknivat. The meaning of this verse is, this is the 30th verse. When the rays of the two Brahmastras combined, a great circle of fire, like the disk of the sun, covered all outer space and the whole firmament of planets. Arjuna has released the counteracting Brahmastra and the rays of the two Brahmastras combined. It was a great circle of fire, like the disk of the sun. So Prabhupada describes this in the purport. The heat created by the flash of a Brahmastra resembles the fire exhibited in the sun globe at the time of cosmic annihilation. Cosmic annihilation means the entire material existence itself is annihilated. The radiation of atomic energy is very insignificant in comparison to the heat produced by a Brahmastra. The atomic bomb explosion can at most blow up one globe. But the heat produced by the Brahmastra can destroy the whole cosmic situation.

### Brahmastra, Samvartaka Fire, Planetary Life

**Key Quote:** "That no planet therefore is without living beings as less intelligent people tend to think."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the effects of the Brahmastra's heat on all planets, comparing it to the Samvartaka fire at the time of annihilation, and asserts that all planets are inhabited by living beings.

The 31st verse. Dhrishtva stratejas tu tayo ho tri lo kaan pradahan mahat. Dahya mana praja sarva saam vartakam amamsata. The meaning of this verse, the 31st verse. This verse. All the population of the three worlds was scorched by the combined heat of the weapons. Everyone was reminded of the Samvartaka fire which takes place at the time of annihilation. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport to his 31st verse. The three worlds, three lokan, three worlds are the upper, lower and intermediate planets of the universe. In the universe there are many planets but it is divided into three divisions. Upper, lower and the middle intermediate planets. Although the Brahmastra was released on this earth. The heat produced by the combination of both weapons covered all the universe. And all the populations and all the different planets began to feel the heat excessively and compared it to that of the Samvartaka fire. At the time of annihilation there is a big fire. That will be explained a little later by Srila Prabhupada further. But here he is telling that the combination of both the weapons produced excessive heat and everyone in all the planets began to feel the heat. So the conclusion is being made that no planet therefore is without living beings as less intelligent people tend to think. Less intelligent people they think that only the earth planet is having intelligent human beings. Other planets, they sometimes say there is no life or they say there are no intelligent people. But that's not correct. According to the understanding we get from the Vedas, the perfect knowledge source, there is life on all the planets. There is life on all the planets and there are intelligent beings on all planets.

**Key Quote:** "This fire will take place on account of the heat increase in the atmosphere."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the Samvartaka fire, describing the conditions leading to universal annihilation, including increased solar heat and the subsequent burning of everything to ashes.

The radiation heat of the radiation when both the brahmastras combined increased many fold because one weapon was released by Ashwatthama, another was released by Arjuna to counteract that first brahmastra on the instruction of Krishna. The heat was so terrible, the human oprajasa. All the inhabitants came to learn that. Inhabitants of the different planets, they felt the great heat produced by the two Brahmastras and what did they feel it like? Samvartakam amamsata, the Samvartaka fire, they felt it is like the Samvartaka fire that is explained in the shastra at the end when there is annihilation to take place, there will be no rainfall, everything would be dry. There will be a great fire all over the universe that's called Samvartaka fire, and everything will be ablaze. This fire will take place on account of the heat increase in the atmosphere. There will be no rising or falling. This fire will take place on account of the heat increasing of the Sun. The Sun is actually like a ball of fire but because it is such a great distance from the earth we don't feel it like a blazing fire, we don't feel like that except in summer sometimes it becomes too hot but that is for a short duration and that is also something which you can tolerate but at the time of universal destruction what happens it is said that the present temperature the Sun will be increased twelve times so naturally there will be fire everything we ablaze in all the planets sometimes we have experience that there is a fire that will cause a fire, forest fire and especially in summer when everything is dry in the forest and the forest fire spreads very rapidly and then the animals which are trapped they will all be burnt alive the forest fire because whichever direction they go they see only fire so they cannot escape they'll be burnt similarly the fire will take place when the annihilation is supposed to happen and everything will be burnt to ashes this is the way the annihilation happens and after that there will be rain and PremierắngMagé Ngũi and that rain

**Key Quote:** "And by the grace of the Lord, another creation will begin afterwards."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the cyclical nature of destruction and creation, highlighting Arjuna's ability to retract the Brahmastras due to his knowledge of the science, preventing widespread destruction.

doislọ शर्द बत हम रै अगर अगर शर्द बत H Porter dieseगु अуш्छों अदमानित गर्म से उपदों withstand all the damage done the damage to ashus. Eивается we are burning ashes this is the way the annihilation happens and after that there will be rain and torrents non-stock the marin Ongment strata in, and that rain also. So it is described the intensity of the rain is like trunk of the elephant is falling water falling down is like huge trunk of an elephant and everything will be covered with water that is called pralaya. And by the grace of the Lord, another creation will begin afterwards. So this destruction that happens is cyclical. Creation, maintenance and destruction. This cyclically happens. But here, even though the combined heat of the two Brahmastras was like the Samvartaka fire, it was actually highly controlled. It is completely controlled. It was not intended for any destruction to take place. They just felt the heat for a moment because after this, it is described in the 32nd verse that Arjuna, at once, he retracted both the Brahmastra weapons as Lord Krishna desired. Arjuna did that. So he did not allow this heat to spread or this radiation to spread. He retracted both the Brahmastras and he knew the science perfectly. Arjuna knew the science and therefore he was able to retract both the Brahmastras by the knowledge of how to use that Brahmastra.

**Key Quote:** "The most important branch of knowledge is called Brahmavidya, Radhyatmavidya, Atmavidya."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of learning from a qualified guru, particularly in the pursuit of Brahmavidya (spiritual knowledge), contrasting it with material knowledge and highlighting its significance.

Properly, it has to be learned. This Ashwatthama, he had not properly learned this. Therefore, the scripture's advice: if you want to learn a particular branch of knowledge, you have to approach a proper guru, one who is actually well versed in the knowledge. And among all the branches of knowledge, the most important branch of knowledge is called Brahmavidya, Radhyatmavidya, Atmavidya. So Atmavidya, and that is what Krishna is speaking in the Bhagavad Gita. At the end of every chapter of Bhagavad Gita, Vyasa Deva concludes by telling, Iti Srimad Bhagavad Gita Su Upanishad Su Brahmavidyaya. Brahmavidya. So Krishna is speaking the most important branch of the Vedic knowledge, that is Brahmavidya or Brahma Jnana, the spiritual science. Now all this Dhanurveda, everything is material knowledge. But this Brahmavidya, spiritual science, what is spirit? It is completely different from the matter and spirit is the basis for everything material. Matter has got its origin. Of course both matter and spirit are originally energies of the Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "Every living being is a spiritual being, not the body."
**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between material and spiritual energy, explaining how material energy manifests into the 24 elements and how living entities are spiritual beings, emphasizing the core teaching of the Bhagavad Gita.

He has many varieties of energies of which matter and spirit are two categories of energy. Matter means this material energy coming from material energy. The beginning of the creation material energy is differentiated by the glance of Mahavishnu into 24 elements and these 24 elements combined in different proportions and different combinations give rise to different objects, material objects, our own body, gross and subtle body, and then the different planets and the varieties of living conditions. Everything is made possible by the differentiation of material energy into the 24 elements and the combinations of the 24 elements. But spirit is different. Spirit is another energy, particularly the spirit, spiritual energy in the form of the living entity. Jeeva bhutam mahabaho yayedam dharyate jagat. The living entities belong to the category of spiritual energy and they are also spiritual. Every living being is a spiritual being, not the body. And that is the whole teaching of the Gita. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Arjuna at once retracted both the Brahmastra weapons and there was no more danger from that Brahmastra which Ashwathama had released."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Arjuna retracting the Brahmastra weapons, emphasizing Krishna's role in averting destruction.

In this session, we will be discussing the 32nd, 33rd, and 34th verses of the 7th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. Prajopadravam Alaksya Lokavyatikaram Chatham Matamcha Vasudevasya Sanjahararjuno Dwayam. The meaning of this verse: thus seeing the disturbance from the general populace and the imminent destruction of the planets, Arjuna at once retracted both Brahmastra weapons as Lord Sri Krishna desired. So Arjuna asked Krishna, when he saw the radiation in the sky spreading everywhere, what is the source of this radiation? Then Krishna explained how Ashwathama had released that Brahmastra out of fear for his own life and he did not know how to retract it. So it was very dangerous. And Srila Prabhupada explains that Brahmastra is like a nuclear weapon of modern times, but it is much, much more powerful. A Brahmastra can destroy an entire universe. So therefore, seeing the imminent destruction of the planets, Krishna actually advised Arjuna to retract both the Brahmastras by counteracting what Ashwathama had released, by Arjuna releasing his own Brahmastra simply to counteract, that's all, and retract both of them.

**Key Quote:** "Ultimately it all rests on the supreme will of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the power of atomic weapons is insignificant compared to the will of the Supreme Lord, who ultimately controls everything.

So exactly what Arjuna did, he at once retracted both the Brahmastra weapons and there was no more danger from that Brahmastra which Ashwathama had released. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "The theory that the modern atomic bomb explosions can annihilate the world is childish imagination." Why? Because Srila Prabhupada says, first of all, the atomic energy is not powerful enough to destroy the whole world. Secondly, ultimately it all rests on the supreme will of the Supreme Lord. Because without His will or sanction, nothing can be built up or destroyed. This we have heard many times, that ultimately everything is under the supreme control of the Supreme Lord. And unless He wills that there should be destruction of the entire world or the entire planet or the entire universe, till then it cannot be destroyed by anybody else. Not possible. So it is foolish also to think that natural laws are ultimately powerful. Yes, there are nature's laws working, but these laws are not blind. They are directed ultimately by the Supreme Lord. Krishna says this in the Bhagavad Gita, Mayadhyakshena prakritihi suyatesa characharam. Mayadhyakshena prakritihi suyatesa characharam. Mayadhyakshena prakritihi suyatesa characharam. By my superintendence, this material nature is working. It is Krishna's superintendence ultimately that is the basis for material nature to work. The laws are there, but the laws have got the law maker and that is the Supreme Lord, and the law enforcer, that is also the Supreme Lord. So without the Supreme Lord's sanction, without the Supreme Lord's enforcement, nothing will happen in this world. So therefore, natural laws are not ultimately powerful.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Unless the Lord wills, it is not possible for anyone to destroy the entire world."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to emphasize the supreme power of the Lord and the insignificance of human power in comparison.

It is the supreme will of the Supreme Lord. So further Srila Prabhupada says, "Material nature's law works under the direction of the Gita as confirmed in the Bhagavad Gita." The Lord says there that natural laws work under His supervision. The words I quoted, Mayadhyakshena prakritihi suyatesa characharam. The world can be destroyed only by the will of the Lord and not by the whims of tiny politicians. After all, everyone in this world is a very, very insignificant person when compared to the supreme power of the Supreme Lord. So everybody is under control of the Supreme Lord and in front of the Lord's power, the power we possess is very, very insignificant. However powerful a person may appear to be in relationship with other persons, but ultimately, in comparison with the Supreme Lord's power, everyone is simply insignificant. So, as Srila Prabhupada says here, unless the Lord wills, it is not possible for anyone to destroy the entire world. Lord Sri Krishna desired that the weapons released by both Drauni and Arjuna—Drauni is Ashwathama, Dronacharya's son—Drauni and Arjuna be withdrawn, and it is carried out by Arjuna at once. So Krishna just instructed Arjuna and Arjuna did accordingly. That is Krishna's will. Similarly, there are many agents of the all-powerful Lord and by his will only can one execute what he desires, what Krishna desires.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Devatas are agents of Krishna, working according to His instructions, reinforcing the idea that no one can destroy the planet without His will.

So, Krishna has got many, many agents. The Devatas are all agents of Krishna only. Vishnubhaktas vruto daiva. All Devatas are Vishnubhaktas. So, according to Vishnu's order, Vishnu's instructions, Vishnu's directions, the Devatas are working perfectly. There is no reason to think that some insignificant person of this world can destroy the entire planet.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Arjuna, his eyes blazing in anger, like two red balls of copper, dexterously arrested the son of Gautami and bound him with ropes, like an animal."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Arjuna's anger and his act of arresting Ashwatthama, explaining that it was part of his duty (dharma).

That never can happen. In the thirty-third verse, it is described, the meaning of this thirty-third verse is, "Arjuna, his eyes blazing in anger, like two red balls of copper, dexterously arrested the son of Gautami and bound him with ropes, like an animal. Pashumrashanayata." So, Arjuna was very angry against this Ashwatthama because Ashwatthama had killed the five sleeping sons of Draupadi. So, Arjuna was very angry against this. He was so angry against Ashwatthama. And therefore, Arjuna's description here is, his eyes blazing in anger like two red balls of copper. He was so angry, his red eyes had become so red. And Arjuna arrested this Ashwatthama. He did not kill him immediately. He arrested him. And how did he arrest him? He bound him up with ropes like an animal. Generally a human being is not bound up by ropes like that, but here the treatment meted out to Ashwatthama by Arjuna is justified by Srila Prabhupada in the purport. Srila Prabhupada says, "Ashwatthama's mother Krippi was born in the family of Gautama, so she is referred to as Gautami, and Ashwatthama is referred to as Gautami Sutam. The significant point in this shloka is that Ashwatthama was caught and bound up with ropes like an animal. According to Sridhar Swami, Arjuna was obliged to catch this son of a Brahmana like an animal as part of the ritual, as part of his duty, Dharma." So the Acharyas are explaining that Arjuna was just doing his duty.

**Key Quote:** "It was not wrong on the part of Arjuna to bind Ashwatthama with ropes like an animal."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to justify Arjuna's actions and introduces the next verse where Krishna will speak to Arjuna.

It was not wrong on the part of Arjuna to bind Ashwatthama with ropes like an animal. This suggestion by Sridhar Swami is also confirmed in the later statement of Sri Krishna. Later on Krishna also will tell the same thing. Ashwatthama was a bona fide son of Dronacharya and Krippi, but because he had degraded himself to a lower status of life, it was proper to treat him like an animal and not as a Brahmana. It is proper for Arjuna to have treated Ashwatthama in that way. And the 34th verse: Shibiraya Nini Shantam Rajwa Baddhwaripum Balat Praha Arjunam Prakupito Bhagavan Ambujekshanaha. The meaning of this 34th verse is, after binding Ashwatthama, Arjuna wanted to take him to the military camp. The personality of God is Sri Krishna looking on with his lotus eyes, spoke to angry Arjuna. So Arjuna wants to take him to the camp, their own military camp, but before that Krishna is now going to speak to Arjuna. And Krishna is described as looking on with his lotus eyes, and Arjuna, he was very angry. His eyes were red, two red hot balls of copper.

### transcendence, divine anger, devotion

**Verse References:** SB 1.7.34
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Because Krishna is absolute, both his anger and pleasure are the same."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the difference between Arjuna's anger and Krishna's anger, emphasizing Krishna's transcendental nature and his concern for his devotees.

That's already described. In the Purport, Srila Prabhupada says that both Arjuna and Lord Sri Krishna are described here in angry mood, but Arjuna's eyes were like balls of red copper whereas the eyes of the Lord were like lotuses. What does this mean? This means that the angry mood of Arjuna and that of the Lord are not on the same level. Why? Because the Lord is transcendence and is absolute in any stage. Krishna is not affected by some moods or some influence of some event. He is unaffected under all circumstances at all times in all places. So he is transcendently situated, always, eternally. His anger, that is Krishna's anger, is not like the anger of a conditioned living being within the modes of qualitative material nature. When we become angry, we are influenced by the modes of material nature, Rajoguna, Tamoguna. Because Krishna is absolute, both his anger and pleasure are the same. His anger is not exhibited in the three modes of material nature. It is only a sign of his bent of mind towards the cause of his devotee, because that is his transcendental nature. Krishna felt for Arjuna because Ashwatthama had beheaded the sleeping sons of Draupadi. Draupadi is also Krishna's devotee. So Krishna was feeling for his devotee. Therefore, even if Krishna is angry, the object of anger is blessed. He is unchanged in all circumstances. This is Krishna's position. He is unaffected by any situation. He is always transcendently situated.

### dharma, brahmana, qualification

**Verse References:** SB 1.7.35
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "That simply by birth in a Brahmin family, without qualification, nobody can become a Brahmana."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of verse 35, focusing on the term 'Brahma Bandhu' and emphasizing that being born in a Brahmin family does not automatically make one a Brahmana; qualifications are necessary.

The 35th verse: Mainam Partharhasitratum Brahma Bandhum Imamjahi Yosav Anagasa Suptan Avadheen Nishi Balakan. The meaning of this verse is: Lord Sri Krishna said, "O Arjuna, you should not show mercy by releasing this relative of a Brahmana, Brahma Bandhu, for he has killed innocent boys in their sleep." Krishna is justifying punishing Ashwatthama appropriately because Ashwatthama has killed innocent boys in their sleep. He is not observing the rules of Dharma Yudha. And he is being referred to as Brahma Bandhu, relative of a Brahmana. He is not a Brahmana. By his actions, he has proved otherwise. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The word Brahma Bandhu is significant." Ashwatthama being referred to as Brahma Bandhu is significant. A person who happens to take birth in the family of a Brahmana, but is not qualified to be called a Brahmana, is addressed as the relative of a Brahmana and not as a Brahmana. This is a very, very important point to be understood, that simply by birth in a Brahmin family, without qualification, nobody can become a Brahmana. Nobody can be called as a Brahmana. Brahmana is only if they are qualified, only if they have characteristics and qualities of a Brahmana.

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The son of a high court judge is not virtually a high court judge."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a high court judge's son to further illustrate that qualification, not just birth, is essential for being considered a Brahmana.

As described in the Shastra. Prabhupada gives an example: "The son of a high court judge is not virtually a high court judge, but there is no harm in addressing a high court judge's son as a relative of the honourable justice." So, Brahma Bandhu, because he is son of a Brahmana, he can be addressed as Brahma Bandhu. Therefore, as by birth only, one does not become a high court judge, so also, one does not become a Brahmana simply by birthright, but by acquiring the necessary qualifications of a Brahmana. So, qualifications are very important. In modern times, there are some people who claim to be Brahmana just by birth in the Brahmin family, but they don't have the qualifications. In the Bhagavad Gita, these qualifications are described, nine different qualifications: Shamo Damo Tapas Shoucam Shanti Rarjam Mevacha Gyanam Vigyanam Astikyam Brahma Karma Subhavajam. A Brahmana naturally works by these qualities: control of mind, control of senses. Shamo Damo Tapas Shoucam, Tapa is austerity, and Shoucam is cleanliness. Like that. So, a Brahmana has to have qualification. As the high court judgeship is a post for a qualified man, so also the post of a Brahmana is attainable by qualification only.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Shastra enjoins that even if good qualifications are seen in a person born in a family, other than that of a Brahmana, the qualified man has to be accepted as a Brahmana."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the shastras state that a person with Brahmanical qualities should be accepted as a Brahmana regardless of birth, and conversely, one born in a Brahmin family without the qualities should not be considered a Brahmana.

This is the Shastric injunction, but it is not understood properly or not enforced properly in modern times. The Shastra enjoins that even if good qualifications are seen in a person born in a family other than that of a Brahmana, the qualified man has to be accepted as a Brahmana. Yesiyal lakshanam proktam. That whatever the qualities that are seen in a particular person, irrespective of his birth in some family. Let's say somebody is born in a Vaishya family, but the person displays all qualities of a Brahmana, he has to be accepted as a Brahmana. That's what it is telling. The Shastras say like that. Similarly, if a person born in the family of Brahmana is void of Brahmanical qualification, he must be treated as a non-Brahmana, or in better terms, a relative of a Brahmana, Brahmabandhu. So, without qualification, nobody should be addressed as a Brahmana. And, there is sometimes protest by the so-called Brahmanas. If somebody born in a Vaishya family is referred to as a Brahmana because the person is qualified as a Brahmana, the others will protest. Lord Shri Krishna, the supreme authority of all religious principles, the Vedas, has personally pointed out these differences. Krishna actually explains this in several places, in several occasions, in stances, that only by qualification, we can call somebody a Brahmana.

**Key Quote:** "A person who knows the principles of religion...does not kill an enemy who is careless, intoxicated, insane, asleep, afraid or devoid of his chariot."
**Summary:** The speaker begins to explain verse 36, outlining the principles of religious warfare, stating that a Dharmavit (one who knows dharma) does not kill an enemy who is incapacitated or defenseless.

Or refer to somebody as a Brahmana. And a Brahmana, actually, even if he is qualified, he has to behave and conduct himself like a Brahmana. He should display those qualities which are mentioned in the scriptures. So, he is a Brahmana. Now, Krishna is about to explain the reason for referring to Ashwatthama as a Brahmabandhu in the next few shlokas. So, the 36th shloka is again spoken by Krishna: mattham pramatham unmattham suptam bhaatam kalam striyam jadam prapannam viratham bhitham naripum hanti dharmavit. The meaning of this 36th verse is that a person who knows the principles of religion, such a person is called dharmavit, does not kill an enemy who is careless, intoxicated, insane, asleep, afraid or devoid of his chariot. viratham, devoid of chariot; afraid, bheetham; asleep, suptam; then mattham, mattham means careless and pramatham intoxicated, unmattham insane. That's the shastric injunction. Nor does a person who knows the religious principles kill a boy, a woman, a foolish creature or a surrendered soul. Boy is balam, a woman is striyam, then jadam, one who is foolish and prapannam, one who is surrendered soul.

**Key Quote:** "Formerly battles were fought on the principles of religion and not for the sake of sense gratification."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the principles of Dharmayuddha (religious war), emphasizing that battles were formerly fought according to religious principles, not selfish desires, and highlighting Ashwatthama's violation of these principles.

So, there are strict principles by which a follower of religious principles conducts himself. So, Shri La Prabhupada explains in the purport, "An enemy who does not resist is never killed by a warrior who knows the principles of religion." Somebody may be designated as enemy, but if he if he is not ready for fighting or he does not resist when attacked then he should not be killed. Formerly battles were fought on the principles of religion and not for the sake of sense gratification. Religious principles, Dharmayuddha, Dharmavit, one who knows the principles of religion. Formerly it was fought like that. If the enemy happened to be intoxicated, asleep, etc. as above mentioned, he was never to be killed. Just like this Ashwatthama, he killed the sleeping sons. So, that somebody is sleeping, you should not kill them, even if they belong to enemy party. These are some of the codes of religious war, Dharmayuddha. Formerly war was never declared by the whims of selfish political leaders. It was carried out on religious principles free from all vices, no bad habits, no irreligious behaviour. So, that way Dharmayuddha used to take place in the former times. Violence carried out on religious principles is far superior to so called non-violence.

**Key Quote:** "Violence carried out on religious principles is far superior to so called non-violence."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the concept of violence versus non-violence, explaining that violence performed according to religious principles is superior to wrongly applied non-violence, using the example of Buddha's incarnation to stop indiscriminate animal killing.

Srila Prabhupada concludes this purport by telling one very important thing. Sometimes people think non-violence is to be practiced and followed, but that is got a specific situation where that non-violence has to be applied. When Buddha invented, people were indiscriminately killing animals in the name of Vedic sacrifice. So, that is when Buddha incarnated and he wanted to stop this animal killing. And the genuine followers of the Vedas of our scriptures they recognized and understood yes, animals should not be unnecessarily killed. So, a person who knows religious principles actually is always careful not to kill even the enemy when they are sleeping, when they are when they are without a chariot. If he is a chariot fighter, he has to be on a chariot. If he is without a chariot, they will never attack such a person. And in the course of a war, children and women are never, never, never killed. This is very, very important.

**Summary:** The speaker reflects on how advanced and organized society was in the past due to strict adherence to religious principles by Brahmans, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas.

So, we come to know through all these instances described here how in former times the society was very, very highly developed and advanced in following all such religious principles. And these principles are very, very very practical to follow. It is not simply some theory alone. At least 5000 years back, there was strict adherence to the principles of religion by the followers of Dharma, especially the Brahmans, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas used to follow all the religious principles. They never would violate, generally, they never would violate. And therefore society was well organized and very, very peaceful. And the Kshatriyas always protect the citizens against attack by the Brahmans. Some foreign king or foreign person did not allow that the citizens were attacked. So therefore, the principles of religion were followed very strictly

And non-violence wrongly applied means there could be sinful reactions. That's what Krishna tells Arjuna in the fourth chapter of Bhagavad Gita.

Now, Krishna is instructing Arjuna that Ashwathama has committed a very serious crime, and if he is not punished now, he is going to degrade himself, and he is going to suffer the reaction anyway at a later stage, so he has to be punished for his own good, for his own well-being.

**Key Quote:** "Political morality is to punish a person by a death sentence in order to save a cruel person from going to hell the punishment in hell is much much much much more severe than just this death sentence now"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the justification for capital punishment, arguing that it can prevent a murderer from suffering more severe consequences in hell.

So, Srila Prabhupada elaborately explains this in the purport: A life for a life is just punishment for a person who cruelly and shamelessly lives at the cost of others' lives. So much discussion nowadays is going on that punishment is not justified, capital punishment is to a for a murder, for a murderer. If the laws of the land punish him by giving him a punishment where he'll be able to become free from the reaction when is punished properly, appropriately, political morality is to punish a person by a death sentence in order to save a cruel person from going to hell. The punishment in hell is much, much, much, much more severe than just this death sentence now, because he has committed a murder or he has killed somebody unjustly. So instead of pardoning him and making him suffer in hell in future, it is better that he be punished now.

**Key Quote:** "That a murderer is condemned to a death sentence by the state is good for the culprit, because in his next life, he will not have to suffer for his act of murder."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the idea that punishment purifies a person from their sins, potentially leading to promotion to heavenly planets.

That a murderer is condemned to a death sentence by the state is good for the culprit, because in his next life, he will not have to suffer for his act of murder. See, people sometimes say, I can't remember what all I did in my previous life. Why am I made to suffer now? That's because you have to suffer. You have done the mistake and you did not atone for it, nor you received punishment for the mistake you did. So neither you atoned nor you received punishment. Therefore, in the next life, you have to suffer the reaction. Such a death sentence for the murderer is the lowest, lowest possible punishment offered to him. You see, lowest possible punishment. And it is said in the Smriti Shastras that men who are punished by the king on the principle of life for a life are purified of all their sins. See, they became purified, even though they might have committed a very, very grievous sin of killing another person unjustly. So much so that they may be eligible for being promoted to the planets of heaven.

### Animal Killing, Murder, Conspiracy, Civilized Society

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Even the killer of an animal is to be considered a murderer...Animal food is never meant for the civilized man whose prime duty is to prepare himself for going back to Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Manu, stating that even killing an animal is considered murder and that animal food is not meant for civilized people focused on spiritual advancement.

So they are completely freed from the reaction of having committed that sin if they are punished appropriately. Now, something very, very important. Srila Prabhupada says, Here, according to Manu, the great author of civic codes and religious principles, Manu is a lawgiver for mankind. Even the killer of an animal is to be considered a murderer, killer of an animal. Nowadays, people are killing animals so much because animal food is never meant for the civilized man whose prime duty is to prepare himself for going back to Godhead. In a civilized society, when there is plenty of vegetables, fruits, grains, milk, why should people kill animals for food? That is the point being made here. Animal food is never meant for the civilized man. And especially civilized human beings are meant for preparing themselves to go back to Godhead. That is a precious opportunity in this human form of life. So Manu says that in the act of killing an animal, there is a regular conspiracy by the party of sinners and all of them are liable to be punished as murderers, exactly like a party of conspirators who kill a human being combinedly. Just like the state law, if a murder happens, it's not just the person who actually killed is punished. Even the others who may be hatching a conspiracy to kill and they engage somebody to kill. Even the conspirators are equally guilty of this murder. That is the state law. Similarly, in killing of an animal, all those who are responsible directly or indirectly for that animal killing will all actually be liable to be punished.

**Summary:** The speaker lists the six types of people involved in animal killing who are all considered murderers according to scriptures.

Now here, Prabhupada is quoting Manu that who are all liable to be punished when an animal killing happens? He who gives permission, he who kills the animal, he who sells the slaughtered animal, he who cooks the animal, he who administers distribution of that foodstuff, animal flesh, and at last he who eats such cooked animal food are all murderers. Six kinds of persons involved in animal killing are all murderers.

**Key Quote:** "Six types of people are liable to be punished when animal killing happens in a civilized human society...Because no one can create a living being despite all advancement of material science. And therefore, no one has the right to kill a living being by one's independent wills."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the culpability of those involved in animal killing, emphasizing that since humans cannot create life, they have no right to take it.

Even though actual killing is done by one person. But the others, I'll read this again. He who gives permission to kill the animal, somebody is rearing an animal, he actually sells that animal for animal slaughter. Or he may not sell it, but he says, Oh, now this animal is of no use to me. You may take it and you may do whatever you want. You can even kill it. No. He is not absolved of that sin of animal killing. So the person who gives permission, the person who kills the animal, obviously he is liable to be punished. He who sells the slaughtered animal, after the animal is killed, that flesh is sold for those who want to eat meat, animal flesh. He who cooks the animal, somebody is going to cook that meat, because human beings don't eat raw flesh, unlike tigers and lions and all those carnivorous animals, human beings eat cooked flesh. So somebody is cooking that flesh. And those who administer distribution of this cooked meat, somebody is engaged in distributing it. And at last, the person who eats cooked animal food are all murderers. Six types of people are liable to be punished when animal killing happens in a civilized human society. All of them are liable to be punished, by the laws of nature. Why? Because no one can create a living being despite all advancement of material science, and therefore, no one has the right to kill a living being by one's independent wills. We cannot create life, so we cannot kill.

### Animal Sacrifice, Revival, Restrictions, Slaughterhouses

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "For the animal eaters, the scriptures have sanctioned restricted animal sacrifices only...just to restrict the opening of slaughterhouses."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses animal sacrifice in yajnas, explaining that it was traditionally performed with the ability to revive the animal and that scriptures only sanction restricted animal sacrifices to prevent widespread slaughterhouses.

So, we should also understand, if an animal is sacrificed in a yajna, then that animal being sacrificed, it will be revived. After the sacrifice, the animal which was killed will be revived. It will be given a new life. How? By brahmanas who know how to chant mantras and actually give new life to a dead animal. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu explains, in a sacrifice, when an animal is killed for the sake of the sacrifice, such animal is given a new life. So, therefore, Srila Prabhupada says, in modern times, when they are killing animals, they are not reviving the animal, they don't know how to give new life, so they are liable to be punished. They cannot kill animals like that. For the animal eaters, the scriptures have sanctioned restricted animal sacrifices only. See, animal sacrifice is restricted. And such sanctions are there just to restrict the opening of slaughterhouses, just so that people don't systematically kill animals in a slaughterhouse. To prevent that, Shastras give a concession that under highly restricted conditions, an animal flesh eater may sacrifice an animal in a suitable animal sacrifice. It is not meant for encouraging animal killing. This animal sacrifice sanctioned in the scriptures is never meant for animal killing.

**Key Quote:** "The procedure under which animal sacrifices are allowed in the scriptures is both good for the animal sacrificed and also good for the animal eaters."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that animal sacrifice, when performed according to scriptural guidelines, benefits both the animal (by promoting it to a human form) and the meat-eater (by saving them from grosser sins).

The procedure under which animal sacrifices are allowed in the scriptures is both good for the animal sacrificed and also good for the animal eaters. That's the way the scriptures are advising the animal sacrifice to be performed by meat eaters. It's good for the animal in the sense that the sacrificed animal is at once promoted to the human form of life after being sacrificed. After being sacrificed at the altar, when the rules are followed for animal sacrifice, the animal is immediately promoted to the human form of life. It doesn't have to wait for gradual evolution to the human form. And the animal eater is saved from grosser types of sins eating meat supplied by organized slaughterhouses. One is never meant to purchase flesh from a slaughterhouse. No. If at all they want to eat, the sanction is there for animal sacrifice to be performed, and in that way, one may under restricted conditions indulge in meat eating.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by condemning slaughterhouses as sources of sinful reactions that lead to calamities and suffering in society, emphasizing the link between sinful activities and natural disasters.

Not otherwise. These slaughterhouses, Srila Prabhupada describes here, are ghastly places for breeding all kinds of material afflictions to society, country, and the people in general. When there is a slaughterhouse, there is a wholesale sinful reaction that the country, the society, the people in general have to suffer. So it is very, very dangerous to have a slaughterhouse. It's not good for the society. The material world is itself a place always full of anxieties, and by encouraging animal slaughter, the whole atmosphere becomes polluted more and more. How does it become polluted? By war, pestilence, famine, and many other unwanted calamities. Calamities are because people become sinful in this society. Otherwise, there will be no calamities. So there is a link between some calamity and natural calamity and the sinful activities indulged in by the people in general. So they are linked up. It is not something accident or by chance something happened. No. There is no chance, there is no accident in this world. That's what the scriptures explain. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Furthermore I have personally heard you promise Draupadi that you would bring forth the head of the killer of her sons."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains verse 38 of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on Arjuna's promise to Draupadi regarding Ashwatthama.

In this session, we will be discussing the 38th and the 39th verses of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 38th verse: Pratishrutam Chabhavata Panchalyei Shunvatomama Aharishye Shrastasya Yaste Maanini Putraha. The meaning of this verse is Krishna is telling Arjuna, "Furthermore, I have personally heard you promise Draupadi that you would bring forth the head of the killer of her sons." This was what Arjuna had told Draupadi when Draupadi informed Arjuna that Ashwatthama had killed her five sleeping sons. So what was it that Arjuna had promised? In the 16th verse of the same chapter, Arjuna had said, "O gentle lady, when I present you with the head of that brahmana, after beheading him with arrows from my Gandiva bow, I shall then wipe the tears from your eyes and pacify you. Then, after burning your sons' bodies, you can take your baths standing on his head." Arjuna was very angry, angry at the act of Ashwathama killing, beheading, just cutting off their head when they were sleeping, the five sleeping sons of Draupadi, totally against all principles of Dharma Yudha. And so if Arjuna had promised to Draupadi, that's what Krishna is reminding Arjuna, "I personally heard you promise Draupadi that you will bring forth the head of the killer of her sons."

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's purport is explained, defining an aggressor and justifying the punishment of Ashwatthama, even though he is the son of a Brahmana.

Now Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "An enemy who sets fire to the house, administers poison, attacks all of a sudden with deadly weapons, plunders wealth, or usurps agricultural fields, or entices one's wife is called an aggressor. Such an aggressor, though he be a Brahmana or a so-called son of a Brahmana, has to be punished in all circumstances." So there's no question of sparing an aggressor; he has to be punished. When Arjuna promised to behead the aggressor named Ashwathama, he knew well that Ashwathama was a son of a Brahmana. Arjuna was quite aware who Ashwathama is; he's the son of Dronacharya, son of the teacher of Arjuna. But because the so-called Brahmana acted like a butcher, a butcher simply cuts off an animal which is meant for slaughter, so this Ashwatthama acted like a butcher. Therefore, Ashwatthama was taken as such, and there is no question of sin in killing such a Brahmana son who proved to be a villain. So there is no sin involved in killing an aggressor.

**Summary:** The speaker explains verse 39, where Krishna instructs Arjuna to kill Ashwatthama, emphasizing his crimes and degradation.

Krishna says, the meaning of this 39th verse: "This man is an assassin and murderer of your own family members. Assassin and murderer. Not only that, but he has also dissatisfied his master. He is but the burnt remnants of his family. Kill him immediately." So this is Krishna's instruction to Arjuna, that Krishna is telling, this Ashwatthama, he is a murderer of your own family members. He also dissatisfied his master. Who was Ashwathama's master? It was Duryodhana, and when Ashwathama revealed to Duryodhana that I have killed, and Duryodhana couldn't understand. This Ashwatthama has not fought against them and killed them in a fair battle. He has killed them while they were sleeping. So Duryodhana did not approve of this heinous act at all. Duryodhana was totally dissatisfied with this. He said, "You have not done the right thing." So therefore, Ashwathama is described as the burnt remnants of his family. He has completely degraded himself. Shamelessly has degraded himself. Therefore, Krishna tells Arjuna, "Kill him immediately. He deserves this kind of punishment." So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada

**Key Quote:** "Although Dronacharya joined the enemy camp, the Pandavas held him always in respect and Arjuna saluted him before beginning the fight."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's explanation of Dronacharya's respect and Arjuna's duty, even on opposing sides of the battlefield, is discussed.

explains, "The son of Dronacharya is condemned here as the burnt remnants of his family." How is Ashwathama the burnt remnants of his family? That's explained by Prabhupada. "The good name of Dronacharya was very much respected. Although Dronacharya joined the enemy camp, the Pandavas held him always in respect, and Arjuna saluted him before beginning the fight. There was nothing wrong in that way, fighting on the opposite sides." Arjuna is obviously on the Pandavas' side, but Dronacharya, he is the teacher of Arjuna. He is on the side of the Kauravas, the enemy side, but still Arjuna never lost any respect for Dronacharya, neither Dronacharya was having any inimical feeling towards Arjuna. That is explained by Srila Prabhupada. In another discourse, Prabhupada says, "Dronacharya, the teacher of Arjuna, is on the opposite side of the Pandavas, so Dronacharya had to be respected, and Arjuna did that." How did he do that? Before fighting with Dronacharya, Arjuna first of all threw one arrow on his lotus feet, indicating, "I am paying my obeisances to my teacher, my guru. This is called etiquette, my dear sir." Prabhupada explains, "You have taught me this fighting science, Dhanur Vidya, now it is being used against you because it is my duty to fight in this Dharma Yudha, so I offer my obeisances as a Kshatriya standing in the battlefield." How did Arjuna offer obeisances to Dronacharya? By shooting one arrow at the feet of Dronacharya. And Dronacharya also, he is a military teacher, he is standing ready for fighting against the enemy on the battlefield, and he is not ready to fight against the enemy on the Kaurava side, so what did Dronacharya do? He threw another arrow touching the head of Arjuna, "My dear boy, become blessed. I mean you have my blessings." That was Dronacharya indicated to Arjuna, and Srila Prabhupada explains, "This is duty."

**Key Quote:** "Fighting in a Dharma Yudha is a duty of a Kshatriya."
**Summary:** The concept of Dharma Yudha is explained, highlighting the duties of a Kshatriya and the blessings received in such a battle, followed by a discussion of cultural purification (Samskara).

"You are given blessings to kill me. Will anybody bless another person that you kill me? No, but this is in the matter of performing duty of fighting Dharma Yudha." This is called the Dharma Yudha. Why? Because in a Dharma Yudha, whether one is victorious or one is killed, either case, it is not fair to kill one or one is not, they are elevated to a higher status in their next life. That's why Dharma Yudha is duty. Fighting in a Dharma Yudha is a duty of a Kshatriya. That's what Krishna explains, sorry, Krishna explains in Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna, "Swadharmam, it is your Swadharma as a Kshatriya to fight in this Dharma Yudha." The disciple is fighting, touching the feet of Dronacharya. "It is my duty." And disciple is telling the teacher, "Please give me your blessing to fight." And Dronacharya, he is telling, "Yes, you have my blessings to fight in this Dharma Yudha." So continuing the purport of Srila Prabhupada, "But the son of Dronacharya degraded himself by committing acts which were never done by the dvijas or the twice-born higher castes." Who are the twice-born higher castes? The dvijas or twice-born higher castes belong to the first three varnas: Brahmana, Kshatriya, and Vaishya. They are the first birth from their parents, and there is a second birth. How is the second birth possible? By accepting the spiritual master as the father and Vedas as the mother. Veda Mata, Guru Pita. During the second birth, which is meant for beginning the learning of the Vedas, they go to Gurukul. In the Vedic culture, they are sent to Gurukul to be trained up. Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas. They are trained up by a qualified teacher, qualified Brahmana. This is called cultural purification, Samskara. It is called Samskara. It is cultural purification. Human life is meant for purification. So even by performing Samskaras, this purification happens.

### Spiritual Initiation, Murder, Aggressor, Punishment

**Key Quote:** "By birth from parents everyone is born a Shudra. But by spiritual initiation one becomes a Vidya."
**Summary:** The lecture continues with the importance of spiritual initiation and contrasts the act of killing in Dharma Yuga with the heinous murder committed by Ashwatthama, reiterating the justification for his punishment and concluding the discourse.

The scriptures declare, Janmana Jayate Shudra Samskarat Vijam Uchyate. So by birth from parents, everyone is born a Shudra, but by spiritual initiation, one becomes a Vidya. That initiation happens when one goes to a Guru and submits to the Guru, "I am your disciple. Please accept me as your disciple and train me, teach me Vedic knowledge." So continuing the purport, "Then murder by killing the five sleeping sons of Draupadi." This is murder. This is not like Kshatriya fights in a Dharma Yuga and kills the enemy. It is not like that. In that, there is no sin. It is not to be considered as murder, fighting in a Dharma Yuga. But here, the sleeping sons of Draupadi were killed by Ashwathama. And by this act of killing the sleeping sons of Draupadi, this Ashwathama dissatisfied his master Duryodhana. Duryodhana never approved of the heinous act of killing the five sleeping sons of the Pandavas. Now Duryodhana also was fighting the battle of Kurukshetra following the principles of Dharma Yuga. This is explained earlier by Krishna. Suptam means sleeping. One who is sleeping is not to be killed. So therefore, Ashwathama became an assaulter of Arjuna's family members, and thus he was liable to be punished by Arjuna. And therefore, Krishna tells Arjuna, "Now you must actually kill this aggressor Ashwathama. You should kill him."

You should punish him." And specifically what is Krishna telling? "You must kill him because he is an aggressor. He is a murderer of your family members. He dissatisfied his master. He has killed sleeping persons." So many good reasons for Arjuna to kill Ashwatthama.

So, it is important to understand the consideration why Arjuna decided not to kill Ashwatthama. Srila Prabhupada explains in the Purport to help us understand better. Arjuna was a great soul, undoubtedly, which is proved here also. In many instances in the Mahabharata, it is clearly established the Pandavas who are pure devotees of Krishna. The Bhagavatam says any pure devotee is full of all good qualities, yes.

**Key Quote:** "Arjuna justified not killing ashwathama even though ashwathama deserved the death of krishna but he was not killed by krishna even though ashwathama deserved the death of krishna but he was not killed by krishna even though ashwathama deserved the death of krishna to be killed"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how Arjuna will justify his decision not to kill Ashwatthama, despite Ashwatthama's degraded actions and Krishna's encouragement to punish him.

All good qualities that have been found in demigods are fully present in a pure devotee. So Arjuna is proved in this particular incident, as we will see towards the end of this chapter, how Arjuna justified not killing Ashwatthama, even though Ashwatthama deserved the death of Krishna, but he was not killed by Krishna, even though Ashwatthama deserved the death of Krishna, but he was not killed by Krishna, even though Ashwatthama deserved the death of Krishna to be killed. Now Arjuna is being encouraged personally by the Supreme Lord Krishna to kill the son of Dronacharya, this Ashwatthama, who is a murderer of Arjuna's family members, but Arjuna considers that the son of his great teacher should be spared, for he happens to be the son of Dronacharya, even though he is an unworthy son. He has degraded himself. Arjuna, Ashwatthama has degraded himself. Why? Because Ashwatthama has done all sorts of heinous acts whimsically for no one's benefit. What did he gain by doing this?

**Summary:** The speaker questions the appropriate punishment for Ashwatthama and highlights the difficulty in performing one's duty as a devotee, requiring careful consideration of the situation.

Ashwatthama did not gain anything. He could not please his master. He didn't do the right thing. He was an aggressor, assassin, murderer, breaking the principles of kathriya conduct in a dharma yudha. So he's definitely punishable. But what punishment? That is the question. Krishna told Arjuna, "You should kill him. He should not spare his life." But Arjuna is thinking, "How can I kill the son of my teacher whom he held in respect?" Now Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "Lord Sri Krishna encouraged Arjuna outwardly just to test Arjuna's sense of duty." Arjuna's sense of duty, what is his duty? In every circumstance, a devotee performs his duty. In every circumstance, in doing duty is the only thing that is difficult in doing the duty of your devotee.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Arjuna must punish Ashwatthama, but the nature of the punishment is the central question, and Krishna is aware of Arjuna's sense of duty.

Duty, there is always a consideration, how should I act in my position in terms of doing my duty. Now Arjuna should not simply let go Ashwatthama. Arjuna has to punish as a matter of duty. At the same time, in doing the duty, he has to consider what kind of punishment does this son of the teacher of Arjuna deserve? What kind of punishment does he deserve? Does he deserve the punishment of being killed or some other punishment? There is no doubt that he has to be punished as a matter of duty. Arjuna has to punish Ashwatthama. But what kind of punishment? That is elaborately discussed in the rest of the chapter. It is not that Arjuna was incomplete in the sense of his duty, nor was Lord Sri Krishna unaware of Arjuna's sense of duty.

Krishna knew Arjuna is aware of his duty and he will act responsibly. This is the difference between a devotee and a non-devotee. A non-devotee under all circumstances acts responsibly. A non-devotee may or may not be responsible in all his actions, because a non-devotee under the influence of the glaring material energy is carried away sometimes and will fail in properly doing his duty or fail in taking responsibility.

When he does a, plays a role, then Krishna performs his duties or activities perfectly, just to teach us. Now Srila Prabhupada gives the example of pure devotees who were put to test by Krishna and they came out successful. The gopis were put to such tests as well. Not only Arjuna is being tested by Krishna now, earlier the gopis also were put to such tests. Prahlad Maharaj was also put to such a test. All pure devotees come out successful in their respective tests by the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates how Hiranyakashipu became angry with Prahlad for chanting the name of Vishnu and tortured him for it.

So, Prahlad Maharaj appeared as the son of Hiranyakashipu. And when Hiranyakashipu came to know this son Prahlad of his is actually chanting the name and glorifying Vishnu, so he became, Hiranyakashipu became very angry against Prahlad. Said, "Don't ever utter even the name of my enemy." Why did Hiranyakashipu consider Vishnu as his enemy? Because Vishnu had killed Hiranyakashipu, Hiranyakashipu's elder brother. So therefore Hiranyakashipu thought Vishnu is my enemy. And he just told Prahlad, "Don't ever utter." But Prahlad as a devotee, he would always chant the name of the Supreme Lord because he is a devotee. Devotee always chants the names of the Supreme Lord. So Hiranyakashipu became more and more angry and he tried to stop his son, but he could not, to the extent that Prahlad was tortured by his father Hiranyakashipu just because Prahlad was chanting the holy name of the Supreme Lord. That's all.

No other fault. For this he was tortured. But he was, Prahlad was protected by the Supreme Lord.

He came and stopped Hiranyakashipu from further giving any trouble to Prahlad. And also Hiranyakashipu was delivered by the Supreme Lord. Delivered means he was killed, but that killing also is beneficial, that he is purified. But when Narsimade offered Prahlad, "You may take any benediction because you are my devotee and you have suffered so much at the hands of this demon." So Prahlad said, "I don't want any boon for myself, but I want you to pardon my father because he committed so many offenses against Hiranyakashipu, but I want you to pardon my father because he committed so many offenses against Hiranyakashipu, but he did not offense against the devotees. He blasphemed the devotees. He gave so much trouble to devotees. So kindly pardon."

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam describing Draupadi's reaction to Ashwatthama being brought before her after he murdered her sons.

Om Agyana Timiran Dhasya Gyanan Janishalakaya Chapsharun Miritam Yena Tasmai Shri Gurave Namaha Nama Om Vishnupadaya Krishna Preshtaya Bhutale Shri Mate Bhaktivedanta Swamin Nithinamine Namaste Saraswate Deve Gauravani Pracharine Nirvishesha Shunyavadi Pachatyade Shatarine Jaya Shri Krishna Chaitanya Prabhu Nithyananda Shri Advaita Gadadhara Shiva Sadi Gauravhakta Vrinda Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasa Tato Jaya Mudeerayet.

The meaning of this verse is: Sri Suta Goswami said, this is Suta Goswami speaking, Draupadi then saw Ashwathama who was bound with ropes like an animal and silent for having enacted the most inglorious murder. Due to her female nature and due to her being naturally good and well behaved, she showed him due respects as a brahmana.

**Key Quote:** "Draupadi then saw Ashwatthama who was bound with ropes like an animal and silent for having enacted the most inglorious murder due to her female nature and due to her being naturally good and well behaved she showed him due respects as a brahmana"
**Summary:** The speaker explains Draupadi's behavior of showing respect to Ashwatthama despite his heinous crime, contrasting it with Arjuna's treatment of him as a culprit.

So this verse is describing when Ashwatthama was brought bound up by Krishna, sorry, bound up by Arjuna. Both Krishna and Arjuna had gone in Arjuna's chariot, Krishna as the charioteer, chasing Ashwatthama who was trying to run away after having enacted the most inglorious murder. Ashwatthama had killed the five sleeping sons of Draupadi, and it was condemned even by his master, Ashwatthama's master, Duryodhana, because Duryodhana was fighting the battle on religious principles. So what are the Pandavas? So in such a battle, to kill somebody who is just sleeping, that is already explained earlier, it is not proper to kill somebody who's sleeping like that even though the person is on the enemy camp. It doesn't matter. Now here, Ashwatthama was bound with ropes like an animal, but what is Ashwatthama's position? Ashwatthama was bound up because he did not behave like a Brahmana. He did not behave like a Brahmana even though he is the son of a Brahmana, son of Dronacharya, son of the Acharya, teacher, military teacher of Arjuna, and he deserves to be respected as such, but he behaved in a most degrading manner. He degraded himself, so therefore Arjuna bound him up. But when he was brought in front of Draupadi, she showed him due respects as a Brahmana. See the difference in the way Draupadi looks at Ashwatthama and the way Ashwatthama is actually looked at by Arjuna after his having committed the most inglorious murder. So Srila Prabhupada explains...

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of Vedic culture and the training of the upper classes in proper behavior and etiquette.

in the purport, Ashwatthama was condemned by the Lord himself. Krishna told Arjuna he doesn't deserve to be respected as such, but he deserves to be excused because he has committed the most inglorious murder, has degraded himself, and even Ashwatthama was treated even by Arjuna just like a culprit, not like the son of a Brahmana or teacher. But then when the same Ashwatthama was brought in front of Srimati Draupadi, although she was very much aggrieved for the murder of her sons, the murderer was present before her, and in spite of all this, she could not withdraw the due respect generally offered to a Brahmana or the son of a Brahmana.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the Vedic perspective on women, emphasizing their mild nature and the need for protection to guide them towards goodness.

of the members, especially the members of the upper three classes, because they trained up, the Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas are trained up in proper behavior, proper etiquette, in the right, in the necessary skill to be acquired for them to do their profession, to earn their livelihood by their profession, by properly getting trained and acting responsibly in the society. So that is not there in the present time so much. It's not there. Whatever little culture remains, we still see in this great country, Bharatvarsha. We still see the remnants of the culture, but actually the training that should really happen is not happening. So Shrila Prabhupada says in the purport that Draupadi knew that Ashwatthama was actually a murderer, and she herself was directly affected. All her five sons were killed most ingloriously by Ashwatthama. In spite of that, she did not withdraw the due respect that is offered to such a brahmana or a son of a brahmana according to the very culture, according to the way she is trained up in the culture. Now it is also explained this is due to her mild nature as a woman. Their mild nature, women as a class are no better than boys, and therefore they have no discriminatory power like that of a man. So according to vedic civilization, because of the mild nature of a woman, she must be protected. She must be protected. So if they are protected, they can be led to goodness very easily, and if they are not protected, they can be polluted very easily also. That is a position of a woman.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the importance of training and character development from a young age, emphasizing that everyone is born into ignorance and needs guidance.

Just like a child, if you mold the character of a child from the very beginning, then such a child can grow up to be a great personality, either a man or a woman. If you train a woman from the very beginning how to become chaste and faithful to the husband, they can become a very good mother, a very good asset in the family, because the whole family life is especially meant for begetting good children. So unless the woman is chaste and faithful to the husband and is trained up, it will not be possible to beget good children. So this point of training, whether man or woman, both have to be trained. Janmana jayate shudra samskara vijam ucyate. This is also very important. Man or woman, by birth, nobody is generally qualified. I mean, generally, I mean somebody who's born under the force of karma, they are getting a body, a material body because of their past karma, so they have to be trained up. It doesn't matter even though they are born in a brahmin family, doesn't matter, but they have to be trained up. Untrained means they remain shudra, they remain ignorant, they remain ignorant, they remain purified, they remain into the transcendental. That is the number ignorant. By birth, everybody is born into ignorance. That is explained in the Bhagavad Gita.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the Vedic system of training for both men and women, emphasizing the ultimate aim of connecting with Krishna through yoga.

So everyone is born into ignorance, but they can be trained up. So that is a whole system in the Vedic culture to train up whether man or woman, everybody has to be trained up. So Srila Prabhupada says there is sufficient information in the Vedic literature how a man should be trained up, how a boy should be trained up, how a girl should be trained up, so that in future they may become happy, and what is that ultimate aim of life? How to become connected with Krishna as spirit soul. It doesn't matter whether you are a man or a woman, matter whether somebody is born as the son of a Shudra or a daughter of a Vaishya, it doesn't matter. They can be trained up. Everyone, every human being at least, can be trained up to understand the ultimate aim of life is to become connected with Krishna. That's called yoga. That specific science of yoga is taught by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. In the fourth chapter, Krishna says, imam vivasvate yogam proktavanaham avyayam. Krishna is telling, I taught the science of yoga to vivasva, and now I am going to teach you. He is telling Arjuna that same science of yoga. So that science of yoga is that actually each one of us, every spirit soul, every living being is connected with Krishna, and that connection is called yoga, and therefore ultimately one has to learn about who am I, who is Krishna, what is my relationship?

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of chanting Hare Krishna in Kali Yuga as the most effective way to cleanse the heart and attain knowledge and devotion.

This is what Chaitanya Mahaprabhu teaches as the fundamentals of the Vedic knowledge. There are so many departments and so many details, but we should learn this fundamental thing. You should not miss out this ultimate aim to connect with Krishna. So therefore Srila Prabhupada says that in this Kali Yuga, to get into the details of all these different divisions or branches of knowledge is not practically possible. There is no time, there is no inclination, there is no proper gurukul system to teach all those details according to the candidate, according to the circumstances. No, simply Chaitanyama would taught, chant Hare Krishna, chant Hare Krishna, and then by chanting Hare Krishna, all the knowledge will be revealed within the heart, and the heart becomes cleansed. By chanting Hare Krishna, all that knowledge will be rehealed and everything will become first-class when one becomes a devotee by chanting Hare Krishna. I will stop here. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Draupadi's motivations for showing respect to Ashwatthama despite his heinous act, highlighting her good nature and cultural understanding.

So this is the description continuing from the previous verse where, as soon as Ashwatthama was bound up and brought by Arjuna in front of Draupadi, she offered him respect out of being good-natured, mild-natured, and in spite of being aggrieved because of the inglorious murder committed by this Ashwatthama, in spite of that, out of respect according to the culture, she offered respects to him, and now she is telling, 'Release him. Why have you bound him up like an animal?' Are you mad at them?

teacher's son. So not only Ashwatthama was a Brahmana, but he also happened to be a teacher's son. Now, Arjuna, why did Arjuna arrest? Did Arjuna not know that Ashwatthama is a Brahmana and he's a son of Dronacharya, Arjuna's own teacher, military teacher? Now Prabhupada explains, Ashwatthama arrested, sorry, Arjuna arrested Ashwatthama knowing perfectly well that he was a son of Dronacharya. Krishna also knew him to be so, but both of them condemned the murderer without consideration of his being the son of a Brahmana. This is exactly according to revealed scriptures that a teacher or spiritual master is liable to be rejected if he proves that he is the son of a Brahmana.

**Key Quote:** "Ashwatthama failed to discharge the duties of a Brahmana or teacher why because he committed the most inglorious murder and therefore he was liable to be rejected from the exalted position of a Brahmana"
**Summary:** The speaker defines the role of a Guru and Acharya, emphasizing the importance of living by example and assimilating scriptures, and reiterates that Ashwatthama's actions warranted rejection from his position, contrasting Krishna and Arjuna's view with Draupadi's.

himself unworthy of the position of a guru or spiritual master. This is what the scripture is saying. The Guru is offered very high respect, but if he proves himself unworthy of the position of a guru. Now the position of the guru is very, very exalted. Guru is also called an acharya or a guru or a person who has actually assimilated all the essence of shastras and he also helps his disciples to adopt the ways of the scriptures. That is the position of guru, especially in the spiritual matters. This is specially applicable in spiritual matters when you say acharya, one who teaches by example, one who has assimilated the essence of the scriptures, one who teaches his disciples whatever that essence of the shastra is by personally training, instructing, giving very good instructions, and the disciple also is actually surrendered to the spiritual master and inquires from him about this wisdom, serves him in a submissive mood, he makes inquiries. So all this is there, but now in the case of Ashwatthama, here it is said Ashwatthama failed to discharge the duties of a Brahmana or teacher, why? Because he committed the most inglorious murder and therefore he was liable to be rejected from the exalted position of a Brahmana. On this consideration, both Lord Sri Krishna and Arjuna were right in condemning Ashwatthama. Both Krishna and Arjuna, they didn't treat Arjuna, Ashwatthama as a Brahmana, why? Because Ashwatthama had fallen down from his position and he was liable to be rejected as a Brahmana, but for Draupadi the matter was

**Key Quote:** "But the shastras say the son of the brahmana if he is not qualified as a brahmana he should not be accepted as a brahmana."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Draupadi's customary respect for Ashwatthama as a Brahmana's son with the shastric view that one's qualities, not birth, determine their social standing and respect, emphasizing Ashwatthama's degraded behavior.

considered not from the angle of shastric vision, but as a matter of custom. It is customary to offer the same respect that is offered to the father is offered to his son, especially when the father is a teacher, a brahmana, deserves all respects. So the son is also offered similar respect, that is a custom. Why? Because people generally accept the son of a brahmana as a brahmana. But the shastras say the son of the brahmana, if he is not qualified as a brahmana, he should not be accepted as a brahmana. You see, a lakshanam proktam. This is the verse in the Bhagavatam. Whatever the symptoms that are displayed by a person irrespective of the family in which he is born, irrespective of whose son he is, if he displays the symptoms of a shudra, he should be accepted as a shudra. In terms of social interaction, what is the respect that is due? What is the respect that is due? The respect that is due to a brahmana who is qualified is different. The respect that is due to a shudra who is not qualified as a brahmana but having the symptoms of a shudra is different. So Draupadi accepting Ashwathama who has degraded himself, behaved in the most degrading manner in killing Draupadi's own sons in a most inglorious way. He is a murderer. He is a criminal. So he should not be treated like a brahmana.

**Key Quote:** "Arjuna did not kill him. And Draupadi did not even withdraw the respect. This is a very, very advanced culture in human society, very advanced culture."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights the Vedic culture's emphasis on proper respect, noting that while Krishna urged Arjuna to kill Ashwatthama, Arjuna refrained due to respect for his guru's son, and Draupadi maintained her respect, showcasing an advanced cultural understanding.

So Srila Prabhupada is explaining elsewhere that in the Vedic culture, they know how to offer respect to the proper persons. They know how to offer respect. You consider Arjuna's position. Krishna told Arjuna after Ashwathama was arrested by Arjuna, Krishna told Ashwathama, 'Kill him. He doesn't deserve to actually be excused for this most inglorious murder he has committed.' But Arjuna did not kill him. Arjuna could have killed him, but he did not kill him. Why? Because Arjuna thought he is a murderer. Why? Why? Because Arjuna is a son of the brahmina. The son of my guru. So as son of guru, of course, he is not a brahmana. Son of a brahmana is not a brahmana when he is not behaving according to the brahmanical standard. So he is considered Brahma bandhu. He is a relative of a brahmana. He is a son of the brahmana. But son of a Brahmana, Arjuna did not kill him. Similarly, Draupadi, considering that he is a son of a Brahmana, she actually being very soft hearted, Vamasvabha, previous verse explained that Vamasvabha. She did not withdraw the respect that is due to Ashwatthama as the son of Dronachali. So the important point is that Arjuna did not kill him and Draupadi did not even withdraw the respect.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the Vedic culture's training in offering proper respects and emphasizes Draupadi's actions as characteristic of a pure devotee who can tolerate personal tribulations.

This is a very, very advanced culture in human society, very advanced culture. So Srila Prabhupada explains that that in the Vedic culture, they are trained up how to offer proper respects. So Srila Prabhupada explains that in the Vedic culture, they are trained up how to offer proper respects to different categories of people. The respect Draupadi is offering, so it is said here that in spite of all these disqualifications of Ashwatthama, Draupadi offered him respect and she even said, Mucchata, Mucchata, Meshya, release him. Why have you bound him up like an animal? He deserves respect because he is the son of the teacher, military teacher. So Srila Prabhupada in the end of the purport says, 'These are the characteristics of one who is a pure devotee of the Lord. A devotee of the Lord can tolerate all sorts of tribulations personally. A devotee of the Lord can tolerate all sorts of tribulations personally. A devotee of the Lord can tolerate all sorts of tribulations personally.'

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Draupadi's tolerance and lack of unkindness even towards her enemy, highlighting that a pure devotee is decorated with saintly qualities, referencing SB 1.2.6.

A devotee of the Lord can tolerate all sorts of tribulations personally. A devotee of the Lord can tolerate all sorts of tribulations personally. A devotee of the Lord can tolerate all sorts of tribulations personally. A devotee of the Lord can tolerate all sorts of tribulations personally. A devotee of the Lord can tolerate all sorts of tribulations personally. A devotee of the Lord can tolerate all sorts of tribulations personally. Personally, Draupadi is affected very, very, very badly. Her all the five sons have been killed in a, in a very, very bad manner, beheading when they're sleeping. So in spite of that, she's tolerant because she's a pure devotee, and in spite of so much tribulation, a devotee tolerate such tribulations and never are unkind to others, even to the enemy. Draupadi did not show any, any, any consideration, had don't have any consideration that he is enemy and he is unjustly killed my sons in a proper battle, Dharma Yudha, while fighting against each other. If they are killed, whoever is killed, it is not improper, but here they are not given a chance to defend themselves, you then attacked. So that is in spite of this, Draupadi being a pure devotee of the Lord. So the scriptures say a pure devotee is decorated with all good qualities of saintly behavior. This is automatic when somebody becomes a devotee. Yasyaasti bhaktir bhagavati akinchana sarvair gunaistatra samasate surah. All the good qualities of the deuxboutus of divine natured persons are to be found only in a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord. Bhakti okinchen doctor the agent. So this pure devotion is so very important, only pure devotion brings out all the good qualities of a person.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam about Dhanurveda, the Vedic military science, and how it involves controlling weapons with Vedic hymns, a science lost in modern times.

Sarahasyo Dhanur Vedaha Savisargo Pasamyamaha Astra Gramascha Bhavata Shikshito Yad Anugrahat. The meaning of this verse is, it was by Dronacharya's mercy that you learnt the military art of throwing arrows and the confidential art of controlling weapons. Sarahasyo Dhanur Vedaha. So Shri La Prabhupada explains in the purport, Dhanur Veda or military science was taught by Dronacharya with all its confidential secrets of throwing and controlling by Vedic hymns. This is unknown in modern times. Control a weapon after releasing it by mantra, sound. Gross military science is dependent on material weapons but finer than that is the art of throwing arrows saturated with Vedic hymns which act more effectively than gross material weapons like machine guns or atom bombs. See the difference? That art, or the science, is lost now. It's not there. The control is by Vedic mantras or the transcendental science of sound. Vedic mantras, they are not ordinary sounds. The sound can be used to direct a weapon, to control a weapon.

**Key Quote:** "He could pierce his target with his arrow by only hearing the sound without seeing the object."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Maharaj Dasaratha and his mastery of Shabda Vedi, the art of hitting a target by sound, and how he accidentally killed a Brahmachari named Shravan Kumar, leading to negative consequences.

To target a particular person when you release a weapon. That is lost now. That science is lost. So in the Ramayana, it is said that Maharaj Dasaratha, the father of Lord Sri Rama used to control arrows by sound only. He could pierce his target with his arrow by only hearing the sound without seeing the object. So Srila Prabhupad explains, it is called Shabda Vedi. Just like I cannot see where is a bird, but the bird is chirping. And by Shabda Vedi, I can release an arrow. It will go wherever the bird is by the dint of the sound the bird is making. And it will go and kill that bird. So, this is called Shabda Vedi. Now Maharaja Dasharatha used it. He knew this science and he used it. And once he made a mistake of instead of killing an animal in the forest, he killed a boy, one Brahmachari. It is described in the Ramayana. Because that Brahmachari had come, he was taking his parents on a pilgrimage and they were old. He was carrying them in a palanquin and when they were thirsty on the way, so he stopped and he went to fetch water. So, he went looking for a water source and he found a pond with clear water. So, when he dipped that pot in the pond to get water, it made sound and this Dasharatha, was actually hiding. And when he heard that sound, he thought here is some animal that has come to drink water in the pond. So, he released an arrow aimed at whoever was actually making that sound while fetching water or drinking water. And the arrow went and actually pierced that Brahmachari. His name was Shravan Kumar. That is described in the Ramayana. And Shravan Kumar almost immediately was killed by the arrow released by Dasharatha. Then Dasharatha, after having released the arrow, when he heard a human being is crying out, then he went and saw, Oh, I have killed a Brahmachari. He never intended to kill a Brahmachari. No. But he mistook by the sound of that pot he was trying to fill. He mistook that sound to be the sound of an animal drinking water. And because he knew the science without seeing the target, He actually shot the arrow, Shabda Vedi, and it went and pierced that target. The Brahmachari who made that sound while filling the pot.

**Key Quote:** "So I have come to give you water. Then they were ecstatic. They were extremely aggrieved because only his son, they were dependent on him."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of Dasharatha, explaining how the Brahmachari's parents cursed him, leading to his grief and death due to Rama's exile, but ultimately, Dasharatha was blessed to have the Supreme Lord as his son.

So when he came and saw, he was very, very repentant. Then just before that boy died, he said, my parents are waiting nearby. They are elderly. They are in a palanquin. So kindly give them water. They are very thirsty. So this Dasharatha, and saying this, he died. Dasharatha took that pot of water and actually went to give that water to nearby. He saw a palanquin and two elderly people. Obviously, the parents of that Brahmachari, Shravan Kumar, were sitting. And he went and tried to give them water. They asked, who are you? He said, I am actually a king. And I had come for hunting. And I am very sorry to inform you that by mistake, instead of killing an animal, I killed your son. So I have come to give you water. Then they were ecstatic. They were extremely aggrieved because only his son, they were dependent on him. And they cursed this Dasharatha that even Dasharatha would die being aggrieved by the loss of his son. And what happened? Because of that curse, Dasharatha, at the time of coronation of Lord Ramachandra, his eldest son, he was obliged to his youngest queen, Kaikeyi, that she demanded that Rama be banished, sent to the forest in exile, 14 years. And that her own son, Bharata, be enthroned as the king. And because Dasharatha was bound by a promise to this queen, Kaikeyi, he had to actually fulfill that promise. And then even though he was reluctant, when Rama came to know that his father had promised his stepmother, so he agreed to actually fulfill that demand of his stepmother. Because he wanted to keep his father's promise intact. He did not want to break that promise. So Rama was, he went away to the forest. And Dasharatha could not tolerate that his son was actually banished just when he was about to be coronated. And in that grief he died. Of course, because Rama is no ordinary son, dying while constantly thinking and calling out his name, that was good for Dasharatha. Because Rama is the Supreme Lord. So that was his blessing that he got the Supreme Lord as his son. And therefore, even if, whatever be the case, he was actually fortunate. But still, Dasharatha did commit a grave mistake by not properly utilizing the Shabda Vedi. So they knew this science.

**Key Quote:** "The Vedas ultimate goal is to know or understand Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the Upavedas, including Dhanurveda, Ayurveda, Sthapatyaveda, and Gandharvaveda, emphasizing that the ultimate goal of the Vedas is to understand Krishna and our relationship with Him.

And that's how Arjuna was taught all this by Dronacharya. The science called Dhanurveda. It is one of the Upavedas. Dhanurveda, Ayurveda, Sthapatyaveda, Gandharvaveda. The science of dance and music. The science of architecture. That's how they used to build beautiful temples. Nice Gopurams, nice Vimanam. Very intricately carved, exact dimensions, etc. So all these sciences are there in the Vedas. Upaveda. It is subsidiary. Because the main subject matter of the Vedas is Brahmavidya, Atmavidya. Spiritual science. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, Adhyatmavidya Vidyanam. So, don't be carried away by some subsidiary subsidiary subject matter of the Vedas. Because the main aim of the Vedas Vedaischa Sarvair Ahameva Vedyam. The Vedas ultimate goal is to know or understand Krishna. So this is very important. As I mentioned earlier in a previous session, that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu teaches us the main teaching of the Vedas is Who am I? Who is Krishna? And what is my relationship with Krishna? This is the ultimate goal of life. To re-establish our lost relationship with Krishna in devotional service. In devotional service.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "They are not carried away by those skills."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of the Pandavas to illustrate how even with worldly achievements, pure devotees remain focused on Krishna consciousness and detachment, ultimately renouncing everything to return to the Lord.

So that way, if somebody learns even a subsidiary subject matter in the Vedas, they understand the ultimate goal is not merely the use of that particular skill or that subject matter. Just like the Pandavas. They won the battle of Kurukshetra. But they ruled for very short time. Because they were ruling because it was Krishna's instruction to them. Because they were divine natured. So they should be ruling the people. Because they are divine natured. Not demoniac natured persons like Kauravas. So they were ruling. But when they came to know that Krishna has actually departed for his personal abode. Immediately they retired. Immediately they retired and went on Mahaprasthana. They renounced. Of course before renouncing they handed over charge of ruling to the grandson, Arjuna's grandson Parikshit Maharaj. So Yudhishthira handed over charge to Parikshit Maharaj. And all the five Pandavas they went away. Mahaprasthana. They keep walking while remembering the Supreme Lord. And in that consciousness of remembrance of the Lord they will quit the body. Whenever it is time to quit the body. They keep walking, walking, walking. So they are conscious of the ultimate goal is to prepare oneself to quit the body while remembering the Lord. And therefore when they learnt that Krishna has gone back to his abode and Narada had told you remain here on the earth till Krishna is here. And after that you go back to Krishna. Because they are all belonging to Krishna. They are associates of Krishna. Personal associates. So they go back to Krishna. They came for the sake of participating in Krishna's pastimes as Krishna's assistants. And they go back. This is the position of a pure devotee. So as pure devotees they never forget they teach us by their exemplary behavior. What is the proper goal in spite of studying these other subjects. They are not carried away by those skills. I will stop here.

**Key Quote:** "So in either case, Ashwathama was a representative of Dronacharya, and therefore killing Ashwathama would be like killing Dronacharya."
**Summary:** The speaker explains verse 45, focusing on Draupadi's argument against killing Ashwatthama, emphasizing that Ashwatthama represents Dronacharya.

In this session we will be discussing from the 45th and the 46th verses of the 7th chapter of 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 45th verse is Saesha Bhagavang Dronaha Praja Rupena Vartate Tasyatmano Urdham Patnyaste Nanvagad Veerasu Kripi. The meaning of this verse is, He that is Dronacharya is certainly still existing, being represented by his son. His wife Kripi did not undergo a sati with him because she had a son. Gravapati is explaining the reason why Ashwatthama should not be killed. She is coming up with so many different arguments that here she is saying that she is not a good person. She is telling Dronacharya he died in the battle but he is still existing because he is represented by his son, Praja Rupena Vartate, and Dronacharya is referred out of respect by Draupadi as Bhagavan Dronaha, Saesha Bhagavata Dronacharya is referred out of respect by Draupadi as Bhagavan Dronaha, Saesha Bhagavata. So it is explained by Srila Prabhupada in the purport, the wife of Dronacharya, Krippi, is a sister of Krippacharya, a devoted wife, who is according to the revealed scripture, the better half of her husband, is justified in embracing voluntary death along with her husband, if she is without issue. But in the case of the wife of Dronacharya, she did not undergo such a trial, because she had her son, the representative of her husband. So Srila Prabhupada explains, a widow is a widow only in name, if there is a son of her husband existing. So in either case, Ashwathama was a representative of Dronacharya, and therefore killing Ashwathama would be like killing Dronacharya. That was the argument.

**Key Quote:** "A slight insult for a respectable family is sufficient to invoke grief."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces verse 46, highlighting the importance of respecting respectable families and avoiding actions that cause grief.

The argument of Draupadi against the killing of Ashwathama. Draupadi was against killing Ashwathama. The 46th verse. The meaning of this verse is, O most fortunate one, who knows the principles of religion, it is not good for you to cause grief to glorious family members, who are always respectable and worshipful. So Srila Prabhupada says, in the purport to this 46th verse, A slight insult for a respectable family is sufficient to invoke grief. Therefore, a cultured man should always be careful in dealing with worshipful family members. So Srila Prabhupada has explained elaborately these two verses in a discourse he had given earlier.

### Guru, Dronacharya, Bhagavan, Opulence, Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The original Bhagawan is Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Dronacharya's position as Guru and the meaning of 'Bhagavan,' ultimately defining Krishna as the supreme Bhagavan possessing all opulences.

Now, the point explained. The point explained by Prabhupada, especially with reference to these two verses, is that what is the position of Dronacharya in the life of the Pandavas. Dronacharya is accepted as Guru by the Pandavas. They were trained up by Dronacharya. And Dronacharya, especially as required by the Pandavas. As regards Arjuna, Dronacharya taught all the secrets. And already Draupadi has pointed out, It is only by the mercy of Dronacharya that you learnt all the secrets about Dhanur Vidya or Dhanur Veda. So Draupadi is not an ordinary woman. You should always remember this. She knows everything about religious principles. And therefore she is teaching the assembly of respectable learned persons how the spiritual master should be respected. She herself is referring to Dronacharya as Bhagawan Drona. Anyone who is extraordinarily powerful is addressed as Bhagawan. Sometimes Narada is addressed as Bhagawan. Sometimes Lord Shiva is addressed as Bhagawan. They are all extraordinarily powerful personalities. The original Bhagawan is Krishna. The definition given by Parashara Muni in the Shastra is who is Bhagawan. One who possesses the sum total of all the wealth and the other opulences. Six opulences. Sum total of all the six opulences possessed by Krishna, Bhagawan Krishna. He is the supreme Bhagawan. But there are others who are not exactly in the position of Krishna as supreme. But they are also having certain extent the same qualities as Krishna. The qualities of Bhagawan they have. So in that sense they also can be addressed as Bhagawan. Because they are extraordinarily powerful compared to other persons. But they are not having Samagra Aishwarya. They are not having the sum total of all the wealth. So that position possessing the sum total of all the wealth is held only by one person. Krishna. Nobody else can equal him.

### Praja, Father-Son Relationship, Vedic Culture, Widow

**Key Quote:** "Dronacharya is still present in the form of his son Ashwathama."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of 'Praja' (offspring) and the father-son relationship in Vedic culture, emphasizing that a son represents the father, and a woman with a son is not considered a widow even if her husband is deceased.

Nobody else can excel him. So she is telling he is extraordinarily powerful personality, Dronacharya. Saesha Bhagawan Drona. Praja roopena vartate. He is still existing. Praja. In the form of Praja. Praja means offspring, son or daughter. So one who is born of the father is called Praja. Now without father there is no possibility of any birth taking place, either son or daughter. So one who gives birth, Prajayate. Praja is the product of the body of the father. That's what Prabhupada explains. The father's body is actually present in the form of the son or daughter, Praja. The Shastra says, Yatha yoni yatha bijam. Father is the bijam. The seed is given by the father. And just like you sow a seed in the ground, then a huge tree comes up. So the seed itself is generated by the tree. But that seed again grows up to be a tree. So the seed is tree later on. Similarly, the seed is put by the father in the womb of the mother, implanted. And when you sow a seed in the ground, you take care for it to properly grow. Similarly, the seed is sown in the womb of the mother, and the mother takes care of the seed and becomes a big body and comes out. So this is the process of birth. In one sense, the seed and the tree there is no difference. Similarly, there is no difference between the son and the father. No difference. The seed of the father and the father himself, there is no difference. So Dronacharya is still present in the form of his son, Ashwathama. So according to Vedic culture, this is very important to understand. A woman who has got a son, even if her husband is dead, she is not considered a widow. Widow, which actually means a woman who doesn't have a husband, who has lost her husband, husband is dead. But if the husband's representative is there, the son, then the woman is not a widow.

### Wife, Better Half, Absolute Truth, Draupadi's Argument

**Key Quote:** "So in the same way, the wife is considered the better half of the husband, Ardhangini."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the concept of the wife as the 'better half' and connects it to the absolute truth, reiterating Draupadi's argument that killing Ashwatthama is equivalent to killing Dronacharya.

So in English also it is said, the wife is considered half the body. In Sanskrit also. In English, better half. So where is this concept coming from? So Prabhupada explains, this concept is coming from the absolute truth. The ultimate source of everything is the absolute truth, Krishna. So we have finished that. Now, we have to 1962. We have done this. Now, we have to specifically explain. To understand we completely understand it in abstract language. Why as we have heard it coming. Up grilled. Hannah and zyangorji. Yes this tradition is also like it was before. These ideas. So Radha and Krishna have combined in the form of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. So in the same way, the wife is considered the better half of the husband, Ardhangini. And the son is there. In so many ways, Draupadi is trying to convince, don't think Dronacharya is dead and gone. Dronacharya is still existing. So killing the son of Dronacharya means killing Dronacharya. So do not do this. This is Draupadi's argument.

**Key Quote:** "Being a Vaishnavi, being a devotee, a pure devotee, not just a devotee, a pure devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of acting in a way that glorifies the family, adhering to religious principles, and highlights Draupadi's compassion and devotion as a Vaishnavi, considering the grief that killing Ashwatthama would cause his mother, Kripi.

And one should act in such a way that the action will always be glorified in the family. Now Pandava's family is a very respectable family. So Draupadi is telling also, if you know the principles of religion, you will not perform any action which will bring down the glory of the family. You should not do such an action. So therefore, you should take care in dealing with the family members of Dronacharya, especially Krippi. So there will be further reasons given by Draupadi why Ashwathama should not be killed in the next two verses. Now Draupadi is a Vaishnavi. That will be explained in the next verse. She is a great devotee. Earlier also Prabhupada had mentioned in the Purport that she is a pure devotee. Therefore, even though she is aggrieved because of the loss of her sons, she is thinking not just of her own problem. She is thinking how Krippi will be put into so much of grief. She has already lost her husband. Further, if you kill Ashwathama, she is going to be put into so much more grief. So Draupadi has all such considerations. Being a Vaishnavi, being a devotee, a pure devotee, not just a devotee, a pure devotee. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Do not make the wife of Dronacharya cry like me. I am agreed for the death of my sons. She need not cry constantly like me."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 47th verse of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on Draupadi's compassion for the wife of Dronacharya.

In this session, we will be discussing Narayanam Namaskritaya Naram Chai Vanarottamam from the 47th and 48th verses of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 47th verse: Ma Rodid Asya Janani Gautami Patidevata Yathaham Brta Vatsarta Rodimi Ashrumukhi Muhuhu. The meaning of this verse is, My Lord, this is Draupadi speaking to Arjuna, do not make the wife of Dronacharya cry like me. I am agreed for the death of my sons. She need not cry constantly like me. See how very considerate is Draupadi. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada said that, sympathetic good lady as she was, Srimati Draupadi did not want to put the wife of Dronacharya in the same position of childlessness, both from the point of motherly feelings and from the respectable position held by the wife of Dronacharya. From two perspectives she is saying, that why should she suffer like me? And also, she is a respectable lady as the wife of the Guru, so why should she be made to suffer?

**Key Quote:** "The Kshatriyas had become very puffed up, very proud, and they were not doing their duties properly as Kshatriyas."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the story of Parashurama and his annihilation of miscreant Kshatriyas, relating it to Draupadi's plea to Arjuna.

The Kshatriyas had become very puffed up, very proud, and they were not doing their duties properly as Kshatriyas. So he decided to kill all these miscreant Kshatriyas. So he simply took one chopper, Parashu. He is called Parashurama. His name is Rama, but he is called Parashurama because he took one axe. Parashu means axe, and simply went around the world 21 times, Trisaptaha, and simply went on chopping the heads of all these miscreant Kshatriyas. 21 times he went around the world to get rid of all these miscreants. So the rage of the Brahmanas is very dangerous for the lower persons, especially the Kshatriyas. So that is exactly what Draupadi is pointing out here. Don't enrage them. She is telling Arjuna, don't enrage them. They don't deserve to be treated the way you are thinking of punishing Ashwathama.

**Key Quote:** "Draupadi is sympathetic to Krippi because Draupadi is a Vaishnavi. This is the attitude of all Vaishnavas, all pure devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Draupadi's compassion stems from her being a Vaishnavi, highlighting the quality of 'Para Dukha Dukhi' and using Prabhupada's preaching as an example.

And Srila Prabhupada explains further, in addition to the purport, he has given a very nice discourse on these two verses. He says in this discourse that Draupadi is sympathetic to Krippi. Why? Because Draupadi is a Vaishnavi. This is the attitude of all Vaishnavas, all pure devotees. What is that? Para Dukha Dukhi. Vaishnava is having some special qualifications. One of them is Para Dukha Dukhi. On their own account, they are never unhappy, but they are Dukhi, they are unhappy only if others are unhappy, others are put into distress, then they become distressed. They can't tolerate seeing others suffer. This is the quality of a Vaishnava. Just like Prabhupada, he took so much trouble travelling all over the world and preaching Krishna Consciousness. Why? Because he could not tolerate to see the suffering of the conditioned souls. And how can their suffering be relieved? Only by Krishna Consciousness. That's why he was so painstakingly untiring in his efforts he put for preaching Krishna Consciousness to all sections of people all over the world.

**Key Quote:** "Look at the character, to give an example, Prahlad Maharaj. He was harassed by his father, who was a demon, Hiranyakashipu was a demon."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the example of Prahlad Maharaj and his devotion despite the torture inflicted by his demoniac father, Hiranyakashipu.

So here now, Prabhupada is explaining, look at the character. To give an example, Prahlad Maharaj. Prahlad Maharaj says, Naivodhvijeparaduratyavaitaranyas Tvadvirya Gayana Mahamruta Magna Chittaha Shochetato Vimukachetasa Indriyartha Mayasukhayabharam Udvahato Vimudhan. Prahlad Maharaj, before explaining what is quoted about Prahlad, that he was harassed by his father, who was a demon. Hiranyakashipu was a demon. Prahlad was a devotee. Now, just because Prahlad was just chanting the name of the Supreme Lord, as a devotee, it's natural, but Hiranyakashipu became very, very angry at Prahlad, his own son, small boy, five year old boy, just because he is chanting the name of the Supreme Lord. That enraged Hiranyakashipu to what extent? He became angry is that he actually tortured this boy, Prahlad, tortured the boy. And because Hiranyakashipu was torturing Prahlad, therefore the Supreme Lord, he cannot tolerate. The devotee is tolerant, devotee is tolerant, but Supreme Lord Krishna, he never tolerates even a little insult done to his devotee. So the Supreme Lord appeared in the form of Narsimha, and he, Narsimha, killed this Hiranyakashipu. Now, after that, Narsimha Deva, he blessed Prahlad, very pleased with his devotion, and he said, you have undergone so much trouble for my sake, now you ask me any benediction that you want.

**Key Quote:** "Prahlad is telling Lord Narsimha Deva, since I have taken birth in this Asura family, please don't allure me by offering me some benediction."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of Prahlad Maharaj, focusing on his humility and his expression of satisfaction through chanting the glories of the Lord.

Prahlad is telling in his prayers to Lord Narsimha, my dear Lord, I am born in a family which is filled with these qualities of Rajoguna and Tamoguna. Asuras, they are influenced by these two lower qualities, Rajoguna and Tamoguna. Rajas Tamo Bhava Asuras, they are influenced by these two lower qualities, Rajoguna, Tamoguna, and Devatas, they are influenced by Sattva Guna. So as compared to those influenced by Sattva Guna, these Rajoguna Tamoguna people, they are very much carried away by wealth, power, by position, etc. So Prahlad is telling Lord Narsimha Deva, since I have taken birth in this Asura family, please don't allure me by offering me some benediction. And Prahlad is also telling, actually, I have learned how to be fully satisfied and happy simply by singing the glories of your Lordship, Tvad Veerya Gayana Mahamrita Magna Chitta. The glories of the Supreme Lord, when chanted, and that nectarian glories of the Supreme Lord, as enumerated by pure devotees, is capable of fully immersing a devotee's mind. A devotee, when he hears, or he hears that nectar, he is able to immerse himself completely, and that way he is always situated in a happy condition.

**Key Quote:** "Like I have been put into so much grief by loss of my sons in the death of my sons, she need not cry constantly like me. So don't punish Ashwatthama."
**Summary:** The speaker returns to the initial theme of Draupadi's compassion, explaining her plea to not punish Ashwatthama in order to spare his mother, Kripi, the grief she herself experienced.

On his personal account, there is no one who is not happy because of that. Now she is thinking, what about Kripi? Ashwatthama is the one who actually beheaded the five sleeping sons of Draupadi, but she didn't kill this Ashwatthama in retaliation or in terms of punishment. Why? Because like I have been put into so much grief by loss of my sons, in the death of my sons, she need not cry constantly like me. So don't punish Ashwatthama the way you have bound him up and you are having some plan to succeed. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** Sut Goswami narrates the story of Ashwatthama's actions and Arjuna's pursuit and capture of him, setting the stage for Draupadi's reaction.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session we will be discussing from the 49th and the 50th verses of the 7th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. The 49th verse: Sutavvacha Dharmam Nyayam Sakarunam Nirvyalikam Samam Mahat Raja Dharmasuto Ragnaha Pratyanandat Vachodvijaha. Sut Goswami's address, addressing the sages of Naimisharanya, addressing them as vijaha, O brahmanas. King Yudhishthira fully supported the statements of the queen which were in accordance with the principles of religion and were justified, glorious, full of mercy and equity and without duplicity. So, Sut Goswami is describing the incident, the first incident from where Bhagavatam begins, the narration of the Bhagavatam begins by Sut Goswami. The son of Dronacharya, Ashwatthama, he beheaded the five sleeping sons of Draupadi and Draupadi was very much aggrieved and Arjuna decided to punish this Ashwatthama. So, Arjuna went chasing, and Ashwatthama released a brahmastra just to save his life but under Krishna's guidance Arjuna was able to neutralize that brahmastra and he anyway, Arjuna was able to capture this Ashwatthama.

**Key Quote:** "Draupadi was very conscious, this Ashwatthama, even though he is an aggressor, atatai, still, he is the son of Dronacharya."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Draupadi's compassion for Ashwatthama, considering his father Dronacharya's position and the potential suffering of Ashwatthama's mother, and King Yudhishthira's support of Draupadi's statements.

He bound him like an animal and brought him to his own camp and presented him to Draupadi. Draupadi was very conscious, this Ashwatthama, even though he is an aggressor, atatai, still, he is the son of Dronacharya. And who is Dronacharya? Dronacharya is the teacher who taught Arjuna and all the Pandavas for that matter. Particularly Arjuna was taught all the secrets of Dhanur Vidya, Dhanur Veda. So Draupadi always remembered that the Pandava family has to be always grateful to Dronacharya. So considering Dronacharya's position and also Dronacharya was killed in the battle, and Dronacharya's wife, Ashwatthama's mother had become a widow. Widow means she had lost her husband. She is not a widow because her son is still surviving. So she had become, she had lost her husband. So Draupadi did not want Krippi to suffer the same way she was suffering the loss of her sons. So therefore it is described here, Draupadi particularly reasoned and told Arjuna not to kill Ashwatthama as a punishment for whatever Ashwatthama had done. So Asutu Goswami is telling King Yudhishthira fully supported the statements of the queen Draupadi.

**Key Quote:** "Dharmya means they are in accordance with the principles of religion."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of 'Dharmya' and contrasts human life, which should be guided by Dharma, with animal life, which is primarily focused on bodily needs.

Now what is described about the statements of Queen Draupadi, very nicely it is told here. Dharmya means they are in accordance with the principles of religion. This is very important, that should become conversant with the principles of religion and conduct themselves accordingly. They should be conversant with the principles of religion. The difference between human life and animal life as described in the scriptures is that human life is not just meant for satisfying the demands of the body. These four demands of the body are there whether animals or humans. This is the material platform, bodily platform that when we have got this body there is the need of aahara. We have to take food so many times a day to maintain the body. Nidra, rest, sleep is required to rejuvenate this body and bhaya, one has to defend oneself against so many dangers, so many problems, so many threats. One has to defend oneself and maithuna, one has to procreate. There is sex life, and the sex life is meant for procreation, for creating progeny. So these four demands are there of the body, whether animals are humans. Samanya metad pashubhi narana, but there is one extra special function of the human being that's called Dharma, the principles of religion. That is called Dharma, the principles of religion.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Dharma is the eternal, inseparable, intrinsic nature of something."
**Summary:** The speaker defines Dharma not as a sectarian faith but as the intrinsic nature of something, using examples like fire, rivers, and sugar, and then states that the Dharma of a human being is to render service, specifically to Krishna.

Now religion should not be understood as some sectarian system of faith. Many times Srila Prabhupada explains this because that is a misconception in the society in general among the people, that when you say Dharma, immediately they take it like some kind of faith, some system. No, it is not a system of faith. Dharma is the eternal, inseparable, intrinsic nature of something. Like the Dharma of fire is heat and light. Wherever there is fire, there has to be heat and light. You cannot have fire where there is no heat. You cannot have fire where there is no light. Not possible. It is intrinsically the quality of fire. So Dharma of fire is heat and light. Dharma of a river is to flow. River means it keeps flowing, flowing, flowing till it reaches the ocean. So then only it is called a river, Nadi. And similarly, Dharma of sugar is the sweet taste of sugar. So you cannot have sugar which is not sweet in taste. Then it is not sugar. Sugar means it should be sweet in taste, and it gives that sweet taste to whatever you mix sugar with. It gives the sweet taste, right? So that, like that, what is the Dharma of a human being? Human being has got Dharma. What is the Dharma of the human being? So that is explained in the scriptures. Dharma of the human being is to render service, to render service. So one should render service to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "If the human being is not engaged in service of Krishna then he is forced to serve illusion and the consequence of serving illusion is misery."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that if one does not serve Krishna, one is forced to serve illusion, leading to misery, while serving Krishna leads to transcendental bliss.

Otherwise, one will be forced to serve illusion in different ways. So every living being in this material world and particularly every human being, if the human being is not engaged in service of Krishna, then he is forced, he or she, whoever it may be, is forced to serve illusion in different ways. Somebody may think, I am master. I am not the servant of anyone. But then he may think like that, but actually he is servant of lust. He is servant of his senses. He is servant of greed, anger, so many things. That means when there is anger, he has to satisfy the demand of anger. When there is lust, lusty desire, he cannot resist fulfillment of their lusty desire. So one is forced to be the servant of illusion if one does not engage in service of Krishna. This is the whole, this is the perfect and proper understanding of Dharma. So an intelligent person will think if mine intrinsic quality or nature is to serve, why should I serve the illusory energy and in exchange for the service of the illusion, what do we get? Only misery. You can see that the person who is not engaged in service of the illusory energy and in exchange for the service of the illusion, what do we get? Only misery. Illusory energy only keeps giving us misery after misery after misery. Sometimes there is some respite or break from misery and we think that is some kind of happiness. So relief from misery is considered or thought of as happiness in this material world for all those who are busy serving illusion. Of course people do not know that they are busy serving illusion. They are in ignorance. That's another quality, nature of being in the material world. Everybody is ignorant of this fact that I am servant. If I don't serve Krishna then I am forced to serve illusion and the consequence of serving illusion is misery, but if somebody serves Krishna then there is only transcendental bliss.

**Key Quote:** "The transcendental bliss and Krishna consciousness in serving Krishna is totally different experience you just have to taste it once then you really understand what is real happiness."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the experience of serving Krishna, describing it as a path to sacchidananda (eternal life, full knowledge, and bliss), contrasting it with the miseries of serving illusion.

Eternal life, full knowledge, sacchidananda. That is the experience of serving Krishna. Krishna is a supreme sacchidananda. We as spirit soul, we are also tiny sacchidananda and that nature, that spiritual nature, sacchidananda nature is possible to be experienced only when we are engaged in serving Krishna. And serving Krishna is very very pleasing to our heart. It is extremely pleasing to the heart. It is very, it is very nice, it's very nice, unlike serving illusion. Serving illusion, there is some promise or hope of enjoyment because our nature is to always be happy. So we seek happiness while we are busy serving illusion, but we really don't get happiness. The result of serving illusion is misery: adi bhautika, adhyatmika, adidaivika klesha. Klesha means misery, three variety, three kinds of miseries and plenty of it everywhere around you. You see in this world everybody is suffering one of these three kinds of miseries due to the body and mind, due to forces of nature and due to other living beings, always harassed by these miseries. Sometimes there is some break or relief or sometimes under the influence of illusion we ignore or we learn to somehow put up with some miseries. We put up with some miseries, but that is not really our position, that's not real happiness. The transcendental bliss and Krishna consciousness in serving Krishna is totally different experience.

**Key Quote:** "King Yudhishthira fully supported Queen Draupadi's statements which were having all these wonderful characteristics."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 49th verse of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on King Yudhishthira's support of Draupadi's statements, which embody dharma, justice, mercy, and lack of duplicity.

In the previous session, I began discussing the 49th verse of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Bhagavatam. I could not complete it. I will continue. I will complete it in this session, the same 49th verse. I will read once again the 49th verse just for refreshing your memory. Suta Vacha Dharmam Nyayam Sakarunam Nirvyalekam Samam Mahat Raja Dharmasuto Ragnya Pratyanandad Vachodvijaha. The meaning of this verse is Suta Goswami is speaking to the Sayyiduna Misharanya, the Brahamanas. O Brahamanas, he is telling, he is addressing them and speaking to them. King Yudhishthira fully supported the statements of the queen. Who is the queen here? Draupadi, Queen Draupadi, which were in accordance with the principles of religion, Dharmam, and were justified, Nyayam, and were full of mercy, Sakarunam, Nirvyalekam, without duplicity. Sakarunam, Nirvyalekam, without duplicity. Samam, full of equity and Mahat, they were glorious.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Yudhishthira knew the principles of religion and supported Draupadi's plea to spare Ashwathama, and discusses the importance of Dharmashastra and its relevance in Kali Yuga.

So, King Yudhishthira fully supported Queen Draupadi's statements which were having all these wonderful characteristics. So, in the Purport, Srila Prabhupada says that Maharaja Yudhishthira was a son of Dharmaraja. So, he knew exactly what are the principles of religion and he supported Draupadi who was justified in telling Arjuna, don't kill Ashwathama even though he is a murderer of the five sons of Draupadi. Don't kill Ashwathama. So, what was the justification? That we have discussed earlier that Draupadi was making the statement or telling Arjuna, don't kill Ashwathama because she was conversant with the principles of religion. So, religion means here Dharma. Dharma means the eternal principles of our religion. That is what I mean by Dharmashastra. It is the intrinsic nature of service. So, such service has to be guided by the scriptural injunctions. So, there is Dharmashastra, how to conduct ourselves while we are living in this world for maintaining ourselves as well as for ultimate liberation from this material bondage. Everything is explained in Dharmashastra.

**Key Quote:** "Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has instructed everyone you study these two scriptures Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the principles of Dharma are summarized in the Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam, and emphasizes the importance of devotional service to Krishna over serving illusion.

Of course, now in Kali Yuga, we don't have time to study all the varieties of Vedic literature, especially the Dharma Shastras. There are 20 Dharma Shastras: Manu Smriti, Yajna Valkya Smriti, Parashara Smriti, like that, 20 great sages, they have compiled and every facet of human life, how one should actually conduct oneself, is explained there. But people have no time to study that, neither they are inclined to follow that. It is very difficult in Kali Yuga. Therefore, the principles of Dharma have been summarized in two scriptures, in two scriptures, the Bhagavad Gita and the Srimad Bhagavatam. These two scriptures, so Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has instructed everyone, you study these two scriptures, Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam. Both are called Krishna Katha, Krishna Katha. Bhagavad Gita spoken directly by Krishna, explaining the principles of Dharma very, very simple way, in a concise way, and Bhagavatam allows elaborately explains what is Dharma, Bhagavata Dharma. Bhagavatam explains what is real Dharma, Bhagavata Dharma, the principles of devotional service to Krishna. As in the previous session we discussed, we, our intrinsic nature or quality is to serve, so if we don't serve Krishna, then we will be engaged in serving illusion.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes surrendering to Krishna and engaging in devotional service, particularly chanting Hare Krishna, as the easy way to practice Dharma in Kali Yuga.

Are we forced to serve illusion? So better than serving illusion, you take up devotional service to Krishna and that is what is told by Krishna also in the Bhagavad Gita, sarva dharmaana parath ajaam am ekam saranam vajah aham tvam sarvapah aqua bhyamoksas sa vimash latcha. Even in the ninth chapter Krishna says Sekharo Worthy to see at Josh كل everything should be done as an offering to Krishna and if one doesn't want to complicate, one thinks that matters are too complicated if everything has to be done as service to Krishna, simply surrender to Krishna, simply surrender to Krishna and then engage in those activities which are meant for simply serving Krishna in a very, very simple way as taught by the Sri Chaitanya Maha, Sri Chaitanya Maha who taught us simply chant Hare Krishna, that is the easy way you of practicing Dharma especially in Kaliyuga, harer nama harer nama harer namaiva kevalam kalau nastyaiva nastyaiva nastyaiva gathiranyatha.

**Key Quote:** "Showing mercy on Krippi you should spare the life of Ashwatthama she is living for his sake that's all."
**Summary:** The speaker returns to the discussion of Draupadi's plea to Arjuna, explaining that it was based on principles of dharma, justice, and especially mercy towards Krippi, Ashwathama's mother.

So here, Dhropadi is telling Arjuna not to kill Ashwathama based on principles of religion, Dharmyam Nyayam. It is fully just. It is in accordance with principles of justice, principles of justice because Ashwathama happened to be the son of Dhronacharya and Dhronacharya was the teacher of Arjuna and Pandavas. So, he taught Arjuna all the secrets. So, Arjuna and the Pandavas should always be indebted to Dhronacharya, guru. Guru, whatever he teaches, one is indebted to the guru. That debt cannot be cleared. The debt cannot be repaid. No. So, in accordance with the codes of justice, Nyayam Sakarunam and full of mercy, mercy not because Ashwathama was deserving to be Dhronacharya and this scenario was included also, he was telling Arjuna to kill Dhronacharya with this excuse. Now, Ashwathama did not deserve to be ismus. I cannot mourn for the leaders that were removed but by killing it Ashwathama, Arjuna would put adultery the mother of Ashwathama, the wife of Dronacharya into so much of grief, grand mother live n recipes the mother of Ashwatama she would not undergo sati she was without any record simply because JS her son whose華 she was just the surviving descendant as per 핵 proteomeきた a survivor after the battle of Kurukshetra in which Dronacharya died in the battle so she did not undergo sati so if she is living just because of her son then by killing the son you want to put her into so much of grief so therefore Sakarunam full of mercy towards Krippi not showing mercy on Ashwatthama showing mercy on Krippi you should spare the life of Ashwatthama she is

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Draupadi's lack of duplicity and her compassion for Krippi, emphasizing the shared experience of motherhood and grief.

living for his sake, that's all. Then Nirvyalikam, without duplicity. She was not trying to do some kind of, it is called Krippi, this duplicitous behavior is sometimes required for somebody who's in politics, that in order to save some situation, they may externally tell something, but they have some other idea in the heart. So, such duplicitous behavior sometimes is required for somebody in politics, but here Draupadi is not speaking in a duplicitous way, Nirvyalikam, without duplicity, without duplicity. She actually feels for the grief of a mother because she has lost her sons and she is experiencing so much of grief. She doesn't want Krippi also to experience that kind of grief just because her son has done something foolish, he has done a big mistake, he's done a big crime actually, but why should she suffer when she is already undergoing grief because her husband died in the battle? So, why should she suffer like Draupadi or suffer more than what she is already undergoing? Why? It is not justified, particularly because she is the wife of the teacher of Arjuna. So, Arjuna should actually spare the life of Ashwathama, Nirvyalikam samam and it is full of equity. That is Draupadi is considering, I am a mother, I am experiencing grief now, same way Krippi will also experience grief. So, she can understand that if this is one of the people who are going to suffer this kind of anguish, then the next person should be the one who has been causing the grief and that is Draupadi who is the wife of Arjuna who has done a huge every other woman other than one's own wife as mother paradareshu dhara means wife all other women other than one's own wife as mother

### material misery, identification with the body, spiritual identity, external energy, remedy
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/yG4t5Q1rvFs?t=86

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "that we are not this body but we are spirit soul for the spirit soul there is no death there is no birth there is no disease there's no old age there's no suffering there are no miseries"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that suffering arises from identifying with the material body due to the influence of external energy, obscuring our true spiritual identity, and introduces the concept of a remedy.

of material nature thinks of himself as a material product and thus undergoes the reactions of material miseries. This is the explanation of what is explained in the Bhagavad Gita, that we are not this body, but we are spirit soul. For the spirit soul, there is no death, there is no birth, there is no disease, there's no old age, there's no suffering, there are no miseries. Why are we experiencing whatever we are going through? We go through suffering that is due to the external energy, the inferior energy of the Lord, the material energy. So that material energy, although transcendental, the living entity is transcendental to the three modes of material nature. The influence of the external energy makes the living being think that he is a product of material nature, he is a material product, and in that way, he undergoes the reactions of material miseries. Now, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada elaborately explained this point because the central point for our understanding that we are not the body, we are spirit soul, this is very, very important to understand. And then there is also, as Prabhupada explains, the root cause of suffering by the materialistic living beings is pointed out. What is the root cause of suffering? This influence of the external energy because of which I think I am a material product. And the remedial measures which are to be undertaken, what is the remedy for this? And also the ultimate perfection to be gained, all three are mentioned in this particular verse.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "even though we are transcendental we are beyond this material body our existence is beyond this material body still the imprisonment is by the influence of the external energy"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the transcendental nature of the soul, its imprisonment within the material body by external energy, and the resulting 'unholy contact' leading to material miseries.

Let us see how these three things are actually mentioned in the verse and explained wonderfully. The Living Being by Constitution is transcendental to material engagement. Engagement means we are trapped inside this body. We means each one of us, spirit soul. Spirit soul is trapped in this body. Body is like a cage. It is like a bird is locked up in a cage. Same way, we are locked up in this body, but he is now imprisoned by the external energy, and therefore he thinks himself one of the material products. Even though we are transcendental, we are beyond this material body, our existence is beyond this material body, still the imprisonment is by the influence of the external energy, and that influence makes us think that I am a material product. And due to this unholy contact, what is unholy contact? The contact of matter and spirit, the pure spiritual entity suffers material miseries under the modes of material nature. I am pure spirit, each one of the living beings is pure spirit, but the contact with this external energy creates a situation where I think, due to the influence of external energy, I think I am a product of matter and this body, and that is the cause for suffering material miseries.

**Key Quote:** "the living entity misunderstands himself to be a material product it is a case of misunderstanding"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that identifying as a material product is a misunderstanding and a perversion of our natural way of thinking, feeling, and willing.

The living entity misunderstands himself to be a material product. It is a case of misunderstanding. It is totally a phenomenon because of misconception, misunderstanding, misidentification. These are the terms used in everywhere in the scriptures. This means that the perverted person is a material product of matter, and this is a case of misunderstanding. The perverted way of thinking, feeling, and willing under material conditions is not natural for him. We think materially, we feel only in terms of matter, thinking, feeling, willing, we act materially. All this is only simply under material conditions. It is the way we think, feel, and live. It is the way we think, feel, and live, and this is not natural. This is not our original situation. This is not our situation as Spirit Soul, but Sheila proper says he has his normal way of thinking, feeling, and willing.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "the present conditional state actually is due to the influence of the external energy which means that the illusory energy takes the initiative while the supreme lord is aloof"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the roles of the absolute truth, illusory energy, and the Supreme Lord, explaining that the illusory energy takes the initiative in conditioning the soul, while the Lord remains aloof, allowing for reformation.

absolute impersonal Brahman, that is completely wrong because the absolute truth is never under any influence of the energy, never. Whereas the living being who is not the absolute truth can come under the influence of the illusion. This cannot be because the living entity has his own way of thinking in his original unconditional state also. The original state is a unconditional state. It is not a state in which there is an influence of these external energy. The present conditional state actually is due to the influence of the external energy, which means that the illusory energy takes the initiative while the supreme lord is aloof. Whose energy is it, this external energy or material energy? It is supreme lord's energy, Krishna's energy, and the supreme lord, even though he is a supreme controller, he is always aloof from the external energy. And as a tiny spirit soul, every living being in this material world is conditioned. Conditioned means influenced to act in a material way, that is a conditioning. The Lord does not desire that a living being be illusioned by external energy. He is always aloof from the external energy, and as a tiny spirit soul, every living being external energy, it's not the Lord's desire that we should be illusioned, but the external energy aware of this fact still accepts a thankless task of keeping the forgetful soul under illusion by her bewildering influence. That is why, why, why should the external energy do this task of keeping the forgetful soul in illusion? That is explained. The Lord does not interfere with the task of the illusory energy because this influence of the illusory energy is necessary for reformation of the conditioned soul. What does the need for reformation the conditioned?

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "still one who surrenders under the lotus feet of the Lord is set free by the order of the Supreme Lord"
**Summary:** Using the analogy of a father disciplining his child, the speaker explains that the Lord allows the illusory energy to act for the reformation of the conditioned soul, and that surrender to the Lord's lotus feet is the path to liberation.

soul desires independent of the external energy of the soul. So this is why the Lord is not interfering. Independent energy and then they may think they are independently enjoying while the fact is they are completely under the control of the illusory energy. So to reform the conditioned soul, this is necessary. Prabhupada gives an example, an affectionate father does not like his children to be chastised by another agent, but he puts his disobedient children under the custody of a severe man just to bring them to order. So similarly, and all of it, the all affectionate Almighty Father Krishna, he desires relief for the conditioned soul, and what kind of relief? Relief from the clutches of the illusory energy. The Supreme Lord for this purpose, he descends from his kingdom upon the kingdom of the illusory energy and personally gives relief in the form of Bhagavad Gita. Krishna speaks the Bhagavad Gita for helping us to get relief from the influence of the illusory energy. So what does it say in the Bhagavad Gita? He suggests that although the ways of illusory energy are very stiff to overcome, very difficult to overcome, still one who surrenders under the lotus feet of the Lord is set free by the order of the Supreme Lord. You can get out of this form of change, out of this form of change by overcoming illusory energy, still we can surrender and then the lotus feet of the Lord is set free by the order of the Supreme Lord. We can get out of it. sübh i milti vayya prapadyante maya met Santos myself I must meditate it well and then I wenig cast drainage now upon myself I have passed through έχει ram beer to achieve themetics I have suffered the sticking of bondage multiple timesbsp.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that surrender is the remedy for suffering, and that the ultimate goal is not just liberation from illusory energy, but reinstatement in our original position of loving devotional service to Krishna.

this illusion simply by surrendering to the lotus feet of Krishna, that's all. This surrendering process is the remedial measure for getting relief from the bewildering ways of the illusory energy. So first thing is why the suffering? Because under the influence of the illusory energy, we are thinking in terms of I am a material product, I identify with this body, and the body undergoes so many changes, and then I think I am suffering while actually I am aloof from the body. Then what is the remedial measure for this? Surrender to the lotus feet of Krishna. And then finally, the highest perfection to be achieved is not merely that I become free from the influence it gives energy, no. There is a original position in a loving devotional relationship with Krishna, the supreme lord in his personal abode as his loving devotee, that is a perfection to be attained. So it is not just relief, it is relief and reinstating in our original constitution.

That means Draupadi is being also supported not only by Yudhishthira but Nakula, Sahadeva and Satyaki. Satyaki is the chariot driver of Krishna. He belongs to the Yadu dynasty. And Arjuna agreed with Draupadi. Yes, what Draupadi is telling is correct, even though Arjuna wanted to kill Ashwatthama. And even Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the son of Devaki, he also agreed with Yudhishthira who was supporting Draupadi's decision. And the ladies and all others unanimously agreed with the king. Now kindly note, here practically everyone is mentioned except one person, that is Bhima.

**Key Quote:** "Bhima however disagreed with them and recommended killing this culprit who in an angry mood had murdered sleeping children for no purpose and for neither his nor his master's interest."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains verse 51, highlighting Bhima's disagreement and his reasons for wanting to kill Ashwatthama, emphasizing the heinous nature of Ashwatthama's actions and their lack of purpose.

In the 51st verse we will see why Bhima's name is not mentioned. The 51st verse. Now about Bhima, what is being said here. The translation of this 51st verse: Bhima however disagreed with them and recommended killing this culprit who in an angry mood had murdered sleeping children for no purpose and for neither his nor his master's interest. See Bhima's reasoning. Bhima disagreed with everyone else. For what reason? Because Ashwatthama is a culprit. He has committed a crime. And what kind of crime? In an angry mood he had murdered sleeping children, the five sons of Draupadi. And he had done it for no purpose. What was his gain by doing it? His specific gain, nothing. And for neither his nor his master's interest. It is not even in his interest that he had killed the five sleeping sons of Draupadi. Neither Duryodhana was pleased with this act of Ashwatthama, because as soon as Ashwatthama killed them, he took the five heads which had been chopped off and presented them to Duryodhana thinking that Duryodhana will be pleased. But Duryodhana was not at all happy about it. He thoroughly disapproved of this and said this is totally abominable. So Duryodhana did not approve it at all. Ashwatthama was fighting on the side of Duryodhana. So he thought, Duryodhana will be pleased. But Duryodhana was not at all pleased by it. So for whose interest had he done it? That's what Bhima is questioning. For whom? For whose sake? It was not his interest. It was not his master's interest. And what other purpose can simply be somebody killed like that? By whom? By Ashwatthama who is fighting in a Dharma Yudha on religious principles. It is totally against all rules.

**Summary:** The speaker continues explaining Bhima's perspective from verse 51, focusing on the role of anger in Ashwatthama's actions and Bhima's conclusion that Ashwatthama deserves to be killed.

All religious principles. And even if let us say somebody violates a religious principle, for whose benefit is it being done? Nobody's benefit. And he had done it in an angry mood. When somebody becomes angry, then they lose their sense of discrimination. Anger actually makes a person lose his intelligence. So Bhima is pointing out that this Ashwatthama, he deserves to be killed because he is a culprit.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces verse 52, describing Krishna's reaction to the conflicting views of Bhima and Draupadi and setting up Krishna's upcoming advice to Arjuna.

Don't spare his life. And then the 52nd verse, it describes when Bhima said this, then the reaction of Krishna. The 52nd verse, nishamyabhimagaditam draupadyascha chaturbhujah alokyavadanam sakhyuh idamahasannivah The meaning of this verse is chaturbhujanam the four armed personality or the personality of Godhead chaturbhujaha After hearing the words of Bhima, Draupadi and others, Bhima and Draupadi's words are contradictory. Chaturbhujah, the personality of Godhead, saw the face of his dear friend Arjuna and he began to speak as if smiling. Now, what is Arjuna's position? That's what Krishna is considering. Arjuna has captured this Ashwatthama, brought him to his own camp and he had bound him up like an animal because he was a culprit. He had arrested him. But now Draupadi is telling Arjuna don't kill him. And she gave a reasoning. And Yudhishthira fully supported Draupadi and everyone except Bhima did support Draupadi. But Bhima disagreed. So what is Arjuna supposed to do? Bhima is not agreeing to let go this Ashwatthama to be excused. And Draupadi is telling don't kill him. What is Arjuna supposed to do? So, Krishna is looking at Arjuna, his friend, his dear friend and Krishna is now going to speak something very very significant to Arjuna. And Krishna is also smiling because he can understand the dilemma Arjuna is having that on the one hand Draupadi is telling don't kill and Bhima is telling he should be killed.

### Krishna, Narayana, Vaikuntha, Krishnaloka, Chaturbhuja

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna only expands as Narayana."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why Krishna is referred to as Chaturbhuja (four-armed) in this verse, drawing on Shridhara Swami's commentary and discussing the relationship between Krishna and Narayana, as well as the spiritual realms of Vaikuntha and Krishnaloka.

And Arjuna had taken a vow to kill. All that will be mentioned by Krishna. So in the purport Srila Prabhupada says Lord Sri Krishna has two arms. Krishna is Vibhujan. And why is he designated as four armed? Chaturbhujaha. Krishna is being referred to as Chaturbhujaha in this verse specifically. Why? That is explained by one of our Acharyas, Shridhara Swami. So, Prabhupada is quoting Shridhara Swami. Shridhara Swami is telling both Bhima and Draupadi held opposite views about killing Ashwatthama. Very clear. Bhima wanted Ashwatthama should be killed. And Draupadi said don't kill him. So opposite views of Bhima and Draupadi. Bhima wanted him to be immediately killed. Whereas Draupadi wanted to save him so Srila Prabhupada says quoting Shridhara Swami we can imagine Bhima ready to kill while Draupadi is obstructing him. And in order to prevent both of them the Lord discovered another two arms. Originally the primeval Lord Sri Krishna displays only two arms. Vibhujarupa. Manusham roopam. That's what is described in Bhagavad Gita. But in his Narayana feature he exhibits four hands. In his Narayana feature he resides with his devotees in the Vaikuntha planets. While in his original Sri Krishna feature he resides in the Krishnaloka planet and far far above the Vaikuntha planets in the spiritual sky. This is explained elsewhere that beyond this material universes is the spiritual sky. And in that spiritual sky there are many many spiritual planets. Now the spiritual planets are called Vaikuntha Loka free from all anxiety. It's the abode of the pure devotees, the pure devotees of the Supreme Lord. In all the Vaikuntha planets the Supreme Lord is present as the predominating deity in his form as Narayana, four handed form Narayana. But above the Vaikuntha planets among all the spiritual planets one particular planet is called Krishnaloka. It's also called Goloka Vrindavana. In that planet alone the Supreme Lord is present as Krishna in two handed form and Krishna is the predominating deity of Krishnaloka. Of course Krishna and Narayana are one person, the Supreme personality you have got it. But still there is distinction also.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes the session by reiterating Arjuna's dilemma and Krishna's sympathetic understanding, preparing for the next verse where Krishna will offer guidance. The lecture ends with a thank you and Hare Krishna.

So here if Sri Krishna is called Chaturbhuja there is no contradiction because Krishna only expands as Narayana. If need be Krishna can display hundreds of arms as he exhibited in his Vishwaroopa shown to Arjuna. He can display any number of arms. Therefore one who can display hundreds and thousands of arms can also manifest four arms whenever required. So this is the explanation given by Sridharaswami. Krishna only displayed two more arms in this situation. So therefore the Supreme Lord is now sympathizing with Arjuna that Arjuna is in a dilemma. He is getting contradictory suggestions. Draupadi telling Arjuna don't kill him. And Bhima is telling he must be killed because he is a culprit. For no purpose he has killed the sleeping sons of, murdered not just killed, murdered the sleeping sons of Draupadi. Neither his interest nor his master's interest is being served by this killing. So he deserves to be killed. This is Bhima's opinion. And what is Arjuna supposed to do? So Krishna is looking at Arjuna and he is sympathizing therefore he is also smiling at Arjuna. Now Krishna is going to speak to Arjuna something. That we will see in the next verse. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker translates and explains the verses, focusing on the dilemma faced by Arjuna regarding Ashwatthama, who is both a brahmana's son and an aggressor, highlighting conflicting duties and promises.

Two verses given together, 53 and 54. Now, the translation of these two verses as given by His Divine Grace AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada: the personality of goddess Shree Krishna said, Shree Bhagavanu Vacha, a friend of a Brahmana is not to be killed, Brahma bandur nahantavya, but if is an aggressor, he must be killed, atatai vadar vadha arhanaha. If he is a atatai, if he is an aggressor, he must be killed. All these rulings are in the scriptures, amnatam, according to rulings of the authority. Both these are given in scriptures, and Krishna is telling Arjuna, you must act accordingly. You had to fulfill your promise to your wife. What does Arjuna's promise to his wife Draupadi? That I shall cut off the head of this ashwar dhamma and bring it for you to pacify you, to punish him so that he may not be able to do it again suitably because of the inglorious murder he has committed. And now Krishna is also telling Arjuna, you must also act according to the satisfaction of Bhima Sena and me. So Bhima directly told that this ashwar dhamma should be killed. Now Krishna also, when ashwar dhamma was captured and arrested by Arjuna, Krishna also just told Arjuna, if you are an Canting and you must come to Bereich Arjuna Krishna had told Arjuna, you must kill this fellow because he is an aggressor, even though he is the son of a brahmana, but as an aggressor, even if we be a brahmana, still they should be killed, what to speak of a brama bandhu. At the same time, now Krishna is telling and next time he is a brahma friend so he will kill Arjuna and his wives until he is gone. You have to act according to the rulings of the Shastra, and you have to fulfill your promise to your wife. And what is Draupadi's suggestion? Don't kill him. To satisfy Draupadi, Arjuna should not kill. And for satisfying Bhima, he should kill. So what is he supposed to do? Kill or not kill?

### dharma, scriptural injunctions, renunciation, duty, contradictions

**Key Quote:** "Whenever somebody tries to refer the scriptures, then in certain circumstances, to apply the scriptural injunction, it is difficult."
**Summary:** The lecture explores the difficulty in applying scriptural injunctions, using the example of a sanyasi's duties and the apparent contradictions within the scriptures.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says that Arjuna was perplexed because Ashwatthama was to be killed as well as spared according to different scriptures cited by different persons. This is a fact. Whenever somebody tries to refer the scriptures, then in certain circumstances, to apply the scriptural injunction, it is difficult. In the 18th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, it is explained that for somebody who is a sanyasi, who is in the renounced order of life, there are no duties to be performed. No duties to be performed because he is completely renounced. He is simply engaged in devotional service to Krishna, exclusively dedicated for that. That is the meaning of renunciation. At the same time, Shastra says that activities which are of the nature of yajna, dana and tapa should never be given up under any circumstances. For a civilized human being, in all stages, one should never stop performing sacrifice because sacrifice is specifically activity meant for pleasing the Supreme Lord. So, in that way, we can understand sacrifice should never be given up. Though, material activities, or material duties even, a sanyasi has got no material duties. A brahmachari has got duties, a grihasta has got duties, a vanapurasta has got duties, but a sanyasi has no material duties. So, it is difficult to understand whether a sanyasi should perform any activities, or not do any activities at all. So, like this, in the scriptures, there are injunctions which seemingly are contradictory in certain circumstances, in certain situations where one has to apply. Different people will give different circumstances, cite different shastras and give different rulings.

**Key Quote:** "Brahmabandhu should not be killed. Aggressor, even if he is a brahmana, he has to be killed. An aggressor, when he is standing without any weapon, he should not be killed. So what is Arjuna supposed to do?"
**Summary:** The speaker returns to the dilemma of Arjuna and Ashwatthama, highlighting the conflicting scriptural injunctions regarding killing a brahmana, an aggressor, and an unarmed aggressor.

Just like here, it's happening. Bhima is telling you must kill, because Bhima is citing the shastra only. And Draupadi is telling, don't kill. And she has given her reasoning. So here, Prabhupada is telling, as a brahma bandhu, or a worthless son of a brahmana, Ashwatthama was not to be killed. Brahma bandhur nahantavya. This is the ruling of the shastra. Brahma bandhu, because son of a brahmana. Even though he is not a brahmana, but he is son of a brahmana still, he should not be killed. But he was at the same time, this Ashwatthama was an aggressor. According to the rulings of Manu, an aggressor, even though he be a brahmana, and what to speak of a brahma bandhu, unworthy son of a brahmana, such an aggressor is to be killed. This is what Manusmriti says. Dronacharya was certainly a brahmana in the true sense of the term, but because he stood in the battlefield, he was killed. He was fighting. A dharma yudha. In the battle he got killed. So when, because Dronacharya was on the side of the Kauravas, and obviously he was killed by the Pandavas. But such killing of Dronacharya was justified because Dronacharya was engaged in battle. But although Ashwatthama was an aggressor, now look at this complication. As an aggressor, it is said in the Shastra, aggressor, even if he is a brahmana, he is to be killed. So, even though Ashwatthama was an aggressor, he stood without any fighting weapons. He stood without any weapons. He was bound up. He didn't have any weapons with him. The ruling is that an aggressor, when he is without weapon or chariot, cannot be killed. Now look at this. Brahmabandhu should not be killed. Aggressor, even if he is a brahmana, he has to be killed. An aggressor, when he is standing without any weapon, he should not be killed.

**Key Quote:** "But the lesson for us to be learnt from this is that in order to, even if one is conversant with the scriptural injunctions, it is not easy to apply the injunctions in different circumstances."
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the complexity of applying scriptural injunctions and the necessity of seeking guidance from a bona fide spiritual master to navigate such dilemmas.

So what is Arjuna supposed to do? Besides all this, now these were all perplexities for Arjuna. And besides all this, to further complicate matters, Arjuna had to keep the promise he had made before Draupadi just to pacify her. As soon as Draupadi began crying after learning that her five sons had been all killed by Ashwatthama, she was crying, and Arjuna just to pacify her had said, I am not going to spare this Ashwatthama. I am going to cut off his head and bring that head for you in order to pacify you. So he has to, he had made a promise. Kshatriya's promise cannot be an empty promise. And he also had to satisfy both Bhima and Krishna, who advised killing Ashwatthama. So Arjuna has promised Draupadi, I will kill him. Bhima and Krishna have advised Arjuna to kill Ashwatthama. The Shastra says, a Brahmabandhu should not be killed. Aggressor has to be killed. But an aggressor without any weapons should not be killed. So what is Arjuna supposed to do? Certainly very, very, very perplexed in situation. This dilemma was present before Arjuna and the solution was awarded by Krishna. Now how Krishna awards the solution is going to be explained in the next verse. But the lesson for us to be learnt from this is that in order to, even if one is conversant with the scriptural injunctions, it is not easy to apply the injunctions in different circumstances. It is not so simple. Always. In some cases it is very simple. But in some situations or circumstances it is not so simple. So therefore Shastra says, in order to learn the scriptures and more importantly in order to learn how to apply the scriptural directions or injunctions in one's own personal life, one has to approach a bona fide spiritual master.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "We have to actually seek solution to our perplexities by approaching a bona fide spiritual master."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating the importance of surrendering to a spiritual master for guidance, drawing a parallel to Arjuna's surrender to Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, and highlighting the spiritual master's role in guiding individuals towards their duty while avoiding sin and progressing in Krishna consciousness.

One has to approach a bona fide spiritual master. The beginning of the Bhagavad Gita, Arjuna first says, I am not going to fight in this battle. How can I kill my own kinsmen? How can I kill Bhishma and Drona, my respectable superiors? For the sake of a kingdom I am going to kill them? Never. But at the same time, Arjuna understands this is a Dharma Yudha and it is a duty of a Kshatriya like Arjuna to fight in this Dharma Yudha. So considering these two aspects, Dharma Yudha, Arjuna should fight, it is his duty to fight and somebody like Bhishma and Drona who are respectable superiors should not be killed. So Arjuna is confused about his duty and Arjuna, what does he say? Now I am confused about my duty and therefore I surrender to you my dear Lord Krishna. Kindly instruct me what is to be done in these circumstances. And this is exactly what is taught in the Bhagavad Gita. We have to actually seek solution to our perplexities by approaching a bona fide spiritual master. A bona fide spiritual master is situated completely in Krishna consciousness and he is able to direct everyone perfectly in such a way that they are able to do their duty at the same time not commit any sin and also make advancement for ultimate liberation in Krishna consciousness. So this is the special position of a bona fide spiritual master. Therefore one has to actually approach a bona fide spiritual master and learn from him and seek his guidance in all such situations. Hare Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "A devotee like Arjuna is able to take help of his intelligence because he is Krishna conscious."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Arjuna used his intelligence, guided by Krishna consciousness, to resolve a complex situation involving Ashwatthama, highlighting the importance of Krishna's direction.

The fifty-fifth verse, Suta Vacha. Now, Suta Goswami is describing this whole incident, narrating this historical incident to the sage Suna Misharanya, he is telling, Arjuna ha sahasa agnyaya here hardam athasina manim jahar murdhanyam Drijasya sah murdhajam Drijasya ah sah murdhanyam Drijasya such mood adjust sitting Arjuna hot To the entrance of Arizombur, it is'll give you Аthas participants that the adoration of thegers is where the meaning of this verse, The meaning of this verse is that, verses. Just then Arjuna could understand the motive of the Lord by his equivocal orders and thus with a sword he severed both hair and jewel from the head of Ashwatthama. Equivocal means ambiguous. Krishna said that you have got two contradictory things to be settled and you have to act appropriately. So Arjuna could understand what is Krishna's motive in giving him such an ambiguous order. You have to satisfy both Bhima and Draupadi. You should keep your promise. You should act according to the rulings of the scriptures. So what did Arjuna do? With his sword he cut off the hair and the jewel from the head of Ashwatthama. So in the purport Srila Prabhupada says contradictory orders of different persons are impossible to carry out. Therefore a compromise was selected by Arjuna by his sharp intelligence. This is where the intelligence is, one takes help of one's intelligence. Of course here we have to understand taking help of intelligence means intelligence directed by the super soul seated on the heart. Super soul is Krishna, Paramatma. And a devotee like Arjuna is able to take help of his intelligence because he is Krishna conscious. He is Krishna conscious therefore he is able to take help of his intelligence and understand what is Krishna's direction in this regard. What should he do? Now we should not think that we can also simply take help of our intelligence under all circumstances and do whatever is according to our judgement using our intelligence, whatever the help whatever is right we should do that that seems like a common sense thing to do but we should also understand that if we are not 100% Krishna conscious we are unable to properly utilize our

**Key Quote:** "The Supreme Lord as Paramatma directs the intelligence according to our desires according to our karma and according to our position whether we are devotee or non-devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on how Paramatma (Krishna as the Supersoul) guides intelligence based on an individual's desires, karma, and whether they are a devotee or not, explaining how even good intentions can be thwarted by past karma.

intelligence the way Paramatma or Krishna directs it why because the Supreme Lord as Paramatma directs the intelligence according to our desires according to our karma and according to our position whether we are devotee or non-devotee for a devotee Krishna one was 10% Krishna conscious Krishna directly gives perfect instructions from within the heart through the intelligence directly Krishna gives instructions for somebody's a non-devotee Krishna is neutral he's neutral as Paramatma he actually considers any living being who is not Krishna conscious ordinary people in this world most people Krishna will as Paramatma consider what is the desire of the particular person then what is his karma based on which what he deserves and accordingly Krishna will direct the intelligence for the person to do in a particular act in a particular way now Now supposing somebody actually desires to do something which is correct, then if his karma is to not do things right, because of his previous sinful activities, then the direction will be given to do something wrong and not the right thing. So he will not get the correct direction through the intelligence, even though he wants to do something right. You see, his desire is to do things right, but his karma is to do something wrong. And therefore, the intelligence will work in doing something wrong. Now consider the other case. Somebody doesn't actually know what is to be done, whether it is right or wrong. But his karma is that he should do the right thing. His karma is that he should be doing the right thing because he is a pious person. He doesn't have sinful reaction of doing the wrong thing. So then he is given the proper direction by the intelligence because of his karma.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore the real way to ensure that we always do the right things and never do any sinful activity, never commit any mistake in our life, is to become completely Krishna conscious."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain how Paramatma considers desire and karma according to the laws of nature, emphasizing that becoming fully Krishna conscious is the only way to ensure righteous actions and avoid mistakes due to our tiny, influenceable nature.

And his desire is to do the right thing. And he is not sure what to do. He is seeking direction. So when we seek direction, we refer our intelligence. So he is directed to do the right thing. So Paramatma will always consider the desire, the karma, and it is according to the laws that are working, laws of nature. There is no partiality. There is no partiality on the part of the Supreme Lord. It is like a programmed machine. It works regardless of who operates, according to the program, according to the way it is designed. It will work. So when we are not Krishna conscious, we cannot always be sure, even if we want to do the right thing. We can't always be sure we will be able to do the right thing. Therefore the real way to ensure that we always do the right things and never do any sinful activity, never commit any mistake in our life, is to become completely Krishna conscious. That is the only way, because we are very, very tiny as spirit soul, individual spirit soul. We are very tiny. We are subject to influence.

**Key Quote:** "If you want to do the right things, you should actually rise above the gunas."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the influence of the illusory energy and the three modes of nature (gunas) on our actions, stating that to consistently do the right thing, one must rise above these gunas by engaging in pure devotional service, referencing the Bhagavad Gita.

Of the illusory energy. And under the influence of the illusory energy, if the mode of goodness is acting, then there is knowledge and proper direction, enlightened state. There is proper direction to do the right things. In the mode of passion, we are confused. In the mode of ignorance, we always do the wrong things. So these gunas are always interacting and producing so many effects. Sometimes sattva guna dominates, sometimes raja guna dominates, sometimes tamma guna dominates. So it is very, very difficult under the influence of the gunas to always do the right thing. There is no guarantee. So therefore the shastras say if you want to do the right things, you should actually rise above the gunas. How can you rise above the gunas? How can you be situated without influence, without being affected by the influence of the gunas? You should come to the spiritual platform, above the material platform of the three gunas. And to come to that spiritual platform is possible only if you engage in pure devotional service. This is told in the Bhagavad Gita: mam chayo avyabhicharena bhakti-yogena sevate sagunan samatityaitaan brahma bhuyaya kalpate.

**Key Quote:** "Arjuna did not kill him but at the same time he cut his hair from his head deprived him of his wealth his jewel was taken away and driving him from his residence he was driven out of the of the camp so these are prescribed punishments and Arjuna gave those proper punishments"
**Summary:** The speaker concludes the discussion of the verses by explaining how Arjuna's actions towards Ashwatthama fulfilled both Draupadi's request and Bhima's suggestion, representing a proper punishment according to scripture, and ends with the Pandavas performing rituals for the dead, marking the end of the chapter.

So here Arjuna, he separated the jewel from the head of Ashwatthama and also cut off his hair. Now this was as good as cutting off his head and yet his life was saved for all practical purposes. See how Arjuna actually was able to satisfy both Draupadi's request to save his life and Bhima Sena's suggestion that Ashwatthama should be killed. So certainly Ashwatthama is twice born because he is indicated here as Dvija. Dvija. Saha murdha jam. Dvija. He is twice born. And he is twice born, but he fell down from his position and he is dead and therefore he was properly punished. So the 56th verse, Vimuchya. Rashana- meatballs. Baal-a-hatya-hatam-prabham. Tejasaa-Maniina-heenam-sibiraan-nirayaa-payatt. He had already lost his bodily luster due to infanticide and now moreover having lost the jewel from his head he would lose even more strength he was unbound and driven out of the camp. 57th verse wapanam dravina adhanam sthanan niraya nirya panam tatha eshahi brahma bandhunam badho nanyo asti dai hi kaha cutting the hair from his head depriving him of his wealth and driving him from his residence are the prescribed punishments for the relative of a Brahmana there is no injunction for killing the body so Arjuna did not kill him but at the same time he cut his hair from his head deprived him of his wealth his jewel was taken away and driving him from his residence he was driven out of the camp so these are prescribed punishments and Arjuna gave those proper punishments the last words are 58th verse of this chapter the closing words putra shoka tura sarve Pandava sahakrishna swanam nutanam yatkrityam chakrur nirharana adhikam the meaning of this verse the last verse thereafter the sons of Pandu and Draupadi overwhelmed with grief performed the proper rituals for the dead bodies of their relatives so they undertook the duty of performing the rituals for the departed souls that is the end of this chapter thank you very much Hare.

### Vyasadeva's vision, energies of the Lord, devotional service as remedy

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This is the perfect remedy for the suffering of the conditioned souls: the process of devotional service."
**Summary:** The lecture begins by discussing Vyasadeva's vision of the Lord and His energies, highlighting devotional service as the perfect remedy for the suffering of conditioned souls, emphasizing hearing and chanting as the beginning of this process.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 6th verse of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: अनर्थो पशमं साक्षाद भक्ति योगं अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अजानतो विद्वाम्स चक्रे सात्वत सम्हिताम. अनर्थो पशमं साक्षाद भक्ति योगं अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे. थे, इस वर्क में हम impactful 的 बार जो कहते है कि, स्थित पत्र वर्क में, वैकुल पर पत्र विशेष निर्मण हो रही या बीम करती है Monte है वर्क में अपने वेसिड युद की वर्क है कि वो अक्सर वर्क हाथवटि में स्कूल है. यह it is complete and perfect in all respects, so when it is described that Vyasadeva saw the personality of Godhead, it is qualified; he saw the all-perfect personality of Godhead. Now, Srila Prabhupada further explains, what does it mean? This statement suggests that the complete unit of the personality of Godhead includes his parts and parcels also. The Lord is always complete, and he is never without his parts and parcels. He saw therefore, what all did he see? He saw therefore his different energies, namely the internal energy, the marginal energy, and the external energy. The Lord is always with his energies, so Vyasadeva, when he saw the Lord, he saw his different energies also. He also saw his different plenary portions and parts of the plenary portions, namely his different incarnations also. Even though the Supreme Lord is one, one and only Supreme Personality of Godhead, but he is not a limited person. He has many different forms of incarnations, plenary portions, parts of plenary portions, and Vyasadeva also specifically observed the unwanted miseries of the conditioned souls who are bewildered by the external energy. This was explained in the previous verse, and here the remedial measure is given, and at last he saw the Lord, and here the remedial measure is given, and at last he saw the Lord, and at last he saw the Lord, and at last he saw the remedial measure for the conditioned souls, namely the process of devotional service. This is the perfect remedy for the suffering of the conditioned souls. What is it? It is the process of devotional service. This devotional service is a great transcendental science and begins with the process of hearing and chanting, and begins with the process of hearing and chanting the name, fame, glory, etc. of the Supreme Personality of Godhead: shravanam, kirtanam, vishnom. This is the beginning of the process of devotional service.

### devotional service, sincerity, causeless mercy, mitigation of miseries

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Bhakti is something that is bestowed by the Supreme Lord when the Lord is fully satisfied with the sincere efforts of the devotee."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that devotional service should not be mechanical but involve the full mind and spirit, highlighting the importance of sincerity and the causeless mercy of the Lord in bestowing love of God, and noting the immediate mitigation of material miseries as a benefit of devotional service.

Revival of the dormant affection or love of Godhead does not depend on the mechanical system of hearing and chanting. Generally, people, when they do something repeatedly, the process tends to become mechanical, just like routinely we do so many things very mechanically. But the process of devotional service is never a mechanical process because it is the full involvement of the mind, because it is the full involvement of the mind, the full involvement of the spirit soul, of the spiritual personality, 100% involved in this process, then only the process is effective to the extent of achieving perfection. Even if somebody does devotional service in a mechanical way, there is benefit, there is a benefit, but it is not sufficient to take us to perfection. So Shrila Prabhupada says this transcendental process, it solely and wholly depends on the causeless mercy of the Lord. Bhakti is something that is bestowed by the Supreme Lord. When the Lord is fully satisfied with the sincere efforts of the devotee, he may endow him with his loving transcendental service. So the complete perfection comes after the devotee has rendered devotional service with all his efforts, sincerely trying to please the Lord, and when the Lord is pleased, he bestows the perfection of love of God. But even with the prescribed forms of hearing and chanting, that is just one has begun, there is at once mitigation of the superfluous and unwanted miseries of material existence. The effect on the heart of the chanting and hearing is immediately felt even by the beginner before he is able to even make advancement. Immediately, what is the immediate effect? The mitigation of material miseries. This is very important to understand, and it is a very great encouragement for anyone that immediately they begin to feel the benefit of this process.

### knowledge vs. devotion, purification, material contamination, spiritual satisfaction

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Devotion helps us to awaken knowledge within our heart."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the path of knowledge with the path of devotion, stating that devotion is independent of knowledge and helps awaken it, and emphasizes the need for purification from material contamination accumulated over lifetimes to experience transcendental love, explaining that material miseries are superfluous and the material body is unwanted.

Such mitigation of material affection does not wait for development of transcendental knowledge. This is what the impersonalists think, that unless there is knowledge, there is no progress in spiritual life. That is for the jnana process. Bhakti process does not depend on development of transcendental knowledge. So the Prabhupada says, rather knowledge is dependent on devotional service for the ultimate realization of the supreme truth. So knowledge is dependent on devotion, but devotion is independent of knowledge. Devotion helps us to awaken knowledge within our heart. So the process of devotional service, it directly acts on the contaminated consciousness to purify, but the devotee has to sincerely engage in the process and patiently engage in the process and patiently wait for complete purification. The complete purification takes some time because we have been associating with this material world for a very, very, very long time, millions of lifetimes, and we have accumulated so much of this material contamination life after life after life after life after life. In ignorance, we have been simply engaging in sense gratification, so that has to be cleansed away before we can actually experience the transcendental love in reciprocation with the Supreme Lord. Before that, we have to cleanse the heart. These material miseries are described as superfluous. Superfluous means they are actually not giving any benefit for us. They are simply useless stuff. That's why they are called un-earth. In fact, un-earth means unwanted, something which is unwanted. Un-earth, this body itself, material body itself is un-earth, it itself is un-earth. But in the material conception, we think we cannot exist without the body. Why? Because the body is the means for our sense gratification, for our material enjoyment. That material enjoyment, yes, we can have to whatever extent we can get some material pleasure by the means of the body, but as spirit soul, we are not meant to enjoy materially. Neither material pleasures give any satisfaction for the soul.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Material pleasure is simply a sensation, and it is a temporary thing... and it eventually leads to miseries only; whereas transcendental happiness is completely pure bliss and it is never momentary."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the soul's true satisfaction, contrasting material pleasures, which are temporary and lead to misery, with transcendental happiness, which is pure, eternal bliss experienced through transcendental senses, referencing the Bhagavad Gita to support this point.

The Bhagavatam raises this point: what ensures that there is complete satisfaction for the soul? The satisfaction of the soul, of the real self, that is to be considered. The satisfaction of the soul is never possible by any material pleasure, material means, material methods, material pleasures, material arrangements. It never even touches the soul in any way. So therefore, people who are seeking real happiness, they are frustrated when they make different arrangements for enjoying materially, or they seek material happiness, and they never are satisfied within their heart, never are satisfied. So this point is explained in the Bhagavad Gita: yehi samsparishya ja bhoga dukha yonaya evate aadyantavan takaunteya nateshu ramate budhah. One more verse that explains what is the nature of transcendental happiness: sukham aatyantikam yatta buddhikrahyam atindriyam. You see, this transcendental happiness is an experience of boundless transcendental joy which is experienced with transcendental senses, atindriyam, not with this material senses. These material senses are useless for experiencing any any spiritual happiness or transcendental happiness. So material pleasure is simply a sensation, and it is a temporary thing. It is also called chapala sukha, momentary happiness, and it eventually leads to miseries only, whereas transcendental happiness completely pure bliss, and it is never momentary. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Pariksit Maharaj, who listened to Shukadev Goswami speak the Srimad Bhagavatam for seven days without interruption, to illustrate the power of attentive hearing and absorption in the subject matter.

See how effective Srimad Bhagavatam is. Simply you have to hear, this is called giving oral reception. You have to give oral reception, means you have to hear attentively. And simply you have to do that. What did Pariksit Maharaj do? He simply sat and heard Shukadev Goswami speak for 7 days and nights continuously. That's all he did. He didn't do any gymnastics. But he was hearing with complete attention. He was fully absorbed in the subject matter. So much so that Shukadev Goswami said, "Do you want to take a break?" He said, "No. There is no need for any break because through my ears I'm drinking the nectar of the words of the Srimad Bhagavatam spoken by Shukadev Goswami." So that nectar makes one indifferent to thirst, hunger, sleep, all these things cannot disturb a person who's completely immersed.

**Key Quote:** "Material life means constant lamentation and everyone is after the mirage of illusory things."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Srimad Bhagavatam extinguishes the fire of lamentation, illusion, and fear, which are the primary symptoms of material disease, and quotes Srila Prabhupada on the effectiveness of the ear as a sense.

It extinguishes the fire of lamentation, illusion and fearfulness. This is explained by Srila Prabhupada in the purport. Prabhupada says, "There are various senses of which the ear is the most effective ear. This sense works even when a man is deep asleep. One can protect himself from the hands of an enemy while awake, but while asleep, one is protected by the ear only. The importance of hearing is mentioned here in connection with attaining the highest perfection of life, namely getting free from three material pangs. Everyone is full of lamentation at every moment. Material life means constant lamentation and everyone is after the mirage of illusory things. The whole material creation is a creation of the illusory energy, and so many objects are there which bewilder the mind and people are simply running after this mirage. Mirage means something, a phenomenon or a death. In a desert, there is no water, but it appears like there is a body of water at a distance and one chases that body of water and never gets any water because there is no real water there in that mirage. Similarly in this material world, so many objects seem to be promising so much of happiness, but actually none of those objects can give us any real pleasure. And thirdly, he is always afraid of his supposed enemy, Shoka, Moha, Bhaya, these are three material pangs, which everyone in this material world who is born under the force of karma."

**Key Quote:** "As soon as you hear from a pure devotee, the actual message of the Bhagavatam, immediately it relieves you from these three material pangs, immediately, you feel relief."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the symptoms of material disease (lamentation, illusion, and fear) and emphasizes the importance of hearing about Krishna from a pure devotee to experience relief from these pangs.

These are the primary symptoms of material disease, Bhavaroga, it is called Bhavaroga, the disease of repeated birth and death. Everyone is affected by this disease in this material world and the primary symptoms, just like if somebody has got a viral infection, then they have a symptom called fever or some body pain, vomiting, loose motion, whatever, like that, what is the symptom of this material disease that is described as these three symptoms: Shoka, Moha, Bhaya. Shoka is lamentation, Moha is illusion and Bhaya is fear. And it is definitely suggested here in that simply by hearing the message of Srimad Bhagavatam, one gets attachment for the supreme personality. Krishna is very, very attractive, but you have to hear about Krishna from the pure devotee, because the pure devotee presents factually the actual personality of Godhead, not some speculated theory or some mental concoction, no, real Supreme Lord is presented by the pure devotee.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the ultimate goal of devotional service (Bhakti) is to develop genuine love for Krishna, which cannot be achieved through other methods like Jnana, Karma, or Yoga.

And as soon as this is affected, the symptoms of the material diseases disappear. As soon as you hear from a pure devotee, the actual message of the Bhagavatam, immediately it relieves you from these three material pangs, immediately, you feel relief. And that is the most encouraging part of the Bhagavad Gita. The process of Bhakti, Srila Vyasadeva saw the all perfect personality of Godhead and in this statement, the all perfect personality of Godhead Shri Krishna is clearly confirmed. The ultimate result of devotional service is to develop genuine love for the first Supreme personality. We have love for Krishna, but this is awakened only by this process of Bhakti. It cannot be awakened by the process of Jnana, Karma or Yoga. No material methods are possible to be practiced in order to awaken our genuine devotion or genuine love for Krishna. Love is a word which is often used in relation with man and woman. And love is the only word that can be properly used to indicate the relation between Lord

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Love is the only word that can be properly used to indicate the relation between Lord Krishna and the living entities."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the relationship between Krishna and the living entities as one of love, comparing it to the affection between male and female, with Krishna being the Parama Purusha (supreme male) and the living entities being Prakriti (feminine).

Krishna and the living entities. Why is that? Because the living entities are described as Prakriti in the Bhagavad Gita: Apareyam itasthu anyam prakritim viddhime paraam. Material energy is described as Apara Prakriti, living entities are described as Para Prakriti. So, we are Prakriti. Prakriti is feminine. The Lord is always described as the Parama Purusha, the supreme male personality. Thus, the affection between the Lord and the living entities is something like the affection between the male and the female in this material world. See why this is being said is because we have experienced what is the kind of affection that exists between a male and a female. So the term love of God, love of God is quite appropriate. If you understand from this perspective, we are feminine in terms of being Prakriti and the Lord is the supreme male. So the relationship is one of love.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Hearing about him means immediate contact with him."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that loving devotional service begins with hearing (Shravanam) about the Lord, and because Krishna is absolute, hearing about Him is the same as being in direct contact with Him, removing material affections.

That is how Prabhupada explains in this purport. Loving devotional service to the Lord begins with hearing about the Lord. Shravanam. This process for executing devotional service is hearing. There is no difference between the Lord and the subject matter heard about him. This is the absolute nature of Krishna. His descriptions are identical with his personality. The Lord is absolute in all respects and thus there is no difference between him and the subject matter heard about him. Therefore, hearing about him means immediate contact with him. The Lord is an absolute in all respects and thus there is no difference between him and the subject matter heard about him, by the process of vibration of the transcendental sound, the sound which is emanating from the lips of the pure devotee. When the devotee, pure devotee describes the Supreme Lord Krishna, that sound is a transcendental vibration and the transcendental sound is so effective that it acts at once by removing all material affections mentioned above. Everything is completely cleansed away by the powerful sound of the description of the Supreme Lord. As mentioned before, a living entity develops a sort of complexity by material association and the illusory engagement of the material body is accepted as an actual fact. We are entangled in this world and we accept this illusion as something which is real. Why is it called illusion? Illusion means something which is not real you accept as real, something which is not fact you accept as fact and the actual fact is rejected as something which is not real. This is the whole basis of illusion.

**Key Quote:** "By hearing the subject matter of Srimad Bhagavatam this false complexity of materialism is removed and real peace in society begins."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of animals being attracted to each other to illustrate how illusion works and explains that hearing the Srimad Bhagavatam removes the false complexities of materialism, leading to peace and love.

Under such false complexity, the living beings under different categories of life and become illusion in different ways. The way the illusory energy works is different for different living entities. Just like a dog, male dog is attracted to a female dog, a male pig is attracted to a female pig. Now from our perspective, the pig may be a very ugly creature or a filthy living in a filthy place in a gutter eating stool, abominable existence, but the evil energy of illusion is such that the soul in a male pig's body is attracted to the female pig's body simply to enjoy sex life, you see. Same thing happens even in bird society, animal society, even in human society also the same thing happens in the whole nature of the Universe by treating what is called happens. So Srila Prabhupada says, "Even in the most developed stage of human life, the same illusion prevails in the form many isms and divides the loving relation between the Lord and the living entities, thereby it divides the loving relation between man and man, between one living, one human being, another human being, but by hearing the subject matter of Srimad Bhagavatam, this false complexity of materialism is removed and real peace in society begins which politicians aspire for so eagerly in many political situations." So peace is the prerequisite for love, there is no possibility of love without peace.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that the Srimad Bhagavatam is the only literature that perfectly describes the Supreme Lord, and attentive hearing of it cleanses the heart, removes misconceptions, and awakens love for Krishna.

As long as our mind is agitated, disturbed, there is no possibility of love, experiencing love. So the Srimad Bhagavatam is the only literature which gives us perfect description of the Supreme Lord which is identical with the Lord and such contact with the Lord through simply hearing attentively will ensure that our heart becomes cleansed of all these misconceptions, all the wrong understanding, all the material complexities are removed and love is at once awakened. So that is the process, that's how it works. I'll stop here, thank you very much.

**Summary:** This segment discusses Shukadeva Goswami's unique position as a liberated soul from birth, explaining why he didn't undergo traditional Vedic studies.

If you remember, the beginning of the Bhagavatam, it is explained Shukadeva Goswami walked away from home without caring to undergo any samskaras, including the Upanayana samskara. He just ignored because only after Upanayana one approaches a bona-fide spiritual master to learn the Vedas, to learn the scriptures, to learn the spiritual knowledge, but Shukadeva Swami just didn't care for any of those formalities. Why? Because he was already engaged in self-realization. He was a liberated soul by birth. It's very, very, very rare somebody is born liberated. Generally, everyone is born as a conditioned soul. The very reason for birth is that one is conditioned by material energy or material nature, but Shukadeva Swami was a liberated soul by birth, so he didn't have to

undergo any study of the Vedas. Now, why did he actually learn the Srimad Bhagavatam? That's the question that will be raised in the next words, but here Srila Prabhupada is the one who explains about the significance of Vyasadeva compiling the Bhagavatam and teaching it to his own son. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "Srimad Bhagavatam is the natural commentation on the Brahma Sutras compiled by the same author, natural commentary on the Brahma Sutras." If you are aware, the Brahma Sutras or the Vedanta Sutras are the most scholarly presentation by Vyasadeva. The essence of the Vedas is given in the Upanishads. The essence of the Upanishads is given in the Vedanta Sutra or the Brahma Sutra. So Brahma Sutra is like the cream of the cream, and that Brahma Sutra is not easy to understand even for learned Vedic scholars. So Vyasadeva himself wrote a commentary on this Vedanta Sutra in the form of Srimad Bhagavatam, and it's called natural because the author of both the Vedanta Sutra and its commentary, the Srimad Bhagavatam, is the same person, Srila Vyasadeva.

**Key Quote:** "Material bondage means we have lost our freedom natural freedom which is there in our spiritual existence."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of material bondage, explaining how it limits our natural freedom and subjects us to the laws of material nature.

Material bondage, material bondage means we have lost our freedom, natural freedom, which is there in our spiritual existence. We are bound up by this body. We are bound up by the laws of material nature. Just like I cannot eat whatever I want, anytime I want, as much as I want. I cannot eat. If I don't obey or follow the laws of material nature, then overeating causes indigestion, or eating the wrong thing, it infects some part of the body, and we get diseased, and we suffer in so many ways due to diseases. So like this, we have lost our natural freedom because material bondage, and what is this proof of material bondage? This very material body. Every body, material body, is a limitation. The soul is completely free to travel anywhere in the whole creation, but being bound up by this body, we cannot just go anywhere and everywhere, and the means of travel also is fixed according to the body, is it not? Birds can fly, human beings cannot fly unless they use a machine called an aeroplane, or they use some yogic siddhi, otherwise they cannot fly. The aquatics can live in the water, but they cannot live on the land. We live on the land, but we cannot live in water.

**Summary:** The speaker addresses the age of the Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining how Srila Prabhupada arrives at the figure of five thousand years based on descriptions within the text and the beginning of Kali Yuga.

This mundane scholars, they have their own empirical methods of determining how old is some scripture or how many years back something was spoken about. History itself, there are so many opinions according to their own theories, but from the text of the Bhagavatam, it is very clear that this Bhagavatam is compiled before the disappearance of King Pariksit and after the departure of Lord Krishna. So this is all described in the Bhagavatam itself very clearly. When Maharaj Pariksit was ruling the world as the king of Bharata Varsha, he chastised the personality of Kali, Kali Purusha. That is described in the first canto of the Srimad Bhagavata. According to revealed scriptures and astrological calculation, the age of Kali is in its five thousandth year now. Five thousand years have already passed since Kali Yuga began. Therefore, Srimad Bhagavatam is compiled not less than five thousand years ago.

**Summary:** This section discusses the order in which Vyasadeva compiled the Vedic literatures, including the Puranas, Mahabharata, and Srimad Bhagavatam, highlighting the importance of the Bhagavatam's description of Krishna's activities.

See how Shila Prabhupada is arriving at this figure of five thousand years old based on the description in the Bhagavatam itself. Mahabharata was compiled before Srimad Bhagavatam, and the Puranas were compiled before Mahabharata. Vyasadeva is the one who compiled all this. So he compiled the Puranas, then he compiled the Mahabharata, then he compiled the Srimad Bhagavatam. That is an estimation of the date of compilation of the different Vedic literatures, especially the Puranas, Mahabharata, and Bhagavatam are very important because they describe the activities of the personality of the Srimad Bhagavatam called Krishna. The activities of the person is very rarely found in very literature. Lot of description is there about the impersonal feature, but that is the subordinate aspect of

**Summary:** The lecture concludes by explaining that the Srimad Bhagavatam is a science for following the path of nivritti marga (the path of liberation), contrasting it with pravritti marga and emphasizing its role in curing material disease.

the synopsis of Srimad Bhagavatam was given before the detailed description under instruction of Narada. Narada gave the synopsis of Bhagavatam to Vyasadeva, and Vyasadeva expanded that and presented the Srimad Bhagavatam for our understanding in an elaborate way. Srimad Bhagavatam is the science for following the path of nivritti marga. That's why it was said, nivritta niratam munihi. Shukadeva Swamy was liberated soul is the path of liberation. The path of pravritti marga was condemned by Narada. Narada, while instructing Vyasadeva, he said this pravritti marga simply increases, aggravates the diseased condition, whereas nivritta marga relieves one of the disease, material disease, and also on the path of liberation, one becomes freed from all the material miseries that was described in the previous two verses. So this path of nivritti marga is the natural, sorry, the path of pravritti marga is the natural inclination for all conditioned souls. The theme of the Srimad Bhagavatam is the cure of the materialistic disease of the human being or stopping completely the pants of material existence.

**Key Quote:** "Shri Shukadev Goswami was already on the path of self-realization and thus he was pleased with his own self. Why did he take the trouble to undergo the self-realization, the study of such a vast literature?"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces Shounaka's question about why Shukadeva Goswami, already self-realized, undertook the study of the vast Shreemad Bhagavatam, and begins to explain the concept of sense gratification.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 9th verse of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Shreemad Bhagavatam: शाउनकव वाच. Now, after सूतकव स्वामी said that व्यास देवा taught the Shreemad Bhagavatam to his own son, immediately शाउनकव interrupts सूतकव स्वामी and asks a very, very important question. Kindly hear this question very attentively: शाउनकव वाच सवै निवृत्ति निरतहा सर्वत्रो पेक्षको मुनिही कस्यवा ब्रहतीम एताम आत्मा रामस समभ्यसत. The meaning is Shri Shounaka asked सूतकव स्वामी, "Shri Shukadev Goswami was already on the path of self-realization, and thus he was pleased with his own self, आत्मा रामा. Why did he take the trouble to undergo the self-realization, the study of such a vast literature? भागवत्म is no small literature, 18,000 verses. Why did he undergo the trouble when he was already on the path of self-realization?" So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, "For the people in general, the highest perfection of life is to cease from material activities and be fixed on the path of self-realization." फहा कि first काथवित है कि Cease for material activity means that these material activities are activities which are aimed at sense gratification. Sense gratification means the senses are always demanding some pleasure, some pleasing object of the senses. For the eyes, it is a beautiful form; for the ears, it is some melodious music or some praise. For the tongue, it is some palliative beauty. For the tongue, it is some palliative beauty. For the tongue, it is some palliative beauty.

### Atma-rama, transcendentalism, Srimad Bhagavatam

**Key Quote:** "Srimad Bhagavatam is a post-graduate study even for the atmarama's who have to surpass all the studies of vedic knowledge."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Srimad Bhagavatam is beyond material enjoyment and even liberation, making it a postgraduate study for Atma-ramas, those who are self-satisfied.

Soul pleasure of the self. Atma means self, and arama means to take pleasure. Everyone is searching after the highest pleasure, but the standard of pleasure of one may be different from the standard of another. Of course, everybody wants pleasure, but the standard may not be the same. Therefore, the standard of pleasure enjoyed by the karmis, the materialistic persons, is different from that of the atma rama's, the transcendentalists. The atma rama's are completely indifferent to material enjoyment in every respect. Why is Srila Prabhupada mentioning this? Because he is trying to explain what is the need for Shukadeva Goswami to undertake study of this vast literature when he was already self-satisfied. What is the impetus? So, Srila Prabhupada says atma rama's are indifferent to material enjoyment. They are not interested in material enjoyment. Srila Shukadeva Goswami had already attained that stage. What stage? The stage of atma rama, taking pleasure in the self or the soul, and still he was attracted to undergo the trouble of studying the great Bhagavatam literature. So, there is an important conclusion here from this stage that Srimad Bhagavatam is stronglyуетing the atma rama's behavior. This means that Shrima Bhagavatam is a post-graduate study even for the atmarama's who have to surpass all the studies of Vedic knowledge. Atmarama's are not interested in any materials stuff, so why would they study Bhagavatam? Because Bhagavatam has got nothing to do with material sense enjoyment. It's completely transcendentalized. The atma vas or say the atma vow has nothing to do with the material sense of knowledge. The atma bhas not been interested in Padm Prim mommy or dealt with.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "If you were to be able to get an ocean of spiritual happiness then that ocean of spiritual happiness cannot equal even one drop of devotional happiness."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts spiritual happiness with devotional happiness, emphasizing the latter's superiority and its presence in Srimad Bhagavatam, and describes the characteristics of a pure devotee who is uninterested in liberation, seeking only to serve Krishna.

happiness is much, much, much, much more than spiritual happiness. What is the comparison? But there is something to say is that if you were to be able to get an ocean of spiritual happiness, then that ocean of spiritual happiness cannot equal even one drop of devotional happiness. There is a comparison in the book, that is something. So, devotional happiness is the happiness that is the happiness derived by devotional service to Krishna when Krishna reciprocates the devotees and service devotional service. So, that is billions and trillions of times more than any spiritual happiness also. So, that happiness is what is there in the Bhagavatam, that devotional happens. And there are so many examples given in the Bhagavatam how different great devotees, pure devotees, they experience this bliss of devotional happiness. And such pure devotees who experience devotional happiness, they deride even the conception of liberation. One great devotee, Billamangal Thakur, he says, "Ever since I am engaged in devotional service and I'm experiencing devotional happiness, I don't care for liberation, but liberation comes and waits as my maid servant, how can I serve?" So, this is the position of a pure devotee, that a pure devotee is uninterested in liberation. Certainly, a pure devotee is never interested in any material happiness. A pure devotee is not even interested in any kind of liberation. There are five kinds of liberation, but a pure devotee is not interested in any of the kinds of liberation. He is simply interested in serving Krishna because that is the source of unlimited transcendental bliss called the devotional happiness. So, Bhagavatam is filled with that. Simply by sitting and hearing Srimad Bhagavatam from the proper source, one has access to this devotional happiness. We get a glimpse of that when we begin Sankirtana. In Sankirtana, there is some kind of experience of happiness which one has never experienced before, and that is very, very, very unique. But that is only a brief glimpse we get in the beginning of our Krishna Consciousness. We have to cleanse our heart and become fixed up in devotional service to be

In this session, we are going to learn about... We are beginning a new chapter in the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, the 8th chapter.

**Summary:** The speaker summarizes the events of the previous chapter, leading to the Pandavas' journey to the Ganges to perform rituals for their deceased relatives.

So the previous chapter described how the five sleeping sons of Draupadi were actually beheaded by Ashwatthama. And in order to punish Ashwatthama, there was a very big description of the effort involved and the actual suitable punishment that is to be given to him as an aggressor, as a Brahma Bandhu, as the son of the military teacher to whom the Pandavas were very much indebted, like that. So in the end, Ashwatthama's life was spared, but Draupadi lost her five sons. So the Pandavas, desiring to deliver water to the dead relatives, they had to do the last rituals, the final rites, for the departed souls. So they went to the Ganges with Draupadi.

**Key Quote:** "Today it is the custom in Hindu society, To go to the Ganges or any other sacred river, To take bath when death occurs in the family."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the ritual of bathing in the Ganges after a death in the family is presented, emphasizing its historical roots and connection to the Dharmashastras.

So Srila Prabhupada explains this particular ritual. Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "Today it is the custom in Hindu society to go to the Ganges or any other sacred river to take bath when death occurs in the family." Death is an inevitable part of life. That life is an inevitable part of life. That life in this body has always got a beginning and an end. So the end of life in this body is called death. And according to Bhagavad Gita, the real person inside the body, the soul, quits the body or is forced to quit the body at the time of death, at the end of this life. So when death occurs, it is the tradition and custom to go to some sacred river and take bath. And moreover, it is described here by Srila Prabhupada, each of the family members pours out a pot full of the Ganges water for the departed soul and walks in a procession with the ladies in the front. So those of you who are familiar with this custom, the rituals that are performed, one of the important rituals is called Dharmodaka, offering water. Udaka means water, offering water for the departed soul according to the particular described method in the Dharmashastras. The Pandavas also followed the rules more than 5000 years ago. So these customs and traditions and the particular rituals mentioned in Dharmashastra are not something new that has been invented now. It has always existed in human society, and it was followed by the Pandavas 5000 years ago because this is a historical record, the Srimad Bhagavatam's historical record of what happened 5000 years back when the Pandavas and Kauravas were present on this earth.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights Lord Krishna's presence among the Pandavas as their cousin, explaining the family relationship through Kunti and Vasudeva.

Now the most important point here is Lord Krishna. Who is Lord Krishna? The supreme personality of God. Being a cousin of the Pandavas, was also amongst the family members. So Krishna, how was he a cousin of the Pandavas? The Pandavas' mother, Kunti, was the sister of Krishna's father, Vasudeva. Vasudeva and Kunti were brother and sister. So therefore, Vasudeva's son, Krishna, and Kunti's sons, the Pandavas, were cousins. That's how it is described. Krishna, being a cousin of the Pandavas, was also amongst the family members. Now Krishna, what role he is going to play, will be described in a verse a little later. He was also there present in this while this ritual was being performed.

This is very significant. They were taking bath in the Ganges River. Now what is a special thing about the Ganges River? We all know it is very, very sacred, it's very holy, it's sanctified. Why that is being mentioned here in the Bhagavatam in this verse? It is because the water of the Ganges is mixed with the dust of the lotus feet of Lord Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Lord Krishna's Vamana avatar, focusing on his request for land from Bali Maharaj and his subsequent expansion to cover the universe.

So the Bhagavatam itself describes a pastime of Lord Krishna in his incarnation as Vaman Dev. When Vamana wanted to restore the kingdom of the heavenly planets to Indra, the son of Aditi, Aditi prayed to the Supreme Lord Vishnu and said, "My sons have lost their kingdom, kindly restore it to them." So the Lord, being pleased with the worship of Aditi, agreed to simply become her son, appear as her son, and that was the incarnation of the Lord as the son of Aditi. His name was Vamana. Vamana incarnation of the Lord is Vamana. He appeared as a small dwar brahmachari boy. That was the form in which he appeared. That's why Vamana, Vamana means a dwarf in some script. And then this Vamana went to Bali Maharaj, who was ruling the heavenly planets, having conquered the heavenly kingdom, and on behalf of the asuras, Bali Maharaj is ruling. So he, and Bali Maharaj is performing sacrifices. So Vamana, disguised as a brahmachari boy, the Supreme Lord Vishnu disguised as a brahmachari boy, he simply went to that arena, sacrificial arena of Bali Maharaj, and asked him, "I want a donation, three paces of land measured according to my footstep." So Bali Maharaj initially was hesitant to give that small quantity of donation, which he thought, small boy doesn't have experience asking donation. So, Bali Maharaj said, "I can give you so much donation, why are you asking for just three steps of land?" Then Vaman Dev said, "I should be satisfied with what is the bare minimum necessity," and he spoke very brilliantly telling that there is no end to greed. And anyway, Bali Maharaj thought this Brahmachari boy is speaking very intelligently, very nicely. So, he actually agreed to give that donation, and what did Vaman Dev do? He expanded himself to cover the entire universe in two steps. And, when he stretched out his leg to cover the upper portion above the earth, all the planets, until the covering of the universe, the first step. Then the toe of his foot pierced the coverings of the universe. That's very significant because the universe is covered by seven layers. Each layer being...

And that water, as it came into the universe, through the hole created by Vamana piercing the shell of the universe, that water washed the lotus feet of Vamandev, who is Vishnu, who is the Supreme Lord. And that is called Ganga."
**Summary:** The lecture concludes with an explanation of the origin of the Ganges, its spiritual potency due to washing the lotus feet of Vamana, and its ability to purify individuals and benefit departed souls.

So, like that, 4 quadrillion miles, like that the thickness of the layers. So, all those layers, the Supreme Lord pierced by merely pushing his toe into the shell of the universe. And what happened? Because these universes are situated in the Karna ocean, causal ocean. So, the water from the Karna ocean leaked inside this universe. And that water, as it came into the universe, through the hole created by Vamana piercing the shell of the universe, that water washed the lotus feet of Vamandev, who is Vishnu, who is the Supreme Lord. And that is called Ganga. So, therefore, here it is said, the water of the Ganges is sanctified because it is mixed with the dust of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. So, therefore, Ganga Jal is spiritually potent. It is spiritually potent because it contains the dust of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord Krishna. And that's the reason why anybody takes bath in the Ganges. People swim in the Ganges River. They are completely purified of all sinful reactions. When they offer that Ganges water to the departed soul, the departed soul also is actually benefited in several ways. Actions are actually cleared away when the soul is offered Ganga Jal, because the Ganga Jal is sanctified water because of being mixed with the dust of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. So, I will stop here. Thank you very much.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 10th verse of the 8th chapter. This is the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. From the previous session, the prayer offered by Uttara continues to Lord Krishna. This is the 10th verse: Abhidhravati Maam Eesha Sharastata Yaso Vibho Kamam Dahatum Maam Natha. Maam Eesha Sharastata Yaso Vibho Kamam Dahatum Maam Natha. Maam Eesha Sharastata Yaso Vibho Kamam Dahatum Maam Natha. Garbho Nipat Pyatam. So this is another part of the prayer offered by Uttara to Lord Krishna. So the translation of this verse is: O my Lord, you are all powerful. A fiery iron arrow is coming towards me fast. My Lord, let it burn me personally if you so desire, but please do not let it burn my embryo. Please do me this favor, my Lord. So Uttara is praying for the protection of the child in her womb because a fiery iron arrow is fast approaching her embryo, and she is praying that let it burn me personally, I don't mind, but let it not burn the child in the

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's purport is discussed, explaining the context of Uttara's situation after Abhimanyu's death and the concept of 'sati' for chaste wives.

womb. Now Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport very nicely. This incident took place after the death of Abhimanyu, the husband of Uttara. Abhimanyu, as I mentioned in an earlier session, died in the battle of Kurukshetra. Abhimanyu's widow, Uttara, should have followed the path of her husband, but because she was pregnant and Maharaj Parikshit, the great devotee of the Lord, was lying in the embryo, she was responsible for his protection. She was pregnant when Abhimanyu died, so she did not die along with the husband. She did not follow the sati procedure. For a chaste wife, when the husband dies, then the wife cannot bear the separation from the husband. The fire of separation is much more intense and intolerable than the fire of the burning funeral pyre of the husband. Therefore, a wife is not allowed to be separated from her husband, because the husband is not allowed to be separated from her wife. A chaste wife who is without children, she generally dies along with the husband's funeral. That's called sati, and by such an action, she elevates herself, which elevates her consciousness. That is a symbol of chastity.

**Key Quote:** "Uttara was not ashamed to express this frankly before lord Krishna she very frankly admitted that I want to protect my child kindly save this child"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Uttara's qualities and lineage, emphasizing her role as a mother and a student of Arjuna, highlighting her fortunate position.

Now here, Uttara should have followed her husband, but because she was pregnant, she did not do so. And who was in the womb? It was not an ordinary child, it was Maharaj Pariksit, a great devotee of the Lord, and as a mother, she is responsible for his protection. The mother of a child has a great responsibility in giving all protection to the child, and therefore Uttara was not ashamed to express this frankly before Lord Krishna. She very frankly admitted that I want to protect my child, kindly save this child. Uttara was the daughter of Maharaj, a great king. Her father was also a great king, the wife of a great hero. Abhimanyu was a great hero, fought valiantly in the battle of Kurukshetra. She was his wife, a student of a great devotee, and later she was a mother of a good king also. Student of a great devotee when Pandavas were incognito, living incognito in Virata's kingdom. Uttara was the daughter of King Virata. So she was Arjuna disguised himself as a dance teacher and Uttara became the student of Arjuna. So therefore a student of a great devotee, Arjuna is that great devotee. And later she was a mother of a good king also. That is Parikshit Maharaj. Arjuna became the emperor of the world and so later on she was the mother of the great king.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 11th verse, explaining Krishna's understanding of Ashwatthama's use of the Brahmastra to eliminate the Pandava lineage.

She was fortunate in every respect. So that is the position of Uttara that is being glorified here. Now the next verse describes what is the response of Krishna. The eleventh verse. So, the meaning of this eleventh verse, Suta Goswami is speaking. Having patiently heard her words, Lord Shri Krishna, who's always very devotees, Bhaktavatsala, could at once understand that Ashwatthama, the son of Dronacharya, had thrown the Brahmastra to finish the last life in the Pandava family. If you remember, this Dronacharya's son, Ashwatthama, had tried to throw a Brahmastra to save his own life earlier when Arjuna was chasing him, and Krishna directed Arjuna to neutralize the Brahmastra so that it would not do any harm. Now again, he has thrown a Brahmastra to finish the last life of the in the Pandava family.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's purport is further discussed, emphasizing the Lord's inclination towards devotees for the well-being of everyone and the importance of reinstating living beings in their original position as loving devotees of Krishna.

This only surviving descendant of the Pandavas. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says the Lord is impartial in every respect, but still he is inclined towards the Lord. The Lord supports his devotees because there is a great necessity of this for everyone's well-being. Devotees are meant for the well-being of everyone in the world because devotees do the greatest welfare activity. There are many people who are engaged in different kinds of welfare activity, but which welfare activity is the best? That which reinstates every living being in his or her original position as the loving devotee of the Supreme Lord in his personal abode. We all belong to Krishna. There is no reason for us to suffer in this material world other than our foolishness of becoming forgetful of Krishna or being rebellious, envious of Krishna, trying to compete with Krishna, trying to assume Krishna's position or trying to be independent of Krishna. So many different reasons can be cited why living beings in this material world who don't belong to this world, who belong to Krishna's personal abode, they are away from Krishna due to various

reasons and all foolish, all foolish reasons. So the Lord takes compassion and he personally comes and he instructs, he speaks the Bhagavad Gita, he sends his representatives and those representatives are being mentioned here. Because there is a great necessity of Krishna's pure devotees in this world for everyone's well-being. That's a great necessity. The Pandava family was a family of devotees and therefore the Lord wanted them to rule the world. See devotees rule the world then there is well-being for everyone because the devotees see everyone as part and parcel of Krishna. They don't see them in terms of their external body. Oh so and so is this particular resident or national or some particular person belonging to particular state or community or caste or no that's not the way a devotee sees other living beings. A devotee sees all living beings as part and parcel of Krishna. This is what is told in the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna is described in the Bhagavad Gita as surdasarvabhutana and the devotees are described as surdasarvadehina. Same meaning. Sarvadehina means all living beings in different forms of bodies. Sarvabhutana means all devotees. Sarvabhutana means all different living beings in different forms of bodies. Same meaning. So the Lord is the best well-wisher of all living beings. Similarly his pure devotees are also the best well-wishers of all living beings. So both the Lord and his pure devotees

are similarly the well-wishers. That was the reason he vanquished the rule of the company of Duryodhana and established the rule of Maharaja Yudhishtira. It's not a question of just competency in ruling. Duryodhana was competent to rule. We can't say he was incompetent, but Duryodhana was lacking that devotion. Therefore Duryodhana was typically having different kinds of feelings in his heart for different categories of people. So and so is my enemy. So and so is my friend. So and so is my well-wisher. Somebody else is my competitor. All kinds of this enviousness. A mentality of differentiation based on externals without looking into the core of the heart that every living being belongs to Krishna. A non-devotee himself doesn't know that he belongs to Krishna. So how will he understand others connection with Krishna. He will never understand by himself if he continues to be in material existence. So therefore to bring about the welfare of all the citizens, all the people of this world, Krishna vanquished the rule of the company of Duryodhana and established the rule of Maharaja Yudhishtira. He also wanted to protect Maharaja Pariksit who was lying in the embryo for the same reason. The successor to Yudhishtira is Pariksit Maharaj, the only surviving descendant in the entire Pandava era. He did not like the idea that the world should be without the Pandavas, the ideal family of devotees. Apandavam idam kartum. Apandavam. This Ashwathama wanted to finish off the last life in the Pandava family so that the world will be without any descendants of the Pandavas, but Krishna did not like that because he wanted pure devotees to rule the world and continue to successively rule. Their descendants who are also pure devotees should successfully rule the world. That's what Krishna wants. And even preaching Krishna consciousness is the only way to do that.

### Brahmastra, Nuclear Weapons, Discrimination

**Key Quote:** "Brahmastra is a fine weapon, which works on mantra the subtle sound vibration and only a trained person can actually release such a Astra by simply using a mantra ashwatthama discharge the brahmastra simply to kill the Pandavas"
**Summary:** The speaker compares the Brahmastra to nuclear weapons, highlighting its precision and lack of indiscriminate harm compared to atomic bombs.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Jai Vanarottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udhirayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 12th verse of the 8th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Taryevatha Munishreshtha Pandava Panchasayakan Atmanobhimukhan Deeptan Alaksya Astrani Upadaduhu. The meaning of this verse: all foremost among the great thinkers, munis, referring to Saunaka, seeing the glaring Brahmastra proceeding towards them, the Pandavas took up their five respective weapons. There was a description earlier that Uttara saw a fiery iron. She saw a fiery iron arrow coming towards her very fast, and she sought shelter of Lord Krishna to protect the embryo, to protect the child in the womb, in her womb. Now here the description is that not only that Astra was released by Ashwatthama to kill the child in the womb, but also it was aimed at killing the five Pandavas. So in the proportiona Pravapara explains, the Brahmastras are finer than the nuclear weapons. This has been discussed earlier. Brahmastra is a fine weapon, which works on mantra, the subtle sound vibration, and only a trained person can actually release such a Astra by simply using a mantra. Ashwatthama discharged the Brahmastra simply to kill the Pandavas, namely the five brothers headed by Maharaja Yudhishtira, and their only grandson was lying within the womb of Uttara, so the target of this Brahmastra which was released by Ashwatthama were six personalities: the five Pandavas and the only surviving descendant of the Pandavas, the grandson of Arjuna, that is Pariksit in the womb of his mother Uttara. Therefore, the Brahmastra, more effective and finer than the atomic weapons, was not as blind as the atomic bombs, even though a comparison is made here that the Brahmastra is something like a nuclear weapon or atomic bomb, but actually it is not blind. When a nuclear bomb is dropped somewhere, it kills so many people, including the innocent people who have nothing to do with war

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the Brahmastra's ability to specifically target individuals, making it impossible to hide from.

who are not any party to any particular fight between some people. So the damage done by atomic bomb or by nuclear weapons is too much, and what is very bad about it is that even the innocent people are unnecessarily killed. So it is said here, when the atomic bombs are discharged, they do not discriminate between the target and others. Atomic bombs don't discriminate; mainly the atomic bombs do harm to the innocent because there is no control. This is a fact. Innocent people are killed in huge numbers. The Brahmastra is not like that, not like the atomic bomb or not like the nuclear weapon. This Brahmastra marks out the target and proceeds accordingly without harming the innocent, so it's much finer. It is directed towards a specific target, and the astra will go searching for the target wherever the target may be. There is no possibility that somebody can hide themselves and protect themselves when a Brahmastra is released against them. No possibility of hiding and protecting, not possible, because it will search out wherever the target is.

So our understanding should be that Brahmastra is a very, very, very fine weapon. It is based on the appropriate mantra, and only qualified people or trained people can actually use such weapons, fine weapons, and it has got a very, very specific target or targets even, just like here, this Brahmastra released by Ashwathama, and the second time he is releasing the Brahmastra ever since the incident of killing the five sleeping sons of Draupadi. Since that incident, second time now Ashwathama is releasing the Brahmastra, and this time the target was specifically the five Pandavas

and the child in the womb of Uttara, the grandson of the Pandavas, Pariksha. The 13th verse, the meaning of this 13th verse: the Almighty personality of God is Shri Krishna, having observed that a great danger was befalling his unalloyed devotees who were fully surrendered souls, at once took up his sudarshan disc to protect them. Now you see the reaction of the Lord. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport elaborately, the Brahmastra, the supreme weapon released by Ashwatthama, was something similar to the nuclear weapon, but with more radiation and heat. This Brahmastra is the product of a more subtle science, being the product of the finer sound, a chapter recorded in the Vedas. In the Vedas, there are different mantras for different purposes, but the important aspect of mantras is all of them are sound vibrations which have got very, very specific purposes

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the Hare Krishna mantra with destructive mantras and emphasizes the importance of devotees' complete dependence on Krishna for protection.

purpose for being utilized in a particular way. Now the Hare Krishna mantra is also a mantra in the Vedas. It is mentioned in the Kali Santarana Upanishad, but this mantra, Hare Krishna mantra, is not meant for any destructive purpose. It is especially meant for self-realization, God realization, and therefore it is very, very, very special, this Hare Krishna mantra. Srila Prabhupada further says, "The advantage of this weapon is that it is not blind like the nuclear weapon." This was already discussed in the previous verse, because it can be directed only to the target and nothing else, so no harm to anybody else except the target. Ashwatthama released the weapon just to finish all the male members of Pandus family. Therefore, in one sense, it was more than dangerous than the atomic bombs because it could penetrate even the most protected place and would never miss the target. So there is no, as I explained in connection with the previous words, there is no possibility of missing the target or somebody hiding from this Brahmastra. That's not possible. Go searching for the target. Knowing all this, Lord Shri Krishna at once took up his personal weapon to protect his devotees who did not know anyone other than Krishna. See, ananya vishayatmana, that means the devotees who are totally dependent on Krishna, they have no other means of protection, though they may be very powerful warriors. The Pandavas are powerful warriors, but still as devotees they are simply dependent upon Krishna.

Knowing very well that all their powers are ultimately limited. Nobody can have unlimited power except the Supreme Lord, so to depend on the Supreme Lord is the most intelligent thing to do because the Lord can give complete protection against any danger, and the Lord is quite capable of doing that because he has got unlimited power, unlike the others who are always powerful by limitation. Now in the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna has clearly promised that his devotees are never to be vanquished. Kaunteya pratijaanihi na me bhakta pranasyati, my devotees are never vanquished.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how Krishna's actions are based on the degree of devotional service and the complete dependence of pure devotees like the Pandavas.

Bhagavad Gita. So devotees are always protected by Krishna when they actually learn to depend for protection upon the Supreme Lord only, exclusively on the Supreme Lord, and not any other means of protection. The Supreme Lord Krishna behaves in a way that is completely different from that of any other Lord according to the quality or degree of the devotional service rendered by the devotees. Now Krishna has got so many devotees and their devotional service is of different levels. Now here the word ananya vishayatmanam is significant. What does it mean? The Pandavas was cent percent dependent on the protection of the Lord, although they were all great warriors themselves. See the characteristic of pure devotees, they completely depend on Krishna even though they may be great warriors themselves. Now as far as the Supreme Lord is concerned, sometimes he neglects even the greatest of warriors, and sometimes he vanquishes all of them. As far as the Supreme Lord concerns, sometimes he negulates even the greatest of warriors and sometimes he vanquishes all of them.

But when the Lord saw that his devotees, his pure devotees, sent person dependent devotees, the Pandavas, there was danger for their life by the Brahmastra released by Ashwatthama, the Lord personally took up his own weapon at the risk of breaking his own vow. Krishna taken above, I will never take any weapon, but he thought it proper to actually take the weapon, his sudarshan chakra, in order to protect his devotees. He is known as bhaktavatsala, that means he is very, very affectionate to his devotees and he'll protect them at all costs because they are dependent on his centaurs.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 14th verse of the 8th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. अन्तस्थ सर्वभूतानाम् आत्मा योगेश्वरो हरिही स्वमायया आवुरुनोद गर्भं. The meaning of this verse is, the Lord of Supreme Mysticism, Yogeishvara Harihī, Shri Krishna, resides within everyone's heart as the Paramatma. As such, just to protect the progeny of the Kuru dynasty, he covered the embryo of Uttara by his personal energy. So what all is Shri Krishna doing? For the sake of his devotees, he is prepared to do anything and everything to protect them. So therefore, Shastras say, always depend on the Supreme Lord and nobody else. Even Krishna declares in the Bhagavad Gita, "You surrender to me alone, exclusively. Take my shelter exclusively." Because only Krishna is dependable for everyone. And nobody is his enemy. Nobody is his friend. He is the well-wisher of everyone.

Surdam Sarvabhutana. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, "The Lord of Supreme Mysticism, Yogeshwaro Harihi, can simultaneously reside within everyone's heart or even within the atoms by his Paramatma feature, his plenary portion." This Paramatma feature is a very special feature of the Supreme Lord in the material world only. Paramatma feature is the expansion of the Lord who has entered into the heart of every living being within this material existence and also entered into every material atom. So this Paramatma feature is a very, very special feature. Now it is mentioned here that Krishna is present as Paramatma in the heart of everyone. So therefore, it is said here, from within the body of Uttara, the mother of Pariksit, and Uttara had prayed to Krishna, "Please protect the child in my womb." So from within the body of Uttara, Lord Krishna covered the embryo to save Maharaj Pariksit and protect the progeny of Maharaj Kuru, of whom King Pandu was also a descendant. Kuru tantave, for the progeny of Maharaj Kuru. Pariksit is described as the progeny of Maharaj Kuru because this Pariksit was the only surviving descendant of the Pandavas

and even the only surviving descendant of the Kuru dynasty, because all others were vanquished in the battle. All the hundred sons of Dhritarashtra were killed in the battle. So there was no, and their children and their grandsons of Dhritarashtra, all of them were killed. So therefore, to save the only remaining descendant of the Kuru dynasty, the Supreme Lord from within the body of Uttara, covered the embryo. Now, in doing so, he engaged his personal energy. His personal energy is his internal potency, non-different from him, and that internal potency is supremely powerful, as powerful as Krishna himself. So nobody can do any harm when the Supreme Lord, by his personal energy, covers or protects somebody. In his own sense, the supreme authority doesn't matter. The Supreme Lord can do nothing, but He can change people in his own way. For example, if you take the Kuru dynasty of Viparaj, for example, the way it is called in the holy Gita, if you look at the rosary, the rosary of Viparaj, the rosary of Kuru, the rosary of Viparaj, the rosary of the Supreme Lord, the rosary of Viparaj, everything is changed. That is also a special thing. But though the Kurus, or they should be called the present generation of Kurus of the Kuru dynasty, but when there were some differences between the two families, the sons of Dhritarashtra were known as Kurus, where the sons of Pandu were known as Pandavas. See, this was particularly Dhritarashtra

It is explained in the first opening verse of the Bhagavad Gita itself, in the first chapter, first verse: Dharmakshetre Kurukshetre Samaveta Yuyutsavaha Mamaka Pandavas Jaiva Dhritarashtra, making a distinction between his own sons, and they are referred to as Kauravas, descendants of Kuru dynasty, but the Pandavas, they are also descendants, but they are not identified as descendants, they are separated from the family lineage. And this always was Dhritarashtra's plan. Somehow or other, he could not become the Emperor because he was born blind, so he wanted his sons to succeed in becoming the Emperor's reward. But Krishna had a different plan. Krishna wants his devotees to be ruling the world, only then people will get real benefit of a Krishna conscious ruler like Yudhishtira or Parichit. Since the sons and grandsons of Dhritarashtra were all killed in the battle of Kurukshetra, the last son of the dynasty is designated as the son of the Kurus, even though Parichit is the grandson of the Pandavas. And when the battle was going on, the Pandavas were identified as Pandavas, and Kauravas were the sons of Dhritarashtra were identified as Kauravas, the sons of Pandu were identified as Pandavas. They both are actually descendants of the Kuru dynasty, but now the last son of the dynasty, that is Parichit, is designated as the son of the Kuru's, Kuru tantave, for the progeny of Maharaja Kuru.

The meaning of this verse says, "Oh Shanaka, although the Supreme Brahmastra weapon released by Ashurthama was irresistible and without check or counteraction, it was neutralized and foiled when confronted by the strength of Vishnu, Lord Krishna." So several times this has been explained that the Brahmastra weapon is irresistible. Nobody can counteract a Brahmastra weapon except by another Brahmastra, and that also by one who is trained how to utilize the Brahmastra and how to counteract another Brahmastra. They should learn that specifically. Otherwise, it is irresistible and it is without any check or counteraction. But when this Brahmastra, which is very, very powerful, a subtle weapon, it was neutralized and foiled by the strength of Vishnu. The Supreme Lord Krishna personally covered the womb of Uttara and neutralized this Brahmastra, so it could not do any harm to the child Pariksit in the womb of Uttara, even though the target was fixed when Ashwatthama released. So in spite of the target being fixed and Brahmastra being irresistible, it was neutralized and foiled by the strength of the Supreme Lord Krishna. So the strength of the Supreme Lord is supreme strength, and no weapon or no other force

**Summary:** This segment explains that the Brahmajyoti, the transcendental effulgence, emanates from Krishna and is the source of the material creation.

can actually work against the protection of Vishnu or Krishna. Now in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "In the Bhagavad Gita it is said that the Brahmajyoti or the glowing transcendental effulgence is resting on Lord Sri Krishna." This is explained in the 14th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, the 27th verse: Brahmano hi pratishta aham. Krishna says, "I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman." Brahmajyoti, that is the effulgence emanating from the transcendental body of Krishna, and it covers the entire spiritual sky. It is the transcendental energy of the Supreme Lord, and that Brahmajyoti is the source of the entire material creation. Actually, it is sourced from Krishna, but through the Brahmajyoti. In other words, the glowing effulgence known as Brahmatejas is nothing but the rays of the Lord, just as the sun rays are rays of the sun disc.

**Key Quote:** "Everyone else is dependent on Krishna. But Krishna is not dependent on anyone else. Krishna is always independent. Krishna is absolute."
**Summary:** This segment reiterates that the Brahmastra cannot surpass Vishnu's strength and emphasizes Krishna's independence and absolute nature.

So this Brahmatejas which is described here: yadyapi astram brahma shiraha tu amogham cha apratikriyam vaishnavam teja asadya. Vaishnavam means in relation to Vishnu. This Brahmastra is actually materially irresistible, but it cannot surpass the supreme strength of Vishnu or Krishna. The weapon called Brahmastra released by Aswatthama was neutralized and foiled by Shri Krishna by his own energy. That is to say, he did not wait for any other's help because he is absolute. See, this distinction we should always note between the Supreme Lord and anyone else. Everyone else is dependent on Krishna, but Krishna is not dependent on anyone else. Krishna is always independent. Krishna is absolute. This distinction eternally exists between the Supreme Lord Krishna and everyone else in the entire creation, even in the spiritual world also. Nobody is equal to Krishna. Nobody is greater than Krishna. Asamordhva. So this is an eternal fact.

**Summary:** This segment clarifies the difference between the impersonal Brahman and the personal feature of Krishna, emphasizing that the individual soul (Anu Atma) is a tiny part of the Supreme Lord.

In fact, those who do not know about the personal feature of the absolute truth, they wrongly think that the impersonal feature, the Brahmajyoti or the Brahman feature of the absolute truth, is the same as the identity of the living being, the tiny living being, Anu Atma. That's what they think, which is completely wrong. Anu Atma is a tiny particle, a portion of the Supreme Lord, and the Supreme Lord is always supremely powerful, unlimitedly powerful, the source of everyone and everything, and his energy can never be equal with anything else. So that is being explained here.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 16th verse of the 8th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on the qualities of the Supreme Lord, specifically Ashtariya, Maya, and Achyuta.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 16th verse of the 8th chapter of 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. मा मम्स्था हेतद आश्चरियम् सर्वाश्चर्यमये अच्छुते यईदं मायया देव्या सुझति अवति हंति अजःहा. The meaning of this verse is, O Brahmanas, this is Suta Goswami addressing the sages of Naimisharanya. O Brahmanas! Do not think this to be especially wonderful in the activities of the mysterious and infallible personality of the Goddess. अश्चरियम्या तती लोड्ड वो स अल मिस्तेरियस् और अच्छुत. The Lord is described in so many ways according to His different characteristics. अच्छुत वो जहूंगीेमान के सिर आज बसे किएक्नेरा. So, qualities which are very unique to the Supreme Lord only. Here, Ashtariya, Maya, and Achyuta, two different qualities of the Supreme Lord are described.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the unlimited power of the Supreme Lord and how His actions are beyond human comprehension, foreshadowing the prayers of Queen Kunti.

Here, Ashtariya, Maya, and Achyuta, two different qualities of the Supreme Lord are described, because we think that he is a person like us, or he is a person a little more powerful than us. No, he is supremely powerful, he is unlimitedly powerful, he can never be compared with anybody else, he is incomparable, and he is absolute. He always is in that position of having the supreme power, always, eternally, it's a fact. So, therefore, this point, nothing is impossible for the Supreme Lord, but all his actions are wonderful for us, and thus he is always beyond the range of our conceivable limits.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces Queen Kunti's prayers as the main subject and discusses the unique perfection of Krishna compared to other expansions and living beings.

This will be explained in a future verse, which is a prayer offered, a series of prayers offered by Queen Kunti. That's the main subject of this chapter, prayers by Queen Kunti, but we're going to start discussing that from the next session, the prayers of Queen Kunti and the series of prayers, wonderful prayers. So, these prayers expressed by self-realized pure devotees clearly helps us understand what is the nature of the Supreme Lord. So, one of the things mentioned here is, the Supreme Lord's actions are always beyond the range of our conceivable limits. The Lord is the all-powerful, all-perfect personality of Godhead, all-powerful, all-perfect. There's no trace of any defect or any inebriety. The Lord is the Supreme Lord. The Lord is 100% perfect. Here, the Lord is referring to Krishna. Krishna is 100% perfect, whereas others, namely Narayana, Brahma, Shiva, the demigods, and all other living beings, possess only different percentages of such perfection. This is analyzed by the Goswamis of Vrindavan, the disciples of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, that only Krishna is 100% perfect.

As he started for home, Krishna finished his work of installing Yudhishthira Maharaj after the battle of Kurukshetra as the emperor of the world. Now he was going back to Dwaraka. So, while he was about to start for Dwaraka, Kunti approached Krishna and addressed him.

### Unalloyed Devotion, Karma and Jnana, Purity of Bhakti

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Pure devotion is completely independent of everything else."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's description of Kunti as a chaste devotee due to her unalloyed devotion, emphasizing the independence of pure bhakti from karma and jnana.

And there will be a series of prayers Kunti will offer to Krishna. In the purport, it is explained by Srila Prabhupada, Kunti is described here as a sati, or chaste, due to her unalloyed devotion to Lord Sri Krishna. This term is used by Prabhupada many times in the Bhagavad Gita. Unalloyed devotion. Unalloyed means it is 100% pure. There is no admixture of karma or jnana in such bhakti. Pure devotional service is described by Srila Prabhupada Swami as anyabila ashita shunyam jnana karmadi anavratam. jnana karmadi anavratam. It is unmixed with any jnana or karma, because karma and jnana without bhakti is never successful. Any pious activity anybody may do, if it is not mixed with a little bhakti, it will always be incomplete, unsuccessful, imperfect. Same thing with transcendental knowledge. Unless that is mixed with a little bhakti, it is always imperfect, incomplete. So, both karma and jnana are dependent on bhakti for a person to achieve perfection. But bhakti, which is pure bhakti, is independent of karma and jnana. Bhakti is never dependent on karma or jnana. Pure devotion is completely independent of everything else. So, therefore, Kunti is described as the most, the chaste lady, sati.

### Exclusive Dependence on Krishna, Protection
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/Hm1wVofDdeo?t=734
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna is the only protector."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that a pure devotee depends exclusively on Krishna for protection, not on other living beings or demigods, highlighting the importance of complete surrender.

A chaste devotee of the Lord does not look to others, namely any other living being or demigod, even for deliverance from danger. Typically, in the material world, we have got different sources for prayer, depending on the type of protection, depending on the type of danger, or depending on the type of problem we may face, or depending on the type of facilities we may have. We have so many sources of protection. We may have so many different dangers. The material world is always filled with dangers. Padam padam yat vipadam. But, for a pure devotee of Krishna, Krishna is the only protector. And, Krishna is the only protector means such a devotee never depends on another living being or another demigod. Never. So, this is very, very significant. Nobody else in the material world, other than a pure devotee, depends exclusively on Krishna. So, this is what we should learn from the Bhagavatam and from the lives of great devotees. And, from Krishna's own instructions, we should learn this, that we have no guarantee of 100% protection except when we learn to completely depend on Krishna. So, if at all you want full protection, under all circumstances, you should learn to depend on Krishna exclusively.

### Pandava Family, Reciprocal Relationship with Krishna, Imperfect Help

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "One should look for all help from Krishna alone, who is competent always to save his devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the Pandava family as an example of complete dependence on Krishna, explaining the reciprocal relationship and warning against seeking imperfect help from other sources.

Now, Krishna is there and also so many other people are there to protect me. No. So, Srila Prabhupada says here, that was all along the characteristic of the whole family of the Pandavas. It's not just true of Kunti. It's true of all the family members of the Pandavas, Pandava family. They knew nothing except Krishna, and therefore the Lord was also always ready to help them in all respects, in all circumstances. See, Krishna is always reciprocally giving protection or offering some help. If I depend completely on Krishna, then Krishna will protect me and help me always under all circumstances. But, if I am not so much completely dependent on Krishna, then Krishna will say, depending on who you want to take protection from, take protection from that source. And that is not guaranteed to protect us in all circumstances, other sources. So, therefore, one should not look for imperfect help from imperfect living beings or from demigods, but one should look for all help from Krishna alone, who is competent always to save his devotees. So, that is the conclusion.

**Key Quote:** "O Krishna, I offer my obeisances unto you because you are the original personality and are unaffected by the qualities of the material world. You are existing both within and without everything. Yet, you are not the original personality. You are invisible to all."
**Summary:** Explanation of the 18th verse of the 8th chapter, focusing on Kunti's understanding of Krishna as the original personality, present everywhere yet invisible to many.

So the 18th verse. The meaning of this verse is, Shri Mati Kunti said, O Krishna, I offer my obeisances unto you because you are the original personality and are unaffected by the qualities of the material world. You are existing both within and without everything. Yet, you are not the original personality. You are invisible to all. So, Kunti's 1st prayer in the series of prayers, she is offering obeisances to Krishna as she knows Krishna is not just her relative. Krishna is not just her brother's son, not just her nephew. But, Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the original personality who is always transcendentally situated, unaffected by material qualities, even when he descends to this material world. And one more thing she is telling here, Krishna exists both within and without everything, inside everything, outside of everything. Now, this is not easy. This is not easy to comprehend. And, she is also telling, in spite of you being present inside everything and outside of everything, still, you are not visible to everyone. You are invisible to all.

### Krishna's Supremacy, Prabhupada's Purport, Original Personality

**Key Quote:** "Shri Mati Kunti Devi was quite aware that Krishna is the original personality of Godhead, although he was playing the part of her nephew."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing that Krishna's supreme position remains unchanged even when he incarnates and plays a specific role.

So, Srila Prabhupada has written an elaborate purport for this. Let us try to hear from Prabhupada what he says. So, Prabhupada begins his purport by telling, Shri Mati Kunti Devi was quite aware that Krishna is the original personality of Godhead, although he was playing the part of her nephew. See, Krishna when he incarnates, he plays the part of a particular person and yet he remains the supreme personality of Godhead under all situations and circumstances. His absolute position, supreme position does not change even though he may appear to be like Krishna, younger than Kunti Devi, subordinate to somebody else, but his supreme position is unchanged because he is the original personality of Godhead. And Prabhupada further says, such an enlightened lady could not commit a mistake by offering obeisances to her nephew. Generally the etiquette is, they should not commit a mistake. The younger ones offer obeisances to the elders. But here Kunti, elderly lady, she is offering obeisances to somebody who is younger, many many years younger. So why? That is because Krishna is no ordinary person. He is the original personality of Godhead. Devi is addressing Krishna as the original Purusha beyond the material cosmos. We are all created beings within this material world, whereas Krishna exists beyond this material creation. He is beyond this material creation. And even beyond the material creation, though there are many many many liberated souls, devotees, Krishna is the original Purusha, original personality, original Lord. So that is Krishna's actual position.

### Transcendental Nature, Infallibility, Maya

**Key Quote:** "Although all living entities are also transcendental, they are neither original nor infallible."
**Summary:** Distinction between Krishna and other living entities, highlighting Krishna's original nature, infallibility (Achyuta), and control over Maya.

Now Srila Prabhupada says one very important thing here. Although all living entities are also transcendental, they are neither original nor infallible. We are also part of the spiritual world. We belong to the spiritual world. We are all transcendental entities, but we are not original. So we have our source in Krishna. Krishna is always our eternal controller, and we are eternally controlled. And one more point is, we are not infallible like Krishna. Krishna is called Achyuta. Achyuta means one who never falls down from his transcendental position, one who never comes under the clutches of Maya. How is that? Krishna is the controller of Maya, of the illusory energy. Eternally he is the controller, so he will never come under the clutches of Maya. So Krishna is called infallible, means one who never falls down into this material existence.

### Transcendental Birth, Incarnation, Control

**Verse References:** BG 4.9
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Even when he appears to take birth, He is merely coming from the spiritual world to give darshan to all of us."
**Summary:** Explanation of Krishna's transcendental birth (Janma karma chamaya divyam) and how it differs from the birth of ordinary living entities who fall under the influence of material nature.

So even when Krishna comes, he may appear to take birth like the son of Vasudeva and Devaki, but his birth is transcendental. Janma karma chamaya divyam. In the Bhagavad Gita this is explained in the fourth chapter, ninth verse. Janma karma chamaya divyam. Divyam means transcendental birth. What is the meaning of transcendental birth? That even when he appears to take birth, he is merely coming from the spiritual world to give darshan to all of us in the material world. He becomes visible. That's all. He is always present as the Supreme Lord. In that same position he appears. He incarnates. He takes birth in the same position. His position doesn't change. Now as opposed to Krishna, who never changes his position, the living entities are apt to fall down under the clutches of material nature. Whenever a living being who actually belongs to the spiritual world wants to independently enjoy, wants to materially enjoy, or wants to try to become independent of Krishna's control, such a living being is forced to come under the clutches of material nature. Krishna is not like that, never. He is always the Lord. He is the Lord of all living entities. He is the Lord of the material nature. He is the Lord of the spiritual nature. He is the Lord of Vaikuntha. He is the Lord of this material creation. He is the Lord of everyone and everything, always, eternally.

**Key Quote:** "He is the chief eternal among so many eternals. All the living entities are eternal. But Krishna is the chief eternal."
**Summary:** Krishna's position as the chief eternal (Nithyo Nithyanam) and supreme controller (Eeshwara), as described in the Vedas and Brahma Samhita.

So that is Krishna's position. In the Vedas, therefore, he is described, Krishna is described as, the chief among all living entities. Nithyo Nithyanam Chetanus Chetananam. In the Upanishad, Kathopanishad, this is stated. He is the chief eternal among so many eternals. All the living entities are eternal, but Krishna is the chief eternal. He is the supreme eternal being. And Chetanus Chetananam, he is the supremely conscious being among so many conscious living entities. That is Krishna's unique position. Now, Krishna is also addressed as Eeshwara. Eeshwaram Prakriteparam. Eeshwaram. Eeshwara here refers to controller. Now, the living beings also may have some position of control, just like Surya, Chandra, Indra, Varuna, Vayu, but they are not supreme Eeshwara. Supreme Eeshwara is only one. That is Krishna. Eeshwaraha, Paramaha, Krishna, Sachidananda, Vikraha. In the Brahma Samhita it is said, Param Eeshwara, Supreme Eeshwara. And Krishna is also, Eeshwara means the controller. He is the ultimate controller. He is the controller of all controllers. There is nobody above him. There is nobody equal to him. Asamordhva. This is Krishna's position.

**Summary:** Explanation of Krishna's presence within everyone's heart as the Supersoul (Param Atma), and how He is the source of remembrance, knowledge, and the ultimate goal of Vedic knowledge.

Now, Krishna was present before Kunti Devi and all the others who had assembled to see him off. But, Kunti knew that, even though he is present in front of her, he is also seated in her heart. He is also seated in everybody's heart as a super soul. So, in the Bhagavad Gita this is confirmed. Kunti Devi is telling, you are present within everyone, and also you are present outside of everyone. So, how is it possible to understand this? That is explained by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, 15th chapter, 15th verse. Sarvasya Chaham Rudi Sanni Vishto. I am seated in everyone's heart as the Param Atma, super soul. And, only due to Krishna do we get remembrance, knowledge, and gratefulness. Matthaha Smritir Gyanam Apohanamcha. And, through all the Vedas, I am to be known. Vedaischa Sarvair Ahameva Vedyam. The Vedas, so many subject matters are discussed in the Vedic literature, but the aim is to know who is Krishna, who is the ultimate source of everything, who is the ultimate controller of everyone and everything. And, that is declared as Krishna. And, Krishna is the compiler of the Vedas, and he is the knower of the Vedas. So, this is the unique position of Krishna.

### All-Pervading vs. Localized, Surrender, Recognition of Krishna

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is both he is all-pervading is also localized but in spite of being present every day he is standing before the Kunti Devi"
**Summary:** Discussion on how Krishna is both all-pervading and localized, and how only surrendered souls can truly recognize Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Hmm. Kuntidevi experienced that, even though Krishna was present outside, still, when the child in the womb of Uttara was in danger of being attacked by a Brahmastra released by Ashwathama, Krishna immediately entered the womb of Uttara to save the child from the attack of Ashwatthama's Brahmastra. So Kunti Devi actually herself was puzzled, is Krishna all-pervading or is localized? What do the meaning of all-pervading? He is present everywhere, but actually localized means he's in a specific place, particular place, just like he's standing in front of Kunti them in Hastinapura is present in front of Kunti. So easy localized or easy all-pervading? So the answer is Krishna is both. He is all-pervading, he is also localized. But in spite of being present every day, he is standing before the Kunti Devi saying you would be some 20, 30 minutes everywhere. In spite of being present within everything, in spite of being present outside, just like I can see you or you can see me, like that everybody when Krishna incarnated could have seen Krishna, but still he reserves the right of not being exposed to persons who are not surrendered souls. Those who are not surrendered, when they see Krishna, they see him as another ordinary person. They seem as another ordinary person. They cannot recognize, oh, here is the supreme personality of God. So how is it that they're not able to recognize that? We expand in the next words. So I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

### Krishna's Transcendence, Deluding Energy (Maya), Spiritual vs. Material Energy

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna is beyond the range of our senses to perceive. Krishna's form is completely spiritual."
**Summary:** This segment explains how Krishna is beyond the perception of our limited senses due to His spiritual nature and how He is covered by deluding energy (Maya), both material and spiritual, which bewilders living entities.

The meaning of this verse is, being beyond the range of limited sense perception, you are the eternally irreproachable factor covered by the curtain of deluding energy. You are invisible to the foolish observer, exactly as an actor dressed as a player is not recognized. So, some words which are maybe not easily understandable, let me try to explain them in a little more easily understandable way. Being beyond the range of limited sense perception. With sense perception, sense perception means with our senses, we are seeing, hearing, smelling, touching, tasting, perception, we are perceiving. We are getting knowledge from outside through these five senses. Krishna is beyond this range of our senses to perceive. Because Krishna's form is completely spiritual. So, these eyes cannot see spiritual form. These ears cannot hear spiritual sound. You see, that's why Krishna's personality is totally spiritual. And therefore, he is beyond the range of limited sense perception. Krishna is also described as the eternally irreproachable. In your case, Krishna is the irreproachable factor. Irreproachable means faultless. Krishna is eternally faultless. Whereas, one of the qualities of every living being is, the living being being very, very limited. Every living being being very limited is prone to commit mistakes. This is one of the characteristics of every living being. Even though, such great personalities like big big devatas, they also sometimes commit mistakes, so nobody is eternally faultless except Krishna. So, therefore Krishna is described here as eternally irreproachable factor, eternally faultless, and he is also covered by a curtain of deluding energy, maya javanika chanam. Maya javanika means curtain. Maya means of the curtain made up of the deluding energy. Deluding energy means that energy which bewilders us. Krishna is covered by a curtain of deluding energy. Krishna has got two kinds of energies which bewilders us. One kind of energy is the material energy which bewilders us, the maha maya. And another kind of energy Krishna has got which is called yoga maya, the spiritual energy that is also bewildering for every every living being. Both the spiritual energy which is personal energy of Krishna and Krishna's material energy, both are bewildering for the living entities. Of course, those who are pure devotees, they are never bewildered by the material energy.

**Summary:** This segment discusses how Krishna is covered by Yogamaya, making Him invisible to foolish observers, and uses the analogy of an actor in a drama to illustrate how Krishna's true identity is concealed from those lacking spiritual knowledge.

And those who are non-devotees, they are subject to the bewilderment by even the material energy. Now, the bewilderment by the spiritual energy, Yogamaya, is meant for devotees to engage in pure devotional service of Krishna. And the bewilderment of non-devotees due to the material energy is facilitating the non-devotees to be able to think falsely that they are independent, they are the lord, or they are controllers, or to think that there is no God, or to be ignorant about Krishna. All this is the effect of the bewilderment due to the material energy only upon non-devotees. So, here Kunti Devi is telling Krishna is always covered by the curtain of Yogamaya. Now, how is it that Krishna is always covered by the curtain of Yogamaya? Invisible to the foolish observer. To those who are enlightened spiritually, Krishna is not invisible. They are able to see Krishna very clearly always because Krishna is always present, eternally present. But those who are foolish people who don't have spiritual knowledge, who don't have spiritual enlightenment, for them Krishna is always invisible. Now the example is given by Kunti Devi here, even when Krishna incarnates, foolish people cannot see him as the supreme lord. Now, why is it like that? Kunti Devi says, just like an actor who is dressed in a particular drama for playing a particular role in a drama, he is not recognized by the people who is the person who is playing this role. Of course, this is understandable if you go back in time

**Key Quote:** "people will who are watching that particular drama they will not be able to say who is this person who is dressed like a king even though that person may be known to the people who are watching"
**Summary:** The speaker continues the actor analogy, explaining how people may know the actor outside the play, but not recognize him in his role, similarly, people fail to recognize Krishna in His various incarnations.

that formerly when there used to be a drama performance on the stage, a dramatic artist, a dramatic actor, he will have a makeup and he will speak, move, etc., exactly as what the role demands. Supposing an actor has to play the role of a king, he will dress up like a king, he will talk like a king, he will walk like a king, his voice will be very deep like that of a king, even though in ordinary life he will be just another ordinary person. So, he is using his acting skill to play a role of a king. And when he actually appears on the stage, people who are watching that particular drama, they will not be able to say who is this person who is dressed like a king, even though that person may be known to the people who are watching the drama outside the stage. They may be known to him. Uh, the actor may be known to them. Okay, they may have actually seen a text, they may have recognized that somebody who's dressed like a king, but they cannot recognize who is this person who is dressed like us. Exactly like that, Krishna when he appears as the son of Vasudeva or his Rama, Narsimha, Varaha, people who are don't have spiritual enlightenment, foolish observers, they cannot recognize here is God, they cannot have greatest. So, in the purport, Sri Lakravapalyee explains

### Krishna's Supremacy, Less Intelligent Persons, Putana Example

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So, the ordinary people, they think Krishna is another ordinary man. No, Krishna is not another ordinary person. He is the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** This segment quotes the Bhagavad Gita to emphasize that less intelligent people mistake Krishna for an ordinary man, and then uses the story of Putana to illustrate Krishna's extraordinary power even as an infant.

Somebody stated in the Bhagavad Gita that less intelligent persons mistake Krishna to be an ordinary man. He says, avajananti mamurha manushin tanum ashritam. Bhagavad Gita 9th chapter, 11th verse. Krishna says that. So, the ordinary people, they think Krishna is another ordinary man. No, Krishna is not another ordinary person. He is the Supreme Lord. He is never without his power. He is never without his opulences. He is never minus the opulences. No. Kunti is now confirming this point that is described in the Bhagavad Gita. Less intelligent persons, who are the less intelligent persons? Those who rebel against the authority of Krishna. They are the less intelligent persons. They are called asuras. Asuras generally want to go against the authority established by the Supreme Lord in this world, in the material world. When the Lord appears as Rama, Narasimha, Varaha, Vamana, any of the transcendental incarnations of the Lord, or even as Krishna, then he performs so many activities which are impossible to be performed by any person of this world, by any human being, or even any devata. They cannot perform. Now, in the tenth canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam, it is clearly explained that Krishna exhibited extraordinary power even when he was lying on the lap of his mother Yashoda as a small child, infant, not child, infant, just born. Say about ten days after Krishna took birth, he was attempted to be killed by one Putana. But when Putana came to breastfeed Krishna with her breast milk, she had severe deadly poison on her breast. And Krishna, he sucked out her life. When she tried to feed him poison through her breast milk, Krishna sucked out her life air. So, it is not possible for anybody of this world to suck out another person's adult's life air, prana, suck out the prana. And instantaneously, Putana died. Instantaneously.

### Krishna's Superhuman Activities, Govardhan Hill Lifting, Bhagavad Gita Instructions, Authority of Great Personalities

**Key Quote:** "Exactly like that, Krishna picked up the huge Govardhan hill and held it up like an umbrella to protect the residents of Vrindavan."
**Summary:** This segment describes Krishna's superhuman activities, such as lifting Govardhan Hill, delivering the Bhagavad Gita, and being accepted as the Supreme Lord by various authorities, reinforcing Kunti's assertion of Krishna's supremacy.

Now, when he was a small boy, seven years old, playfully he lifted the Govardhan hill on his little left finger. Now, as easily as a child picks up a mushroom, small mushroom, a child, sometimes children when they play in rainy season, there are mushrooms growing. They pick up that mushroom and hold it like an umbrella. Krishna apparently was holding the Govardhan hill on his little left finger as an umbrella for protecting the residents of Vrindavan when there was a torrential rain sent by Indra. But he did it as effortlessly as a child picks up a small mushroom and can effortlessly hold it. Exactly like that, Krishna picked up the huge Govardhan hill and held it up like an umbrella to protect the residents of Vrindavan. So, these type of superhuman activities of Krishna are described in the tenth canto of the Bhagavatam. And even the activities of Lord Rama, Lord Varaha, Lord Narasimha, they are all described in the authentic scriptures. Now, Krishna has also delivered marvelous instructions. In the Bhagavad Gita, he spoke to Arjuna 45 minutes. When the battle was about to begin, Arjuna became bewildered. And Krishna removed his illusion by speaking Bhagavad Gita and enlightening Arjuna and through Arjuna all of us. So, that is only possible for Krishna. That cannot be done by anybody else. So, and Krishna is accepted as a very very great personality, the supreme personality by such authorities as Vyasa, Devala, Asita, Narada, Madhvacharya, Ramanujacharya, Shankaracharya, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Jeeva Goswami. All great personalities, they have accepted Krishna as the supreme lord. So, therefore, Kunti's asserting that Krishna is the supreme lord is perfectly accurate.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces Queen Kunti's prayer and explains that she is a pure devotee who recognizes Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deviim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet In this session, we will be discussing from the 20th verse of the 8th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The topic of this 8th chapter is primarily the prayers by Queen Kunti. This is the third prayer by Queen Kunti, the third verse expressing her devotion to Krishna. Tathā paramahamsānām munīnām amalātmanām bhakti-yoga-vidhānārthaṁ kathaṁ paśye mahi-striyahā The meaning of this verse is: You yourself descend to propagate the transcendental signs of devotional service unto the hearts of the advanced transcendentalists and mental speculators who are purified by being able to discriminate between matter and spirit. How then can we women know you perfectly?

**Key Quote:** "Krishna descends to propagate the transcendental signs of devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that even intelligent people who can discriminate between matter and spirit may not understand Krishna without devotional service, which is propagated by Krishna and his pure devotees.

So, Kunti Devi is actually a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, she is able to recognize Krishna as not just her relative, but as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In spite of Kunti Devi being able to recognize Krishna, she is helping us understand that those who are not devotees, they cannot recognize Krishna. They are not able to identify, here is the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So, therefore, in this particular verse, Kunti Devi is saying, Krishna descends to propagate the transcendental signs of devotional service. And such knowledge is even required to be given to the advanced transcendentalists, to very, very intelligent people who are purified by being able to discriminate between matter and spirit. See, there are two things in this world, matter and spirit. All living beings are spirit. So, they belong to the solar system, this category of spiritual energy, and everything else that we see around us, all material things, they are made of matter, material energy. So, there is a very, very big difference between matter and spirit, and it's not easy to discriminate like that. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita, the difficulty for an ordinary person to discriminate between matter and spirit. Only the very, very intelligent people who are able to analyze every single thing, what is its fundamental nature, whether it is matter or is it something different than matter, which is something which is not matter, spirit. So, if even the most intelligent people who can discriminate between matter and spirit, even they are unable to understand the personality of Godhead because they are not conversant with devotional service, the science of devotional service, so such science of devotional service is propagated by Krishna himself

**Key Quote:** "even for the greatest philosopher Krishna remains the supreme unknown"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how even great philosophical speculators cannot access the Lord and that Krishna is beyond the thinking power of even the greatest philosophers.

when he descends in this world or by Krishna's pure devotees who also descend for the same purpose, just like Prabhupada has come to teach us the actual science of devotional service. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu came for the same purpose. Chaitanya's pure devotees come for the same purpose. So now Kunti Devi is considering the position of ordinary people, how can they understand or know Krishna perfectly? So now, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains even the greatest philosophical speculators cannot have access to the region of the Lord. Lord here means the supreme Personality of Godhead. Why? Why is it so? Because it is said in the Upanishads that the supreme truth, the absolute personality of Godhead, is beyond the range of the thinking power of the greatest philosopher, avaam manasa kochara. Even if the Upanishads describe who or what is the absolute truth in so many words, still even for the greatest philosopher, Krishna remains the supreme unknown.

### Krishna's mercy, women's devotion, sincerity

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is knowable only by one who has got Krishna's mercy"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna is knowable only through his mercy and that women, in general, have an advantage because they readily believe in the Lord's superiority and offer obeisances without reservation.

Krishna remains like that. So therefore, Srila Prabhupada says Krishna is unknowable by great learning or by the greatest brain. Then Krishna is unknowable even by the greatest learned person. Then what is the way to know Krishna? That is explained by Srila Prabhupada as Krishna is knowable only by one who has got Krishna's mercy. That's the only way to know Krishna. Krishna has to reveal himself when he shows his mercy upon a particular person. Only then such person on whom Krishna's mercy is being showered, such a person can know Krishna by revelation. Others may go on thinking about him for years together, yet he is unknowable. This is a fact. So this fact is corroborated by the Queen, Queen Kunti, who is playing the part of an innocent woman. Kunti Devi as a pure devotee has nothing to do with this material world. All pure devotees belong to the spiritual world. Then why are pure devotees here in this world? They are here to actually show us the way of devotional pure devotion is served by their own actions, by their own words. Kunti Devi as a pure devotee is now describing Krishna, Krishna's position. So, Srila Prabhupada says there are some categories of people who in this material world are not able to speculate and think very deeply, analyze things in an intelligent way, they don't have that capability. So, it is mentioned by Srila Prabhupada in the purport here, women in general are unable to speculate like philosophers, but they are blessed by the Lord because they believe at once in the superiority and all mightiness of the Lord. See, this is one advantage women have over men in general. Of course, this is speaking women as a class. So, they are not as intelligent as great philosophers in order to speculate who or what is the absolute truth, but they have a special quality. What is that? They believe at once in the superiority and all mightiness of the Supreme Lord. And therefore, women in general, they offer obeisances to the Supreme Lord without any reservation.

### obeisances, sincerity, Krishna's kindness, religious functions

**Key Quote:** "If somebody bows down to Krishna without reservation, yes, my dear Lord, you are the Almighty."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of bowing down to Krishna with sincerity and notes that women often participate more in religious functions, highlighting the effectiveness of simple acceptance over showy religious fervor.

Now, this is a very important qualification for somebody to actually know and understand Krishna's personality. If somebody bows down to Krishna without reservation, yes, my dear Lord, you are the Almighty. You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I bow down to you. So, Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, So, that fourth point, You bow down to me, offer your obeisances to me. That is being pointed out by Srila Prabhupada. Women very easily, they agree to bow down to the Supreme Lord Krishna because he is the Almighty Supreme Lord. And because of this reason, Srila Prabhupada says, The Supreme Lord is so kind that he does not show special favor only to a great philosopher. As is mentioned in the verse, he knows the sincerity of purpose. Therefore, it is observed generally that in any religious function, women assemble in great numbers as compared to men. And this is not true just in some particular place or some particular sect of some religion, no. In every country and in every sect of religion, it appears that the women are more interested than the men in such religious functions where there is an assembly of religious minded people. This simplicity of acceptance of the Lord's authority is more effective than showy insincere religious fervor. Men may try to show off. We are great religionists. Or they may try to speculate or try to analyze or try to reason out. But it's not easy for them to understand Krishna. Krishna is beyond the range of understanding of even the most learned or greatest philosophers. But when women bow down with sincerity to the Supreme Lord, then Krishna reveals himself to such sincere souls without any discrimination. Without any discrimination. For Krishna, every living being is important as a spirit soul, as his own part and parcel. Krishna does not see the external bodily features.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna reveals himself to such sincere souls without any discrimination."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna sees the soul within the body and that sincere souls, especially women who readily bow down, can easily receive Krishna's mercy and understand him.

Krishna does not see that. And why these different bodies? Only because the particular soul who is interested in enjoying this material world is given a particular body suitable for the enjoyment. So whether it is a body of a woman or a man or a devata or an animal or a bird or an insect or a reptile or whatever, 8,400,000 different varieties of bodies. But these are just meant for accommodating the desires to enjoy in this world. But as Krishna is concerned, he sees every living being within the body, whatever be the external form. He sees the living being who is actually a spirit soul, spiritual by nature, completely different from the body. Krishna sees the soul. And that is also the vision of pure devotees. They see living beings as spirit souls trapped in a body, trapped in a misconception that they are seeking some material enjoyment in different ways. So it is important that to understand Krishna is easily accessible for the sincere soul who follows Krishna's instructions, the instructions of the devotional literature in simply approaching the Deity form of the Lord and just bowing down, Krishna, you are the Supreme Lord and I offer my respectful, sincere obeisances to you just because you are the Supreme Lord and you deserve the greatest respect in this world. So just this alone is enough for Krishna to reveal himself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead to a sincere soul. And in this regard, women are fortunate because without wasting time in trying to speculate and differentiate between matter and spirit and trying to philosophize, they simply bow down and they are recipients very easily of Krishna's mercy by which they can understand Krishna. I will stop here.

**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam 1.8.21, focusing on Queen Kunti's prayers and the significance of the names used to address Krishna.

Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya, Narayanam Namaskritya, Naram Chai Vanarottamam, Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session we will be discussing from the 21st verse of the 8th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, continuing the prayers by Queen Kunti. Krishnaaya Vasudevaya Devaki Nandanayacha, Nanda Gopakumaraya Govindaya Namo Namaha. The meaning of this verse is, Let me therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto the Lord, who has become the son of Vasudhara, Vasudeva, the pleasure of Devaki, the boy of Nanda, and the other cowherd men of Vrindavan, and the enlivener of the cows and the senses.

**Key Quote:** "Govinda means one who is enlivener of the cows and the senses."
**Summary:** The lecture elaborates on the meanings of Krishna's names as used in the verse, including Vasudeva, Devaki Nandana, Nandagopakumaraya, and Govinda, emphasizing Krishna's role as the enlivener of cows and senses.

Now every name referred to by Queen Kunti is very meaningful. So, Krishnaaya, the Supreme Lord Krishna, who is Vasudevaya, he has appeared as the son of Vasudeva, therefore he is called Vasudeva. So, Kunti is identifying this personality who has appeared as the son of Vasudeva, and therefore called Vasudeva, he is actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna. Krishnaaya Vasudevaya Devaki Nandanayacha, he is also identified as the son of Devaki, Devaki. He appeared as the son of Devaki and Vasudeva, Devaki as his mother and Vasudeva as his father. So, therefore Devaki Nandana, another name for Krishna. He is the same Supreme Lord who has appeared as the son of Devaki and Vasudeva. He is not an ordinary person, his birth is not ordinary, it is transcendental. Then, Nandagopakumaraya, Nandagopakumaraya, Nandagopakumaraya, Nandamaharaj was the king of the cowherd men in Vrindavan. So, Krishna also appeared as the son of Nandamaharaj and Yashodhamayi, as the cowherd woman, wife of Nandamaharaj in Vrindavan. So, he is also identified as Nandagopakumaraya, Kumara means a small boy, five-year-old boy. So, Krishna appeared as a cowherd boy also, as the son of Nanda and Yashoda. And, he is Govindaya Namo Namaha, Govinda. Govinda means one who is enlivener of the cows and the senses. This Go, the word Go means the senses, Go also means the cows. So, the cows and senses are enlivened by Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "No material position is, or material assets are qualification for understanding Krishna."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how the senses are enlivened by contact with Krishna and emphasizes that material qualifications are insufficient for understanding Krishna.

Whenever the senses come in contact with Krishna or the cows, when they are in touch with Krishna, they become enlivened. That's why Krishna as the cowherd boy is always tending the cows. That's a very, very special thing. A very, very special relationship of love between Krishna and the cows. Or, between Krishna and the devotees whose senses are very nicely engaged in devotional service to Krishna because of which the senses become enlivened. So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport that the Supreme Lord, as has been explained in the previous verse by Kunti Devi, is unapproachable by any material assets. Whatever be the material qualification of any person in any position in this material world, those material assets are useless when it comes to understanding the personality of Krishna. I may be a very great philosopher, but that doesn't qualify me to know and understand the personality of Krishna. I may be the most charitable, beneficent person, that doesn't qualify me to understand Krishna. I may be a very powerful devata, that doesn't qualify me to understand Krishna. No material position is, or material assets are qualification for understanding Krishna.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "He comes in His original form just for the sake of showing special mercy upon His pure devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna appears out of unbounded mercy to devotees and to diminish the disturbances caused by demoniac persons, ultimately protecting the devotees.

Then how can Krishna be understood? He is understood when out of His unbounded and causeless mercy He comes down to this earth as He is. He comes in His original form. When we say Krishna, He appears in His original form. Not that He is assuming a human-like form. No. He is coming in His original form. His original form resembles a human-like form. But it is not a human form. It is not a material form. It is not a human form. And He does so just for the sake of showing special mercy upon His pure devotees. Pure devotees. Krishna wants to show His causeless mercy. Unbounded. That means there is no limit to how much mercy He showers on His pure devotees. Unlimited mercy. And also He appears to diminish the upsurges of the demoniac persons. These demons, they become too much troublesome. They want to create havoc in the life of religious people or saintly persons or law-abiding citizens. These demoniac persons, they are law-breakers. They are against God in general. They are sometimes too materialistic or they are atheistic or they are openly against God, like that. So all such demoniac persons when they become too much of a disturbance and they create too much trouble for the saintly persons, for the devotees, then Krishna appears and Vinashaya Chidushkrutam He destroys, He kills them and protects the devotees.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Therefore, Krishna is more merciful than Rama."
**Summary:** This section compares Krishna's incarnation to other incarnations, particularly Rama, highlighting Krishna's greater accessibility and mercy, especially in Vrindavan where everyone can approach and serve Him.

Now, Srila Prabhupada says, Queen Kunti specifically adores the incarnation or descent of Lord Krishna above all other incarnations. Krishna appears in many, many different incarnations: Rama, Varaha, Narsimha, Vamana, etc. But among all the incarnations of the Supreme Lord, the one and only Supreme Lord, the incarnation in His original form as He is, the incarnation of Krishna is the topmost. Why? Because in this particular incarnation, Krishna is very easily approachable by everyone. So Prabhupada compares in the incarnation of Rama, He remained a king's son and from His very childhood, He became a king's son. But in the incarnation of Krishna, although He appeared as the son of a king, son of King Vasudeva, He at once left the shelter of His real father and mother, Vasudeva and Devaki, and went to the lap of Yashoda Mai to play the part of an ordinary cowherd boy in the holy land of Vrindavan. And that Vrindavan has become sanctified because of Krishna performing His childhood pastimes there, which are very, very, very pleasing to all devotees. Therefore, Krishna is more merciful than Rama. The incarnation of Krishna is more merciful than the incarnation of Rama. Why? In Vrindavan, everyone is a devotee of Krishna. Everyone can approach Krishna. Not only the parents of Krishna, Yashoda Mai and Nanda Maharaj, but the cowherd boys, the cows, the peacocks, the birds, the bees, the river Yamuna, the trees, the plants, the insects, every creature in Vrindavan is able to directly approach Krishna and actually render service to Him. In whatever way they can, they render service in their own way. And Krishna accepts it very, very mercifully. That is Krishna's greatness. So therefore, the scriptures declare Krishna's incarnation is the topmost because He is easily approachable

**Summary:** The lecture discusses Kunti's affectionate relationship with Krishna and contrasts it with the greater fortune of Nanda and Yashoda, who experienced Krishna's childhood pastimes, further explaining the concept of Krishnaloka and Gokula Vrindavan.

by everyone. Now, Srila Prabhupada also points out Krishna was very kind to Kunti's brother Vasudeva because he appeared as the son of Vasudeva. Now, because he appeared as the son of Vasudeva, Kunti was able to have that affectionate relationship with Krishna as being Krishna's aunt, father's sister. So, Kunti is able to address Krishna in paternal affection. She has all different kinds of relationships between the Supreme Lord and the devotee. So here, Kunti is able to affectionately address Krishna as her relative. But, Nanda and Yashoda are more fortunate because they could relish the childhood pastimes of Krishna which Vasudeva, Devaki, Kunti, they could not relish. They could not relish the childhood pastimes of Krishna. And among the childhood pastimes of Krishna, of course, all the childhood pastimes of Krishna and Vrindavan are very special. They are described by Srila Prabhupada here as prototypes of his eternal pastimes in original Krishnaloka. Krishna has got his personal abode in the spiritual world. That's called Chintamani Dhamma, Vrindavan Dhamma, Goloka Dhamma, different names, same abode of Krishna, Krishnaloka. But that Krishnaloka, eternally Krishna's pastimes is covered by or going on. And Krishna sometimes comes to this world to display those pastimes, the replica of those pastimes he enacts in this earthly planet, in the tract of land called Rajabhoomi, Rajabhoomi, Gokula Vrindavan. So there are two Vrindavans, Goloka Vrindavan in the spiritual world and Gokula Vrindavan on this earth planet. But Gokula Vrindavan is not material. It is completely spiritual. Though ordinary eyes see it as a material, another material place, but actually it is not

a material place. Now Krishna comes to Gokula Vrindavana with all his spiritual entourage and paraphernalia. Now Krishna's mother, Yashoda Mai, she also belongs to Krishnaloka. But she also comes. Nanda Maharaji belongs to Krishnaloka but he also comes. The covered boys, Shridham and Madhumangala, all the covered boys, they belong to the spiritual world but they also come with Krishna. That is for Krishna to display his wonderful, loving pastimes with all his devotees. And Krishna is inviting us, come, join me, come with me to Krishnaloka and enjoy pastimes like these covered boys are enjoying with me, like the covered men and covered women, the eternal associates are enjoying.

### spiritual form, distinguishing features of the Lord, limitations of intelligence

**Key Quote:** "All such classes of people are unfit by intelligence to understand transcendental subject matter concerning the spiritual name, fame, attributes, forms, etc. of the supreme absolute truth."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's purport, explaining the specific marks on the Lord's transcendental body that distinguish Him from other spiritual beings, and discusses the limitations of certain classes of people (women, shudras, and dvijabandhus) in understanding transcendental knowledge.

In the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, Here are some of the specific symbolical marks on the spiritual body of the Personality of Godhead, which distinguishes his body from the bodies of all others. We often hear the Supreme Lord has got transcendental spiritual form, Satchidananda vigraha, but his spiritual form is distinctly different from the spiritual form of the other devotees in the spiritual world. All the inhabitants have spiritual form, all the devotees spiritual word, only the Supreme Lord and his devotees, nobody else is there, everyone is devotee, but specifically there are some marks on the transcendental form or body of the Lord which distinguish him from the spiritual bodies of all others. So what are those specific marks are being described, four of them are described in this words, these marks are all special features of the body of the Lord, even though there is similarity in the form of the Lord and the living beings, the spiritual form, you're talking with the spiritual form, not the material form, these spiritual forms are similar, but still there are differences. The Lord may appear as one of us, but he is always distinct by his specific bodily features. These features of the Supreme Lord distinguish him from the other living entities. Krishna's original form is a form which looks like a human form, but it is not a human form, it is completely transcendental original form of the Supreme Lord. Srimati Kunti claims herself unfit to see the Lord because of her being a woman, in a previous shloka she stated so Katham pasye mahi sriyeha this was the prayer by Queen Kunti in her previous verse this is claimed because women, superderas, that is thedes i worker-class people and the vizha Bandhu's, who are the vizha Bandhu's, the wretched descendants of the hierarchy classes, they don't come up to theまだ dika qualities or qualifications of the twice born, though they are taken birth in such a family. All such classes of people are unfit by intelligence to understand transcendental subject matter concerning the spiritual name, fame, attributes, forms, etc. of the supreme absolute truth.

### understanding Vedas, archavigraha, mercy of the Lord

**Key Quote:** "So, the archamurthi, the archavigraha, the transcendental form of the deity who descends on the material world just to distribute favors to the fallen souls."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami clarifies that the inability of certain groups to understand the Vedas refers to their limited intelligence in grasping transcendental subjects, and explains how the Lord descends as the archavigraha (deity form) to bestow mercy upon all fallen souls.

Now, this is a very, very specific description here. When it is said, sthreeshudra dvijabandhunam trai na sruthi gochara that sthreeshudra and dvijabandhu are unable to understand the sruthi, the Vedas. What does it mean? It means that they don't have sufficient intelligence to understand the transcendental subject matter concerning the spiritual name, spiritual form, spiritual attributes, qualities of the supreme absolute truth, Krishna. That is the sense in which it is said. That is a specific point that is made. Such persons, although they are unfit to enter into spiritual affairs of the Lord, can see him as the archavigraha. Archavigraha means the worshipable deity form, the archamurthi in the temples, especially in the temples. So, the archamurthi, the archavigraha, the transcendental form of the deity who descends on the material world just to distribute favors to the fallen souls. So, this archamurthi or archavigraha or the deity form is an incarnation of the supreme Lord in the material world who appears in a form which we can see with ordinary eyes, the deity form. So, the Lord descends or comes down to this material world to distribute favors to the fallen souls, including the above-mentioned women, shudras and vijabandhus. He comes specifically for favoring these people who are unfit, who don't have sufficient intelligence, who do not take interest in spiritual subject matter, who are in that sense unfortunate, but even they can become fortunate by simply visiting the temple and having darshan of the Lord. Because such fallen souls cannot see anything beyond matter, the Lord condescends to enter into each and every one of the innumerable universes as the garbhodaka shayi vishnu who grows a lotus stem from the lotus-like depression in the center of his transcendental abdomen. And thus Brahma, the first living being in the universe, is born. See, the Lord's mercy upon us is that he personally comes. Here condescends means he agrees

**Key Quote:** "See, the Lord's mercy upon us is that he personally comes."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the Lord's mercy in descending to the material world and sending His pure devotees, and describes the various forms of the archavigraha made from different elements, highlighting the significance of lotus flowers in worship.

to come down to our level. We are in a lower level. We are in the material world. We are fallen souls. But he comes down. Though he has nothing to do with this material world, he doesn't belong to the material world. He belongs to the spiritual world. He is always in transcendence. But even when he comes down, he is unaffected by the material energy. He remains in transcendence. That is very, very important to understand, to note. So, he comes down personally. And he sends his pure devotees like Srila Prabhupada also, who also come down, who don't belong to this world. They belong to the spiritual world eternally. But they come down for the sake of delivering the fallen souls. The Lord also comes down for delivering the fallen souls. Therefore, the Lord is known as Pankajanabhi. The depression in the center of his transcendental abdomen, which is like a lotus. That is why he is called Pankajanabha. The Pankajanabhi Lord accepts the Archavigraha. His transcendental form in different elements, namely a form within a mind, a form made of wood, a form made of earth, a form made of metal, a form made of jewels, a form made of paint, a form drawn on sand. So, when he said form made of earth, it could be either clay form, or it could be a stone form. So, all these different elements, from these elements, a particular specific form is either carved out, or cast in the case of a metal, or chiseled from wood, a block of wood, just like Jagannath Baldev Subhadra. From neem wood, the forms are made, or the marble forms of Radha Vrindavan Chandra, or the metal form of Radha Krishna Chandra. These forms are specifically made according to Agama Shastra, according to the scriptures, which describe how to make the form of the Lord. All such forms of the Lord are always decorated with garlands of lotus flowers, especially lotus, because lotus is the most beautiful flower among all the flowers. And as soon as we see lotus, we should remember Krishna. We should remember Krishna. That's why he is always garlanded

### temple atmosphere, attracting non-devotees, deity worship vs. idolatry, importance of temple visit

**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami discusses the importance of a soothing temple atmosphere in attracting non-devotees, differentiates between deity worship and idolatry, and encourages neophyte devotees to visit the temple and worship the Lord to become Krishna conscious.

with lotus flowers. He has got a depression, lotus-like flower depression in the center of his transcendental abdomen. And it is said here by Srila Prabhupada, there should be a soothing atmosphere in the temple of worship to attract the burning attention of the non-devotees who are always engaged in material wranglings. Material wrangling means that the mind is absorbed in material affairs. And they are completely, in that sense, materialistic. But even their attention can be attracted towards Krishna simply by the soothing atmosphere in the temple where the beautiful deity form of the Lord is always nicely decorated with beautiful flower garlands, especially lotus garlands. The meditators worship a form within the mind. Therefore the Lord is merciful even to the women, shudras and vijabandhus, provided they agree to visit the temple and worship the different forms made for them. Such temple visitors are not idolaters. Idolaters means those who worship idols. They are not supposed to worship idols. Idol means an imaginary form of the Lord. Whereas deity is the Lord himself incarnating in the form of the deity. That means the Lord is personally present. A deity is a Sakshat Bhagawan in his transcendental form. Whereas idol is an imaginary form. So there is a difference between idol and deity. All the great Acharyas establish such temples of worship in all places just to favor the less intelligent. And one should not pose himself as transcending the stage of temple worship while one is actually in the category of shudras and women or less. All people who are neophyte devotees are not conversant with the science of Krishna consciousness should visit temple and actually worship the Lord, bow down before him and actually have darshan of the Lord and that way become very easily Krishna conscious. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna could not be killed as soon as he was born by Kamsa."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the story of Devaki's imprisonment by Kamsa, the prophecy of Krishna's birth, and Vasudeva's efforts to protect Krishna.

Muhur Vipadganath So in the purport, Shri La Prabhu Par explains, Devaki the mother of Krishna and sister of King Kamsa was put into prison along with her husband Vasudeva because the envious king was afraid of being killed by Devaki's 8th son. Who is Devaki's 8th son? Krishna. So there was a prophecy at the time of Devaki's marriage that the 8th son of Devaki will be killing Krishna. So just because of this prophecy, immediately Kamsa wanted to kill Devaki immediately. And it is at the time of her marriage, his own sister, just because there was a prophecy, an unseen voice from the sky. This is the nature of the demoniac. Demoniac people are always envious. Kaleena Kamsena by this envious king Kamsa. This king Kamsa, he killed all the sons of Devaki who were born before Krishna. Six children. Six children who were born. But Krishna escaped the danger of child slaughter because he was transferred to the house of Nanda Maharaj, Lord Krishna's foster father. So Krishna could not be killed as soon as he was born by Kamsa, because Vasudeva was in anxiety about protecting Krishna. And Krishna instructed Vasudeva that, that you actually transfer me because you are always in anxiety about the protection of your children, which is natural for every parent.

### Kunti, Dhritarashtra, Pandavas, Krishna's grace, Dangers, Helplessness

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna bestows more favor upon a devotee who is in greater dangers."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Kunti's situation as a widow with young children in Dhritarashtra's palace, the dangers faced by the Pandavas, and how Krishna's grace is especially potent for devotees in helpless situations.

Now as regards Kunti Devi, Shraddha Prabhupada says, Kunti Devi along with her children were also saved from a series of dangers. Kunti Devi, she was a widow when her children were very small. And so she was in the house of, in the palace of Dhritarashtra. But this Dhritarashtra who was very much desirous of enthroning his own sons, even though they did not have the right, the right to rule. Dhritarashtra did not have the right to rule. Neither his sons had the right to rule the kingdom of the whole world being ruled from Hastinapura. The seat of the King of Hastinapura was the seat of the Emperor of the entire world those days. So in spite of that, being very very greedy, greed for power, greed for the royal power, so they don't hesitate to do anything. So these Kauravas they always were attempting to kill the Pandavas but Krishna protected the Pandavas so that's what Kunti is telling that Kunti Devi along with her children were also saved from a series of dangers by Krishna. Srila Prabhupada says Kunti Devi was shown more favor because Lord Krishna did not save the other children of Devaki whereas he saved the children of Kunti Devi. Kunti had five sons and they were all saved. Kunti her five sons Draupadi all of them were saved by Krishna. Parikshit the grandson of Arjuna all of them were saved by Krishna. Why? This was done because Devaki's husband Vasudeva was living whereas Kunti Devi was a widow and there was none to help her except Krishna. So what is the meaning of this? Prabhupada says the conclusion is that Krishna bestows more favor upon a devotee who is in greater dangers.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna is always there to protect us and Krishna wants us to depend on him for all protection so that we become attached to him."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that material existence causes us to forget Krishna and rely on our own arrangements, while true protection comes from developing attachment to Krishna.

Sometimes, Krishna puts his pure devotees in such dangers because in that condition of helplessness, the devotee becomes more attached to the Supreme Lord Krishna. Actually, material existence is such that we forget Krishna and we think that we have to personally make our own arrangements for our protection, because material world is full of dangers. But then the reality is Krishna is always there to protect us and Krishna wants us to depend on him for all protection so that we become attached to him. So that simply by developing our, reviving our memory of Krishna and developing our attachment, which is natural for us, because in our heart there is dormant Krishna consciousness, then we become eligible to transfer ourselves to the personal abode of Krishna where we actually belong. This is the whole description in the Bhagavad Gita. The more the attachment is there for the Lord, the more success is there for the devotee. See, due to material contact, we develop material attachments and that perpetuates our material existence.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna agrees to become the son only of the most advanced devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Devaki was not an ordinary woman, as only an advanced devotee can become Krishna's mother, and reinforces Krishna's supreme position, stating that everyone is subordinate to Him.

But if we develop attachment for Krishna and if that attachment increases more and more, just like it happened for Kunti. So, Prabhupada is clarifying, Devaki is not an ordinary woman. Devaki, the devotee who became the mother of Krishna, was not an ordinary woman. After all, who can become the mother of the Supreme Personality of God? Krishna agrees to become the son only of the most advanced devotee. In their previous lives, Devaki and her husband Vasudeva underwent severe austerities and when Krishna therefore appeared before them wanting to give them a benediction, they told him they wanted a son. But where can there be a person like a god like Krishna? But where can there be another person like Krishna? That is not possible. Krishna or God is Asaamardhva. That is, no one is equal to him. No one is greater than him. everyone is God. No. One who says this, Prabhupada explains, he is actually totally ignorant about God. He is like an animal. He is like a dog. Prabhupada says, not God, but dog. Not G-O-D, but D-O-G, dog. For God is great and he is no competitor. No one is equal to him. Everyone is subordinate to him. Everyone is lower than him. And in the Chaitanya Charita Amritha, it is said, Ekale Ishwara Krishna Arsaba Bhrithya. Everyone is a servant. Only Krishna is the only master. Even the greatest of demigods like Brahma, Shiva and even Vishnu, of course Vishnu is not a demigod, but everyone is subordinate to him. Everyone else

**Summary:** The speaker describes the roles of demigods like Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu in managing the material world and the three gunas, while emphasizing that Krishna is the supreme controller above all.

else is a servant of Krishna. Shiva Virenchi Nutam, in the Shastra, the various scriptures, it is said, Lord Krishna is offered respect even by Lord Shiva and Lord Brahma, the topmost of demigods. Krishna is offered respect by everyone else. That's a fact. Now, above the beings, there are demigods. Demigods are empowered personalities in this world, material world, who are many, many, many millions of times more powerful than human beings. That's a fact. They control the wind. All over the universe, the wind is blowing. One of the devatas controls the sun planet, which is supplying heat and light to all the millions of other planets in this universe. So, they are universal level controllers. But even they are subordinate to Krishna. They are empowered by Krishna. The power is given to them by Krishna. Krishna is only all powerful. Everyone else is dependent on Krishna for their power. As we human beings are above the lower animals, above us, there are demigods, devatas. The most important of demigods are Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva. Lord Brahma is the creator of this universe. That is the power of Brahma. And Lord Shiva is the destroyer of this whole universe. As Lord Vishnu, who is Krishna himself in another form, for the sake of certain functions, Krishna appears in the form of Vishnu. So, Vishnu is the maintainer of the entire universe. So for the sake of this material world, there are three guna's: Satwa Guna, Raja Guna, and Tama Guna. Lord Vishnu takes charge of sattva guna, Brahma takes charge of rajoguna, and Shiva takes charge of tamo guna. Now these three controllers of these three gunas, they are not under the influence of the gunas. Prabhupada gives the example just like a superintendent of a jail is himself not a prisoner even though he may be in the prison, but he is there as the controller of the prison not as a prisoner. Similarly these three personalities Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are transcendental to the mouths

**Key Quote:** "I must utilize my senses for Krishna's service."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of 'Hrishikesha' as the master of the senses and emphasizes the importance of using our senses in Krishna's service to achieve liberation and return to Godhead.

but Krishna is a supreme controller above everyone else and therefore he is known as Hrishikesha. Hrishika means senses and Isha means the master. Actually Krishna is the master of everyone's senses, of all the senses. So we have got senses and we think we control our senses, actually we don't control. The example is given, I've got this hand, I think I can lift my hand whenever I want, but if there is the control of Krishna is there that he withdraws to move my hand, that happens when I may get a paralytic stroke, then I cannot move my hand independently. So therefore Krishna is the controller of everyone's senses and therefore it is called Vishikesha. What does it mean? It means that I must utilize my senses for Krishna's service. My senses are not meant for my enjoyment or my utilization, no, they are meant for serving Krishna and that is the perfect situation, proper situation. As soon as we recognize Krishna is the controller of my senses, I use it for Krishna's service, I become completely free from material bondage, I reinstate myself in the position of Krishna's devotee and I am eligible to go back to God. I'll stop.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 24th verse of the 8th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. विशान महागने पुरुषाद दर्शनात अससभाया वनवास कृच्रतः मृधे मृधे नेक महारथास्त्रतो द्रोवन्यस्त्रतः चास्म हरे भी रक्षिताह.

**Key Quote:** "This is the reciprocation of the Lord with his devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker compares Devaki's and Kunti's situations, highlighting the constant dangers Kunti faced and Krishna's protection, emphasizing the Lord's reciprocation with devotees.

So, here is a list of different dangerous encounters that Kunti Devi, along with her sons, had to face. Srila Prabhupada explains this very nicely in the purport. The list of dangerous encounters is submitted here in Devaki, because in the previous verse there is a reference to Devaki, who was protected as much as Kunti was also protected. But Prabhupada is comparing Devaki's situation with Kunti's situation. Devaki was once put into difficulty by her envious brother. Otherwise, she was well. So, Kunti and her sons were put into one difficulty after another for years and years together. See the difference? Devaki, after she was imprisoned and you see Krishna was born and Krishna was transferred to Vrindavan. And then, Devaki's problems were over. But Kunti Devi and her sons were put into so many different dangerous situations, so many difficulties. They were put into trouble by Duryodhana and his party due to the kingdom. And each and every time, the sons of Kunti were saved by Lord Krishna.

This is the reciprocation of the Lord with his devotees. Therefore, Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, Name Bhakta Pranasyati Kaunteya Pratijaanihi Name Bhakta Pranasyati: "My devotee will never be vanquished." And that's a fact. Though they tried to kill the Pandavas, the Kauravas could never succeed in doing so.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Duryodhana's attempt to poison Bhima and throw him into the river, highlighting Duryodhana's envy and Bhima's vulnerability.

Because the Pandavas were always protected by Krishna, without any doubt. So, it begins with Vishan. Vishan means, once Bhima was administered poison in a case. Bhima was administered poison in a case. The Pandavas and Kauravas, they grew up in the same palace in Hastinapura. And Dhritarashtra was the caretaker king. And the grandfather of the Pandavas and Kauravas, Bhishma, he appointed Dronacharya to teach and coach the princes. Both the Kauravas, the hundred sons of Dhritarashtra and the five sons of Pandu, the Pandavas, 105 students Dronacharya had. And he coached them very nicely in military science because they were Kshatriyas. Now, in such training time, it was very clearly evident that Bhima was the strongest among all the 105 students. They became Dancing Kings because of His power and Kṛṣṇa's assistance. Now, it is said that Bhima was very successful in ложdayevar, playful and British. You might watch this armas with me... They are this many great Kauravas. The זonöledzksy and Brigareta of Dronacharya have exactly the same power and compassion that flashinkeya has. The beautiful women, the don'ts and the ladies' Dojo, for me to actually face him in combat one-on-one so Duryodhana with a evil mind asuric mentality he decided let me kill this Bhima and he administered a trick one once he organized a kind of a picnic for all the princess and they all went and they were playing and then he arranged that food be served in the picnic spot and he had made sure secretly that one of the items the cake which was to be served to all the princess Bhima's cake was poisoned so Bhima Bhima was given that cake and he didn't suspect anything he just ate it and after eating a little while he started feeling very very drowsy and Bhima tried to remain awake and somehow he was feeling extremely sleepy so he went off somewhere and just completely slept off. All the princes then were going back and suddenly the Pandavas the five of them or four of them other than Bhima they noticed Bhima is missing so they are searching and searching and searching and searching where is Bhima. What has Duryodhana done? He has arranged that secretly Bhima be thrown into a river. And because he was completely asleep effect of the pandemic was that Bhima was thrown into a river.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the reaction of Kunti and Duryodhana to Bhima's reappearance, emphasizing that Bhima's survival was due to Krishna's arrangement.

Bhima was given special medication to increase his strength to that of 10,000 elephants, so Bhima became very very very strong and then the Nagas again brought him back to that river and left him on the bank of that river and then Bhima was missing from the palace for some days and Kunti was very worried and so.

And then Kunti was very very pleased. Duryodhana was very apprehensive. How did he come back? What happened? Duryodhana did not know. Then Bhima revealed secretly that there is a plot to kill me. There was a plot and by Krishna's mercy I was saved.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of the house of shellac, Vidura's warning, and the Pandavas' escape through a tunnel, highlighting their intelligence and Krishna's protection.

And Bhima in this way was actually saved from being killed by Krishna's arrangement. It was Krishna's arrangement. Then once they were put into a house made of shellac. Now each of these dangers that are mentioned, it is elaborately explained in the Mahabharata. So I will not be able to explain each and every particular danger like that. But in brief I may state that another attempt was made to burn the Pandavas alive by sending them to a new palace that was called Kunti. It was constructed but it was made of combustible material, shellac. And Duryodhana's plan was to set fire when they were all settled inside nicely one particular night. So Vidura came to know about it and Vidura informed Yudhishthira that you are being sent to a palace which is going to set fire. Be careful. So Yudhishthira through Vidura's help, he dug a tunnel as soon as they went into the palace. He dug a tunnel. And before escaping through the tunnel, underground tunnel, Yudhishthira himself set fire to that palace. And then after that the Pandavas with Kunti escaped.

**Summary:** The speaker recounts the attempted disrobing of Draupadi and Krishna's miraculous intervention, as well as Bhima's fight with the demon Hidimba.

And then that's the way they were saved from that fire. So then Draupadi was dragged out and attempted to be stripped naked once in a gambling match. Somehow that gambling match that happened. And Draupadi was saved by Krishna who supplied her unlimited length of sari. They tried to disrobe her by pulling her sari. But Draupadi was supplied with unlimited length of sari. So they could not strip her naked at all. Krishna saved her. She cried out Krishna. Because the Pandavas were unable to intervene because they had lost themselves in the gambling match. So they were unable to save her. And the other elders in the assembly did not interfere with this Duryodhana and Dushasana's misdeed, because Draupadi also was kind of lost in the gambling match and she would become a kind of a servant to the Kauravas. Something like that. Then when they were exiled in the forest, Bhima had to fight with the man-eater demon Hidimba, Rakshasa. So one Rakshasa, man-eater. But Bhima killed this Rakshasa. Again, Krishna's mercy that Bhima was empowered to kill this man-eater who was a very dangerous Rakshasa, who had killed many humans and devoured them and eaten their flesh.

**Summary:** The speaker briefly mentions the Kurukshetra battle and Ashwathama's Brahmastra, emphasizing Krishna's constant protection of the Pandavas.

Such a dangerous man-eater was killed by Bhima because he was empowered by the Lord. Then after all this tribulation there was a great battle of Kurukshetra. Arjuna had to meet such great generals as Drona, Bhishma, Karna. All very very powerful fighters. But Krishna, he protected Arjuna and the Pandavas. And no harm was done by the Kauravas. Even though the Kauravas were very powerful, they could not do any harm to the Pandavas. And at the end when Parikshit was in the womb of Uttara, then Ashwathama released the Brahmastra to kill the child. But Krishna saved. Krishna personally entered the womb of Uttara and saved the child. So in this way the Pandavas were protected by Krishna at all times, whenever there was danger to their life, whenever there was any difficulty.

**Key Quote:** "One who is on the path of material progress, trying to improve himself with respectable parentage, great opulence, high education, and bodily beauty, cannot approach you with sincere feeling."
**Summary:** Queen Kunti reveals that material opulence can hinder sincere devotion to Krishna, emphasizing the importance of humility in approaching the Lord.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 26th verse of the 8th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, continuing the prayers by Queen Kunti. The meaning of this verse is: One who is on the path of material progress, trying to improve himself with respectable parentage, great opulence, high education, and bodily beauty, cannot approach you with sincere feeling. So Kunti Devi is revealing a secret about the way to approach Krishna—the simple ways to call out Krishna's name and in this way directly come in contact with Krishna, approach Krishna. But there is a quality to such utterance of the name or calling out the name. So she is telling here, one can approach with sincere feeling if they are materially exhausted. If they are puffed up with material opulence, then they cannot sincerely call out the Lord's name.

**Key Quote:** "These material assets makes one materially opulent means artificially puffed up artificially proud and it's also intoxicating."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that material advancements like wealth, education, and beauty are temporary and create artificial pride, hindering spiritual progress.

So Srila Prabhupada says, "Being materially advanced means taking birth in an aristocratic family and possessing great wealth, Janma, Aishwarya, and education, Shruta, and attractive personal beauty, Shri, Janma, Aishwarya, Shruta, Shri." These four are described here. All materialistic men are mad after possessing all these material opulences, and this is known as the advancement of material civilization. The whole world practically is in ignorance about the spiritual truths, spiritual reality, and therefore, people are mad after material opulence. But the result is that by possessing all these material assets, one becomes artificially puffed up. We are being intoxicated by such temporary possessions. Why is it said artificially puffed up? Because there is no real asset to be proud of. It is simply some illusory possession that people become proud of. How long can you have your wealth? How long can you have bodily beauty? How long can you have material uprightness, education? Only as long as the body lasts. At the most, after that, everything is separated. Everything is separated from you. Can you take your wealth with you when you put the body to your next life? Can you take your material education? Can you take any material possessions? No, you cannot. So therefore, it is described here, these material assets make one materially opulent, meaning artificially.

**Key Quote:** "By once uttering the holy name of the Lord the sinner gets rid of a quantity of sins that is unable to commit."
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the power of chanting the Lord's name, highlighting the difference between sincere devotion and external displays, and the importance of feeling in the utterance.

The buddha shloka and other buddhas are incapable of uttering the holy name of the Lord by addressing him feelingly, "Oh Govinda, Oh Krishna." You see, the quality of uttering the name, that is important also. It's not just that somebody is able to say the name. Now, Shilpa Prabhupada explains a very important point here. He says, "It is said in the shastras," is quoting from the scriptures, "that by once uttering the holy name of the Lord, the sinner gets rid of a quantity of sins that is unable to commit." That means even once uttering the name of the Lord is so powerful, so effective, it can destroy any quantity of sin. It doesn't matter what the quantity of sin is. So such is the power of uttering the holy name of the Lord, chanting Hare Krishna, simply vibrating the tongue and producing the sound Hare Krishna. He's very, very, very powerful. So such is the power of uttering the holy name of the Lord. There is not the least exaggeration in this statement. What the shastras are telling, that any quantity of sin can be destroyed completely by just one utterance of the holy name, is not an exaggeration. It's a fact. It's a 100% fact actually. The Lord's holy name has such powerful potency. There's a secret that is known to the pure devotees and to those who are associated with the pure devotes. But there is a quality of such utterances also. It depends on the quality of feeling. So there is difference between a sincere devotee calling out for Krishna by chanting his name, by uttering his name, Krishna, and there is a difference between a sincere devotee and a person who is not so sincere but simply makes an external show that I can also chant. No, it's not going to be effective if one is not a sincere devotee, if one doesn't utter with feeling.

**Key Quote:** "A helpless man can feelingly utter the holy name of the Lord whereas a man what does the same Holy Name in great material satisfaction cannot be so sincere."
**Summary:** Sincerity in chanting comes from a feeling of helplessness and dependence on the Lord, contrasting with the insincerity of those materially satisfied, suggesting material advancements can be disqualifications for spiritual progress.

So that is explained by Prabhupada: a helpless man can feelingly utter the holy name of the Lord, whereas a man who utters the same Holy Name in great material satisfaction cannot be so sincere. So sincerity is being explained specifically. He, what does it mean to be sincere enchanting Hare Krishna? It means that have within the heart the feeling of utter helplessness, utter helplessness. Sheila proper says in another place that just like a very, very small child cries for the mother, the child cries helplessly, helplessly, so the mother is particularly attentive to the child who cries helplessly. Immediately she attends to the child. Similarly, when man utters the Lord's Holy Name in helpless state of feeling, then the Lord immediately appears and actually takes care of the devotee. A materially puffed up person may utter the Holy Name of the Lord occasionally, but he is incapable of uttering the name in quality. So quality of the Lord is the state of feeling. That is not the state of reality is not there in the utterance by materially satisfied people. Therefore, the four principles of material advancement which are mentioned by Kunti Devi in this prayer, which are the four principles—high parentage, good wealth, high education, attractive beauty—are so to speak disqualifications for

**Key Quote:** "The principle of life should always be to decrease the degree of material intoxication which leads one to be more and more illusioned about the aim of life."
**Summary:** Material opulences are like a fever, an external symptom of an unhealthy condition, and spiritual advancement involves decreasing material attachment, not increasing it.

There is something mental, how to warfare between good and bad, of another political understanding that all these material opulences are useless for spiritual practice. The material covering of the pure spirit soul is an external feature. All the material opulences are like an external covering, as much as the body, our mind, material mind, material intelligence, all these are external coverings of the spirit soul. As much as here is an example, Prabhupada gives an example, as much as fever is an external feature of the unhealthy body, very good example. The general process is to decrease the degree of the fever and not to aggravate it by maltreatment. And somebody gets fever, it is an indication of unhealthy body. So what should one do? One should try to decrease the fever, not increase it. Similarly, it is sometimes seen that spiritually advanced persons become materially impoverished, and this is no discouragement. This is not discouraging if they become materially very poor after making spiritual advancement. On the other hand, such impoverishment is a good sign, as much as the falling of temperature is a good sign. Nobody wants to increase the fever. When somebody gets fever, they want to reduce it. Similarly, material wealth, there is no need of increasing material wealth when one spiritually advances. There's no need. If one's material wealth reduces, that's a good sign. It is not a sign of misfortune. No, the principle of life should always be to decrease the degree of material intoxication, which leads one to be more and more illusioned about the aim of life. All these

**Summary:** Material assets intoxicate and create illusion, hindering one's ability to enter the kingdom of God, emphasizing the need to become sober and detached from material opulence.

intoxicating, so that intoxication results in one becoming illusioned about the aim of life. So if somebody is really illusioned, then they are not fit for entrance into the kingdom of God. So we have to reduce this intoxication and become sober. Dheera, the Sanskrit word is Dheera. Krishna says, Dheera Stratra Namukhyati, one who is sober, he's not, he or she is not bewildered by this material opulence or material wealth.

This is the 8th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam, continuing the prayers by Queen Kunti. Namo Akinchanavittaya Nivritta Gunavrittaya Atma Ramaya Shantaya Kaivalya Pataye Namaha. The meaning of this verse is: My obeisances are unto you who are the property of the materially impoverished. You have nothing to do with the actions and reactions to the material modes of nature. You are self-satisfied and therefore you are the most gentle and you are the master of the monads.

**Key Quote:** "The Supreme Lord is the property of the materially impoverished."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the concept of the Lord belonging to the materially impoverished and clarifies that it doesn't mean a living being can be a complete renouncer in the absolute sense.

So this is yet another prayer by Queen Kunti. It is a sequel to the previous two prayers. In the previous prayer Kunti Devi had explained that people who are materially opulent are perfect, and they cannot feelingly utter the holy name of the Supreme Lord. But here Kunti Devi is telling the Supreme Lord is the property of the materially impoverished, Akinchanavittaya. So Shri La Prabhupada explains in the purport that a living being is finished as soon as there is nothing to possess. What does it mean? One is akinchanavitha without any material possessions. So it is not to be misunderstood. So Prabhupada is clarifying the sense in which this is used by Kunti Devi, akinchanavitha. The Supreme Lord is the property of the materially impoverished. What is the meaning of that? How do we understand it? So a living being is finished as soon as there is nothing to possess. So a living being is finished as soon as there is nothing to possess.

**Key Quote:** "A living being renounces something for gaining something more valuable."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that renunciation involves giving up something for a greater spiritual gain, not simply becoming empty-handed.

So a living being is finished as soon as there is nothing to possess. Therefore, a living being cannot be in the real sense of the term a renouncer. Sometimes people think I have to renounce. I have to give up. I have to give up my wealth. I have to give up my house. I have to give up my family. I have to give up my possessions. I had to give up my everything. But we should also understand that we cannot really be a renouncer in that way. Why? Because the principle of renunciation is explained by Prabhupada as a living being renounces something for gaining something more valuable. For example, a student sacrifices his childish proclivities to gain better education. As children are sent to school, initially, they may be very, very playful. But as they become mature and serious, then they actually try to gain better knowledge. So, they are given up their playful tendency. Similarly, a servant gives up his job for a better job. So, in the same way, a devotee renounces the material world, not for nothing, not to become empty handed, without any possessions,

**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of the Goswamis of Vrindavan to illustrate how devotees renounce material possessions to gain spiritual wealth and devotion to Krishna.

you know, but for something tangible in spiritual value. So, devotee gives up material possessions to gain some spiritual, spiritually tangible value, something of spiritual value and it is quite tangible, it is not intangible. So, the example is given of the Goswamis of Vrindavan who were disciples of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. It is said here, Srila Rupa Goswami, Srila Sanatana Goswami and Srila Raghunath Das Goswami and others gave up their worldly pomp and prosperity for the sake of service of the Lord. Devotion is service, for Krishna Bhakti, for Krishna Seva for that reason. They were big men in the worldly sense. The Goswamis were ministers in the government service of Bengal. Rupa Goswami and Sanatana Goswami are ministers of Nawab Hussain Shah in the then government of Bengal during that time. And Srila Raghunath Das Goswami, who was the son of a big zamindar of his time, very, very rich. His father was very rich. But they left everything to gain something superior to what they previously possessed. So, don't think that devotees are renouncing and giving up and becoming totally impoverished. No, they give up material wealth to gain some spiritual wealth.

**Key Quote:** "The devotees are generally without material prosperity, but they have a very secret treasure house in the lotus feet of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates a story about Sanatana Goswami and a touchstone to illustrate that devotees possess a secret treasure in their devotion to the Lord, which is more valuable than material wealth.

The devotees are generally without material prosperity, but they have a very secret treasure house in the lotus feet of the Lord. So, this treasure possessed by the devotees is unknown to materialistic persons. They can't evaluate. There is a nice story about Srila Sanatana Goswami. Prashupa tells a story. Now, Sanatana Goswami had a touchstone with him. A touchstone can convert any base metal to gold simply by touching. In Hindi they say paraspathar. In Sanskrit, they say chintamani. So, it is such a touchstone. If you touch iron with a touchstone, it become gold. So, Sanatana Goswami, he had a touchstone with him and he had left this stone, touchstone in a pile of refuse, in some garbage. He had thrown it in the garbage. A needy man took it. So, somebody approached Sanatana Goswami, I am a very poor man. So, can you give me something so that I can get rid of my poverty? So, Sanatana Goswami said, you want some touchstone? It is there. You can take it. Where is it? Oh, it is in the garbage heap. So, this poor man, he took it and he thought, oh, now my poverty problem is solved completely. But later on, he wondered, why was this valuable stone, this touchstone kept in such a neglected place? Why was it kept there? He was an intelligent person also. He was considering that what kind of thing I have taken from the Goswami, from Sanatana. He therefore asked Sanatana Goswami for the most valuable thing. He was intelligent enough to understand, if touchstone is the most valuable thing Sanatana Goswami has in his possession, then he would not have left it in the garbage. Nobody leaves in the garbage something very, very valuable that they possess. So, why had he kept it in the garbage? So, therefore, he went and asked Sanatana Goswami that can you give me the most valuable thing in your possession?

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the holy name of the Lord is the true spiritual touchstone and that a factual devotee doesn't give material things but the supreme asset, Krishna.

Sanatana Goswami said, yes, I can give you. And what did he give? Sanatana Goswami gave him the holy name of the Lord. That is why in one of the scriptures, it is said, Nama Chintamani Krishna. Krishna Nama is the spiritual touchstone. It is not a material touchstone. It is a spiritual touchstone. Akeenchana means one who has nothing to give materially. This is the meaning of the word Akeenchana. It should not be misunderstood. A factual devotee or Mahatma does not give anything material to anyone. Just like Sanatana Goswami, he gave the holy name. That is not a material commodity. It is 100% spiritual. Now, Sanatana Goswami or any Mahatma, any factual devotee does not give material, anything material to anyone, because the Mahatma himself or the pure devotee himself, he has already left all material assets. He has given up himself. So, he does not have material assets to give you. He has given them up.

**Key Quote:** "Material hankerings and spiritual advancement go ill together."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that material desires and spiritual progress are incompatible, and neophyte devotees should distinguish between spirit and matter, lacking the spiritual vision to see them as one.

He can, however, deliver the supreme asset. What is supreme asset with a pure devotee? It is the personal of Godhead, Krishna. Krishna is the property of the pure devotees. Krishna can be delivered by a pure devotee. Krishna can be delivered, therefore it is said here by Srila Prabhupada, because Krishna is the only property of a factual devotee, Krishna can deliver, sorry, because Krishna is the only factual property of the real devotee, so Krishna can be delivered by a devotee to anybody who desires to have Krishna. The touchstone of Sanatana Goswami which is thrown in the rubbish was not the property of the Goswami, otherwise it would not have been kept in such a place. So this specific example is given to neophyte devotees just to convince them that material hankerings and spiritual advancement go ill together. They don't go together. Material opulence and spiritual advancement don't go together unless one is able to see everything as spiritual in relation with the Supreme Lord. One must always distinguish between spirit and matter. A neophyte devotee should not artificially try to see the spirit and matter as one and the same. A neophyte devotee should make distinction between what is spirit and what is matter, should make a distinction. A spiritual master like Sanatana Goswami, although personally able to see everything as spiritual, set this example for us only because we have no such spiritual vision. We don't have spiritual vision at the present moment to understand that even matter being emanation from Krishna is also ultimately spiritual only, but then such a vision is not possible for a neophyte devotee in the beginning of Devotional Service. So what happens is, what happens.

**Key Quote:** "Material advancement is Anartha. It is not required."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that material advancement is an unwanted thing (Anartha) that leads to entanglement and misery, and encourages listeners to give it up and embrace Krishna consciousness under the guidance of pure devotees.

When somebody advances materially, material advancement is civilization. Such material advancement is a great stumbling block for spiritual advancement. The more one becomes materially advanced, the more one becomes puffed up, and consequently, such a puffed up person cannot make spiritual advancement even if such a person takes to chanting Hare Krishna, because the chanting will be done without the sincere feeling. That is not possible for a materially intoxicated person. Such material advancement entangles the living being in the bondage of material body followed by all sorts of material miseries. See, material advancement comes with a price. What is that? With material advancement, there is entanglement and entanglement means material miseries. So, this has to be carefully understood. So, therefore, in Sanskrit, material advancement is called Anartha, unwanted things, unwanted. Actually, this is so. This is a fact. Material advancement is Anartha. It is not required. So, Prabhupada gives an example that in the present context of material advancement, one uses lipstick at a cost of 50 cents and there are so many unwanted things which are all products of material conception of life. So many material possessions people have, but that makes them only entangled, and subsequently, they have to face so many unwanted miseries. Everybody understands miseries are unwanted, but that's a result of possessing so many material things which are actually Anartha. So, Prabhupada's instruction is give up this business of material advancement and take to Krishna consciousness under the guidance of pure devotees.

The meaning of this verse is, "No one can understand your transcendental pastimes which appear to be human and are so misleading. You have no specific object of love nor do you have any object of envy. People only imagine that you are partial." This is a prayer.

### Krishna's transcendental nature, material contamination, influence of material modes

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is not a human being. Krishna is the Supreme Unlimited Lord."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on Krishna's transcendental nature, emphasizing that He is not a human being and is not influenced by material contamination, unlike conditioned souls.

So Kunti is helping us understand what is the nature of Krishna's personality. Krishna is completely transcendental, which means that he has no enmity. He has no special liking for somebody. He is not partial. It appears sometimes like he is partial to his devotees. It appears like that. So that will be explained here in the purport by Srila Prabhupada. The Lord's mercy upon the fallen souls is equally distributed. He has no one as the specific object of hostility. Now this point is very important. The very conception of the personality of Godhead as a human being is misleading. Krishna is not a human being. Krishna is the Supreme Unlimited Lord, full of all good qualities. He is absolute. He is all good. Every living being is his part and parcel and therefore every living being is dear to him as the part and parcel living being. His pastimes in this material world especially appear to be exactly like a human being's activities, but actually they are transcendental. They are without any tinge of material contamination because Krishna does not come in contact with material nature. The material modes are not able to influence Krishna. The material modes always are influenced by Krishna.

### conditioned souls, material enjoyment, pure devotees, mercantile community

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Foolish people think that devotional service is something like flattering Krishna to get some special mercy."
**Summary:** This segment contrasts conditioned souls seeking material enjoyment with pure devotees offering selfless service, using the analogy of a mercantile community to illustrate the difference.

Only the conditioned souls. Why? Because the conditioned souls want to enjoy materially. Therefore the material modes will act on them. Only then they can try to enjoy, though there is no enjoyment. Now here one point Srila Prabhupada explains, that Krishna is known to be partial to his pure devotees, but actually he is not partial. He appears to be partial to his pure devotees. Just like Prabhupada gives the example of the sun. The sun is never partial to anybody. By utilizing the sun rays, sometimes even the stones become valuable, brilliant jewels, whereas a blind man cannot see the sun, although there are enough sun rays before him. So darkness and light are two opposite conceptions, but this does not mean that the sun is partial in distributing its rays. In spite of the sun being present in the sky, why is there darkness in some places? Because even though the sun rays are open to everyone, the capacity of the receptacles are different. Foolish people think that devotional service is something like flattering Krishna to get some special mercy, whereas the fact is that the Lord has so many unlimited number of pure devotees, and those pure devotees are always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord Krishna, always, and they are not like a mercantile community. Now mercantile community, people are merchants. They render some service in exchange for value. They always want something in exchange.

### pure devotion, unconditional service, reciprocity with Krishna, material motives

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "You simply want to serve Krishna out of love Krishna wants to provide you everything that you require out of love for you."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of unconditional service to Krishna and the reciprocal relationship where Krishna provides everything out of love.

That's the nature of a commercial transaction. So a pure devotee, even though he is always engaged in serving Krishna lovingly, he never does any service with expectation of something in return from Krishna. Never. Never. Never. Now just because the pure devotee renders loving service to Krishna, Krishna's full mercy is open for him. Then there are other people who serve the Lord but with a material motive, so when the purpose is over then they don't continue their service, just like somebody is in need of money and they approach Krishna and pray to him, "I am in need of money, kindly help me," so after Krishna fulfills their desire then they forget Krishna, how they are not continuing their prayer to Krishna. So such people they are conditionally rendering service to Krishna, they have a material motive, whereas pure devotees they render service to Krishna without any tinge of any material motive, pure service. So the Lord correspondingly is always taking care of them. It is reciprocal. You simply want to serve Krishna out of love, Krishna wants to provide you everything that you require out of love for you. You serve him unconditionally, Krishna takes care of you without putting any conditions. So it is not that Krishna is partial to the Lord and he performs service to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "The mercy of the Supreme Lord Krishna is open for everyone all living beings especially all human beings but people are reluctant to receive the mercy of Krishna many times they refuse."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the availability of Krishna's mercy to all, contrasting pure and mixed devotees and highlighting the rarity of pure devotional service.

So Lord Krishna is so strong, which only a traditional consumer is able to apply it to such people who render him loving transcendental service. No, he does not say some select people can become my devotee, can render service to me. He says everyone is my devotee, means everyone is Krishna's devotee, so everyone should render service to Krishna because you are his devotee, everyone without exception. But some people they are very much against Krishna, they are very, very, very demoniac natured, they envy Krishna. So such people it is very difficult for them to understand Krishna or relate to Krishna properly, it is very difficult. So Prabhupada concludes this description by telling the mercy of the Supreme Lord Krishna is open for everyone, all living beings, especially all human beings, but people are reluctant to receive the mercy of Krishna, many times they refuse. So this is the difference between a pure devotee and a mixed devotee. Mixed devotee means there is some material motive for such a devotee to render service to Krishna, and pure devotee on their hand, me other hand means no material motive and without any material motive constantly engaged in Krishna's service, always. So it is a very exacted position to constantly render service without any envy towards somebody or without any expectation of anything in return. It is very, very, very, very rare. This is the difference between a pure devotee and...

**Key Quote:** "Those who are cent percent engaged in devotional service to Krishna are the full recipients of the Lord's mercy."
**Summary:** This segment explains who can receive Krishna's mercy, differentiating between those in darkness, partial recipients, and full recipients based on their engagement in devotional service.

pure devotional service. It's very rare, but anybody associates with a pure devotee, they can easily develop this pure devotion to Krishna. So Prabhupada explains in terms of who can receive the mercy of the Lord. Lord is freely distributing, but who can receive? Prabhupada says those who are compelled to receive the mercy of the Lord are those who are compelled to receive the mercy of the Lord, who are completely against the service of the Supreme Lord Krishna are considered to be in abject darkness, they're completely in darkness. Those who ask for the Lord's favor only at the time of necessity are partial recipients of the mercy of the Lord. The atheist, agnostics, demoniac natured people who never worship God, they are completely in darkness about Krishna and they remain in material existence till they change their ways. And those who are asking for the Lord's favor, but they are rendering some devotional selves, though it's not pure devotional service, but still they're rendering some service to Krishna and asking for some help, they are actually partially partial recipients of the mercy of Krishna because how will Krishna reciprocate with them? They are asking for something, Krishna will give that, but devotees, pure devotees who don't ask anything from Krishna, Krishna provides everything they require. They are always protected by Krishna, always sheltered by Krishna, always provided for by Krishna. So the conclusion is that those who are cent percent engaged in devotional service to Krishna are the...

### sincere chanting, reciprocity, salvation, spiritual abode

**Key Quote:** "It appears like he is partial to his devotees but he is not at all partial he is simply reciprocating with each person exactly according to that person surrender to Krishna that's all."
**Summary:** This segment concludes by emphasizing the availability of Krishna's mercy through sincere chanting, explaining that Krishna reciprocates based on surrender, and discussing salvation and the spiritual abode.

full recipients of the Lord's mercy. So it is just open for everyone. Anybody who sincerely serves Krishna, just sincerely chants, vibrates the tongue and says Hare Krishna, the Lord's mercy is available fully for such a person, but people refuse to even chant the name of Krishna. They will not chant the name of Krishna. So unfortunate people miss this opportunity even though when the Lord descends to this material world, he plays like a human being. It appears like he is partial to his devotees, but he is not at all partial. He is simply reciprocating with each person exactly according to that person's surrender to Krishna, that's all. Now in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, who died in the presence of Krishna, they got salvation without necessary qualification. Salvation means liberation without having even the qualifications because when somebody dies in the presence of Krishna then they become purified of all sinful reactions, therefore such a person is able to get some place in the spiritual abode of the Supreme God Krishna, provided they are willing to go to the supreme abode of the Supreme God. If people don't want to go, Krishna does not force. Sometimes people who don't have proper knowledge or information, they refuse to go to this abode of the Lord because only those who are purified can go. But even those who are purified, if they reject the opportunity they have for going to the spiritual personal abode of the Lord, they need not go. Krishna will not force. So I will stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.

### grief, family relationships, Kurukshetra

**Key Quote:** "There sat the king of the Kurus Maharaj Yudhishthira along with his younger brothers and Dhritarashtra Gandhari, Kunti and Draupadi all overwhelmed with grief."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of ego and begins discussing the third verse of the eighth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, describing the grief of the family members after the battle of Kurukshetra.

In this session, we will be talking about the process of getting rid of the ego. We will be discussing from the third verse of the eighth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The third verse is as follows: Tatrasenam Kurupatim Dhritarashtram Sahanujam Gandharim Putrashokartam Pratham Krishnam Chamadhavaha. The meaning of this third verse of the eighth chapter of the first canto of Bhagavatam: There sat the king of the Kurus, Maharaj Yudhishthira, along with his younger brothers and Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, Kunti, and Draupadi, all overwhelmed with grief. Lord Krishna was also there. Now, Srila Prabhupada explains this situation that, in the purport of the third verse of the eighth chapter, Ganga Mahaprabha talks about the battle of Omneshwarinha in Kurukshetra, as we read about in her report. Srila Prabhupada says that the battle of Kurukshetra was fought between family members, and thus all affected persons were also family members like Maharaj Yudhishthira and brothers, Kunti, Draupadi, Subhadra, and Dhritarashtra and Gandhari. Her daughters-in-law were on one side with Kauravas, and on the other side there were... So, therefore, the description given by Srila Prabhupada here is, all the principal dead bodies were in some way or other related with each other. And therefore, the family grief was combined.

**Key Quote:** "When Arjuna is surveying the battlefield against whom he has to fight, the enemy party, he sees all grades of relatives on the enemy side."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the family relationships involved in the battle and how Krishna was related to everyone, emphasizing Krishna's sympathy towards all.

They had lost all different grades of relatives. This is described in the Bhagavad Gita in the beginning also. When Arjuna is surveying the battlefield against whom he has to fight, the enemy party, he sees all grades of relatives on the enemy side. Of course, on his side also there were relatives, but he is seeing the enemy side. There are so many grades of relatives, and he is overjoyed, and he is overjoyed with compassion for them, and he refuses to fight. And then Krishna instructs him in the Bhagavad Gita and tells him how he has to do his duty of fighting in this Dharma Yudha as a Kshatriya. So, after the battle, the family grief of the surviving family members on both sides, the grief was combined. Lord Krishna was also one of them as a cousin of the Pandavas and nephew of Kunti, as well as brother of Subhadra, etc. See how Krishna is related in so many ways. He is the nephew of Kunti. He is a cousin of the Pandavas. He is the brother of Subhadra. Subhadra was the wife of Abhimanyu. Abhimanyu was the son of Arjuna. Abhimanyu died in the battle. So, Subhadra was... lost her son, Abhimanyu, not her husband. Subhadra's husband was Arjuna. Arjuna and Subhadra's son was Abhimanyu. Abhimanyu died in the battle. So, Subhadra lost her son, Abhimanyu. So, Krishna was the brother of Subhadra. The Lord... Who is the Lord? The Lord... Supreme Lord Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is the best well-wisher of every living being."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna is sympathetic to all, especially his devotees, and began to pacify the grieving family members.

Therefore, he was equally sympathetic toward all of them, and therefore he began to pacify them befittingly. Now, Krishna... He is Supreme Lord. So, he is actually sympathetic to all of them because the Pandavas especially and Kunti and Draupadi were his devotees. And, otherwise also, Krishna is the best well-wisher of every living being. So, Krishna, understandably, he began to pacify all the family members who were in grief due to losing their beloved relatives. And, the fourth verse... The meaning of this verse is: Citing the stringent laws of the Almighty and their reactions upon living beings, Lord Sri Krishna and the Munis began to pacify those who were shocked and affected. And, the fourth verse... The Lord...

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Dharma or religion means the laws given by the supreme law."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of spiritual discourses in pacifying those affected by loss and emphasizes that the laws of nature are under the control of the Supreme Lord, defining Dharma as the laws of God.

This is very important that when there is some natural calamity or some unfortunate incident where there is a loss of life, and that too a big number of people are killed, then the only way to pacify the surviving family members is by the instructions and the spiritual discourses given by saintly persons, sages, given by the devotees, by the saintly persons. So, exactly that is the meaning of this verse. Laws of nature, under the order of the Supreme Personality of God, it cannot be altered by any living entity. The laws of nature are something which nobody can alter. Nobody can alter it. So, therefore, it is described here, the living entities are eternally under the subjugation of the Almighty Lord. Now, who is the maker of these laws? It is Supreme Lord Krishna. And who enforces it? Supreme Lord enforces it, and therefore everyone is eternally under the subordinate control of the Supreme Lord, who is the supreme control. Now, it is clearly explained here by Srila Prabhupada, the Lord makes all the laws and orders, and these laws and orders are generally called Dharma or religion. This is a very, very important point. What is Dharma or what is religion? Dharma or religion means the laws given by the supreme law. Nobody else can make these laws. You cannot have your own religious system as is fashionable nowadays. No, there is a universal religion or Dharma, the real Dharma, that is the laws of God, which is acting on every living being irrespective of their belonging to some particular country or some religious sect or some belief system.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Simply by following krishna's orders as given the bhagavad gita anyone can become happy in this world both materially and spiritually"
**Summary:** The speaker continues discussing the laws of nature and emphasizes that following Krishna's orders, as given in the Bhagavad Gita, leads to both material and spiritual happiness.

All that doesn't matter. Just like when death comes, there is no consideration of whether this person is a Hindu or somebody is believing in God or somebody doesn't believe. There is no such consideration. When there is disease, especially when there is an epidemic or a pandemic, there is no consideration whether somebody believes or does not believe. These are laws, stringent laws of material nature, which are actually laws of God. So, no one can create any religious formula. Bona fide religion is to abide by the orders of the Lord. The Lord's orders are clearly declared in the Bhagavad Gita. For all the scriptures, the most concise scripture is the Bhagavad Gita, and all the scriptures by the German BI, known as Bible, Krishna is directly spoken and given the orders. Everyone should follow Krishna's orders, and that will make everyone happy simply by following Krishna's orders as given in the Bhagavad Gita. Anyone can become happy in this world both materially and spiritually. Note this, it is not just spiritual happiness. Of course, Bhagavad Gita is a spiritual literature, but still in the Bhagavad Gita, how to be spiritually happy and also how to be materially happy, both are described. As long as we are in the material world, our duty is to follow the orders of the Lord. That is our duty, to simply follow Krishna's orders as is given in the Bhagavad Gita.

**Key Quote:** "Serving the lord is our eternal engagement."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that by following the Lord's orders, one can be liberated and render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord, emphasizing the importance of giving up the material conception of life.

And if, by the grace of the Lord, we are liberated from the clutches of the material world, then in our liberated stage also, we can render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord. Serving the Lord is not some temporary activity. No, serving the Lord is our eternal engagement. That's called swarupa. So, if we agree to follow the orders of the Supreme Lord as given in the bona fide scriptures or in Bhagavad Gita, then we are protected by the Lord. We can be materially and spiritually happy. We can get liberation from material bondage. And after liberation, what happens? That's clearly told here. We render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord. And we are transcendental loving service to the Lord. In our material stage, we can see neither ourselves nor the Lord for want of spiritual vision. In our present condition, we lack spiritual vision. This vision is simply some material vision which is not useful for seeing the spiritual reality. We cannot see God. We cannot because God is completely spiritual in form, and we cannot see our self, the real self inside this body. We can't see anything spiritual. But when we are liberated from material affection, and when we are situated in the original spiritual form, we can see both ourselves and the Lord face to face. So, therefore, what is called as mukti or moksha or liberation actually means to be reinstated in our original spiritual status after giving up the material concept of life. We are all having a material concept that I am this body, all the bodily connections are mine, but we are not the body. Bodily connections are not mine. So, to give up this material conception is to practice Dharma.

**Key Quote:** "Human life is specifically meant for qualifying ourselves for the spiritual liberty"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of spiritual liberation and realizing that we are separate from the material body and possessions, leading to understanding our relationship with Krishna.

Properly and become liberated from misconceptions, material misconceptions. Therefore, human life is specifically meant for qualifying ourselves for the spiritual liberty. Real liberation is spiritual liberation. Materially, however much people may try to become free, the bondage is always there and because of the body, and after this body is finished, we don't die, but we accept another material body. So, if you want to become free from this material covering, material trap, material entanglement, then you should aim for spiritual liberation, spiritual liberty. In the influence of the illusory energy or material energy, we accept this spot life of few years as permanent existence. This is a big defect in our civilization. People do not know that this material world is a temporary place, and it is actually a presentation of illusion by the material energy. Now, by cultivating spiritual knowledge, we can realize we are nothing to do with all this material paraphernalia. Then, as soon as we realize this, I am nothing to do with this material body or material possessions or material existence itself, I become free from all material attachments, and then this freedom from material attachment means we understand who we are. We understand who is Krishna. We understand what is our relationship with Krishna, and we become reinstated in our spiritual original position.

Now, this chanting of Hare Krishna, it is actually the means to inject within the core of our heart the spiritual sound of the holy name of the Supreme Lord. Thereby, it actually clears away misgivings, misconceptions. It clears away material misconceptions, and then it actually unlocks. It awakens our spiritual knowledge within our heart, the spiritual knowledge. It is awakened. So, the real problems of life, birth, death, disease, old age, these problems are solved only by cleansing the misgivings in the heart and by awakening to spiritual reality, through especially chanting Hare Krishna. So, this is what is explained by Srila Prabhupada in his purport.

### inconceivability of God, contradictory nature of God's actions, understanding Krishna through pure devotees

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So, if we properly hear from the right source, like pure devotees, like Kunti, and all the other Acharyas, then we can get some understanding about Krishna's personality as inconceivable for our tiny brain."
**Summary:** Kunti's prayer highlights the seemingly contradictory nature of Krishna's actions, emphasizing that He is both unborn and takes birth, active yet inactive, and that understanding Him requires hearing from pure devotees.

In this session we will be discussing from the 30th verse of the 8th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, continuing the prayers by Queen Kunti. जन्म कर्मच विश्वात्मन् अजस्याकर्तुरात्मनः तिरियन् रिशिशु यादसु तरत्यन्त विडंबनम्. So Kunti Devi is saying, of course, it is bewildering, O soul of the universe, that you work, although you are inactive, that you take birth, though you are the vital force and the unborn. You yourself descend among animals, men, sages, and aquatics. Verily, this is bewildering. So, in this particular prayer, Kunti is helping us understand something about the characteristics of the Supreme Lord, which seem to be self-contradictory. So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "The transcendental pastimes of the Lord are not only bewildering, but also apparently contradictory." In other words, they are all inconceivable to the limited thinking power of the human being. What is the reality? We cannot conceive of a personality who is simultaneously unborn and still takes birth. He is active, yet he has nothing to do. So we cannot conceive what kind of a personality is that. Even though the Supreme Lord is all-pervading Supersoul of all existence, still he appears in the form of a boar among animals, in the form of a human being among inhuman society as Rama, Krishna, etc. Or he appears in the form of a rishi like Narayana Rishi, or he appears in the form of an aquatic like a fish, Matsyavatara. Still, Kunti is saying he is unborn. Even the scriptures declare Aja. In Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says Ajo Pisannabhya Yatma. He is Aja, he is unborn. And Name Parthasthi Kartavyam Trishulokeshu Kinchana. Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita. Here also it is said, there is nothing to do. And even in the Vedas, Natasyakaryam Karanam Javidhyate. This is in Upanishads. So, if we properly hear from the right source, like pure devotees, like Kunti, and all the other Acharyas,

### transcendental nature of Krishna's forms, Krishna as the vital force of the universe (Vishwatma), Krishna's actions are extraordinary

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Although he appears among animals like another animal, or he appears like a man, or a rishi, or a fish, he is eternally the Supreme Lord under all circumstances."
**Summary:** This segment explains that Krishna's various forms (fish, boar, human) are all spiritual and transcendental, and that He is the vital force (Vishwatma) sustaining the entire universe, with actions meant for our understanding.

then we can get some understanding about Krishna's personality as inconceivable for our tiny brain. Everything is possible for him because everything is reconciled in his personality. Every action of the Lord actually is bewildering for the common man because none of his actions are ordinary. They are all extraordinary. Lord means performer of extraordinary activities, always, not sometimes, always. Now in the Brahma Samhita it is said, He cannot be understood by Vedic knowledge, Vedesh Udurlabham, but he can be easily understood by the pure devotees, Adurlabham Atma Bhaktao. It is very easy to understand for the pure devotees. So, therefore, it is the pure devotees who know that, although he appears among animals like another animal, or he appears like a man, or a rishi, or a fish, he is eternally the Supreme Lord under all circumstances, and his activities prove that. Activities prove that. When the Lord appeared as a fish, he instructed Satyavrata. Satyavrata was a great king. He was a devotee also. So, the Lord instructed him in transcendental knowledge, you see. So, which fish will instruct transcendental knowledge to somebody else? That is because he is the Supreme Lord in that form. The form may appear like a fish, or a boar, or a human, or half man, half lion, all kinds of inconceivable forms, simply for the sake of his pastimes, he appears in such forms. But all of those forms are completely spiritual. There is not the least tinge of any materiality in any of those forms. So, therefore, Kunti addresses the Supreme Lord Krishna here as Vishwatman, the vital force of the universe. In everybody's body, there is vital force. There is Atma. But, just as this whole body works because of the presence of that vital force in the heart of the living being, similarly, the whole universe is working because Krishna has entered this universe as Vishwatma. So, he is the supreme vital force, supreme vital force. We are all present in this universe, but we are not in the center of the universe. We don't control the universal working. We have no influence to do anything in this universe.

**Key Quote:** "One who understands this real nature in truth about the activities and appearance, or birth of Krishna, such a person, upon leaving the present body, need not take birth again in this material world, but instead, attains Krishna's eternal abode."
**Summary:** Krishna's birth and activities are transcendental, and understanding this leads to liberation; He is present within and without everything, but cannot be understood through material logic or observation.

But Krishna's actions, they are meant specifically for our understanding. If Krishna is present as the supreme vital force in the center of the universe, where is the question of his taking birth? So, he will not take birth. Why he has to take birth? So, therefore, in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna clarifies, "I take birth and I perform activities, but they are all transcendental. They are not ordinary. janmaharmachame divyam and evamyo veti tattvatah." One who understands this real nature in truth about the activities and appearance, or birth of Krishna, such a person, upon leaving the present body, need not take birth again in this material world, but instead, attains Krishna's eternal abode. In the beginning of our prayers, we said that Krishna is within and without everything, but still, he is invisible. Now, for example, Krishna is in everyone's heart. He is entered into every atom also. Andantrastha paramanu chayantrastha. Paramanu means atom. So, he entered into every universe. He enters into every planet. He enters into every living being's heart. He enters into every material atom. So, Krishna is within everyone and everything, and he is outside also. As Vishnu, he is outside of everything. He never comes in touch with the material nature, material world. So, he is outside of everything also. So, therefore, Krishna we cannot understand by some ordinary logic, by some material calculations, by descriptions given in terms of some material observation. That will never help you understand Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is simultaneously greater than the greatest Mahato Mahiyan and he is smaller than the smallest Anoranyan."
**Summary:** The lecture describes the Vishwaroopa, or universal form of Krishna, emphasizing His immense greatness, and explains that He is simultaneously greater than the greatest and smaller than the smallest.

We have to hear devotees like Venkati. Now, there is a description of Krishna's Viratrupa or Vishwarupa, one form of the Lord. The external body of Krishna as described in the description given of the Viratrupa or Vishwarupa. The hills and mountains are described as the bones of the Lord. So many hills are there. So many mountains are there. They are all described as the bones of the Virat Purusha. The great oceans have been described as the different holes in the Lord's universal body. The planet Brahmaloka has been described as the upper portion of his skull. Like this, the universal form has been described in so many ways. But then, the earth and the sky are intended to be the upper portion, because they are the set of the earth. The certain part of the earth and the sky is where the earth is. This is the only thing about which the universe is. Let us veer from the present state. In Brahma's view, the matter of the universe is to have run—what makes the universe and God's existence both greater than the matter of the universe. Now, it is said here, Brahma Shankar Prabhupada, there are people who can simply think of God as being great, but they do not know how great he is. They are thinking in terms of what they consider as great. So then they are misguided. So, then they are misled to believe some Devatas as God or some other powerful person they think is God. So, therefore, the Vishwaroopa description of the Lord, Supreme Lord is given in the scriptures that if you think of greatness of the Supreme Lord, think of the hills and mountains as the bones of the universal form. So, how many hills are there? How many mountains are there? You cannot count. So, this form is the universal form is very, very, very, very huge. Nobody can see. Arjuna was given special eyes to see that universal form. Otherwise, nobody can see this form of the Supreme Lord. So, Krishna is simultaneously greater than the greatest, Mahato Mahiyan, and he is smaller than the smallest, Anoranyan. That is Krishna's wonderful characteristic. Simultaneously, he is greater than the greatest and smaller than the smallest. So, the Vishwaroopa is the biggest form of anyone in this entire universe, and the form of the Supersoul who has entered into every atom is much, much smaller than the atom. That form of the Lord is actually the Lord being smaller than the smallest, Anoranyan. So, this is also greatness of the Lord. Simultaneously, he is present as greater than the greatest and smaller than the smallest.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing Krishna's eternal supremacy and how He becomes a plaything in the presence of His pure devotee, Mother Yashoda.

this sight is bewildering to me. So, in the previous verse, Kunti Devi has said his activities, Krishna's activities, are bewildering. So, she is giving an example of a particular pastime which is bewildering. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, here is another explanation of the bewilderment created by the pastimes of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is the supreme in all circumstances, as already explained earlier. It is not that sometimes he is supreme and sometimes he is not. No, always eternally supreme under all circumstances, all places, always, eternally. Here is a specific example of the Lord's being the supreme, at the same time a plaything in the presence of his pure devotee. The pure devotee being referred to here is Yashoda, Mother Yashoda.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the nature of pure devotion, highlighting how pure devotees serve Krishna out of unalloyed love and often forget His supreme position.

Now, we have to remember that the pure devotees are rendering service to Krishna only because of their unalloyed love, pure love. There is no expectation of anything in return. And while discharging such devotional service to the Supreme Lord, the pure devotee forgets that Krishna is actually the Supreme Lord. They forget that. And when the Supreme Lord is reciprocating with his pure devotee, he also accepts the loving service of the devotee more relishably when the devotee is rendering that service out of pure affection, spontaneously, without any reverential admiration.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the devotion in Vaikuntha, characterized by reverence, with the spontaneous love in Goloka Vrindavan, which Krishna relishes more.

See, in spiritual world there are two kinds of devotees. The devotees in the Vaikuntha Loka are also pure devotees, as much as devotees in Goloka Vrindavan are also pure devotees. But the devotees in Vaikuntha, they have appreciation of the Supreme Lord, knowledge, understanding, as the supreme person full of all opulences, the greatest. So, they have reverential admiration for the Supreme Lord. Whereas in Goloka Vrindavana, devotees, they forget that Krishna is the Supreme Lord, and they render service to him simply out of their love for him. So, this is without reverential admiration. This is spontaneous love. This is different than what devotion that is expressed in Vaikuntha. Now, Krishna as a Supreme Lord, one and only one Supreme Lord, he relishes more if his devotees render him spontaneous loving service, than when the devotees render him devotional service out of reverence for him

**Summary:** The speaker provides examples of Krishna's friends and parents in Vrindavan and emphasizes that Krishna values the loving chastisement of his devotees more than the prayers of the Vedas.

as the greatest. Now, Prabhupada gives examples here. The friends of Krishna, the covered boyfriends, they consider Krishna as one of them. They are not conscious that, Oh, here is Krishna who is the Supreme Lord. You have to be very careful in our dealing with him. No. The parents of Krishna, they are like Yashoda, Nanda Maharaj, and elderly gopis and elderly gopas in Vrindavan, they consider Krishna as a child only. Again, they are not conscious, here is Krishna, who is the Supreme Personality of God, full of all powers. No. They forget that. Now, one important point here is that Krishna accepts the chastisement by his devotees like his parents, more lovingly than he accepts the prayers of the Vedas, which glorify him in so many ways as the greatest.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna, when he came to this material world, he wanted to show to the people of this world, what are the kind of pastimes that go on between himself and his pure devotees in Goloka Vrindavana."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna descended to show the pastimes of Goloka Vrindavan, giving the example of Krishna stealing butter and being scolded by Yashoda.

So, therefore, Krishna, when he came to this material world, he wanted to show to the people of this world what are the kind of pastimes that go on between himself and his pure devotees in Goloka Vrindavana. He wanted to show that. So, in front of this material world, in front of his mother Yashoda, he displayed a unique picture of subordination. Though he does not become subordinate, he plays the role of a subordinate child, but he does not become subordinate. So, Srila Prabhupada explains, in his natural, childish, playful activities, Krishna used to spoil the stock of butter that was kept by mother Yashoda, by breaking the pot of this butter and distributing it to his friends and monkeys. And that made mother Yashoda very angry. Why? Because, I have churned this butter for you. And what are you doing? Spoiling the stock of this nice delicious butter and distributing to the monkeys?

**Summary:** The speaker describes Yashoda's attempt to punish Krishna, Krishna's feigned fear and tears, and the contrast between Krishna's fear of Yashoda and the fear that He inspires in the universe.

So, simply out of love for her child, Yashoda wanted to make a show of punishment. So, what did she do? She took a rope and threatened and threatened to actually tie him up, tie his hands. So, Krishna, when he saw mother Yashoda is angry and she wants to tie him, he began to cry, just like a small child, ordinary children. When mother is angry, they also become very afraid and they begin to cry. Now, when tears were rolling down Krishna's eyes, they were washing the mascara, which Yashoda used to decorate his eyes with. Krishna is already very beautiful, but the devotees like to decorate him. So, the beautiful eyes, the mascara was being washed when he was crying out of fear of mother Yashoda. So, this picture of Krishna is adored by Kunti Devi. And Kunti Devi is simultaneously remembering this child who is crying as a son of mother Yashoda. She is, this child is not ordinary child. He is a Supreme Lord. And he is feared by whom? By Sakshatbhayamurthy, by the fear personified, who creates fear in everyone, in his entire universe creation. That Bhayamurthy is always afraid of Krishna.

### Kunti's consciousness, Yashoda's forgetfulness, loving exchange, rasa

**Key Quote:** "It is the loving exchange that Krishna relishes."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Kunti's awareness of Krishna's supreme position with Yashoda's forgetfulness, emphasizing that Krishna relishes the loving exchange with his devotees.

Then how can Krishna be afraid of Yashoda? So, Srila Prabhupada explained, this means Kunti was conscious of the exalted position of Krishna, whereas Yashoda was not conscious of the exalted position of Krishna as the Supreme Lord. Why? Because if Yashoda were to be conscious of Krishna's position, she could not have chastised Krishna. And it is said here, that Krishna makes Yashoda forget that he is the Supreme Lord, so that Yashoda will not treat him as a Supreme, and thereby, she will actually, out of love, even chastise him. So, what does Krishna relish? It is the loving exchange that Krishna relishes. It is only out of love that mother chastises. Mother Yashoda chastises Krishna. It is not out of any real anger. It is anger of love. Anger of love. So, this is actually a different kind of anger than what we know as anger in this material world. It is only possible in the spiritual world, this kind of anger. And it is only because of the loving exchange between Mother Yashoda and Krishna. The same love, Mother Yashoda sometimes will kiss Krishna. Same love, she will embrace him. Same love, she will sometimes feed him. Sometimes she will send him for taking the cows for grazing in the forest. The same love, but variety of exchanges of rasa.

**Key Quote:** "They all know Krishna is the Supreme Personality of God."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the exalted position of Krishna's devotees and clarifies that their forgetfulness of Krishna's supreme position is not due to ignorance, illustrating with the mud-eating pastime.

This is subject matter of the Bhagavatam, subject matter of one book written by Srila Rupa Goswami, Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu. So, this is a very, very exalted position of the devotees of Krishna, pure devotees. They are among the topmost devotees. And don't think that because they forget Krishna as Supreme Lord, don't think they are in ignorance about Krishna's actual position. They all know Krishna is the Supreme Personality of God. They all know. Like it happens when Yashoda once told Krishna, I heard you have eaten some mud. Open your mouth. So, Krishna said, No, I have not eaten any mud. So, Yashoda said, Okay, okay, if you have not eaten, let me just see. Let me open your mouth. You open your mouth, let me just see whether there is any mud in your mouth. So, Krishna opened his mouth and then Yashoda began to see the whole universe in his mouth. So, then she became completely conscious of Krishna's exalted position as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And she began to think actually under the influence of illusion, I am thinking this, Krishna is my child. Actually, Krishna is my child. Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how Krishna uses Yogamaya to conceal his greatness from Yashoda and concludes by reiterating the eternal nature of Krishna's loving exchanges with his devotees in the spiritual world.

So, then Krishna does not like Mother Yashoda to treat him as the Supreme Lord. So, therefore, Krishna covered Mother Yashoda with Yogamaya, which hides Krishna's greatness and supremacy. And Mother Yashoda after that said, Okay, okay, now don't ever again attempt to eat mud. I will give you nice sweets. Don't eat mud. Go and play. So, she came back to her position as the loving mother of Krishna, the small child Krishna. And this is the eternal position of Krishna in the spiritual world, in his loving exchanges with his devotees. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna has a transcendental form which never deteriorates and he is always unborn."
**Summary:** Queen Kunti glorifies Krishna, explaining that although unborn, He appears in a transcendental form, unlike ordinary beings who are forced to take birth due to karma.

From the 32nd verse of the 8th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, continuing the prayers by Queen Kunti: kecidahur ajam jatam punya shlokasya keertaye yadopriyasyaanvavaye malayasyeva chandanam. The meaning of this verse is: some say that the unborn is born for the glorification of pious kings, and others say that he is born to please King Yadu, one of your dearest devotees. You appear in his family as sandalwood appears in the Malaya hills. So here the description is being given by Queen Kunti, glorifying the Supreme Lord Krishna as 'Unborn is born.' Krishna is unborn, ajopisannabhya yatma. Krishna has a transcendental form which never deteriorates, and he is always unborn. He eternally exists in the spiritual world. Eternally he is the controller of everyone and everything in the entire cosmic manifestation. Still he incarnates. 'Incarnates' means he takes birth in this material world. But he is born as the Supreme Lord. His position doesn't change. He appears in a transcendental form.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Krishna's transcendental birth with the forced birth of spirit souls due to karma, emphasizing the eternal master-servant relationship between Krishna and the living entities.

He doesn't take birth like we take birth. Even spirit soul, the living entity, is Ajop. He is unborn. But the spirit soul is forced to take birth, accept a material body, a temporary material body, because of the force of karma. Such karmic force does not act on the Supreme Lord, because the Supreme Lord is the controller of all such laws of karma. He is transcendental always. He is the master always, and we are eternally the servant. Either we serve Krishna as devotees, or we serve the illusory energy as non-devotees. So servant we are, always. Krishna is the master always, the controller, the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that despite Krishna being unborn, He takes birth in the material world, as stated in the Bhagavad Gita, and there are different opinions as to why He does so.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, because the Lord's appearance in this material world is bewildering, there are different opinions about the birth of the unborn. In the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord says that he takes his birth in the material world, although he is the Lord of all creations, and he is unborn. So there cannot be any denial of the birth of the unborn, because he himself establishes the truth, Krishna's own statement in the Bhagavad Gita. But still there are different opinions as to why he takes his birth. That is also declared in the Bhagavad Gita. In the fourth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna declares that he takes birth in this material world, and he also declares the purpose of such birth.

### Krishna's potencies, Internal potency, Reestablishing religion

**Verse References:** BG 4.8
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "He appears by his own internal potency."
**Summary:** Krishna appears by His internal potency to reestablish the principles of religion, protect the pious, and annihilate the impious, as stated in the Bhagavad Gita.

He appears by his own internal potency. Krishna has got three kinds of potencies: internal potency, external potency, and internal potency. So that internal potency is the spiritual potency. It is Krishna's personal energy. Potency means energy. It is his personal energy for his purposes exclusively. And when Krishna takes birth in this world, it is the action of the internal potency. Energies are working always, but we take birth under the external potency, under the material energy. Therefore we get a material body. Krishna does not accept the material body. So in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says he comes to reestablish the principles of religion, dharmasamsthapanarthaya. So how does he establish these principles? He speaks the Bhagavad Gita. He follows the rules and regulations of a householder while he was living in Dwaraka as the king of Dwaraka. By his own behavior, by his actions, by his words, by his teachings, by his instructions, he establishes, rather reestablishes, the principles of religion. And he also comes to protect the pious, paritranaya sadhunam, and to annihilate the impious, vinashaya chadushkrutam. So three purposes clearly he says in the Bhagavad Gita for which he appears, or he takes birth in this material world. That is the mission of the appearance of the unborn.

### Transcendental appearance, Glorifying Yudhishthira, Pious King

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "His birth is not exactly birth. Birth means we are accepting a material body. Krishna does not accept a material body."
**Summary:** Krishna's birth is described as an appearance, a transcendental manifestation, to glorify the pious King Yudhishthira, who follows the scriptures and instructions of Krishna.

Srila Prabhupada uses this word 'appearance' to distinguish Krishna's birth as transcendental. He is always present, but he becomes visible. Therefore we say he appears. His birth is not exactly birth. Birth means we are accepting a material body. Krishna does not accept a material body. Still it is said that the Lord is there to glorify the pious king Yudhishthira. Now Yudhishthira, one of the Pandavas, the eldest Pandava, he was a pure devotee of Krishna. Not only Yudhishthira, all the five Pandavas are pure devotees of Krishna. Kunti is pure devotee of Krishna. Draupadi is pure devotee of Krishna. All the members of the family of Yudhishthira, the Pandavas, are pure devotees of Krishna. So Krishna appears to glorify Yudhishthira. Yudhishthira is a pious king. He rules exactly according to the directions given in the Shastra, the scriptures. He follows the instructions of Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "The people in this world can be happy only when they have a devotee ruling over them."
**Summary:** A devotee ruler is essential for the welfare and happiness of the people, as demonstrated by the rule of the Pandavas, where basic needs were plentiful.

He rules for the welfare of the entire world. He teaches the citizens what is the goal of life, and he guides them so that they may be delivered from this material existence. That's why devotees are required to rule this world. So Srila Prabhupada further says, Lord Sri Krishna certainly wanted to establish the kingdom of the Pandavas for the good of all in the world. The Mahabharata describes when Pandavas were ruling, everyone was happy. There was plenty of supply of all the basic needs. That's described in the Mahabharata and the Bhagavatam both. King Yudhishthira's rule is very, very good. So Prabhupada says when there is a pious king ruling over the world, the people are happy. That's a fact. When the ruler is impious, the people are unhappy. This is the opposite. So there cannot be happiness simply by some artificial arrangements. No. The people in this world can be happy only when they have a devotee ruling over them.

**Key Quote:** "In the case of democracy, the impious citizens themselves elect their representative to rule over them."
**Summary:** In Kali Yuga, rulers are often impious, leading to unhappiness, and in democracies, impious citizens often elect impious leaders, thus being responsible for their own suffering.

Only such a devotee can ensure the people will be happy. In the age of Kali, in most cases, the rulers are impious, and therefore the citizens are also continuously unhappy. Kali Yuga is the age of quarrel, hypocrisy, and the rulers are generally impious. So people are not happy in Kali Yuga. But in the case of democracy, the system of government that we have at present in our country, and many other countries also, the democratic form of government, Srila Prabhupada says, in the case of democracy, the impious citizens themselves elect their representative to rule over them. Mostly people are not pious in Kali Yuga, and such impious citizens, they elect an impious person to rule. Therefore, they cannot blame anyone for their unhappiness. When there is an impious ruler, people have to be unhappy. They cannot be happy. So they want to be happy. So who is to blame? They themselves are to blame, because they elect their representative.

### Yudhishtira vs. Nala, Krishna's independence, Choice of appearance

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna chooses where he wants to appear. How he wants to appear. As whose son he wants to appear. He chooses that. Therefore he is completely independent."
**Summary:** Yudhishtira is glorified by Krishna's appearance because he is a pure devotee, unlike Maharaj Nala, and Krishna is independent, choosing where and how to appear, unlike conditioned souls.

To rule. So Srila Prabhupada gives another point here, that Maharaj Nala was also celebrated as a great pious king, but he had no connection with Lord Krishna. Therefore Maharaj Yudhishtira is meant here to be glorified by Lord Krishna. Maharaj Nala was also a pious king. He was ruling nicely. But he was not a pure devotee of Krishna. So therefore, Yudhishtira was a pure devotee of Krishna. He is meant to be glorified by the appearance of Krishna in this world. Krishna also glorified King Yadu, having taken birth in his family. So Krishna appeared in Yadu dynasty. Yadu was a former king, and from him the dynasty of kings is coming down. So Krishna's father Vasudeva was a descendant of the Yadu dynasty. Krishna appeared in that Yadu dynasty, the son of Vasudeva. So therefore it is said here, Krishna is known as Yadava, Yadu Veera, Yadu Nandana. Many names are there like this, although the Lord is always independent of such obligation. Krishna is identified as a descendant of the Yadu dynasty, but Krishna has no obligation to appear in the Yadu dynasty. When we take birth in this world in a certain family or a certain lineage, we have no choice. We are forced to take birth according to karma. Krishna is not forced like that. So Krishna chooses where he wants to appear, how he wants to appear, as whose son he wants to appear. He chooses that. Therefore he is completely independent.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is just like the sandalwood that grows in the Malaya hills."
**Summary:** Krishna's appearance in the Yadu dynasty is likened to sandalwood growing in the Malaya hills, highlighting the association but also Krishna's independence from obligation.

He is not bound like us. So the example is given. Krishna is just like the sandalwood that grows in the Malaya hills. Trees can grow anywhere and everywhere, yet because the sandalwood trees grow mostly in the area of Malaya hills, the name sandalwood and the Malaya hills are interrelated. Sandalwood is famous. It has got very, very nice fragrance. But such sandalwood trees grow mostly in the Malaya hills, and therefore malayasyeva chandanam. Sandalwood is known as Malayan sandalwood. So the example is given to help us understand. Krishna need not appear in the Yadu dynasty just to glorify his devotee King Yadu. Krishna appears in that dynasty.

### Sun analogy, Unborn nature, Mercy

**Key Quote:** "The conclusion is that the Lord is ever unborn like the sun. And yet he appears as the sun rises from the eastern horizon."
**Summary:** Krishna's appearance is further explained using the analogy of the sun, which is always present but appears to rise and set, emphasizing Krishna's unborn nature and His appearance out of mercy.

So Srila Prabhupada says the conclusion is that the Lord is ever unborn like the sun, and yet he appears as the sun rises from the eastern horizon. Now another example. The sun is in its orbit, and it is just rotating in its orbit, but to our eyes on the earth, it appears like sun is rising on the eastern horizon in the morning, and sun is setting in the evening, and there is a period of darkness. Again next morning the sun rises. So the sun appears to rise and set, but actually sun is always in its orbit in its position. So just as the sun is never the sun of the eastern horizon, similarly the Lord is no one's son, but he is the father of everything that be. Krishna is the Lord of everything, everyone, but out of his causeless mercy, he appears as the son of Vasudeva, Devaki, as a descendant of Yadu dynasty, out of his mercy. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "so yet one more reason why Krishna appeared"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and discusses the reasons for Krishna's appearance, highlighting that while the Lord may appear for one apparent purpose, He solves many problems simultaneously.

In this session we will be discussing from the 34th verse of the 8th chapter of the 1st canto, Srimad Bhagavatam, continuing the prayers by Queen Kunti. The meaning of this verse is: Others say that the world, being overburdened like a boat at sea, is much aggrieved and that Brahma, who is your son, prayed for you and so you have appeared to diminish the trouble. So yet one more reason why Krishna appeared. Krishna had incarnated, and all these reasons are valid reasons. So the Lord is so expert that when he appears for apparently one purpose, actually he solves so many problems.

### Brahma's Birth, Narayana's Potency, Garbhodakashayi Vishnu

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "without spiritual contact matter cannot create"
**Summary:** The speaker explains Brahma's unique birth from Narayana without a mother (Lakshmiji), emphasizing the omnipotency of the Lord and the necessity of spiritual contact for material creation.

All the problems of all the people, that's the Lord's way of incarnation. So here another reason is being given that Brahma, he felt that the earth was overburdened by demoniac forces and he was unable to deal with it, so he prayed for the Lord's incarnation and the Lord appeared to diminish this burden. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, "Brahma or the first living being born just after the creation is the direct son of Narayana. Narayana as Garbhodakashayi Vishnu. Garbhodakashayi Vishnu is a form of Narayana incarnating as Vishnu as the second Vishnu form in this world. Garbhodakashayi Vishnu first of all this Vishnu enters the material universe, why? Because without spiritual contact matter cannot create. We think that material changes are taking place automatically, no, nothing happens automatically. Behind matter there has to be spirit." So Srila Prabhupada says, "Without spiritual contact matter cannot create. This principle was followed from the very beginning of the creation. The supreme spirit, that is the supreme Lord, entered the universe and the first living being Brahma was born on a lotus flower grown out of the transcendental abdomen of Vishnu. Garbhodakashayi Vishnu has got a lotus like depression in his navel region. From that Lotus navel a lotus flower was born, therefore he is called Padmanabha." What I've heard this name, Padmanabha, he from whose navel, nabi or nabha, Padma, a lotus appeared. Brahma was born on that Lotus. So Srila Prabhupada says, "Vishnu is also known therefore as Padmanabha. Brahma is known as Atma Bhuvu because he was begotten directly from the father without any contact of mother Lakshmi ji. Brahma is also known therefore as Padmanabha. Brahma is known as Atma Bhuvu because he was begotten directly from the father without any contact of Mother Lakshmi ji."

### Narayana's Omnipotency, Mayavada Philosophy, Transcendental Nature of Krishna

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Narayana is not an ordinary living being."
**Summary:** The speaker refutes the Mayavada philosophy that equates all beings with Narayana, emphasizing Narayana's transcendental nature and omnipotency, contrasting it with the limitations of ordinary living beings.

Vishnu's consort is Lakshmi. Generally anybody takes birth from a father and mother. That's our experience in this world. But Brahma, he was born directly from the father without any contact with the mother. Srila Prabhupada explains, Lakshmiji was present near Narayana engaged in the service of Lord Narayana, and still without contact with Lakshmiji, Narayana begot Brahma. So therefore Srila Prabhupada says, this is the omnipotency of Lord Narayana. Omnipotency means he is the father. He has got all power, all kinds of potencies, and those potencies are working. They are active, actively engaged in producing so many different changes. One who foolishly considers Narayana like other living beings should take a lesson from this. There are so many millions and billions of living beings including powerful devatas, but no devata can produce a son without contact between the male and female. Not possible. Never happens. Therefore, the conclusion is, Narayana is not an ordinary being. Narayana is not an ordinary living being. Especially the mayavadis. They wrongly think or consider everyone is Narayana. So between sanyasis, they address each other as Narayana. When one mayavadi sanyasi meets another mayavadi sanyasi, he says, Namo Narayana. So he is addressing the other sanyasi as Narayana. Then the other sanyasi will also address this first sanyasi as Narayana. This is blasphemy, because Narayana is not an ordinary living being. Ordinary living being can never become Narayana. Narayana never becomes conditioned. In this material world, Narayana never accepts a material body. So these mayavadis who accepted a material body, it is because they are jiva. They are ordinary living being. Living being is subject to bewilderment by the illusory energy. Living being has to be, may be forced to take birth and accept a material body, but Krishna does not take such birth. Krishna does not accept material body. Narayana is always transcendental.

### Narayana's Potencies, Brahma Samhita, Creation Process

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Narayana is the personality of God in himself."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Narayana's divine potencies, referencing Brahma Samhita to explain how each part of His body can perform the functions of all other parts, and discusses Brahma's role in the secondary creation process.

So, the conclusion or the proper understanding is that Narayana is the personality of God in himself, and he has all the potencies of all the senses in all the parts of his transcendental body. So, this is statement in the Brahma Samhita. As regards the Supreme Personality of God, Brahma Samhita states, "His different parts of the body are capable of doing the work of all other parts. Each part or each sense can act, and perform the activities of all other senses." Just like Narayana can eat by seeing through his eyes. We can only see with our eyes. We cannot eat with our eyes. We cannot see with our mouth. We can only eat with our mouth. Like that. So, Srila Prabhupada explains, "An ordinary living being begets a child by sexual intercourse, and he has no other means to beget a child other than the one designed for him. But Narayana being omnipotent is not bound to any condition of energy." Supreme Lord Narayana, he is complete and independent to do anything and everything by his various potencies, very easily and perfectly. Everything the Lord does, through his energies, through his potencies, easily and perfectly. Just by his will, things happen. That's all. Nothing more. And whatever he does, he does it perfectly. Brahma is therefore directly the son of the father, and was not put into the womb of a mother, therefore Brahma is called Atma Bhuv, self-born, because he doesn't have a mother. Brahma doesn't have a mother. Doesn't enter a womb of a mother. No. This Brahma, who is thus created by Narayana, without any contact with the woman, this Brahma is in charge of further creations in the universe. Further creations in the universe. So the initial work of creation is done by Vishnu, but afterwards, after Brahma is born, Brahma does the further work of creation.

### Brahma's Empowerment, Kshirodakashayi Vishnu, Prayers for Incarnation
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/kF-oaFcfY74?t=679
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "If Brahma were not empowered by Narayana, Brahma could not create."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Brahma's ability to create is due to the power invested in him by Narayana, describes Kshirodakashayi Vishnu and the demigods' prayers to Vishnu for relief from the burden of the earth, leading to Krishna's appearance.

And Prabhupada explains here, "secondarily reflected by the potency of the omnipotent." What is the meaning of this? That Brahma does further work of creation. Like Brahma creates the Prajapatis. Now that is also due to the potency of the Supreme Lord, which is invested in Brahma to do the further creation. If Brahma were not empowered by Narayana, Brahma could not create. If Brahma were not empowered, he could not create. Within the halo of the universe, there is a transcendental planet known as Shwetadvipa, which is the abode of the Kshirodakashaya Vishnu. This is the third Vishnu form, Kshirodakashaya Vishnu. He is residing in a planet called Shwetadvipa, in which there is a milk ocean, and in the center of the milk ocean, there is an island. On that island, the Lord resides at Kshirodakashaya Vishnu, the maintainer Vishnu of this whole universe. Whenever there is trouble in the universe that cannot be solved by the administrative demigods, they approach Brahma. And if Brahma also cannot solve their problem, then Brahma consults and prays to Kshirodakashaya Vishnu, the maintainer Vishnu. So when Kamsa and others were giving trouble, then earth became overburdened by the misdeeds of these demoniac people. So Brahma, along with the other devatas, prayed at the shore of the Kshirodaka ocean, and they were advised that the Supreme Lord himself is going to descend in his avatar as Krishna. And they also knew that Krishna would appear as the son of Vasudeva and Devaki. So therefore, some people say the Lord appeared because of the prayers of Brahmaji. Brahma prayed. It's a fact. Brahma prayed, and he got the response from the Lord within his heart that the Supreme Lord himself will personally appear in the Yadu dynasty as the son of Vasudeva and Devaki. Therefore, when Krishna appeared in the womb of Devaki, then the devatas came to pray to Krishna within the womb of Devaki. It's called Garbhasthuti prayers, Tenth canto, second chapter. Beautiful prayers are there which are offered by the demigods to Krishna in the womb of Devaki. They knew because Brahma was informed.

### devotional service, liberation, Krishna's appearance

**Key Quote:** "Krishna has also appeared for rejuvenating the devotional service of hearing, remembering, worshipping, etc."
**Summary:** Queen Kunti's prayer is explained, focusing on Krishna's purpose of rejuvenating devotional service to liberate conditioned souls.

Bhavesmin Klishyamananam Avidyakamakarmabhihi Shravanasmaranarhani Karishyan Nithikechana. The meaning of this verse is, and yet others say that you appear to rejuvenate the devotional service of hearing, remembering, worshipping and so on in order that the conditioned souls suffering from material pangs might take advantage and gain liberation. So Krishna appears for different purposes, and He simultaneously fulfills all the purposes when He appears in an incarnation. That's the greatness of His appearance. So Queen Kunti, being a pure devotee, is very well aware that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His appearance is very, very purposeful. So in this verse she is saying that Krishna has also appeared for rejuvenating the devotional service of hearing, remembering, worshipping, etc. And why He has to revive that? Because

**Key Quote:** "Every millennium, every yuga, he appears because the materialistic way of life is such that, after Krishna revives in one particular incarnation, gradually the religious principles deteriorate in human society."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how conditioned souls are bound by karma and how Krishna incarnates in every yuga to re-establish religious principles as they deteriorate over time.

the conditioned souls, conditioned souls means all those who are under the stringent laws of karma, they are suffering from material pangs, simply because they are always engaged in some material activities and they get bound up and they suffer. So, such conditioned souls should take advantage of the process of devotional service and thereby very easily gain liberation from this material bondage. So, Krishna comes for this purpose also. So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, in the Srimad Bhagavad, sorry, in the Srimad Bhagavad Gita, the Lord asserts that he appears in every millennium just to reestablish the way of religion: Dharma samsthapana arthaya sambhavami yuge yuge. Every millennium, every yuga, he appears, because the materialistic way of life is such that, after Krishna revives in one particular incarnation, gradually the religious principles deteriorate in human society. Then again Krishna comes in another incarnation, again he rejuvenates the religious principles. Again it starts deteriorating. So, periodically Krishna incarnates for this purpose.

**Key Quote:** "The factual way of religion is to accept the Lord as a supreme authority, and thus render service unto him in spontaneous love."
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes that true religion is defined by God, specifically Krishna, and involves accepting Him as the supreme authority and rendering loving devotional service.

Dharma samsthapana arthaya. Now, Srila Prabhupada explains, "The way of religion is made by the Supreme Lord. No one can manufacture a new path of religion as is the fashion for certain ambitious persons." In modern times, sometimes people say, "Oh, I have got my own way of practicing Dharma." But that is not real Dharma. That's not religion. That's not true religion. True religion is what is given by God, what is given by Krishna. The factual way of religion is to accept the Lord as a supreme authority, and thus render service unto him in spontaneous love. This is the perfect understanding of religion: that Krishna is the Supreme Lord, Supreme Personality of Godhead, and everyone should render loving devotional service to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "A living being, any living being, cannot help but render service because he is constitutionally made for that purpose."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that all living beings are meant to render service, and if they don't serve Krishna, they become servants of illusory energy and material desires, leading to the illusion of being masters.

Now, Srila Prabhupada explains here, a living being, any living being, cannot help but render service because he is constitutionally made for that purpose. We are made for doing service eternally. That's the only function: to render service. But, we are meant to serve Krishna. If we don't serve Krishna, then we are forced to serve illusory energy, Maya. Servant we are. We cannot avoid rendering service. So, it's explained here, the only function of the living being is to render service to the Lord, to Lord Krishna. The Lord is great and living beings are subordinate to him. Everyone is subordinate to Krishna, the Supreme Lord. So, everyone's duty is simply to serve Krishna. Unfortunately, the illusioned living beings, out of misunderstanding only, become servants of the senses by material desire. We all have material desires, and these material desires dictate that we become servant of our senses. We think we are master in this material world, generally, under the influence of illusion. But, in reality, nobody is master. Krishna is the only master. Krishna is the only Lord. Krishna is the only controller.

**Key Quote:** "In such a false conception, they become servants of the senses. They simply chase their material desires. And that is never to be fulfilled."
**Summary:** The lecture discusses how material desires lead to becoming servants of the senses, chasing unfulfillable desires, and becoming entangled in nescience, with a specific mention of perverted sex life as a central point of material enjoyment.

But, others have an illusory idea that "I am controller, I am master. I am the enjoyer." And in such a false conception, they become servants of the senses. They simply chase their material desires, and that is never to be fulfilled. It is called durashaya. Durashaya, never to be satisfied, never. Though, sometimes people think, "By my hard work, I have successfully worked for satisfying some material desire of mine, and I have become successful," but that success is another facet of the illusion only. Both failure and success are illusions, because we have nothing to do with this material world. So, we become, under illusion, servant of our own senses. Now, this desire, material desire, is called avidya, nescience. Now, only because of this nescience or avidya or material desires, the living beings make different plans for material enjoyment. Material enjoyment, there are so many plans made by different living beings. This plan for material enjoyment is centered about a perverted sex life. Sex life, by itself, is not condemned in the scriptures. It's got a higher purpose: to produce Krishna conscious progeny, Krishna conscious children. But perverted sex life is simply meant for some so-called enjoyment, which actually is totally illusory.

### transmigration, birth and death, different bodies, continuous life

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Transmigration means, I am leaving one body and entering another body."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of transmigration, where the soul leaves one body and enters another, emphasizing that death is not the end of existence but a migration to a new body.

Therefore, a person becomes entangled in the chain of birth and death by transmigrating into different bodies. You should understand this word, transmigration. Transmigration means I am leaving one body and entering another body, while I am not aware that I have changed my body. I am existing through the changes, but I am not aware of that. That's why it's called transmigration. Migration, you understand. Just say, a person migrates from India to America. He leaves India and he goes to America, say, migrated to America. Actually, a similar thing happens when we die. Death is not the end of our existence. Death means we migrate from this body to another body, new body. But because that change happens without our knowledge, without our understanding, it's called transmigration. And actually life is continuous through the changes of the body.

**Key Quote:** "In that next body, a person thinks, I have come into existence when I was born, which is a mistake, which is an incorrect understanding."
**Summary:** The lecture continues on transmigration, highlighting the illusion of forgetting past lives and the incorrect understanding of coming into existence at birth, and emphasizing that threefold miseries persist even when changing bodies.

Just like we change body from childhood to youth to old age. Do we think that we are different person from childhood to youth when the change happens? No. I am quite aware. I am the same person. I had the body of a child. Now I have the body of a young man when I become youthful, when I go to the youthful stage. So, I don't think that I am a different person. But what happens when we quit this body at the time of death and enter another body? Mostly, in most cases, a person forgets about the previous life. That is one thing. Second thing, in that next body, a person thinks, "I have come into existence when I was born," which is a mistake, which is an incorrect understanding. So, in the chain of birth and death, by transmigrating to different bodies on different planets, this happens under the direction of the Supreme Lord. He is completely in control, the Supreme Lord. So, Srila Prabhupada explains, unless one is beyond the boundary of this nescience or ignorance or misunderstanding, misconception, one cannot get free from the threefold miseries of material life. One cannot get free. The threefold miseries will be there in material existence, even if we change bodies. Miseries are not going to vanish.

**Key Quote:** "So, therefore, the conclusion is that if we understand and take to devotional service, which Krishna actually every time appears in every yuga, and he revives the real religious principles in human society, and we should take advantage of that."
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by emphasizing the importance of devotional service (bhakti) as the path to liberation, highlighting Krishna's role in reviving religious principles and encouraging listeners to take advantage of this opportunity to return to Godhead.

So, therefore, the conclusion is that if we understand and take to devotional service, which Krishna actually every time appears in every yuga, and he revives the real religious principles in human society, Dharma Samsthava and Artha, and we should take advantage of that. Krishna is doing it for our sake. It's not for his benefit. It's for our benefit. So, those who are accepting this path of devotional service, they are very, very fortunate souls, and they can solve this problem of repetition of birth and death by practicing bhakti and becoming liberated. Ultimate liberation is possible in the bhakti. Go back to Godhead, never to return again to this miserable material world.

### repetition of birth and death, transcendental activities, Krishna's lotus feet
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/w2np8N3hAs4?t=54

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "O Krishna, those who continuously hear, chant and repeat your transcendental activities or take pleasure in others doing so certainly see your lotus feet which alone can stop the repetition of birth and death."
**Summary:** Kunti Devi explains how hearing, chanting, and repeating Krishna's transcendental activities, or even taking pleasure in others doing so, can lead to liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

In this session we will be discussing from the 36th verse of the 8th chapter of the 1st canto of Shreemad Bhagavatam, continuing the prayers by Queen Kunti. श्रिन्वन्ति गायन्ति गृणन्ति भीक्ष्णशः स्मरन्ति नन्दन्ति तवेहितं जनाह तैयेवपश्यंति अचिरेणतावकं भवप्रवाहो परमं पदाम्बुजम. The meaning of this verse is, O Krishna, those who continuously hear, chant, and repeat your transcendental activities or take pleasure in others doing so, certainly see your lotus feet which alone can stop the repetition of birth and death. So Kunti Devi is explaining how one can end this repetition of birth and death. Of course, most people do not know that the real fundamental problem of material existence is this repetition of birth and death. It's called samsara or bhava. So this accepting this material body, while we are actually not got anything to do with matter, we are pure spirit and we have our spiritual body, we have our spiritual heart, we have our home, the abode of Krishna, Krishnaloka, but foolishly we give up that spiritual home and we desire independent enjoyment, we desire to lord over material nature and therefore we are forced to take this material body which is called birth and we cannot remain in this material body permanently, we have to quit this material body by force, that's called death and after death if we still have desire for lording over or we have desire for material enjoyment, independent enjoyment then we have to continue to accept another body and that's another birth. So jatasyahi dhruva mṛtyu dhruvam janma mṛtasyaca Krishna explains this in the Bhagavad Gita, for one who has taken his birth in this material world death is certain and after death if one is not liberated at the time of death then one has to take birth again, cannot avoid. So Kunti Devi is now telling who can actually stop this repetition of birth and death, those who continuously hear, chant, and repeat the transcendental activities of Krishna or even if they don't do it they simply take pleasure in somebody else who is doing that, such persons are able to have darshan of Krishna's lotus feet by which they are very easily able to conquer this material existence, they are able to stop the repetition of birth and death.

### conditional vision, spontaneous love of God, recognizing God

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Therefore even though the Lord may be present before our eyes it is not possible to see him unless we have the necessary vision."
**Summary:** Seeing Krishna requires developing spontaneous love of God and changing our conditional vision, as material qualifications are not enough to recognize the Lord.

So Sri La Pravapa explains in the purple, The Supreme Lord Sri Krishna cannot be seen by our present conditional vision, this eyes with which we normally see so many material things, it works under certain conditions, so this conditional vision is not suitable for seeing the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna, in order to see him one has to change his present vision by developing a different condition of life which is full of spontaneous love of God, spontaneous love of God, not forced to do some devotional service, spontaneously one renders service to Krishna very enthusiastically, lovingly, very nicely. When Sri Krishna was present personally on the face of the globe not everyone could see him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, when Krishna incarnates everybody can see him but they don't recognize him, they don't understand here is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they think he is another ordinary person, materialists like Ravana, Hiranyakashipu, Kamsa, Jarasandha are highly qualified personalities by acquisition of material assets but they were unable to appreciate the presence of the Lord, so somebody is materially qualified that is not enough to to recognize the Supreme Lord when he is incarnated or when he is personally present before our vision, therefore even though the Lord may be present before our eyes it is not possible to see him unless we have the necessary vision. Sometimes people ask can you show me God, even if God were to appear in front of you the question you should ask yourself before you ask the question can you show me God, can I recognize God if God comes in front of me as one does God have and does he rule God and can be first in difficult or end able and have the strength to rank the planet later it would just rather be permanent above

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "If hearing is from the right sources, it acts very quickly."
**Summary:** Hearing from authorized sources is crucial for spiritual advancement, and one should approach the Lord's pastimes, including those with the Gopis, with the right understanding and motivation.

service does not see the Lord face to face. The reason is that the first item shravana is very important. If hearing is from the right sources, it acts very quickly. Generally people hear from unauthorized persons. Such unauthorized persons may be very learned by academic qualifications but because they do not follow the principles of devotional service, hearing from them becomes a sheer waste of time. Hearing from unauthorized persons will not result in any spiritual advancement. Sometimes the texts are interpreted fashionably to suit their own purpose. Therefore, first one should select a competent and bonafide speaker and then hear from him. When the hearing process is perfect and complete, the other processes become automatically perfect in their own way. After hearing comes chanting and then remembering etc. There are different transcendental activities of the Lord and each and every one of them is competent bestow the desired result provided the hearing process is perfect. In the Bhagavatam the activities of the Lord begin from his dealings with the Pandavas, that's the first canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam. There are many other pastimes of the Lord in connection with his dealings with the asuras and others and in the tenth canto the sublime dealings with his conjugal associates the Gopis as well as his married wives at Dwaraka are mentioned. Since the Lord is absolute there is no difference in the transcendental nature of each and every dealing of the Lord whether the description in the first canto is about the Lord's dealings with the Pandavas or in some other canto about the Lord's dealings with some other asuras or it is the dealing of the Lord with his most beloved devotees the Gopis or his beloved Queens at Dwaraka all are transcendental. But sometimes people in an unauthorized hearing process take more interest in hearing about his dealings with the Gopis, such an inclination indicates the lusty feelings of the hearer so a bona fide speaker of the dealings of the Lord never indulges in such hearings, one must hear about the Lord from the very beginning as in the Srimad Bhagavatam or any other scripture.

**Key Quote:** "We must always remember that the Lord is always transcendental to any mundane attachment."
**Summary:** Krishna is transcendental to any material attachment, and hearing about Him and His devotees is conducive to spiritual life, offering relief from the troubles of material existence.

and that will help the hearer attain perfection by progressive development, one should not therefore consider that his dealings, that means Krishna's dealings with the Pandavas are less important than his dealings with the Gopis, we must always remember that the Lord is always transcendental to any mundane attachment, Krishna doesn't have any attachment, any material attachment at all. In all the above mentioned dealings of the Lord he is the hero in all circumstances and hearing about him or about his devotees or combatants is conducive to spiritual life. It is said that the Vedas and Puranas etc are all made to revive our lost relation with him, hearing of all these scriptures, essential, it's absolutely essential. In the previous verses Kunti Devi has explained that those who have come to this material world are working very hard like asses and have such a hard burden that they cannot bear it because the lusty desires have created heavy work that puts them always in trouble, Krishna comes to introduce the system by which one can get relief from this continuously troublesome life, material life means troublesome heavy work that's

the essence of material line. Now as regards what is Pushpa Roshani Gratia? Religion consists of the laws of God. People who do not know this think that religion means faith, but although you may have faith in something, and I may have faith in something, and although I may believe you, and you may or may not believe me, that is not religion. There is even a supposedly religious mission that says, you can manufacture your own way, whatever you think is right, that is right. This is their philosophy, wrong philosophy, bogus philosophy, but that is not science. Supposing I am a madman, is it all right? Is it all right to think, whatever I think is correct? Is it all right to think like that? How could this be? 2 plus 2 equals 4 is science. If I believe that 2 plus 2 equals 5 or 3, does it become true? No, never. So, there are laws of God, and when there is dharma, asya glani, deviation from these laws, we suffer. So, Krishna comes to correct these mistakes, and he shows us the way of devotional service. And if we follow that, very easily, we can cross over this most difficult material existence.

### dependence on Krishna, protection, devotee vs. non-devotee

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Only Krishna can protect us."
**Summary:** This segment explains that Kunti Devi's prayer highlights the pure devotee's complete dependence on Krishna for protection, contrasting this with the non-devotee's reliance on temporary and ultimately insufficient shelters.

The meaning of this verse is, O my Lord, you have executed all duties yourself. Are you leaving us? Today, though we are completely dependent on your mercy and have no one else to protect us, now when all kings are at enmity with us. This verse, spoken by Kunti Devi in a prayer to Krishna, is clearly indicating the position of a pure devotee like Kunti Devi on the Supreme Lord Krishna. In a sense, what is Kunti Devi telling? My dear Lord Krishna, we are dependent on you. We are totally dependent on your mercy. We have no one else for protecting us. Only you are our protector. This is the factual position of everyone, not only Kunti Devi, but pure devotees know this, recognize this, and always take shelter of Krishna. The non-devotees, they try to take shelter of so many other so-called shelters, but they are not. But nobody else can protect us, the living beings, except Krishna.

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "What is the material disease? To be independent of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker defines the material disease as the desire to be independent of Krishna, emphasizing that our natural constitutional position is one of dependence on Him, which paradoxically leads to true independence from other material influences.

Only Krishna can protect us, because non-devotee means somebody who is in a very unsafe position, under the clutches of the illusory energy. It is not at all safe. It is not at all secure. It is not at all the best shelter. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport to this verse, "The Pandavas are most fortunate because with all good luck, they were entirely dependent on the mercy of the Lord." In the material world, to be dependent on the mercy of someone else is the utmost sign of misfortune. See, in the material world, people want to be independent. That's the material disease. What is the material disease? To be independent of Krishna, because our constitutional position is dependence on Krishna. And by becoming dependent on Krishna, not by becoming, by remaining dependent on Krishna, we are completely independent of all other persons, all other so-called sources of protection. But in the case of our transcendental relation with the Lord, it is the most fortunate case where we can live completely dependent on Krishna. The material disease is due to thinking of becoming independent of everything.

**Verse References:** —

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, General public
**Key Quote:** "But a cruel material nature does not allow us to become independent."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the futility of trying to become independent of the laws of nature through material advancement, using the example of Ravana's attempt to build a staircase to heaven as an illustration of this misguided endeavor.

This is the material disease. I want to be independent. But a cruel material nature does not allow us to become independent. The false attempt to become independent of the stringent laws of nature is known as material knowledge. Material advancement means we go on trying to secure ourselves whenever we face some danger, and what is the nature of material existence? Danger in every step, padam padam yad vipadam, that is material existence. And only a foolish man will think that I can secure myself independently. You cannot. Material nature is going to completely smash all our so-called arrangements. The whole material world is moving on this false attempt at becoming independent of the laws of nature, beginning from Ravana. Ravana lived millions and millions of years back in some Dretayuga, former age. This Ravana, he wanted to prepare a direct staircase to the plants of heaven and transport people against the laws of God. What are the laws of God? That anybody wants to elevate themselves, like we've energized, performing pious activities and qualify themselves to go there. Impious persons cannot force themselves or somehow go there. It's not possible. So Ravana thought, why should people perform pious activities? I will make a staircase to heaven from the earth and anybody wants to go, even without performing any austerity, they can go. I will give them the access. This is what Ravana thought.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The highest goal of human civilization is to work hard under the guidance of the supreme lord Krishna and become completely dependent on him."
**Summary:** The speaker asserts that the highest achievement is to work diligently while remaining completely dependent on Krishna, citing the Pandavas as an example of this ideal, teaching others that complete dependence on Krishna ensures safety and security.

But that is never to happen. So Srila Prabhupada says, beginning from Ravana down to the present age, they are trying to overcome the laws of nature. They are trying now to approach distant planetary systems by electronic mechanical power, just like they're trying to go to the moon, but they cannot force themselves the way they are attempting. The highest goal of human civilization is to work hard under the guidance of the Supreme Lord Krishna and become completely dependent on him. The highest achievement of perfect civilization is to work with valor, but at the same time depend completely on the Supreme Lord Krishna. This is the best achievement. The Pandavas were the ideal existence of this standard of civilization because they're pure devotees and they rule the whole world teaching people this principle. What are the principle the Pandavas were teaching? Completely depend on the Supreme Lord Krishna and you are safe, you're secure, that is the way to

make spiritual progress and go back to Godhead. That is the way. Undoubtedly, the Pandavas were completely dependent on the goodwill of Lord Sri Krishna, but they were not idle parasites of the Lord. This is a very important point. Pandavas are dependent on the goodwill of the Supreme Lord Krishna, does not mean that Krishna will do everything, I don't have to do anything. No, they are not idle parasites. They were all highly qualified both by personal character and their physical activities. They were, in terms of character, they had the best character as is very evident in the dealings of the Pandavas with everyone else, and they were also active physically also, not sitting back lazily and telling Krishna we'll do it. Still, they always look for the mercy of the Lord because they knew that every living being is dependent by constitutional position, the way we are made, the way we are.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "The perfection of life is therefore to become dependent on the will of the Lord instead of becoming falsely independent in the material world"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the pursuit of false independence in the material world is an illusion, and true protection comes from becoming 'sanatha' - dependent on the will of the Lord, shielding us from the unfavorable conditions of material existence.

We depend completely on the Supreme God. The perfection of life is therefore to become dependent on the will of the Lord instead of becoming falsely independent. In the material world, somebody may say, I am an independent person in the material world, but that person is speaking in ignorance, under illusions. Somebody may think everything is fine with me now. That is because after the previous misery that somebody has experienced, then they get some relief from that misery, they think everything is fine, but very soon another misery is going to affect them. Miseries come one after another, one after another, one after another. There is some relief period between two miseries and that period people wrongly think, because right now, I've got some relief, some misery I was suffering, therefore I think everything is fine. I have become so habituated to suffering in this world that when I get relief, I think it's very nice. Those who try to become falsely independent of the Lord are called anatha or without any guardian, anatha. Whereas those who are completely dependent on the will of the Lord are called sanatha or those having someone to protect them. Therefore, we must try to be sanatha so that we can always be protected from the

**Summary:** This segment discusses how the deluding power of maya makes us forget the undesirable nature of material existence, emphasizing that only after many births does a fortunate person realize Krishna is everything and surrender to Him, becoming a Mahatma like the Pandavas.

unfavorable condition of material existence. As long as we are here, in the material world, we need protection against the onslaught of maya, and how is that protection to be achieved? By becoming dependent on Krishna through devotional service. By the deluding power of the external material nature, we forget that material condition of life is the most undesirable perplexity. That's the power of maya. As I said, when there is some relief from some suffering, we think under the influence of illusion, I am very safe. I am protected or I am fine. I don't require any protection. That's what I think. The Bhagavad Gita, 7th chapter, 19th verse, therefore, directs us that after many, many births, one fortunate person becomes aware of the fact that Vasudeva or Krishna is all in all and that the best way of leading one's life is to surrender unto him completely. bahunam janmanamante jnanavan mam prapadyate. Jnanavan means one person got mature knowledge, fully enlightened by properly maturing in transcendental knowledge. Such a person is actually a Mahatma. Mahatma means a pure devotee. All the members of the Pandava family were Mahatmas in household life. They were not renunciates. They were not living in a secluded place doing some meditation or tapasya. They were householders.

### scriptural teachings, dependence on Krishna, Kunti's prayer

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The scriptures are teaching us that we should depend upon the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by reiterating that the scriptures teach dependence on the Supreme Lord, exemplified by the Pandavas' relationship with Krishna, and highlighting Kunti's prayer expressing their complete reliance on Him.

They had responsible duties as Kshatriyas. Maharaj Yudhishthira was the head of these Mahatmas, as Pandavas, and Queen Kunti Devi was the mother. The lessons of the Bhagavad Gita and all the Puranas, specifically the Bhagavata Puranas or Srimad Bhagavatam, are therefore inevitably connected with the history of the Pandava Mahatmas. The scriptures are teaching us that we should depend upon the Supreme Lord. That's what the scriptures are teaching us, and that is best illustrated by this description of the Pandavas' dependence on Krishna. For the Pandavas, separately, they were dependent on Krishna. For the Pandavas, separation from the Lord was just like separation of the fish from water. The fish cannot live outside of water. Similarly, devotees cannot live outside of the protection of Krishna. So Queen Kunti is pursuing the Lord, please stay with us. Don't go home, because we are totally dependent on you. So I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "We should know that every moment I should be dependent on Krishna's mercy only."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of dependence on Krishna, urging listeners to be constantly Krishna conscious and avoid complacency.

This is yet another prayer offered by Queen Kunti to Krishna, that the devotees are very well aware that their existence is totally dependent on Krishna, and only because of Krishna's mercy, they are able to perform their duties. They are able to perform activities in a nice way. And the example is being given, when the spirit soul leaves the body, the body is a useless piece of dead matter. But as long as the spirit is there, the body is having so many nice life symptoms. Actually, the body is always matter, dead matter. But the presence of the spirit makes it appear to be having life. And the absence of the spirit means immediately the body starts decomposing. It cannot be sustained anymore. So in the Purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, "The body is quite aware that the existence of the Pandavas is due to Shri Krishna only." This point has to be very, very nicely understood. And only then we become very serious in Krishna consciousness and not be complacent in our practice. In this material world, while we are still here, we should not be complacent. We should know that every moment I should be dependent on Krishna's mercy only.

And for that, I have to be Krishna conscious always, not sometimes, always. The Pandavas are undoubtedly well established in name and fame and are guided by a great king, Yudhishthira, whose morality personified. He is called Dharma because he is morality personified. And the Yadus are undoubtedly great allies of the Pandavas. But without the guidance of Lord Krishna, all of them are non-entities.

There is a background consciousness. No one should be proud of his prestige, power and fame, without being guided by the favor of the Supreme Lord. He will be always conscious of this favor of the Supreme Lord upon each one of us, under all circumstances.

The living beings are always dependent and the ultimate dependable object is the Lord himself.

We may therefore invent by our advancement of material knowledge all sorts of counteracting material resources, but without being guided by the Lord. All such inventions end in fiasco, however strong and stout the reactionary elements may be, just like we sometimes hear, oh, this building is earthquake proof. All such inventions end in fiasco, however strong and stout the reactionary elements may be, just like we sometimes hear, oh, this building is earthquake proof. the building to collapse during an earthquake that provision that is made is alone not enough.

there has to be some better understanding that if Krishna protects then we are completely safe and if Krishna does not give his protection then we are completely totally helpless nothing else can save us at a time when there is calamity or danger we cannot be saved without Krishna's mercy so this has to be very very clearly understood our understanding of the existence of Krishna is very important and we have to be very very clear our material arrangements ultimately will fail. As soon as an important man dies his name and form become unimportant even though he may have been a big scientist, a politician or a philosopher. We have experience of this. As long as there is life in the body the person is got some respect some name and fame but as soon as that soul leaves the body then the person is no

See the fact is everybody considers the body as the self as the person body is not the person but they only can identify in terms of the body what happens to this body after the person the life is gone the body is gone out of the body the spirit soul is left the body then this body is just a lump of matter when an important man is alive he may have so many guards and no one can go before him or touch him but when the same man is dead and lying on the floor one may kick him in the face and practically no one will care a dead man a dead body who cares for showing some respect or protecting or guarding or showing some honor nobody cares this is

energies all his energies so example is given by Srila Prabhupada the sun for example is energetic and the sunshine is energy as long as the sunshine is present the sun is present and if the sun were not present the Sun's energy would also not be there just like at night the Sun is not in the sky so there's no sunshine sunshine can never exist without the Sun Sun can never be without the sunshine so this is the kind of interrelationship the energy and energetic must both exist although the Mayavadi philosophers do not accept the energetic but only the in-person energy we must accept both the energy and the energetic this is the special thing about Krishna conscious philosophy that Krishna is the energetic source of all energies and all energies belong to Krishna and Krishna can never be without his energy and energy cannot exist independently without Krishna so therefore the devotees always know energy is there means Krishna and Krishna is there means energies are automatically there always there so this understanding will help us actually become Krishna conscious I'll stop here

**Key Quote:** "In the modern civilization, people think industries are generating many jobs, increasing the wealth of the nation, increasing the GDP and giving so many nice gadgets and facilities and machines for peoples. But actually, there is the negative side of this industrial development."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Queen Kunti's prayers to Krishna for prosperity and contrasts it with the speaker's view on modern industrial development and its negative consequences.

In this session, we will be discussing from the fortieth verse of the eighth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, continuing the prayers by Queen Kunti, Ime Janapada Sriddha Supak Kau Shadhi Veerudhaha Vanadrinad Yudanvanto Hedante Tava Bhikshitaihi. The meaning of this verse is all these cities and villages are flourishing in all respects because the herbs and grains are in abundance. The trees are full of fruits, the rivers are flowing, the hills are full of minerals, and the oceans full of wealth. And this is all due to your glancing over them. Kunti is offering prayers to Krishna because of Krishna's glance, there is prosperity, abundance of everything. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "Even prosperity flourishes by natural gifts and not by gigantic industrial enterprises." In the modern civilization, people think industries are generating many jobs, increasing the wealth of the nation, increasing the GDP and giving so many nice gadgets and facilities and machines for people. But actually, there is the negative side of this industrial development. So many problems due to these industries, which are not generally highlighted or discussed by the industrialists themselves, just like the waste generated, the pollution. So, there is a negative side of this industrial development.

### exploitation, material nature, God consciousness

**Key Quote:** "The more we attempt to exploit material nature according to our whims of enjoyment, the more we shall become entrapped by the reaction of such exploitative attempts."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the dangers of exploiting material nature and emphasizes the importance of accepting nature's gifts with God consciousness.

But actually, there is the negative side of this industrial development. The dependence on artificial way of living, all this has actually led to destroying the finer sentiments of our human being. So, Srila Prabhupada explains some of these things in the purport. 1. Industrial enterprises are products of a godless civilization and they cause the destruction of the noble aims of human life. This is what Prabhupada is explaining, they cause the destruction of the noble aims of human life. The more we go on increasing such troublesome industries to squeeze out the vital energy of the human being, the more there will be unrest and dissatisfaction of the people in general. Although if you only can live lavishly by exploitation, not everybody actually is prosperous because of the industries. It's only a few people who are becoming very, very rich and they ensure that they have all the best facilities for their stay, for their family members, for their comfortable living, etc., but they end up exploiting the poor people. The natural gifts such as grains and vegetables, fruits, rivers, the hills of jewels and minerals, and the seas full of pearls are supplied by the order of the Supreme as He desires. Material nature produces them in abundance or restrict them at times according to the desire of the Supreme Lord. The natural law is that the human being may take advantage of these godly gifts by nature and satisfactorily flourish on them without being captivated by the exploitative mentality of lording it over material nature. The industrial enterprises are basically exploitation due to the tendency of lording, but accepting the gifts of nature. The gifts of nature given by Krishna, the Supreme Lord, who is actually the one who is directing material nature, so then we may accept them and live very nicely without destroying the noble aim of life that is God consciousness, God realization. The more we attempt to exploit material nature according to our whims of enjoyment, the more we shall become entrapped by the reaction of such exploitative attempts. Material nature is entangling if we try to exploit.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the sufficiency of natural gifts and criticizes industrial exploitation, advocating for devotional service and obedience to the laws of the Lord.

We should always remember that. If we have sufficient grains, fruits, vegetables, herbs, then we will be entrapped by the reaction of such exploitative attempts. Material nature is entangling if we try to exploit. We should always remember that. If we have sufficient grains, fruits, vegetables, herbs, then we will be entrapped by the reaction of such exploitative attempts. The more we attempt to exploit material nature, the more we shall become entangled by the Patrol of Elemental Nature and causal action. That was the ultimate goal of my research and you can understand that by fully understand what annicas involved in their independent consumption of Entropical anywhere is not only their contribution to life but also into their survival. Contraindyst himself this is the very individual act they commit to each device, anything and not kill an animal if he has sufficient grains and vegetables to eat. This is a fact. The flow of river waters fertilizes the fields and there is more than what we need. Minerals are produced in the hills and the jewels in the ocean. If the human civilization has sufficient grains, minerals, jewels, water, milk etc., then why should we hanker after terrible industrial enterprises at the cost of the labor of some unfortunate men? See, industries always exploit poor people. The labor class of people are exploited. But all these natural gifts are dependent on the mercy of the Lord. What we need therefore is to be obedient to the laws of the Lord and achieve perfection of human life by

The indications of Kunti Devi are just to the poor. Lord Krishna as was described by Guruji in from the point. She desires that God's mercy be bestowed upon them so that natural prosperity will be maintained by His grace. So, by Krishna's mercy there will be prosperity because Krishna is directing material nature. Further Srila Prabhupada explains Kunti Devi mentions that the grains are abundant, the trees are full of fruits, the rivers flowing nicely, the hills of minerals, hills are full of minerals and the oceans are full of wealth. But she never mentions that industry and slaughterhouses are flourishing for such things are nonsense that men have developed to create problems. Such things as factories and industries are modern

**Summary:** This segment describes how God's creation provides sufficiently and how cooperation between living beings leads to prosperity, emphasizing the importance of Krishna's glance and devotional service.

developments. They never existed in the Vedic culture, Vedic civilization never existed. If we depend on God's creation there will be no scarcity but simply ananda or bliss. God's creation provides sufficient grains and grass while we eat. The grains and fruits, the animals like the cows will eat the grass. The bulls will help produce grains and they will take only a little being satisfied with what we throw away. If we take fruit and throw away the skin the animal will be satisfied with the skin. If anybody has got a Goshala then they have experienced that we take the vegetable and peel, we give it away to the animals. We take the fruit and the peel, we give it to the animals and they are happy and they are satisfied and they are nourished by those peels. In this way with Krishna in the center there can be full cooperation between the trees, animals, human beings and all living entities. This is Vedic civilization, a civilization of Krishna consciousness. Very important to note, Vedic civilization is a civilization of Krishna consciousness. Simply by cooperation between all the varieties of living beings there is plenty for everyone. There is prosperity the whole world. Kunti Devi prays to the Lord this prosperity is due to your glance she is telling Krishna. So, Prabhupada says when we sit in the temple of Krishna, Krishna glances over us and everything is nice. When sincere souls try to become Krishna's devotees, Krishna very kindly comes before them in his full opulence and glances upon them and they become happy and beautiful. So, whenever you visit the temple of Krishna, just sit in front of Krishna and let his merciful glance fall on you. Then there will be plenty, there will be prosperity, there will be no scarcity.

### Krishna's glance, creation, material nature
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/KLL0oh07pmA?t=736
**Verse References:** BG 9.10
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Simply by Krishna's glance, matter becomes agitated. And then becomes pregnant and gives birth to the living entities."
**Summary:** This segment explains how Krishna's glance is responsible for the creation of the material world and the birth of all living entities, referencing scriptures to support this point.

This is a fact, cent percent fact. Similarly, the whole material creation is due to Krishna. It is due to Krishna's glance. This is what the scriptures tell us, sa aikshata, this is the statement in the Upanishads. Sa aikshata sa asrujata, this is the statement of the Upanishads. In the Vedas, it is said that he glanced over matter thus agitating it. And there was a creation, the whole creation took place. Simply by Krishna's glance, matter becomes agitated. And then becomes pregnant and gives birth to the living entities. Krishna injects the living entities into the womb of material nature. tasmin garbham dadamyaham, Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita. It is simply by Krishna's glance that plants, trees, animals and all of the living entities come forth. How is this possible? None of us can say simply by glancing over my wife, I can make her pregnant. Not possible for us. Although this is impossible for us, it is not impossible for Krishna. The Brahma Samhita says, angani yasya sakalendriya vritti manti. What does this mean? It means every part of Krishna's body has all the capabilities of all the other parts of his body. With our eyes, we can only see. But Krishna merely by seeing can make others pregnant. There is no need of sex. For simply by glancing, Krishna can create pregnancy. In Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says in the 9th chapter, 10th verse, maya dhyakshena prakriti hi suyatesu characharam. By my supervision, material nature gives birth to all moving and non-moving living beings. The word aksha means ice. So akshena indicates that all living entities take birth because of the Lord's glance.

No. So therefore, simply by Krishna's grace. If we become devotees, if we become Krishna conscious, there will be no scarcity, we will have plenty and we will be having prosperity. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 43rd verse of the 8th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, which is Queen Kunti's prayer to Krishna, and explains the meaning of the verse, highlighting Krishna's various attributes and roles.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 43rd verse of the 8th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is the last prayer by Queen Kunti in this chapter. Shri Krishna Krishna Sakha Vrishni Rishabhava Nidrup Rajanya Vamsha Dahanana Pavarga Virya Govinda Godvija Surarthi Haravatara Yogeshwara Kila Guru Bhagavan Namaste. Kunti Devi is addressing Krishna in different ways in this prayer. The meaning of this verse is, O Krishna, O friend of Arjuna, O chief among the descendants of Vrishni, You are the destroyer of those political parties which are disturbing elements on this earth. Your prowess never deteriorates, you are the proprietor of the transcendental abode, and you descend to relieve the distress of the cows, the brahmanas, and the devotees. You possess all mystic powers and you are the preceptor of the entire universe.

### Srila Prabhupada's Purport, Krishna's Abode, Role of Kings, Disturbing Elements

**Key Quote:** "Actually the kings are meant to rule over the citizens exactly as the representative of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the verse, discussing Krishna's transcendental abode, his pastimes, his role in maintaining the universe, and the responsibility of kings to act as representatives of Krishna.

You are the Almighty God and I offer you my respectful obeisances. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, a summary of the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna is made herein by Srimati Kunti Devi. Kunti Devi knows very well Krishna is not just a relative, not just an ordinary person, not just another powerful Kshatriya, but Krishna is the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Personality of God. And he has multiple relationships with his devotees. Accordingly, he is addressed here in different ways. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, the Almighty Lord has his eternal transcendental abode where he is engaged in keeping Surabhi cows in the Goloka Brindavana. Krishna is always engaged in pastimes with his devotees, especially the cowherd boys, the cows, the gopis, like that. Krishna is served by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune in Goloka Brindavana. He descends on the material world to reclaim his devotees. He is the one who has the power to annihilate the disturbing elements in groups of political parties and kings who are supposed to be in charge of administration work. Actually the kings are meant to rule over the citizens exactly as the representative of Krishna, because in reality it is Krishna who maintains everyone. Eko bahunam yo viddhati kama. But if the king does not conduct himself as the representative of Krishna, then he is not fit to be the ruler of the people in general. Then Krishna either incarnates to destroy such rulers, or he empowers his devotees to actually end the rule of such a king. So, this is a very important point.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna creates, maintains and annihilates by his unlimited energies."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain Krishna's energies and how he works through them, emphasizing that Krishna is always full of prowess. He also highlights the importance of cows, brahmanas, and devotees for the general welfare of all living beings.

There are so many non-devotional elements. So, Srila Prabhupada further explains, Krishna creates, maintains, and annihilates by his unlimited energies. The shastras say that Krishna has nothing to do personally, but that doesn't mean he is inactive. He works through his energies, he acts through his energies, and his energies are simply following his will. Exactly according to his will the different energies will work and they will carry out Krishna's instructions or Krishna's desires. Even though Krishna creates, maintains, and annihilates, still he is always full with prowess and does not deteriorate in potency. In the material world we have experienced when we expand our energy, unless we renew, we feel exhausted, whereas Krishna, he employs his energies for so many different activities, but his energy never reduces. He is always full of all energies. Further Srila Prabhupada says the cows, the brahmanas, and the devotees of the Lord are all objects of special attention. Cows, brahmanas, and devotees. Krishna particularly is interested in the welfare of the cows and the brahmanas and devotees. Now all these cows, brahmanas, and Vaishnavas are object of special attention because they are very important factors for the general welfare of all

**Summary:** The speaker analyzes Kunti Devi's different forms of address to Lord Krishna in her prayer, focusing on the term 'Krishna Sakha' and explaining how addressing Krishna in relation to his intimate devotees is pleasing to him.

living beings. Now, different forms of address of Kunti Devi in this last prayer. Kunti addresses Lord Krishna as Krishna Sakha. Why? Because she knows although Arjuna is her own son, but Lord Krishna is more intimately related with Arjuna than with her. This is a fact. So, Kunti wants to please Krishna by addressing him in his relationship with Arjuna. So, Kunti wants to please Krishna by addressing him in his relationship with his intimate devotees. That is another secret we have to learn from the Srimad Bhagavatam, from the Acharyas, from pure devotees, that they know how to please Krishna. The very way of addressing Krishna by making a reference to his intimate relation with his pure devotees, that is very, very pleasing to Krishna. Just like Krishna is addressed as Devaki Nandana, Yashodha Nandana, Nanda Nandana. These are all ways of addressing Krishna, indicating thereby that Krishna has an intimate relationship with his devotees.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna specially saved Draupadi and just Draupadi had to call out Krishna's name Govinda please say me that's all Krishna immediately responded"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Krishna's relationship with Draupadi, his appearance in the Vrishni dynasty, and his role in relieving the earth's burden by destroying demoniac kings.

Now, the term Krishna also refers to Draupadi also. So, Krishna Saka also indicates Krishna's relationship with Draupadi. Draupadi was saved from being insulted when Duryodhana and Karna attempted to strip her naked. Krishna specially saved Draupadi, and just Draupadi had to call out Krishna's name, Govinda please save me, that's all. Krishna immediately responded. So even Draupadi is a very special devotee of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Kunti also addresses Lord Krishna as Vrishni Rishabha, the chief of the Vrishni dynasty or the best of the descendants among Vrishni. It is because Krishna appeared in this Vrishni dynasty that this dynasty became famous. Kunti already has mentioned just as Malaysia and the Malaya hills became famous because of the sandalwood that grows there. Sandalwood can grow anywhere, but since it happens to be growing in Malaya, so therefore the Vrishni dynasty also became famous after Krishna appeared in the Vrishni dynasty as the son of Vasudeva. Kunti Devi also addresses Lord Krishna as they destroy the political parties or royal dynasties that disturb the earth. Earth is simply overburdened by demoniac kings, by those who exploit the innocent citizens. The earth is overburdened, whereas when the earth's burden is relieved, when Krishna appears or when one of incarnations of Krishna appear in this world, then the earth

**Key Quote:** "King is meant to be the representative of God"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the role of a king as the representative of God, emphasizing Krishna's supremacy and the importance of devotional service for understanding God, contrasting it with the impersonal conception.

feels relief. Now generally in the monarchy system the king is honored very, very gorgeously. Why? King is meant to be the representative of God. So king should not be treated as an ordinary person, particularly when the king is a devotee of Krishna. So in Sanskrit king is also called Naradeva, which means God in human form. So his duty, the king's duty, is same as Krishna's duty, that just like God maintains all living beings, same way the king is a supreme citizen in this state and is responsible for the welfare of all the citizens of this state. So Prabhupada makes this point, Krishna is not impersonal, Krishna is the supreme person, but each one of us we are limited, Krishna is unlimited. This difference always exists between us and Krishna. Then our individual persons is such that we have limited knowledge, we are limited opulences, but Krishna has unlimited forms or opulences or knowledge. Krishna is unlimited. So we can never compare ourselves with Krishna, but at the same time we can understand we are very, very tiny and we do possess some of the qualities which Krishna has got. So therefore the understanding of God is possible only if we engage in pure devotional service. Now in the impersonal conception we are not able to understand exactly who or what is God. They simply deny different attributes of God without realizing that God cannot be understood simply by reading some books or simply by hearing some descriptions. We have to hear from the right source, we have to read the right books written by a devotee.

So now Suta Goswami is explaining what happened after Kunti offered her prayers to Krishna, who was leaving Hastinapura in order to go back to Dwaraka. So Suta Vacha Prathayetham Kalapadai. Prathayetham Kalapadai. Parinoota khilodayah mandam jahasa vaikuntho mohayanivamayayah. The meaning of this verse is, Suta Goswami said, "The Lord, thus hearing the prayers of Kunti Devi composed in choice words for his glorification, mildly smiled. That smile was as enchanting as his mystic smile." He said, "The Lord, thus hearing the prayers of Kunti Devi composed in choice words for his glimpsing power."

So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "Anything that is enchanting in the world is said to be a representation of the Lord." Ultimately, Krishna is always the source of everything, in this world, in the spiritual world, everywhere. He is the ultimate source. Janmad yasiya taha. He is the ultimate source. Aham sarvasya prabhavo. So, anything enchanting is a representation of Krishna. Now, the conditioned souls, that means the living entities in this world who are trapped in the illusory energy, they are enchanted by Krishna's mystic powers.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the enchantment of devotees with that of conditioned souls, emphasizing Krishna's pleasure with sincere prayers, even if imperfect.

But the devotees of Krishna, the pure devotees, are also enchanted in a different way by the glories of Krishna. And for the devotees, Krishna always bestows his blessings. So, Sri La Pravupada says, just like Krishna has many energies which work differently. So, Kunti Devi prayed to the Lord just to enunciate a fragment of his glories. The Lord's glories are unlimited, because he is an unlimited personality. He is the unlimited personality. Everybody else is limited. Only Krishna is unlimited. Now, devotees, when they glorify the Lord, they glorify him with chosen words, Kalapadaihi. And therefore, the Lord is known as Uttama Shloka. The best of poetry is composed to describe the Supreme Lord. Uttama Shloka. Now, Sri La Pravupada says one important point here, that any amount of chosen words is not sufficient to enumerate the Lord's glory. Yet, the Supreme Lord is satisfied by the prayers offered by different pure devotees, because the prayers are offered by his...

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is pleased with that."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a father pleased by a child's broken language to illustrate Krishna's acceptance of sincere prayers, and introduces the concept of Maya as both illusion and mercy.

beloved devotees, he accepts them. Prabhupada gives an example, just like a father is satisfied even by the broken linguistic attempts of the growing child. This is a common experience for us that when a child speaks in the beginning in a broken language, it is very pleasing to the father. So similarly, even a beginner in Krishna consciousness offers sincere prayers to Krishna, Krishna is pleased with that. But Krishna's devotees who know Krishna, they always offer wonderful prayers which are composed by chosen words. Here in this verse, the word maya has been used. Maya has got two different meanings. One meaning of the word maya is delusion or illusion. And another meaning of the word maya is mercy. Now in this verse, the word maya has been used by Sita Goswami in the sense of mercy. It is the Lord's mercy upon Kunti Devi, who offered wonderful prayers,

that Kunti Devi was able to please the Lord by offering him wonderful prayers. So it's the mercy of the Lord that he accepted those prayers, and in return, he mildly smiled at Kunti Devi, indicating acceptance of the prayers, wonderfully offered by Kunti Devi. So Srila Prabhupada says, if Krishna is pleased and even smiles a little, then the whole universe will be pleased. See, Kunti Devi has pleased the Lord by prayers, and Krishna is pleased by Kunti Devi's prayers, then Krishna is pleased means the whole universe is pleased. Tasmanti trade jag. If Krishna is pleased or satisfied, then the whole universe will be satisfied. Why? Because the whole universe is a part and parcel of Krishna only. But why not? Only then will we become liberation, reciprocatedband using many forms and microphones.

### Analogy of the body, Centrality of Krishna, Root of manifestation

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Similarly, till Krishna is pleased. You cannot make the whole world happy. Not possible."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of satisfying hunger to illustrate the importance of pleasing Krishna, the speaker emphasizes Krishna's central role in creation.

Krishna will be satisfied if we do so. Just like it is given elsewhere in the Bhagavatam, prāṇopahārācchayathendriyāṇo, just like the parts of the body, they are working. Just like when there is food in the stomach, then the hunger is mitigated and one feels satisfaction. So, Srila Prabhupāda gives an example here. Even though we have various senses, which can be satisfied in different ways by sense gratification, if a person is hungry, then the sense gratification will not work till the hunger is mitigated. Similarly, till Krishna is pleased, you cannot make the whole world happy. Not possible. Now we should always remember Krishna is the central point of this entire creation. And Krishna is also like the root of this manifestation. Lord Krishna is the root of this manifestation. So, just like you water a tree by pouring water at the root of the tree, similarly, by satisfying Krishna, you can satisfy all the others.

### Krishna as the source, Material and spiritual creation, Maya as forgetfulness

**Key Quote:** "So, when you forget Krishna, that is maya."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna is the source of both material and spiritual creation, and defines Maya as the forgetfulness of Krishna.

Krishna declares in the Bhagavad Gita, "I am the source of everything." So, Krishna being the source, when we please Krishna or satisfy Krishna or make an offering to Krishna, then everyone becomes satisfied. Now, Srila Prabhupada further explains that the material creation of Krishna is the source of everything. The material creation and the spiritual creation are both creations of Krishna, but they are existing side by side. Even though they are existing side by side, the material creation is another part of the spiritual creation. Just like the cloud in the sky is a creation of the sunshine. Sunshine is not created by the cloud, but the cloud is created by the sunshine. So, when the cloud is created by the sunshine, it covers the very sunshine, which was the cause of its creation. But actually, can the cloud cover the sun or sunshine? Not possible. So, the cloud, when it covers, it covers our vision. It covers our vision. Similarly, maya means absence of Krishna consciousness. So, when you forget Krishna, that is maya, and that is a condition of all the living beings in the world. And that is a condition of all the living beings in the world. And that is a condition of all the living beings in the world. And that is a condition of all the living beings in this world who are taken birth by force of karma. They are forgetful of Krishna.

### Krishna's all-pervasiveness, Overcoming Maya, Offering prayers with feeling, Following devotees

**Key Quote:** "So, when we come to Krishna consciousness, then there is no more maya."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Krishna's presence in every atom and heart, and how Krishna consciousness helps overcome Maya, emphasizing the importance of offering prayers with feeling and following the example of great devotees like Kunti.

Therefore, they are in maya. In this material world, Krishna is all-pervading. He has entered into every atom. He has entered into everybody's heart. Why are we unable to see Krishna who sits in our heart? Because we have been covered by the illusion of maya. That is the only reason. So, when we come to Krishna consciousness, then there is no more maya. No more maya. Now, Srila Prabhupada says another important point. Offering prayers to Supreme Lord means offering prayers with feelings. We are persons. Krishna is the Supreme Person. So, there is an exchange between the devotee and the Lord. What is that exchange? That exchange is that we offer a praise to Krishna feelingly. So Srila Prabhupada is telling us that Krishna is Uttama shloka, glorified by the choicest poetry, but all these poems or all these songs and all these creations are actually full of meaning, full of meaning and very beautifully composed, and many many prayers are there because Krishna has so many devotees and they offer wonderful prayers. So we should learn these prayers and following the footsteps of great devotees like Kunti, we should offer such prayers to Krishna that will be pleasing to Krishna.

So this verse describes the Lord's departure from Hastinapura to Dwaraka after Yudhishthira had been installed as the emperor of the world after the battle of Kurukshetra. He accepted the prayers of Srimati Kunti Devi, and he is now preparing to leave, but he was stopped by Yudhishthira, and it is explained by Srila Prabhupada what was the kind of interaction between King Yudhishthira and Krishna. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "No one could make Lord Krishna stay at Hastinapura when he decided to start for Dwaraka, but the simple request of King Yudhishthira that the Lord remain there for a few days more was immediately effective. This signifies that the power of King Yudhishthira was loving affection, which the Lord could not deny. The Almighty God is thus conquered only by loving service and nothing else."

**Key Quote:** "Formerly the whole planet was known as Bharatvarsha."
**Summary:** This segment explains the historical significance of Hastinapura, the prevalence of Vedic culture, and the concept of Bharatvarsha encompassing the entire planet.

He is fully independent in all his dealings, but he voluntarily accepts obligations by the loving affection of his pure devotees. So Srila Prabhupada explains in another place the significance of the word Gajasa Hwayam that is used in these words. The capital of the world empire was called in those days Hastinapura or Gajasa Hwaya. Gaja means elephant. Hasti also means elephant. Formally the kings used to keep many, many horses and elephants. And in those days, there was only one king ruling the entire world, and the capital of that king who was ruling the whole world was Hastinapura. So there was only one flag, and these things are mentioned in the Srimad Bhagavatam. There were not many states, and the world was under one culture. Which culture? The Vedic culture. The advanced people in those times were Aryans. Now Srila Prabhupada explains Indo-European stock are also Aryans. They came from Central India and Central Asia. That is the history. Caspian Sea. Prabhupada gives an example. What today is called Caspian Sea was the place of Kashyapa Muni. From word Kashyapa comes the word Caspian. Formerly, another example Srila Prabhupada gives, formerly the capital of Afghanistan was known as Gandhara Desha. Now it has become Kandahar by historic context. By historical references, Srila Prabhupada says, it will be ascertained that the whole planet was known as Bharatvarsha, unlike now what is called as Bharat or Bharatvarsha is only the sub-continent of India. Formerly the whole planet was known as Bharatvarsha, and before it was known as Bharatvarsha, the whole planet, it was called Ilaavrata Varsha.

### Mahabharata, Kunti's prayers, Krishna's smile

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Mahabharata means greater Bharata."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the Mahabharata as the history of greater Bharatvarsha and Krishna's acceptance of Kunti's prayers.

But since the time of King Bharata, who was the forefather of the Pandavas, the planet was called Bharatvarsha, and throughout the planet there was Vedic culture, and Srila Prabhupada says the treasures are still available, and the history of the whole world is called Mahabharata. Mahabharata means greater Bharata. It is like nowadays we have greater channels. Greater Chennai, greater Mumbai. So those days when Mahabharata was compiled, it means history of the greater Bharatvarsha, the entire planet. The king of Hastinapura, once again Prabhupada is telling, was the emperor of the whole world, of this whole planet, earth planet. There were other states, but they were paying tax to the emperor. Now Krishna, after receiving the nice prayers by Kunti Devi, nicely composed and accepted the prayers by the word which is indicating that, Badham. Badham means, "Yes, that's alright." He smiled. Krishna smiled because whatever Kunti had said, that is true. There is no exaggeration. So Krishna smiled because whatever Kunti said, she was so pleased to enunciate the glories of Lord Krishna. Krishna, because she knows what is Krishna. In this way, Krishna was preparing to return to Dwaraka. Now Yudhishthira Maharaj requested Krishna, "My dear Krishna, my dear brother, if you kindly stay for a few days more, be very nice."

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "If we increase our love for Krishna, we will be able to do everything."
**Summary:** This segment highlights that love for Krishna allows devotees to 'purchase' Krishna, influencing his actions.

So Prabhupada explains, Krishna is fully independent. He could have refused. "No, I cannot stay more. I have to go." But here it is said, premna. Premna means out of love. Yudhishthira implored Krishna, "Please stay back a few more days." So it is to be understood that Maharaj Yudhishthira cannot order the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but by love, everything is possible. Therefore, Srila Prabhupada says, if we increase our love for Krishna, we will be able to do everything. If we increase our love for Krishna, then Krishna becomes purchased by us. In an earlier verse, in the prayers by Kunti Devi, she said, Namo Akinchanavittaya. Akinchanavitta. He is the property of the pure devotees. Krishna is the property of the pure devotees. So that same point, Prabhupada is telling here, if we increase our love for Krishna, we will be able to do everything. Then Krishna becomes purchased by us. Krishna agrees. Whatever his loving devotees say, that is his kindness. Krishna is actually everyone's order giver.

**Verse References:** BG 1.21-22
**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "We can purchase Krishna by love."
**Summary:** This segment uses the example of Arjuna ordering Krishna as his chariot driver to illustrate how love allows devotees to influence Krishna.

But he accepts the order of his devotee. Now another example Srila Prabhupada gives, when Krishna was driving Arjuna's chariot, it is described in the beginning of the Bhagavad Gita. Arjuna said, Senayorubhayor madhyeratham sthapayam echchuta. So what is the meaning of this, my dear Krishna? You are achchuta. Achchuta means one who never falls back. So, Arjuna is telling Krishna, "You accepted the post as my charioteer, Parthasarathi." So, Krishna has to carry out the order of the king who is the master on the chariot. And chariot driver, after all, is supposed to take the order from the master and accordingly drive the chariot. But, Arjuna knew, Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead. Arjuna was very clear. Only, out of friendship, Krishna agreed to become Arjuna's chariot driver. So, when Arjuna requested Krishna, radham sthapayam echchuta, just place my chariot between the two armies. He was little hesitating that I am ordering Krishna who is the supreme personality of Godhead. But then, in spite of that, Arjuna is reminding Krishna also, although you are my master, for the time being, but because you have voluntarily accepted to become my chariot driver, therefore, I am asking you, it is not out of disrespect. So, Krishna also responded by telling, "Yes, I am willing. This is the position."

**Key Quote:** "all departments of knowledge are really meant for finding out Krishna."
**Summary:** This segment explains that understanding God through Vedic study is difficult, as Krishna is veiled by Yogamaya, but all knowledge ultimately aims to find Krishna.

So, Prabhupada says, "We can purchase Krishna by love." And that is stated in the Brahma Samhita. Veda Shudurla. Dhurlabham adhurlabham atma bhaktau. Dhurlabha means very, very difficult to obtain. So, Brahma says, if you officially study the Vedas, to find out God, or to know about God, that is very, very difficult. So, for those who are trying to understand God by cultivating knowledge of the Vedas, or searching for God in the Vedas, it is very, very difficult for them to obtain Krishna. Krishna also says in the Bhagavad Gita, Naham Prakash Sarvasya Yogamaya Samavrtha. "I do not expose myself to everyone, because I am covered by the Yogamaya curtain." So, also Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, Vedash Sarvair Ahameva Vedyaha, that all departments of knowledge are really meant for finding out Krishna. So, whichever branch of knowledge you take, Veda means all branches of knowledge, chemistry, physics, politics, sociology, medicine, whichever branch of knowledge that is there in the Vedas, the aim is to find out Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "the purpose of all education, the purpose of studying the Vedas, the purpose of getting any knowledge, is to know Krishna."
**Summary:** This segment narrates Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's Krishna-centered teaching of grammar and concludes that the ultimate goal of all knowledge is to know Krishna for a successful life.

And, this was actually taught by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. When he was teaching grammar to his students, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, at a very young age, he became a scholar in Sanskrit grammar. So, he was teaching his students, he had opened a small school, and he was explaining what is called as Dhatu. Dhatu means verb in Sanskrit grammar. So, he was explaining simply Krishna. Krishna. Through all the methods of teaching different aspects of Sanskrit grammar, he would only teach about Krishna. That's all. The students somehow became a little dissatisfied. That means, Nimai Pandit, he was known as Nimai Pandit, he simply explains Krishna, Krishna, Krishna in everything he speaks or everything he teaches, he only explains Krishna. But, actually, that's the real point. Whatever is the subject matter, the goal is to understand Krishna, to know Krishna. That's the perfection of all knowledge. So, the Chaitanya Charitamrita, which describes this particular pastime of the Lord, Chaitanya Charitamrita says, these students, they are Adhama Paduya, inferior, very low grade students. They are not interested in understanding God or Krishna. They want some grammar. For what purpose? What is the use of learning the grammar without knowing Krishna? So, Prabhupada concludes, the purpose of all education, the purpose of studying the Vedas, the purpose of getting any knowledge, is to know Krishna. That is the ultimate goal of all education. And, if we understand Krishna, if we know Krishna, our life is ultimately completely successful. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "As the rightful claimant for the throne, the whole battle of Kurukshetra was fought and millions were massacred, were killed in the battle. So Yudhishthira is thinking, for me to be enthroned as the emperor of the world, so much of massacre, it is not, he feels it is not justified."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Yudhishthira's grief over the massacre in the battle of Kurukshetra, fought for him to be enthroned, and the immense scale of the battle.

So it is being described here by Suta Goswami that Yudhishthira was very much aggrieved for the huge massacre that had happened as a result of the battle of Kurukshetra. So Srila Prabhupada explains this elaborately in the purport: "The pious king Yudhishthira was mortified because of the mass massacre of human beings in the battle of Kurukshetra, especially on his account." So it is explained, why Yudhishthira was so aggrieved? "This was visible mainly in the Bodhisattvas nativity. And yet all none could pretty see it." So in some sense it would seem that the rules of the Yudhishthira contraption was actually a result of that conflict. But the understanding of which is that Yudhishthira was feeling much aggrieved regarding the things about whom he did not want to see, because in one sense there was no need of fighting. As the rightful claimant for the throne, the whole battle of Kurukshetra was fought and millions were massacred, were killed in the battle. So Yudhishthira is thinking, for me to be enthroned as the emperor of the world, so much of massacre, it is not, he feels it is not justified. But on the principle of justice, Yudhishthira was to replace Duryodhana. The whole clique of politics centered around this point, and all the kings and residents of the whole world became involved in this fight between the rival brothers. Lord Krishna was also there on the side of King Yudhishthira. It is said in the Mahabharata, Adiparva, that 640 million men were killed in the 18 days of the battle of Kurukshetra, and some hundreds of thousands were missing.

**Key Quote:** "And it is an authentic historical record, this itihasa, itihasa means history."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the historical authenticity of the Mahabharata and Ramayana as itihasas, histories of Vedic culture, focusing on the stories of Lord Ramachandra and the Pandavas/Kauravas.

Practically, this was the greatest battle in the world within 5000 years. So, there is a detailed description in the Mahabharata about this entire episode of the battle, events leading to the battle. And it is an authentic historical record, this itihasa, itihasa means history. And two famous itihasas based on the history of Vedic culture, are the Ramayana and Mahabharata. So, as you are aware, Ramayana is the history of Lord Ramachandra, the incarnation of the Supreme Lord appearing on the earth and ruling the entire world from Ayodhya. And Mahabharata is the history of the Pandavas and Kauravas, and they are ruling the world.

**Key Quote:** "So, after the battle, Krishna and these sages headed by Vyasa, they all tried to pacify and explain and convince Yudhishthira that Yudhishthira is not responsible for this killing."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Krishna and other sages tried to convince Yudhishthira that the battle was justified and that he was not responsible for the killings, but Yudhishthira remained unconvinced.

So, Prabhupada further explains in the purport, this mass killing simply to enthrone Maharaja Yudhishthira was too mortifying for whom? For Yudhishthira. So, he tried to be convinced with evidences from histories by great sages like Vyasa and by the Supreme Lord Krishna himself, that the fight was justified, because the cause was just. So, justifying the fighting in spite of the huge number of people who died in this battle, in spite of that big number of deaths, the sages headed by Vyasa and Krishna himself, both of them, they wanted to pacify Yudhishthira and explained to him by historical evidence of previous instances where such big battles were fought for the sake of justice to prevail in this world. Duryodhana had occupied the post by cheating the Pandavas, by banishing them to the forest, by his so many tricks and by force, though Yudhishthira was powerful, but he was just being very morally upright in every instance that Duryodhana cheated the Pandavas, headed by Yudhishthira. So, after the battle, Krishna and these sages headed by Vyasa, they all tried to pacify and explain and convince Yudhishthira that Yudhishthira is not responsible for this killing. But Maharaj Yudhishthira could not be satisfied, even though he was instructed by the greatest personalities of his time. Somehow, Yudhishthira was not convinced, and that will be described in the rest of this chapter, towards the end of this chapter.

### superhuman action, Krishna's purpose, Bhishma Dev

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna's purpose of Yudhishthira not getting convinced is that Krishna wanted to perform still more superhuman action."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses why Krishna didn't convince Yudhishthira, suggesting it was to allow Yudhishthira to receive instructions from the dying Bhishma Dev.

How Yudhishthira was not convinced that this battle was justified. Now, Krishna is being described in these words as the performer of superhuman actions, Adbhuta Karmana. Krishnena Adbhuta Karmana. But in this particular instance of trying to convince Yudhishthira, neither Krishna nor Vyasa could convince King Yudhishthira. They could not. So, does it mean Krishna failed to be a superhuman actor? The answer is no, certainly not. How do we understand this? Krishna did not fail in his attempt to convince Yudhishthira. Why? Because Krishna is the supreme lord, He is the Ishwara, supreme controller, and he is seated as a super soul in the hearts of both King Yudhishthira and Vyasa Deva. So, Krishna is in the background, but he is the supreme controller. So, Krishna's purpose of Yudhishthira not getting convinced is that Krishna wanted to perform still more superhuman action. As super soul of King Yudhishthira, Krishna did not allow King Yudhishthira to become convinced by the words of Vyasa and others including himself, because Krishna's desire was that Yudhishthira should hear instructions from the dying Bhishma Dev, from the dying Bhishma Dev.

**Key Quote:** "Even though Bhishma was fighting on the opposite side... Bhishma is great devotee. He has affection for the Pandavas. He knows the Pandavas cause is just. Still Bhishma had to fight on the side of Duryodhana."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights the unique situation of Bhishma, a great devotee who knew the Pandavas' cause was just, yet was obligated to fight for Duryodhana.

Now, Bhishma was also another great devotee of the supreme lord Krishna. Even though Bhishma was fighting on the opposite side, this is very, very unique situation. Bhishma is great devotee. He has affection for the Pandavas. He knows the Pandavas cause is just. Still, Bhishma had to fight on the side of Duryodhana. Now the supreme lord Krishna also wanted that at the last stage of his material existence, the great warrior Bhishma Deva should see Krishna personally at the time of his quitting the body, and Bhishma should also see his beloved grandchildren, the Pandavas, and thus pass away very peacefully, because Bhishma Deva was not at all satisfied to fight against the Pandavas, because he knew Pandavas cause is just. So Prabhupada explains the reason why Bhishma Deva was constrained to fight on the side of the Kauravas. The reason is that Kshatriyas are very stern people, and therefore Bhishma Deva, he was obliged to take the side of Duryodhana. Why was he obliged to take the side of Duryodhana? Because Bhishma was maintained at the expense of Duryodhana.

**Key Quote:** "Bhishma actually was the one who was supposed to rule the whole world, but he voluntarily gave up for the sake of his father."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the story of Bhishma's sacrifice, giving up his claim to the throne for his father's happiness and his subsequent obligation to Duryodhana due to being maintained by him.

Now elsewhere Prabhupada explains that actually the kingdom belonged to Bhishma Deva. How is that? Bhishma was the eldest son of the emperor Shantanu, and the emperor, when he actually retired, this Shantanu was a forefather of the Pandavas and Kauravas. When he retired, Bhishma should have taken charge of ruling the whole world as the emperor. But because Shantanu wanted to marry one daughter of a fisherman, one Satyavati, hmm, it's a very long history. So Shantanu wanted to marry the daughter of a fisherman, Satyavati, but Satyavati's father refused, because he calculated that the son born of my daughter through this emperor will not be able to inherit the post of the emperor, because the elder son has got a son through his first wife. So what is the use of marrying my daughter to this emperor? So he refused, this fisherman refused Shantanu. Shantanu said okay. But when Bhishma found out that my father has been refused, he went to the fisherman and said, what is the reason you are refusing to marry your daughter to my father? So then the fisherman explained. Bhishma said, I forsake the claim to the throne. The son born of your daughter will be the next emperor. Then Bhishma thought that the fisherman will accept. The fisherman said okay, the son born of my daughter will be the emperor, but after that son, your son will claim the throne of the whole world, because you are forsaking, but he may not forsake. So then Bhishma agreed to remain a brahmachari, not to marry, and that way Shantanu was able to marry that fisherman's daughter Satyavati. So Bhishma actually was the one who was supposed to rule the whole world, but he voluntarily gave up for the sake of his father. Therefore Krishna, Bhishma is not actually a dependent, not really a dependent, but he assumed a humble position that Duryodhana maintained me, and so he fought on the side of the Kauravas. I will stop here.

In this session, we will be discussing two verses, the 47th and the 48th verses of the 8th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 47th verse: आह राजा धर्म सुतः चिन्तयन् सुरुदाम् वधं प्राकृतेन आत्मना विप्रा स्नेह मोह वशंगतः. The meaning of this verse is: King Yudhishthira, son of Dharma, overwhelmed by the death of his friends, was aggrieved just like a common materialistic man. O sages! Thus deluded by affection, he began to speak. Suta Goswami is describing how Yudhishthira was aggrieved and what did he say, how did he express himself. So he was overwhelmed just like a common man. Now Srila Prabhupada explains something very significant in the purport. Srila Prabhupada says, King Yudhishthira, though he was not expected to become aggrieved like a common man, became deluded by worldly affection by the will of the Supreme Lord Krishna, just as Arjuna was apparently deluded on the battlefield of Kurukshetra before the war began, again by the arrangement of Krishna only. Both Yudhishthira and Arjuna are pure devotees. All the five Pandavas are pure devotees. So there is no question of them becoming deluded by Maya. So it is Krishna's arrangement for Arjuna to become deluded, so that Krishna could speak Bhagavad Gita for our benefit. Similarly, Krishna wanted Bhishma to instruct Yudhishthira. And through Yudhishthira, Krishna wanted Bhishma to instruct the whole world about the intricacies of Dharma. And for that purpose, he was able to tell the whole world about the intricacies of Dharma.

### body vs. soul, duty, Krishna's plan

**Key Quote:** "Just like this cloth we are wearing is simply an external covering for the real person within the dress."
**Summary:** This segment focuses on the distinction between the body and the soul, emphasizing the importance of fulfilling one's duty without being attached to the material body, and reiterates Krishna's plan behind Yudhishthira's delusion.

Krishna arranged that Yudhishthira should become overwhelmed by worldly affection for the loss of so many people in this battle. Srila Prabhupada explains in this purport, a man who sees knows well that the living entity is neither the body nor the mind, but is transcendental to the material conception of life. You have heard this many times in the Bhagavad Gita and all the scriptures, it is explained, we are spirit soul, we are not the body, we are not the mind. Both the gross body and the subtle body are coverings for the real person within the body, that is the spirit soul. The common man thinks of violence and non-violence in terms of the body, but that is a kind of delusion. Just considering the body alone is a big mistake. Everyone is duty bound according to one's occupation. Occupational duties, swadharma or varnashrama dharma. A kshatriya is bound to fight for the right cause regardless of the opposite party. In this case, Yudhishthira was fighting against his own cousins, the Kauravas. But for the right cause, a kshatriya should not refuse to fight. That is what Krishna explains in the Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna also. In discharge of duty, one should not be disturbed by annihilation of the material body, which is only an external dress of the living soul. In the Bhagavad Gita in the second chapter, Krishna explains, just like this cloth we are wearing is simply an external covering for the real person within the dress. Similarly, the body itself, the physical body is simply an external covering of the spirit soul. And when it is worn out, then one discards that. That is what is called death, discarding this body and accept a new body. All this was perfectly known to Yudhishthira Maharaj. But by the will of the Supreme Lord Krishna, he became just like a common man, because there was another great idea behind this delusion.

### Bhishma's instructions, akshauhini, warfare

**Key Quote:** "King Yudhishthira would be instructed by Bhishma, as Arjuna was instructed by Lord Krishna himself."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the purpose of Yudhishthira's delusion, which was to receive instructions from Bhishma, and then details the composition of an akshauhini and the scale of the Kurukshetra war.

Krishna had another plan, why Yudhishthira should become deluded. What is that great idea? King Yudhishthira would be instructed by Bhishma, as Arjuna was instructed by Lord Krishna himself. This was the idea for Yudhishthira to become deluded because of the massacre, mass massacre. The 48th verse: अहो मे पश्यत अज्ञानम् हृदि रुढम् दुरात्मनः परकीयस्य एव देहस्य अहो मे अक्षौहिणीर् हतः. The meaning of this verse is, King Yudhishthira said, O my Lord, I am the most sinful man. Just see my heart, which is full of ignorance. This body, which is ultimately meant for others, has killed many many phalanxes of men. Phalanx means akshauhini in Sanskrit. Then the purport should be appropriate to explain what is the count of a phalanx or akshauhini division. A solid phalanx of 21,870 chariots, 21,870 elephants, 109,650 infantry, and 65,600 cavalry is called an akshauhini. Chariots here mean chariot fighters. And elephants means on elephant back there are powerful warriors who fight from elephant back. And infantry means those on foot, soldiers on foot. And cavalry means those who are on horseback, fighters on horseback. So, these four kinds of fighters are there in a battle in the Vedic times, in the Vedic culture. So, akshauhini division is very very big. 21,000 and odd chariots, 21,000 and odd elephants, 109,000 infantry, and 65,000 odd cavalry. So many. And like this how many divisions were there totally on the battlefield of Kurukshetra? 11 on the Kaurava side. 11 akshauhini divisions on the Kaurava side, and 7 akshauhini divisions on the Pandava side. Totally 18 akshauhini divisions were fighting in this battle of Kurukshetra.

### responsibility, Yudhishthira's perspective, body's purpose

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Yudhishthira as the most pious king of the world takes for himself the responsibility for killing such a huge number of living beings because the battle was fought to reinstate him on the throne."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Yudhishthira's sense of responsibility for the deaths in the Kurukshetra war and his understanding of the body's purpose as service to others.

So, Prabhupada further explains, many akshauhinis were killed on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. That's a fact. Maharaj Yudhishthira as the most pious king of the world takes for himself the responsibility for killing such a huge number of living beings because the battle was fought to reinstate him on the throne. Yudhishthira is seeing from this perspective. After all, Duryodhana was ruling very nicely, even though he was not the rightful claimant. But he was ruling. He was a Kshatriya ruling properly. He was guided by proper Brahmanas who were expert in state administration. So, just for the sake of me to become the emperor, so much of killing. It's not justified. So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport the thinking of Yudhishthira. What was his thinking like? This body is after all meant for others. It is meant for others. While there is life in the body, it is meant for the service of others, paropakaara. And when it is dead, it is meant to be eaten by dogs and jackals or maggots. After all the body will be, when the soul leaves the body after death, the body is either burnt away to ashes in a fire, cremated, or it is buried and it will be eaten away by maggots underneath the earth. Or some people just leave the body for being eaten by other birds or vultures or other animals. So, in any case, the body is going to be finished. So, but Yudhishthira is sorry because for such a temporary body, such a huge massacre was committed. In terms of Yudhishthira seeing from a perspective that after all the body is meant for doing some welfare activity while I am living. And what have I done? Just because I want to be the emperor, such a huge massacre. This is not at all justified, not at all justified.

**Key Quote:** "It's meant for doing welfare activity for the other people, paropakaara."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Arjuna's and Yudhishthira's reactions to the war, highlighting the conscientious nature of pure devotees and emphasizing that the human body should be used for welfare activities rather than sense gratification.

So, this is Yudhishthira's way of thinking. And further verses will explain how he is the most pious king and he is very sensitive to what has happened. So, Yudhishthira is behaving like this because he is a pure devotee. A pure devotee is very very conscientious. Arjuna, he is thinking, okay, we are all ready to fight. But what are the consequences of such a ghastly war? What are the consequences? He is thinking about it. Is it really necessary to fight in this battle? And whom am I going to kill? My own kinsmen? And for what? For just getting a throne, ascending a throne for ruling the world? And I am also simply going to fight against my own grandfather and teacher, Drona, Bhishma, who are my respectable superiors? I don't want to fight. This is the way Arjuna responded upon seeing the army of the Kauravas before the battle was about to begin. Now, Arjuna was overwhelmed before the battle began. Krishna spoke Gita. And Yudhishthira was overwhelmed after the battle. And both of them were instructed. Arjuna was instructed by Krishna, and Yudhishthira was instructed by Bhishma. Bhishma is a Mahajana. He is an authority. So, it is correct to say that after all the body is not meant for simply enjoyment as emperor or some enjoy some power. No, it's not meant for that. It's meant for doing welfare activity for the other people, paropakaara. That's what it is meant for. And a human being has got this sense of reasoning, developed intelligence by which he can understand what is the real purpose of this existence in this body. That a human being can understand. The lower creatures cannot. So, human beings should not simply utilize the body for sense gratification. That's the conclusion. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of Yudhishthira Maharaj's lamentation after the Kurukshetra war, highlighting the immense loss of life and Yudhishthira's feeling of responsibility.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chaiva Narottamam Deviim Saraswatiim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udhirayet. In this session, we will be discussing the 49th and the 50th verses of the 8th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 49th verse: The meaning of this verse is, "I have killed many boys, brahmanas, well-wishers, friends, parents, preceptors, and brothers. Though I live millions of years, I will not be relieved from the hell that awaits me for all these sins." So Yudhishthira Maharaj is affected by the massacre that happened in the battle of Kurukshetra. It was a World War. The whole world was divided into two parties: those on the side of the Pandavas and those on the side of Kauravas. So The Mahabharata says 640 million people were dead at the end of 18 days of the battle of Kurukshetra. So when Yudhishthira Maharaj was killed by the massacre, he went to the scene of the battlefield. He saw the number of dead people and he was overwhelmed with a feeling that I have been responsible for this entire killing. Now how is it that he's responsible? Because the whole battle was fought.

### Duryodhana's evil intentions, Krishna's protection of Pandavas, Purpose of creation, Krishna consciousness

**Key Quote:** "Only a pure devotee can properly rule this world and actually guide the people to become Krishna conscious, to get out of this material entanglement."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the reasons behind the war, focusing on Duryodhana's evil intentions and Krishna's divine plan to establish the Pandavas, pure devotees, as rulers to guide people towards Krishna consciousness.

Yudhishthira Maharaj as the emperor of the world. Of course, it was the rightful claim of the Pandavas to rule the world after the death of Pandu, who was the ruling emperor. But Dhritarashtra, being the caretaker king while the Pandavas were very small, their father King Pandu, Emperor Pandu, he died untimely, early. So then Dhritarashtra was made the caretaker king because there was nobody else to take charge of ruling till Yudhishthira grew up and became sufficiently powerful. He was trained and an adult to actually take charge of ruling the kingdom, ruling the entire world. So Dhritarashtra, as the caretaker king, developed the desire that his sons, the Kauravas, headed by Duryodhana, should rule and not the Pandavas. So Duryodhana being evil-minded, it is described in the Bhagavad Gita, Dhritarashtra durbuddhe yudhe priyochikiri shavaha. Durbuddhi, evil-minded Duryodhana, he planned and plotted to kill the Pandavas and eliminate them before they could even become adults and could actually stake the claim for ruling the entire world. But Duryodhana was unsuccessful because the Pandavas, being pure devotees, were always protected by Krishna. It was Krishna's plan that the Pandavas should actually be ruling the entire world because they are the proper representatives of Krishna, the Supreme Lord, being pure devotees of Krishna. Only a pure devotee can properly rule this world and actually guide the people to become Krishna conscious, to get out of this material entanglement. That's the whole plan of the Supreme Lord in this material world.

### Purpose of material creation, Conditioned souls, Liberation, Role of a Kshatriya king

**Key Quote:** "The purpose of this creation is to give a chance to the conditioned souls."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the purpose of material creation as an opportunity for conditioned souls to realize their spiritual nature and return to the spiritual world, emphasizing the role of a Kshatriya king in guiding people towards liberation.

Sometimes people wonder, what is the purpose of this creation? The purpose of this creation is to give a chance to the conditioned souls. All of us are called conditioned souls. We are conditioned by this material nature. We develop desires to enjoy, thinking that we are this body, we belong to this world. And our life continues birth after birth after birth because we have so many varieties of desires for enjoying. But actually Krishna's purpose is different. Krishna wants us to realize we don't belong here because we are spirit, soul, we are not the body. And as spiritual beings, we can never be really satisfied and happy by material pleasures, by material enjoyment, by material lordship. We can never be satisfied or happy. So Krishna wants us to realize this. And for this purpose, Krishna has created this world in such a way that in the human form of life, we have developed intelligence. And if we are guided on the spiritual path of emancipation, of liberation from material bondage, then very easily we are able to understand and act appropriately under proper guidance and become completely free from all entanglements and go back to our original position in the spiritual world to enjoy eternal life of bliss and knowledge. This is the whole plan of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the purpose of creation: to liberate all the living beings, especially the human beings. And a proper Kshatriya ruling the human beings, ruling this world and particularly guiding the human beings on this path of liberation. It is possible that everyone can be liberated if they are guided by a king like Yudhishthira.

**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada on the sins of war, particularly the killing of innocent beings, and reiterates Yudhishthira's acceptance of responsibility for the mass killing.

A Krishna conscious king. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "Whenever there is a war, there is certainly a massacre of many innocent living beings, such as boys, brahmanas and women, whose killing is considered to be the greatest of sins. Innocent people should not be killed. They are all innocent creatures and in all circumstances killing of them is forbidden in the scriptures. Maharaj Yudhishthira was aware of these mass killings. Similarly there were friends, parents and preceptors also on both sides and all of them were killed. It was simply horrible for him to think of such killing and therefore he was thinking of residing in hell for millions and billions of years." Yudhishthira Maharaj accepts responsibility for this mass killing because only for the sake of enthroning Yudhishthira the whole battle was fought. And so many people were killed.

### King's duty, Yudhishthira's humility, Self-aggrandizement, Pure devotee's sensitivity

**Key Quote:** "A pure devotee is very thoughtful, is very sensitive, he is very very careful in every action and he always considers the consequences of any action that he performs."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the apparent contradiction of a king's duty to kill miscreants versus Yudhishthira's feeling of guilt, highlighting Yudhishthira's humility and a pure devotee's sensitivity to the consequences of their actions.

The 50th verse: naino rājña prajābhartur dharma-yuddhe vadho dviṣāṁ iti me natu bodhāya kalpate śāsanam vachaha. The meaning is, there is no sin for a king who kills for the right cause, who is engaged in maintaining his citizens, but this injunction is not applicable to me. A king has to engage in violence when there is a necessity of protecting innocent creatures, of protecting the weaker sections of society, of protecting women, of protecting saintly persons, of protecting brahmanas. Then he has to actually kill the miscreants. That's the duty of the king. But Yudhishthira Maharaj is thinking that even though a king has got a duty to kill the miscreants, but this killing in this battle is not applicable, is not proper for King Yudhishthira. That's what he's thinking. The Purport: Shrila Prabhupāda says, "Maharaj Yudhishthira thought that although he was not actually involved in administration of the kingdom, just being carried on well by Duryodhana without any harm to the citizens, he caused the killing of so many living beings only for his personal gain of the kingdom from the hands of Duryodhana. The killing was committed not in the course of administration but for the sake of self-aggrandizement, and as such he thought himself responsible for all the sins." This is Yudhishthira Maharaj's thinking. A pure devotee is very thoughtful, is very sensitive, he is very very careful in every action and he always considers the consequences of any action that he performs. Before performing the action there is so much of thinking, there is so much of precautions taken.

### Peace negotiations, Duryodhana's obstinacy, Kshatriya dharma, Avoiding war

**Key Quote:** "Yudhishthira Maharaj tried peace negotiations with Duryodhana and the Kauravas. In so many ways he tried to avert this battle."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts Yudhishthira's efforts to avoid the war through peace negotiations, highlighting Duryodhana's obstinacy and the Pandavas' willingness to compromise, even asking for just five villages.

As you are aware, in the Mahabharata it is described that to avoid this battle, Yudhishthira Maharaj tried peace negotiations with Duryodhana and the Kauravas. In so many ways he tried to avert this battle. He did not like the idea of fighting against the Kauravas in order to get back his rightful claim for the kingdom. But Duryodhana was obstinate and he would not give the kingdom back to the Pandavas. Of course it is a very long story. Story in the sense it is a historical incident that really happened. It is not a fictitious story. Actually the Kauravas headed by Duryodhana they usurped the kingdom of the Pandavas by cheating them in a gambling match. And after they promised to return the kingdom after the Pandavas had completed 13 years of exile living in the forest. When they came back Duryodhana refused to give back their kingdom. So then war became inevitable because a Kshatriya when challenged he cannot refuse to fight. So Duryodhana said you fight and defeat us and then you take your kingdom. So Kshatriya never begs for kingdom. Of course it was a rightful claim. Yudhishthira was not begging Duryodhana. But Yudhishthira did not like the idea of fighting and killing the Kauravas and so many others. He knew that it is going to be a world war. So to avoid that world war Yudhishthira tried peace negotiations. The Pandavas reduced their request for peace by averting the battle by just asking five villages for the five brothers. Even Duryodhana was not willing to give this much to the Pandavas.

**Key Quote:** "So the Pandavas as devotees their life is very very simple...They are as pure devotees they are completely free from the desire for sense enjoyment."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the Pandavas' simple life as devotees, their detachment from material comforts, and reiterates Yudhishthira's feeling of guilt for the massacre caused by the war, despite Duryodhana's obstinacy.

Why were the Pandavas asking? Because they are duty bound to maintain themselves by ruling over citizens, by ruling over people. So they collect taxes and maintain themselves. So the Pandavas as devotees, their life is very very simple. Anyway, thirteen years they have spent in exile. They are so magnanimous souls. They are as pure devotees, they are completely free from the desire for sense enjoyment. A devotee maintains his body simply for the sake of doing some devotional service to Krishna. That's all. He maintains his existence only for serving Krishna. And for serving Krishna what is required? Krishna is happy even if any devotee offers him in worship a leaf, a flower, a fruit or little water. So devotees live a very simple life and they are engaged in a devotional service. So the Pandavas did not have, even though they were born in a royal family and they were living in a palace before they were sent to exile. They were living in royal comforts as Kshatriyas ruling half the world. But as devotees they did not want any of these comforts. So the Pandavas reduced their request and they asked Duryodhana for five villages and Duryodhana refused. So war was inevitable. So even though Duryodhana's obstinacy was the cause for the entire battle, Yudhishthira is now thinking that this massacre that has happened, he considers himself responsible and therefore he is very much feeling guilty of being the cause for this massacre, mass killing.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the importance of protecting five categories of people in Vedic culture: brahmanas, cows, women, children, and old men, emphasizing the king's role in providing special care.

The story of the hair of Queen Draupadi. In the purport, Shrila Prabhupada explains, "Insulting the chaste lady Draupadi cost them their very life." It's very, very dangerous, and Prabhupada explains very nicely in the purport: In the glorious days, or days before the advent of the age of Kali, the brahmanas, the cows, the women, the children, and the old men were properly given protection. So, five categories of persons are mentioned who require special protection. Of course, in the Vedic culture, the King protects all the citizens impartially. But, in spite of being impartial to all the citizens, the king gives special care or protection for five categories of persons: the brahmanas, the cows, the women, the children, and old men.

**Key Quote:** "The protection of the brahmanas maintains the institution of varana and ashrama, the most scientific culture for attainment of spiritual life."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the reasons for protecting brahmanas and cows, highlighting their roles in spiritual advancement and nourishing the brain for higher understanding.

Now why? That is explained by Srila Prabhupada very nicely. Number one, why protection should be given specially for brahmanas? It is explained here, the protection of the brahmanas maintains the institution of varna and ashrama, the most scientific culture for attainment of spiritual life. The brahmanas are the ones who give direction to the rest of the society for everyone to attain spiritual life. Having got the human form of life, everyone is eligible as a human being. So brahmanas are protected, means the rest of the society will get proper direction for spiritual advancement to attain spiritual life. Number two, why cows have to be protected? That is explained as follows: The protection of cows maintains the most miraculous form of food, that is milk, for maintaining the finer tissues of the brain for understanding higher aims of life. Human intelligence is special, because a human being has developed intelligence to understand spiritual aim of life or higher aim of life than merely satisfying the senses in gross or subtle ways. So this higher aim of life is missed out if the brain tissues are not properly nourished. Therefore cow's milk is especially meant for human beings in order to nourish their brain tissues to understand the spiritual goal of life. And Srila Prabhupada many times has explained this point that cow's milk is a miraculous form of food. For whom? For the human beings, for the progressive human beings.

**Key Quote:** "The protection of women maintains the chastity of society by which we can get a good generation for peace, tranquility and progressive life."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of protecting women to maintain chastity and ensure a good progeny, and introduces the concept of garbhadana samskara for conceiving spiritually advanced children.

Number three, this describes why women should be protected. The protection of women maintains the chastity of society by which we can get a good generation for peace, tranquility, and progressive life. The future depends on the quality of the progeny that human beings are born with, producing now. Now how can we ensure that there is a good progeny? By protecting the women. Number four, why children should be protected? The protection of children gives the human form of life its best chance to prepare the way of liberty from material bondage. Such protection of children begins from the very day of begetting a child by the purificatory process of garbhadana samskara, the beginning of pure life. So, certainly in modern society many people do not know what is this garbhadana samskara or the beginning of pure life, that before a man and woman combine, they perform this garbhadana samskara or preparation of their consciousness in order to attract a spiritually advanced soul to take shelter of the parents as their child. So, in this way, good population will be there in the society, resulting in a good

**Summary:** The speaker explains the need to protect old men so they can prepare for a better life after death, contrasting successful humanity with a life of 'polished cats and dogs'.

generation being produced for a good future. Number five, why old men should be protected? The protection of the old men should be protected by giving them a chance to prepare themselves for better life after death. Of course, the entire human life is preparation for a better life after death, but at least if one has not begun this preparation before old age comes, at least after retirement, after getting old, one should and must dedicate oneself completely for this preparation. That's why old men should be protected. Now Srila Prabhupada explains this complete outlook is based on factors leading to successful humanity. Success in the human form of life is something different from the success which people who do not know what is the goal of human life, what they think is success. So Srila Prabhupada says this complete outlook is based on factors leading to successful humanity as against the civilization of polished cats and dogs.

**Key Quote:** "Human life is no better than animal life if one is simply engaged in the same for animal activities"
**Summary:** The speaker differentiates human life from animal life based on intelligence and the ability to attain spiritual life through the varna and ashrama system.

Human life is no better than animal life if one is simply engaged in the same four animal activities: ahara nidra bhaya maithunam cha samanyam etat pasubhi naranam. There are four common activities for both the animals, pasubhi, and naranam, and for the human beings. What are the four common activities? Ahara, food, we all require food, our living is based on food. Nidra, sleep. Bhaya, defense mechanism against some danger for the body. And maithunam for procrastination, creation, there is a need of engaging in sex life. So these are common activities of the animals and human beings, but a human being is distinguished because of possessing a developed intelligence by which the human being can make a permanent solution to all problems of material existence by attaining spiritual life. So for attaining spiritual life, there has to be a proper organized effort in the society, in the human society. And that organized effort is called the scientific system of varna and ashrama. Every human being is classified according to guna and karma

to engage in a particular type of occupational activity so that they can contribute to the society and also get their means of livelihood. And importantly, all are guided by the qualified brahmanas in order to attain spiritual life by practicing certain basic principles meant for the human being, civilized human being. Now, Srila Prabhupada says, the killing of the above mentioned innocent creatures is totally forbidden for the benefit of the human being. It is forbidden because even by insulting them, one loses one's duration of life. We have a fixed duration of life when we are born, but this duration of life will not remain with us throughout our life intact. It is not going to remain intact. We can reduce our duration of life by insulting. By insulting any of the five categories of persons, by insulting a brahmana or a cow or a chaste woman or innocent children or old men, by insulting any of them, our duration of life is shortened.

### Kali Yuga, Unprotected Women, Varna Sankara, Draupadi, Insult, Consequences

**Key Quote:** "To insult a chaste woman means to bring about disaster in the duration of life."
**Summary:** The speaker connects the lack of protection for women in Kali Yuga to the birth of unwanted children and uses the example of Draupadi's insult to illustrate the disastrous consequences of disrespecting chaste women.

And here is an example that Prabhupada gives. In the age of Kali, they are not properly protected. And therefore, the duration of life of the present generation has shortened considerably. Why are we seeing shortening of the duration of life nowadays? Because the above five categories of personalities are not given proper protection. That is well known. In the Bhagavad Gita, it is stated that when the women become unchaste, for want of proper protection, there are unwanted children called Varna Sankara. Varna Sankara means children born of unprotected women. Such children are actually born with so many demoniac qualities, and they actually spoil the entire human society because of their bad behavior. And the whole society becomes degraded because of such unwanted children. So that is because women are not protected. To insult a chaste woman means to bring about disaster in the duration of life. Dushasana, a brother of Duryodhana, insulted Draupadi, an ideal chaste lady, and therefore the miscreants died untimely. All the Kauravas, 100 sons of Dhritarashtra, they all died simply because Draupadi was insulted in that assembly when there was a gambling match. So they tried to strip her naked, and they were unsuccessful because Krishna protected Draupadi. But nonetheless, their duration of life was shortened, and they all died untimely, Akala Mrtyu. So, duration of life is shortened when one insults a chaste lady.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains Yudhishthira Maharaj's feelings of guilt after the war.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 51st verse of the 8th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Streenam Madhata Bandhunam Droho Yosav Ihotthitaha Karmabhir Grihamedhiyair Naham Kalpo Vyapohitum. The meaning of this verse is, "I have killed many friends of women, and I have thus caused enmity to such an extent that it is not possible to undo it by material welfare work." This is continuing from the previous few verses where Yudhishthira Maharaj, after visiting the battlefield after the war was over, his son was killed, he had seen the massacre that has taken place. Millions, 640 million people were dead, and he is feeling very guilty that just for me to be enthroned as the emperor of the world, this huge killing has happened. Therefore, he is expressing his...

**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of Grihamedhi (materialist) and how they inevitably commit sins even unintentionally while pursuing material prosperity.

He is assuming responsibility for killing different kinds of people as a result of this battle. So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, the Grihamedhis are those whose only business is to perform welfare work for the sake of material prosperity. There are two words that are used in the scriptures, Grihamedhi and Grihastri. Grihamedhi is a person who doesn't have any spiritual understanding of life, simply works on the basis of, "I am the body," and simply works for maintenance of the body, for giving pleasure to the body, for maintaining the body, and the false ego dictates that, "I am this body and all the body is mine. The bodily connections are mine." This is the outlook of a Grihamedhi, and such a Grihamedhi, whatever work he does, he does only for the sake of material gain. He has no understanding of spiritual perspective of life itself. So, such Grihamedhis, they perform welfare activity only for the sake of material prosperity. Now, these material prosperity is sometimes hampered by sinful activities. Why? Why is it hampered by sinful activities? Because a materialist is sure to commit sins even unintentionally in the course of discharging

**Summary:** The speaker discusses how the Vedas prescribe sacrifices to atone for unintentional sins, highlighting the importance of protecting brahmanas and cows for spiritual progress.

material duties. That's the nature of this material world. Even if a person knows what is sin and wants to avoid sinful activities, he cannot avoid that simply by being engaged in material duties. So it is said here, to get relief from such sinful reactions, the vedas prescribe several kinds of sacrifices. Unintentionally committed sins, there is a prescription in the vedas, different kinds of sacrifices are prescribed for those on the path of material gain through the scriptural directions. So further, Srila Prabhupada says, it is said in the vedas that by performing the ashwamedha yagna or horse sacrifice, one can get relief from even brahma hatya, killing of a brahmana. Among all the types of sinful activities a person can commit in the human form of life, the most grievous type of sinful activity is this killing of a brahmana, killing of a cow, and killing of a brahmana. Krishna is worshipped as a brahmana hita yacha. Krishna is worshipped as the topmost well-wisher of the cows and the brahmanas. The brahmanical culture, human society can progress spiritually only if this brahmanical culture is maintained and all saintly kings, raja rishis,

maintain this brahmanical culture based to protect the brahmanas and cows especially. But Yudhishthira Maharaj's thinking is different. So Yudhishthira Maharaj actually performed this ashwamedha yagna in order to atone for unintentional sinful activities, but he thinks that even though by performing such yagnas one can generally become free from sinful reactions, he thinks that for him it is not possible to get relief even by performing ashwamedha yagna from the great sins he has committed. What happens when a war takes place? Srila Prabhupada explains, in war either the husband or the brother or even the father or sons go to fight. When they are killed, a fresh enmity is created, and thus a chain of actions and reactions increase which is not possible to be counteracted even by thousands of ashwamedha yagnas. In a particular battle, one particular family people are killed, kshatriyas, then the women are so much, the surviving family members, the women and children unprotected, and then there is enmity. Lelakshmi may be described as the first family in violence, but in the great days there is that a woman named lelaki or a woman called lelaki who is a nice lady and a very kind person, the child killed her son left her child to his mother-in-law also with her husband and his wife the two lovers had a very good relationship and now they say that they are not sharing the battle and that is why they say that the FX is not that they can not make it in this way when they find out that they can not do it in their own way then the gravedigger of the vale will say that he has no power over them and son of Yadav is again leaving them alone after their loss become enemies of the new ruling king.

action and reaction. So, Srila Prabhupada says the way of karma is like that. Material activity or work in this material world is like that. We are always entangled in a chain of action and reaction. It creates one action and another reaction simultaneously and thus increases the chain of material activities, binding the performer in material bondage. So, what is the way out of this chain of actions and reactions? In the Bhagavad Gita, Srila Prabhupada says, in the 9th chapter, 2 verses, 27th and 28th verses, the remedy is suggested that such actions and reactions on the path of work can be checked only when work is done on behalf of the Supreme Lord. Only by offering the work or doing the work on behalf of the Supreme Lord or offering the results of the work to Krishna, can one be freed from the reactions. The battle of Kurukshetra was actually fought by the will of the Supreme Lord, Shri Krishna. Krishna, as it is evident from his version, that is Krishna's version, and only by Krishna's will was Yudhishthira placed from the throne of Hastinapura. So actually Yudhishthira Maharaj is a pure devotee, and it is Krishna's intention that a king like Yudhishthira Maharaj rules the whole world because he is the proper representative of Krishna in this material world.

**Key Quote:** "for those who are non-devotees when they are involved in a war in which massive killing happens they are responsible for that killing if they have declared war out of personal whims or for their own sake"
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that the Pandavas were not tainted by sin because they acted on Krishna's orders, while non-devotees bear the responsibility for wars fought for personal gain.

factually no sin whatsoever touched the Pandavas who were only the order carriers of the Lord. For the Pandavas there is no sin because they are pure devotees. They do everything for pleasing Krishna. They do everything on behalf of Krishna. They carry out Krishna's orders. It is this ground in the Mahabharata, after the battle was over and Yudhishthira Maharaj was to be enthroned, he did not want to rule the world that way, but Krishna wanted it. Therefore, Yudhishthira Maharaj accepted to rule the world. So this is the real nature of devotee, detached from everything material, but for the sake of the Supreme Lord, a devotee accepts anything and everything for the sake of serving the Lord. That's the nature of a devotee. So Srila Prabhupada says, for others, that means those who are non-devotees who declare war out of personal interest, the whole responsibility lies on them. That means for those who are non-devotees, when they are involved in a war in which massive killing happens, they are responsible for that killing if they have declared war out of personal whims or for their own sake. Here Yudhishthira Maharaj tried for peace negotiation. Yudhishthira Maharaj sent even Krishna to the yodana for peace negotiation. But Krishna also could not convince Duryodhana to stop this battle, to avoid this war.

**Key Quote:** "Because a pure devotee never kills anyone except on the order of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna orchestrated the war to remove the burden of the earth and that demons killed by Krishna or his devotees are purified of their sins.

So it was inevitable that Yudhishthira had to fight this battle, and Krishna wanted it because Krishna's plan was to remove the burden of the earth. The earth was overburdened by demoniac kings before the appearance of Krishna, and the Pandavas appeared simply for assisting Krishna in his pastimes because they are his pure devotees. So Krishna reduced the burden by killing so many demons. And finally, those demons who still remained after Krishna killing them, he gathered all those demons on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, and he wanted his pure devotees, the Pandavas, to kill these demons on his behalf. So actually the demons killed by Krishna are so much benefited that their sinful reactions are completely nullified because being killed by Krishna. When some demons, any demon is killed by a pure devotee, similarly the demon is purified of all sinful reactions because a pure devotee never kills anyone except on the order of Krishna. Because a pure devotee kills somebody only on the order of Krishna, the person who is killed even by a pure devotee is nullified, his sinful reactions are completely nullified.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam about the futility of trying to purify sinful actions with similar actions, particularly in the context of Yudhishthira's lamentation over the killings in the battle.

The meaning of this verse is, as it is not possible to filter muddy water through mud, or purify a wine-stained pot with wine, it is not possible to counteract the killing of men by sacrificing animals. Again, this is Yudhishthira's lamentation that so many people were killed in the battle because he feels, for his own sake, the battle was fought and he is responsible for the killing.

**Key Quote:** "A sacrifice recommended in the scriptures is never meant for killing animals."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's perspective that Vedic sacrifices involving animals were not intended for killing but for rejuvenation and testing the efficacy of Vedic mantras chanted by qualified brahmanas.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, Ashwamedha Yajnas or Gomeda Yajnas, sacrifices in which a horse or a bull is sacrificed, were not, of course, for the purpose of killing the animals. This is a very important point to be understood here. A sacrifice recommended in the scriptures is never meant for killing animals. Even though, actually, in such a sacrifice, a horse or a bull is killed, it is not meant for killing. How do we understand this? So, Lord Chaitanya explains that such animals sacrificed on the altar of Yajna were rejuvenated and a new life was given to them. See, in all such sacrifices, even though there is a horse or a bull, that killed horse or bull is rejuvenated by giving it new life. In some cases, the soul in the animal's body is promoted immediately to the human form of life. It was just to prove the efficacy of the hymns of the Vedas. In the Vedas, in the Vedic sacrifice, there are four kinds of priests. There is the priest who chants the mantras, and the mantra chanting should have the power, the purity of the brahmana, who has perfected his mantra chanting, because of which the chanting will be effective. And in case the brahmana who is chanting the mantras is unable to revive an animal, because his chanting is not sufficiently powerful, then there is a referee priest who actually takes over and actually he chants the mantras to revive the animal, the animal which is sacrificed, and he also chants for the sake of the sacrifice. So, the whole process is to give new life to an animal, and for the testing of the chanting of the mantra, such an act is done.

**Key Quote:** "In this age of quarreled hypocrisy, that is Kali Yuga, there is no possibility of performing the yajnas perfectly, for want of expert brahmanas who are able to conduct such yajnas."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the impossibility of properly performing Vedic sacrifices in Kali Yuga due to the lack of qualified brahmanas and the potential for incurring sinful reactions from improperly conducted sacrifices.

Kill an animal and give it a new life. By recitation of the hymns of the Vedas in the proper way, certainly the performer gets relief from the reactions of sins. In such sacrifices, when mantra chanting is done by qualified brahmanas, then the yajaman, the performer of the sacrifice, he gets relief from reactions of sins. But, in case of such sacrifices improperly done under inexpert management, surely one has to become responsible for animal sacrifice, like it is happening in Kali Yuga. They kill animals, but they don't have qualified brahmanas to chant mantras to revive the animal. There are no qualified brahmanas who can chant mantras in this way. In the scriptures it is explained, there is an arani mantra, which a brahmana who performs sacrifices, yajnik brahmana, chants. By chanting the arani mantra, he is able to generate fire by the power of the mantra. To light a sacrificial fire, a brahmana does not use a matchbox, or some other device, to spark a fire. No. He uses arani mantra. So, that's the power of sound. Subtle sound, vibration is like that. But, in Kali Yuga, we don't have qualified brahmanas who can chant in this way. This is one of the main reasons why all sacraments, all sacrifices of this kind, are particularly forbidden in the age of Kali. That's what Srila Prabhupada says here. In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy, that is Kali Yuga, there is no possibility of performing the yajnas perfectly, for want of expert brahmanas who are able to conduct such yajnas.

### Kali Yuga, animal killing, karma, meat eating

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Such meat eating is never pardoned."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of meat shops in Calcutta that falsely associate animal sacrifice with religious offerings to illustrate how animal killing in Kali Yuga leads to karmic consequences for everyone involved, comparing it to a gang of conspirators committing murder.

So, Srila Prabhupada says elsewhere, that in Calcutta, there are some meat shops which sell animal flesh. Now, they say Kali Prasad. What is the reason why they call their shop as Kali Prasad, meat shop? Because, they make a show of killing a goat, and offering a piece of the goat flesh to Kali. But, there is no qualified brahmana who can actually chant the mantras to revive the goat in performing this sacrifice of killing the goat. So, in the absence of a qualified brahmana chanting properly the mantras to revive the killed animal, the killer and the person who actually partakes the flesh of the killed animal, actually six kinds of people are responsible for this killing, and are punishable by the laws of karma. The person who rears the goat, the person who transports the goat, the person who sells the goat, the person who kills the goat, the person who purchases the flesh, the person who cooks the flesh, the person who eats the cooked meat, all of them are punishable for the killing of the goat. It's exactly like a murderer is punished by state laws. Exactly like that. So, people are unaware. In modern times, people are unaware what is the kind of punishment that awaits them for indulging in such meat eating. Such meat eating is never pardoned. The animal killing involved in such meat eating, and not only the person who kills the animal, everyone else involved in that, are all equally responsible for the killing. They are like a gang of conspirators who commit a murder. Exactly like that.

**Key Quote:** "You cannot purify a wine stained pot by washing it with wine. You have to wash it with pure water."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the impossibility of properly executing animal sacrifices in Kali Yuga and uses the examples of muddy water and a wine-stained pot to illustrate the principle that sinful actions cannot be purified by similar actions.

So, in Kali Yuga, there is no possibility of anybody properly executing Ashwamedha Yajna or Gomidha Yajna or even the goat sacrifice to Kali, which is called Ashwamedha Yajna. So, anybody properly executing Ashwamedha Yajna or Gomidha Yajna or even the goat sacrifice to Kali, which is recommended in the scriptures for meat eaters, there is no possibility that they can do that properly because there is no qualified Brahman. Now, Prabhupada says further in purport, Maharaj Yudhishthira therefore gives a hint to performing sacrifices in the age of Kali. Yudhishthira Maharaj is telling that in the age of Kali, there is no possibility that simply because somebody has killed men by killing animals in a sacrifice, they cannot get rid of the sinful reaction of killing men. He gives examples, two examples he gives, just like it is not possible to filter muddy water through mud. So, you have to have a filter which is clean, which is free of mud. Then only you can filter muddy water and get clean water. But if the cloth itself has got mud, the filtering cloth, then how can you filter muddy water through that and get clean water? Similarly, he gives another example, you cannot purify a wine stained pot by washing it with wine. You have to wash it with pure water. Then only you can cleanse away the wine stained pot. Similarly, simply by sacrificing animals, they can purify water. So, you can purify water by washing it with clean water. Similarly, you can purify the blood stained pot with pure water. Similarly, you can purify water with...

**Key Quote:** "One of the offenses is, do not perform any sinful activity on the strength of chanting Hare Krishna, thinking that even if a sinful person has committed a sin, by chanting Hare Krishna, his sinful reaction is nullified."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of avoiding sinful activities, especially meat eating, intoxication, gambling, and illicit sex, for devotees who chant Hare Krishna, explaining that chanting is not a license to sin.

...clean Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu particularly taught this Harinama Sankirtana Yajna. This is what he taught. But one should not indulge in animal killing and counteract it by performing the Harinama Yajna. There are some offenses to be considered in chanting Hare Krishna, in performing Sankirtana Yajna. What are the offenses? One of the offenses is, do not perform any sinful activity on the strength of chanting Hare Krishna, thinking that even if a sinful person has committed a sin, by chanting Hare Krishna, his sinful reaction is nullified. That is only for unintentional, inadvertent sins committed in spite of taking all care to avoid sin. Only such care. So, a devotee who chants Hare Krishna should be very responsible, should lead a responsible life, should completely avoid all sinful activities, especially avoid four types of sinful activities in Kali Yuga: meat eating, intoxication, gambling and illicit sex. Completely avoid them. And be careful not to perform any other sinful activities. So, then only, while chanting Hare Krishna, if accidentally there is some sin committed, then Krishna will pardon. This sinful reaction is nullified by chanting Hare Krishna. Krishna pardons. Those who are devotees of the Lord never kill an animal for self-interest. For their personal sake, they never kill an animal. Never. And, as the Lord ordered Arjuna, they do not refrain from performing the duty of a Kshatriya.

**Key Quote:** "The whole purpose, therefore, is served when everything is done for the will of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that the principle of Ahimsa does not excuse a Kshatriya from performing their duty and concludes that the ultimate goal is to act according to the will of the Lord, which is possible only for devotees dedicated to Krishna.

The principle of Ahimsa is, do not harm other creatures by indulging in violence. But, that does not mean a Kshatriya. A Kshatriya will not do his duty of killing miscreants. That is within the purview of Dharma, laws of Dharma. So, Krishna told Arjuna that by fighting in a Dharma Yudha, you will not incur sin. By not doing your duty, by avoiding, by not participating in a Dharma Yudha, you will incur sinful reactions. That is what Krishna tells Arjuna in Bhagavad Gita. That is being cited by Prabhupada here. The whole purpose, therefore, is served when everything is done for the will of the Lord. This is possible only for the devotees, who act according to the will of the Supreme Lord. It is devotees. Devotees' life is dedicated to Krishna. Therefore, they act only according to the will of the Lord. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

### Krishna, Yudhishthira, Ashwamedha Yajna, Indra

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Lord Shri Krishna caused three well-predicted well-performed Ashwamedha yajnas or horse sacrifices to be conducted by Maharaj Yudhishthira and thus caused his virtuous fame to be glorified in all directions like that of Indra who had performed 100 such sacrifices."
**Summary:** The lecture begins with the speaker reciting prayers and then introducing the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (1.8.6) that will be discussed, explaining that Yudhishthira's three horse sacrifices equaled Indra's fame from 100.

Om Agyanati Miran Dasya Gyanan Janishalakaya Chakshurun Militam Yena Tasmai Shri Gurave Namaha Nama Om Vishnu Padaya Krishna Preshtaya Bhutale Shri Mate Bhakti Vedanta Swamin Nithinamine Namaste Saraswate Deve Gauravani Pracharine Nirvishesha Shunyavadi Pachatya Deshatarine Jaya Shri Krishna Chaitanya Prabhu Nithyananda Shri Advaita Gadadhara Shiva Sadhi Gauravakta Vrinda Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Devim Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayamudhiya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam.

The meaning of this verse is: Lord Shri Krishna caused three well-predicted, well-performed Ashwamedha yajnas, or horse sacrifices, to be conducted by Maharaj Yudhishthira and thus caused his virtuous fame to be glorified in all directions like that of Indra who had performed 100

### Srimad Bhagavatam, Parikshit Maharaj, Pandavas, Devotees

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So the Bhagavatam concerns not only description of the Supreme Lord and one or two devotees but actually concerns the Supreme Lord in relationship with his variegated devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the context of the verse, relating it to the questions of the sages of Naimisharanya and the birth of Parikshit Maharaj, emphasizing the importance of the Pandavas as pure devotees and the Bhagavatam's focus on the Lord's relationship with various devotees.

such sacrifices. So the comparison is made here. Yudhishthira performed only three horse sacrifices, but his fame equaled that of Indra, who performed 100 Ashwamedha yajnas. Another name for Indra is Shatakrtu, one who has performed Shata—Shata means 100—100 horse sacrifices. So how is this? Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, this is something like the preface to the performances of Ashwamedha yajna by Maharaj Yudhishthira. Now here, we should remember Suta Goswami is describing a past incident, a historical incident about the Pandavas. This is actually based on the questions asked by the sages of Naimisharanya to give the background: how is it that Parikshit Maharaj met Shukadev Goswami and heard the entire Bhagavatam from Shukadev Goswami? So, in order to describe the birth of this Parikshit Maharaj, the incidents leading to that are being described here because they will help us understand better the fact that who is Parikshit Maharaj, how he is a Mahabhagavata by birth itself, and how his activities are glorious. Even his preparation for death is very, very, very glorious. So everything is glorious about the exalted Mahabhagavata Parikshit Maharaj. So the description, because Parikshit is the grandson of the Pandavas, therefore the description is being given here. Pandavas themselves are Mahabhagavatas; they are pure devotees of the Supreme Lord, all the five of them. So therefore, the Bhagavatam concerns not only description of the Supreme Lord and one or two devotees, but actually concerns the Supreme Lord in relationship with his variegated devotees, yes, unlimited devotees, all relating with him in their own particular relationship. So we understand that from the Srimad Bhagavatam

### Yudhishthira, Kurukshetra, Krishna, Pure Devotees, Kingship

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna actually conducted this battle of Kurukshetra in order to enthrone his pure devotee as the emperor of the world."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the historical context, including the end of the Kurukshetra war and Yudhishthira's enthronement, explaining that Krishna orchestrated the war to establish a pure devotee as ruler to guide citizens back to Godhead.

because all such descriptions are there. So therefore, the historical incident of Yudhishthira Maharaj, the end of the battle of Kurukshetra, this narration began when Ashwatthama attempted to kill—sorry, Ashwatthama killed the five sleeping sons of Draupadi, and he was punished. That was the seventh chapter, and the eighth chapter begins by telling that after that Yudhishthira, Yudhishthira was enthroned as the emperor of the world, and Krishna actually conducted this battle of Kurukshetra in order to enthrone his pure devotee as the emperor of the world. Why? Because a pure devotee carries out the mission of the Supreme Lord in this material world. What is that mission of the Supreme Lord in this world? The Lord has created this world in order to give a chance to the conditioned souls to try to enjoy materially and prepare themselves, especially in the human form of life, to actually return to their original consciousness, Krishna consciousness. So this is the whole program, and to facilitate this understanding and acting properly and preparing oneself to return to the original consciousness, the king has to guide the citizens of his kingdom in such a way that they all prepare themselves to go back to Godhead. And therefore, Krishna wants pure devotees to rule this world. So the Pandavas are pure devotees of Krishna; therefore, Krishna wants the Pandavas to rule the world. The Kauravas are not devotees of Krishna; therefore, Krishna arranged the battle of Kurukshetra in which the Kauravas were completely destroyed. So here, after Yudhishthira was enthroned as the emperor of the world, he performed three Ashwamedha yagnas again by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna.

### Yudhishthira, Indra, Opulence, Pure Devotion, Fame
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/g_bpM5E5wRU?t=445

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The fame of Maharaj Yudhishthira was not less than that of Indra."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's explanation of Yudhishthira's comparison to Indra, highlighting that despite Indra's greater opulence, Yudhishthira's fame was equal due to his pure devotion to Krishna.

Now Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, the comparison of Maharaj Yudhishthira to the king of heaven is significant. In what way is it significant? Srila Prabhupada explains, the king of heaven is thousands and thousands of times greater than Maharaj Yudhishthira in opulence. Naturally, the opulence of the inhabitants of the heavenly planets is much, much, much, much more than those of the inhabitants of the earthly planets, and correspondingly, the king of heaven is many, many, many millions of times more opulent than the emperor of this earthly planet or this world. Yet it is described in the purport here, the fame of Maharaj Yudhishthira was not less than that of Indra. How is that so? The reason is that Maharaj Yudhishthira was a pure devotee of the Lord. See Maharaj Yudhishthira's special position. What is that? He is a pure devotee of Krishna. All the five partners, they are pure devotees of Krishna, and by Lord Krishna's grace only was King Yudhishthira on the level of the king of heaven. So the fame of Yudhishthira was because of his being a pure devotee of Krishna. A pure devotee is naturally very famous without any endeavor for attaining fame. By his actions, a pure devotee automatically becomes, naturally becomes, very famous. So Srila Prabhupada explains that even though King Yudhishthira performed only three Ashwamedha Yajnas, whereas the king of heaven performed hundreds, still Yudhishthira's fame was equal to that of Indra. So now Srila Prabhupada says that is a prerogative of the devotee of the Lord.

### Krishna, Devotees, Equality, Mercy, Sunlight Analogy
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/g_bpM5E5wRU?t=595
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "A devotee of the Lord is more glorified because he is always in touch with the all great Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the potential perception of Krishna being partial, clarifying that Krishna is equal to all but devotees are glorified due to their constant connection with Him, using the analogy of sunlight reaching different places based on their receptive power.

Now here is a very important point, that somebody may think that Krishna is partial to his devotees. So Srila Prabhupada says no, Krishna is not partial to his devotees. The Lord is equal to everyone, equal to everyone, but a devotee of the Lord is more glorified because he is always in touch with the all-great, all-great Supreme Lord. This is the position of the devotee. He never forgets Krishna, Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is always in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead under all circumstances and all conditions, at all times, always, always in touch. So therefore, the pure devotees are naturally glorious. Now Srila Prabhupada gives an example here. The sun rays are equally distributed, but still there are some places which are always dark. This is, you can understand this example, it is not difficult, that the sun is shining brightly in the sky and distributing the rays equally, not only for this planet but for millions of other planets also. The sun is distributing the light and heat, but there are some places where the sunlight does not, does not reach at all. Those places will always be dark, always be dark. This is not due to the sun, but to the receptive power. Different places receive different quantity of sunlight when the sun is shining in the sky. That is dependent on the receptive power of the particular place. That is different.

### Mercy, Krishna, Conditioned Souls, Part and Parcel, Rebellion
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/g_bpM5E5wRU?t=739
**Verse References:** BG 4
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Krishna wants us with him, but we are forgetful, we are rebellious, we are envious, we want to be separate, we want to be independent."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna freely gives his mercy and wants to deliver all conditioned souls, as everyone is part and parcel of Him, but our forgetfulness and rebellious nature prevent us from realizing this.

Similarly, now we understand this example, we can compare this example. Those who are sent percent devotees of the Lord get the full-fledged mercy of the Lord, which is always equally distributed everywhere. The Lord is equal to everyone. He freely gives away his mercy. He wants everyone to go back to him. That's why he speaks Bhagavad Gita. That's why he personally comes so many times in different incarnations. Personally he comes, he sends his representatives. He wants, he wants to deliver all the fallen conditioned souls because everyone belongs to him. Krishna in the fourth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita says, "Every living being is mine." Yajnatvana punarmoham evam yasyasi pandava sarvabhutani asheshani drakshasi atmani atomai. He says, "Every living entity is my part and parcel." Mamaivam shojeevaloke jeevabhutasanata vanatana. Eternally we are part and parcel of Krishna, so we have the same nature as Krishna, spiritual nature. So Krishna wants us with him, but we are forgetful, we are rebellious, we are envious, we want to be separate, we want to be independent. This is a fact. Many people may not agree, but with a cool and sober head, if you think over, you understand who you are essentially in a sense, and then you consider this, then you will realize and you will actually very easily be able to rectify your misconception and discover the mercy of the Lord, which is equally available for everyone always.

**Key Quote:** "The pure devotee of the Lord, who are 100% pure devotees, they get the full fledged mercy of the Lord because they want it."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that pure devotees receive the full mercy of the Lord because they are open and receptive to it, while others do not take it, and then ends the session.

So Prabhupada says the pure devotee of the Lord, who are 10% pure devotees, they get the full-fledged mercy of the Lord because they want it. They are open for receiving it, and others don't want it. They don't take it. That's all. It's available, but they don't take it. I'll stop here.

**Key Quote:** "Lord Shri Krishna then prepared for his departure."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam describing Krishna's preparation for departure from Hastinapura.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 7th verse of the 8th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Aamantrya Pandu Putramshcha Shaineyodhava Samyutaha Dwaipayana Adibhir Vipraihi Poojitai Pratipoojitaha. The meaning of this verse is: Lord Shri Krishna then prepared for his departure. He invited the sons of Pandu after having been worshipped by the brahmanas headed by Srila Vyasadeva. The Lord also reciprocated greetings.

### Krishna's Supremacy, Varnashrama, Brahmanas, Kshatriyas
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/YfW_uuY71Z8?t=106
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna's position as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally a fact."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that although Krishna was acting as a Kshatriya, the Brahmanas worshipped Him because they knew Him to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead, emphasizing Krishna's eternal position.

We should understand the historical incidents in the proper context that Krishna came from Dwaraka in order to conduct the battle of Kurukshetra, and after the battle of Kurukshetra, Yudhishthira was enthroned as the Emperor, and Krishna, having completed his mission in visiting Hastinapura, is now preparing for his departure to go to Kurukshetra in order to return to Dwaraka. That is being described here, that Krishna prepared for his departure, and when he was leaving Hastinapura, the Brahmanas headed by Srila Vyasadeva worshiped Krishna. So, that is explained by Srila Prabhupada in the purport. Apparently, Lord Sri Krishna was a Kshatriya and was not worshipable by the Brahmanas. The convention is Kshatriyas should worship Brahmanas. That is the Varanashrama division of the society, members of the society. But the Brahmanas present there in Hastinapura, headed by Srila Vyasa Deva, all knew him, that is, knew Krishna, to be the personality of Godhead, and therefore they worshipped him. So, they were not wrong in worshipping a Kshatriya. The Brahmanas were not wrong because even though Krishna was playing the part of a Kshatriya, Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead under all circumstances, at all times, in all places.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "He does not lose his position even though he may assume a subordinate position."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's unchanging position as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even when He assumes a subordinate role, like that of Arjuna's chariot driver.

In the material world, everybody's position is a temporary, changeable position. Krishna's position as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally a fact, no matter what activities are performed by Krishna. Krishna may perform the role of the chariot driver of Arjuna, but that does not make Krishna come down to a lower position. No, he does not come down in his position. His position remains the same, absolute, always the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That's how, even though he is seated on the chariot of Arjuna as the chariot driver, Sarathi, but still when Arjuna was perplexed, Krishna instructed Arjuna, and through Arjuna, the entire human society in the subject matter of Bhagavad Gita. So when he is speaking as Bhagavad Gita, he is speaking as the Supreme Lord. In fact, his actions, all his actions are performed in his original position only. He does not lose his position even though he may assume a subordinate position. He may assume an unequal position, but his position is unchanged.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Those who know Krishna properly, they always understand he is Eternal Lord, and he is eternally the controller, eternally the master, and he is eternally worshipped by everyone."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that the Brahmanas, led by Vyasadeva, knew Krishna's true nature and worshipped Him accordingly, and that Krishna reciprocated greetings to honor social order.

So therefore, the Brahmanas headed by Vyasadeva in Hastinapura, they knew Krishna to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Eternal Lord, at all times, circumstances, at all times. So therefore, they properly worshipped him. Those who know Krishna properly, they always understand he is Eternal Lord, and he is eternally the controller, eternally the master, and he is eternally worshipped by everyone. Hmm. The Lord reciprocated the greetings just to honour the social order that a Kshatriya is obedient to the orders of the Brahmanas. Now, when the Brahmanas offer something to Krishna, Krishna reciprocates properly, receiving it, just to honour the social custom. Hmm. That a Kshatriya is obedient to the orders of the Brahmanas. That is social custom. Although Lord Sri Krishna was always offered the respects due the Supreme Lord from all responsible quarters, the Lord never deviated from the customary usages between the four orders of society.

**Verse References:** BG 4.13
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Society can be perfectly organised in that way."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the varnashrama dharma, explaining that Krishna created the four divisions of society based on qualities and work, and that the goal is ultimate liberation through performance of one's duty and worship of Vishnu.

In the fourth chapter of Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says, chaaturvarnyam maya-srishtam guna-karma-vibhaga-saha. He says, it is I who have created these four divisions of social orders in human society: chaaturvarnyam brahmana-kshatriya-vaisa-shudra. Society can be perfectly organised in that way: the intellectuals, the administrators, the business class, the productive class, that is the business class, and the labourers. And different people have different skills, different qualities. They are born under different influences of the gunas. Accordingly, they can be engaged properly in some livelihood, means of livelihood. But everybody is entitled, eligible for ultimate liberation in the human form of life. And that's what the whole varnashrama dharma is about: how to worship Vishnu by performance of your duty in such a way that you will actually be ultimately liberated from material bondage.

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "As soon as he seated himself on the chariot to start for Dwaraka, Krishna has seated himself."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna observed social customs to set an example and then introduces the next verse where Uttara hurries towards Krishna in fear.

So Krishna never deviates from the customary usages between the four orders of society. The Lord purposely observed all these social customs so that others would follow him in the future. See, to set an example, Krishna says in the third chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, yad yad acharati shrestha ha tattadeve tarojanah sayat pramanam kurute lokas tad anuvartate. Then, in the next verse, the eighth verse, it is said here, gantum krta matir brahman tvarakam ratam asthitah upalebe abhi dhavantim uttaram bhaya vikvalam. The meaning of this verse is, as soon as he seated himself on the chariot to start for Dwaraka, Krishna has seated himself. He has made preparations for his departure and he is seated on the chariot. He saw Uttara hurrying towards him in fear.

### Uttara, Dependence on Krishna, Pure Devotees, Protection
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/YfW_uuY71Z8?t=623
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Lord protects everyone, but one who depends completely upon him is especially looked after by the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Uttara's situation and emphasizes the complete dependence of the Pandavas on Krishna's protection, explaining that pure devotees are especially cared for by the Lord.

Uttara is the wife of Abhimanyu, the daughter-in-law of Arjuna and Subhadra, whose son is Abhimanyu. Abhimanyu was killed in the battle of Kurukshetra. So, Uttara had lost her husband in the battle. So, she was hurrying towards Krishna in fear. Now, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, all the members of the family of the Pandavas were completely dependent on the protection of the Lord. Why? Because they are all pure devotees of the Lord. All the members of the family of the Pandavas, all of them are pure devotees of the Lord. And the symptom or characteristic of a pure devotee is complete dependence, dependence on the protection of the Lord. In fact, for anyone, there is no other protection outside the protection of Krishna. That's a fact. That's true for everybody, not just for the pure devotees. But, pure devotees know this fact and they always seek shelter of Krishna's lotus feet, Krishna's protection. Because the members of the family of the Pandavas are completely dependent on protection of the Supreme Lord, therefore, the Lord protected all of them in all circumstances. It is reciprocal. The Lord protects everyone, but one who depends completely upon him is especially looked after by the Lord. The father is more attentive to the little son who is exclusively dependent on the father. The example is being given by Srila Prabhupada. The father has many children. The grown up ones may not require as much care and attention and protection as much as the little one. So, the little son who is exclusively dependent on the father, the father is more attentive. Similarly, the pure devotees who are especially completely dependent upon him, the Lord is more attentive.

### Uttara's Prayer, Protection, Death, Mrtyuloka

**Verse References:** SB 1.8.9, BG 8.15
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "O Lord of Lords, Lord of the Universe, You are the greatest of mystics. Please protect me for there is no one else who can save me from the clutches of death in this world of duality."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Uttara's prayer for protection from death, emphasizing that only Krishna can save one in this world of duality, and concludes by stating that the reason for her fear will be explained in the next verse.

And in the ninth verse, Uttara is telling the Supreme Lord, uttaro vacha pahi pahi mahayogin deva deva jagatpate nanyam tvad abhayam pashye yatra mrtyu parasparam. The meaning is that Uttara said, O Lord of Lords, Lord of the Universe, You are the greatest of mystics. Please protect me for there is no one else who can save me from the clutches of death in this world of duality. There is no one who can save me in this world of duality from the clutches of death. This world is called Mrtyuloka, a place where death is certain for everyone who takes birth. Krishna describes in the Bhagavad Gita, jatasyahi dhruva-mrtyur dhruvam janma-mrtyasya ca. For anyone who has taken birth in the material world, death is certain. That means this body, life in this body is going to come to an end. It is not going to be there forever. The soul is eternal, but the life in this body is not eternal. So that time comes when we have to quit the body, that is called death. So in this world of death, who can save anyone except Krishna? Nobody else can save. So therefore, Uttara is telling, please protect me for there is no one else who can save me from the clutches of death. So therefore, the response of the Lord also will be described and before that Uttara's prayer is not complete. Why is she asking for protection? That will be explained in the next verse. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the significance of Bhishma's instructions to Yudhishthira and the liberation attained through Krishna consciousness at the time of death, referencing Srila Prabhupada's purport.

in the presence of Lord Krishna. So the first verse: Suta Vacha Iti Bheeta Praja Drohat Sarva Dharma Vivitsaya Tato Vinashanam Praagat Yatra Deva Vrata Apatat. The meaning of this verse is: Suta Goswami said, "Being afraid for having killed so many subjects on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, Maharaj Yudhishthira went to the scene of the massacre. There Bhishma Deva was lying on a bed of arrows about to pass away." A new chapter. This will describe Bhishma's instructions to Yudhishthira to pass away from Kurukshetra to Yudhishthira and also Bhishma offering wonderful prayers before quitting his body. Bhishma offering wonderful prayers to Krishna. He was fortunate that Krishna was present in front of him when Bhishma was to quit his body. That's Krishna's blessing on Bhishma Deva, who was, who is a great devotee of Krishna, one of the Mahajanas of the ideal devotees of Krishna. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "In this ninth chapter, as it is billed by Lord Sri Krishna, Bhishma Deva will impart instructions to King Yudhishthira on the subject of occupational duties, Sarva Dharma Vivitsaya. Bhishma Deva will impart about occupational duties, Sarva Dharma Vivitsaya. Bhishma Deva will also offer his last prayer to the Lord on the verge of passing away

from this mortal world and thus become liberated from the bondage of further material engagements. Those who are Krishna conscious at the time of death, they don't have to take birth again in this material world, they straight go back to Godhead. No more birth in this material world, no more material existence. So Bhishma Deva was fortunate to be able to offer his last prayer to the Lord on the verge of passing away from this mortal world. Mortal world is the place of death. There is no such death in the spiritual world because in the spiritual world nobody has a material body, everybody has a spiritual form. There is no death. Of course, for the spirit soul there is no death even in this world, but the spirit soul has to keep on taking different material bodies one after another and that is the sum and substance of material existence, samsara, repetition of birth and death. But in the spiritual world there is no birth, there is no death, there is no material body, there is no material

**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of 'Praja' as all living beings, not just humans, and emphasizes the king's responsibility to protect all creatures within his domain.

that's the perfection of life. So Srila Prabhupada explains in another place that King Yudhishthira, he was such a responsible for his life that he was a great devotee of his life and he was a responsible person that he became afraid that I've killed so many Praja. Now the word Praja is very important to understand. Praja just doesn't mean the human population of a particular place, it means all the living beings or creatures were born in a particular place. So when we say Praja of this Bharata Varsha it means not only human beings who have taken birth in Bharata Varsha but even the animals, the birds, the trees, all the creatures they are called Praja. So Srila Prabhupada explains pra means in that word Praja prakrishta roopena there is a meaning in sanskrit for each word so the word is also um formed by combining pra ja ja means jayate takes birth so every living entity takes birth in some particular place whether it is a tree or a bird or an insect or an animal or a human being they take birth in a particular place so when people understand this if somebody has taken birth in america they are called american national national why american national because they could take birth in america so the government extends a certain facilities for those who have taken birth in america they consider them as american national similarly prabhupada is telling what about the animals which are taken birth in america whatever you the trees which are taken birth in america what about them they also require protection the government or the head of the state or the king of a particular country has to give protection not only to the human beings but even to the animals the birds the trees that is the duty and that is the proper responsibility that's the proper way of taking responsibility for a

So he is going to hear from Bhishma and Bhishma is the authority who can speak on Dharma. Now Dharma does not mean some religious faith as people think Dharma means the occupational duty occupational duty. Dharma means the word dharma also means the intrinsic quality of so in all these senses particularly in this context it is occupational duty. What is the duty of a king who actually was involved in this battle when so many 640 million kshatras. No one. Nobody. were killed in this battle. So, what is his duty now? Is there sinful reaction? Is there any kind of atonement? Is there any way out of avoiding the reactions, atoning for the reactions? So, he is going to hear from Bhishma. So, that is the significance of this particular shloka. And it is also told Bhishma, because along with Yudhishthira, Krishna also went driving the chariot of Arjuna. And in the presence of Krishna, Bhishma was fortunate to quit his body. That will be described in detail in the later part of the chapter.

**Key Quote:** "Even if Krishna comes in front of us, are we able to recognize he who is the supreme personality of God?"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the difficulty in recognizing Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even when He is present, using the example of Duryodhana's failure to recognize Krishna during the peace negotiations before the Kurukshetra war.

And since Bhishma Deva knew of his glories, he worshipped him duly. If you remember, in an earlier verse, it was described when the Pandavas were coming to the battlefield where Bhishma was lying on a bed of arrows. Krishna accompanied the Pandavas. So, Bhishma was very, very fortunate and blessed to have Krishna in front of him when he was about to quit the body. Krishna is directly present in front of Bhishma. And here it is said, even if Krishna comes in front of us, are we able to recognize he who is the supreme personality of Godhead Krishna? Not necessarily, because Krishna looks like a human being. We may think when Krishna comes in front of us, here is another human being, and we may not be able to recognize him. It is said in the scriptures, even when Krishna incarnated five thousand years back on the earth planet and moved around in human society, many, many people thought he was an ordinary person. He was another human being. They could not recognize him because he looked like a human being, and we may not be able to recognize him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A very good example is there in the Mahabharata when Krishna went with the peace proposal on behalf of Maharaja Yudhishthira before the Battle of Kurukshetra was about to begin, to avoid that battle, world war. It was not just a battle, it was a world war. Yudhishthira wanted to negotiate for peace and Duryodhana refused, so Yudhishthira thought, let me send Krishna. Krishna went to Duryodhana, but Duryodhana thought Krishna is another king of Dwarka, another politician, and he thought Krishna is very diplomatic in bringing a peace proposal from Yudhishthira. So Duryodhana did not recognize Krishna as a Supreme Personality of Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "Bhishma Deva is one of the Mahajanas...who know the religious principles perfectly and who know the goal of the practice of all religious principles is simply to understand Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Bhishma Deva's position as one of the Mahajanas, who possess perfect knowledge of religious principles and understand that the ultimate goal is to understand Krishna, and highlights the significance of Bhishma's instructions to Yudhishthira in the Mahabharata.

Got it? And Krishna, in order to convince Duryodhana that Krishna is not an ordinary person, Krishna showed one of his universal forms to Duryodhana, and Duryodhana thought Krishna is using some mystic power to bewilder Duryodhana, to force him to accept the peace proposal. Duryodhana said, I am not going to be carried away by your display of some mystic power. See, in spite of Krishna showing to Duryodhana I am not an ordinary person, Duryodhana could not recognize. So it is important to note here, it is said since Bhishma Deva knew of his glories, he worshipped Krishna duly. Bhishma Deva is one of the Mahajanas. The Mahajanas are twelve great personalities in this universe who know the religious principles perfectly and who know the goal of the practice of all religious principles is simply to understand Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to attain the lotus feet of the shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna is the goal of following all religious principles. This is known only to the Mahajanas. Bhishma Deva is one of the Mahajanas. He knows who is Krishna. He knows who are the living entities. He knows what is this world, why this creation, what is the goal of life. All these things are known to Bhishma, and Bhishma's instructions to Yudhishthira forms the bulk of the wisdom given in the Mahabharata. Over three Parvas, out of 18 Parvas, Bhishma's instructions to Yudhishthira are covered. Bhishma Parva, Anushasana Parva and Shanti Parva. Three Parvas. Parvas are big volumes of which the Mahabharata is constituted or divided. So 18 Parvas are there and out of those 18, three of them, the bulk of the Mahabharata is describing Yudhishthira's, sorry Bhishma's instructions to Yudhishthira on the

He is not an ordinary person. He is not another King. He is not just a powerful King. He is the Supreme Lord of all Lords. He is above everyone including the topmost Devatas, Brahma, Shiva, everybody. So that Bhishma Deva knew. In the Purport Srila Pravapath says the Lord's omnipotency is displayed by simultaneous presence in every place. Krishna is present everywhere in every place in the material world, in the spiritual world, everywhere. This is called omnipresence. He is present everywhere. And that is because of his omnipotency.

**Key Quote:** "Even though you're so tiny your consciousness is spread throughout the body similarly it is explained in the scriptures Krishna in his form as Garbhodakashayi Vishnu has entered this universe."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of the individual spirit soul's consciousness spreading throughout the body to explain how Krishna, as Garbhodakashayi Vishnu, is present and conscious throughout the entire universe.

Powerful, so he can be present and he is present everywhere. To give you an example, each one of us, we are very, very tiny spirit soul. It's a small particle of spiritual atom, very, very tiny. How small? One by ten thousandth part of the tip of the hair point in size. So that small tiny spiritual atom is inside the heart of this body. Now the consciousness of that tiny spirit is spread everywhere in the body. Compared to that tiny, very, very small spirit soul, this body is quite big, and the conscience is spread so perfectly all over the body that if an ant bites the tip of your toe, you immediately come to know about it. An ant may bite you somewhere in the top of your head, you immediately come to know about it. Any part of the body the ant bites, you immediately come to know about it. So even though you're so tiny, your consciousness is spread throughout the body. Similarly, it is explained in the scriptures, Krishna in his form as Garbhodakashayi Vishnu has entered this universe. He is present as Vishwatma, the soul of the universe. So just like my consciousness is spread throughout the body, even though I am just in the heart region, a very tiny spirit soul, similarly, even though Krishna is the spirit soul, the supreme spirit within the universe, his consciousness is spread throughout the universe. The gigantic universe consists of millions of planets. Each planet have millions of living beings. Everywhere throughout the universe, Krishna's consciousness is spread. So he is conscious of every part of the universe. Not only he is present within the universe, he has entered the universe, he has entered the heart of every living being. Every living being's heart is present.

**Key Quote:** "Vaishnava philosophy clearly explains the truth that the atma and paramatma are two not one though in the scriptures it is explained that the atma and paramatma are one in quality both are spiritual by nature qualitative equality."
**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between the individual soul (atma) and the Supreme Soul (Paramatma), refuting the Mayavada philosophy that claims they are one and the same, and emphasizing the Vaishnava understanding of their distinct quantitative differences despite qualitative similarity.

So he is also conscious of every body. In fact, that is the difference between ourselves and Krishna, atma and paramatma. There is so much of, so many different philosophies describing whether the atma and paramatma are two distinct different entities or they are one. Most people are misled by the mayavada philosophy which says atma and paramatma are one. Vaishnava philosophy clearly explains the truth that the atma and paramatma are two, not one. Though in the scriptures it is explained that the atma and paramatma are one in quality, both are spiritual by nature, qualitative equality. Quantitatively, they are distinctly different. Quantitatively, the tiny spirit is only conscious of one body. I am conscious of my body, you are conscious of your body, another person is conscious of his or her body only, whereas Krishna is conscious of everybody. Krishna is conscious of billions and trillions and innumerable bodies, everybody. So this is distinctly different in terms of quantity, omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient.

He is all-knowing. He is all-powerful. He is present everywhere, every nook and corner. So that Krishna is present in front of Bhishma Deva. So don't wrongly think Krishna is an ordinary person or just another powerful king. No. Krishna is the supreme person, the Personality of God. So here the word that is used by Vyasa Deva to describe this, Asinam Jagadishwaram. Jagadishwaram. The lord of the universe. The lord of the universe is sitting in front of Bhishma Deva. So and it is said here, Krishna manifests his transcendental form by his internal potency, mayaya upatvigraham. Krishna's form is completely transcendental. You know, it looks like a material form of a human being. It is not a material form. Krishna's form is completely transcendental. And Bhishma knew about this. And therefore Bhishma duly worshipped him. Bhishma did not receive him as another king. No. Bhishma knew. Here is the supreme personality of God. He duly worshipped him.

**Key Quote:** "So in a joint family system, the elders are there to guide the youngsters in every respect."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of the joint family system and the role of elders in guiding and caring for the younger generation, drawing a parallel to Bhishma's role in raising the Pandavas.

So this is a very touching scene. On the battlefield, after the battle is over, Bhishma is ready to quit his body. The Pandavas have come there, arrived there. The Pandavas were sitting near Bhishma Deva, overtaken with affection for their dying grandfather. The Pandavas could remember how Bhishma Deva actually took charge of their protection when Pandu died early, when the Pandavas were very young. So Bhishma took charge of the upbringing of the Pandavas. So they were naturally feeling so much affection for Bhishma Deva. They were very grateful. So Bhishma Deva met the Pandavas. And as far as Bhishma Deva is concerned, He was very happy to see the Pandavas getting back their kingdom, which was rightfully theirs. Only because of injustice by the Kauravas, the Pandavas were deprived so far of their kingdom. So Bhishma Deva... covered by the Kauravas. So far the Pandavas were deprived so far of their kingdom. So Bhishma Deva was overwhelmed with love and affection and there were tears in his eyes. He was very happy that the Pandavas got back their kingdom after the battle of Kurukshetra. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, when Maharaj Pandu died, his sons were all small children and naturally they were brought up under the affection of elderly members of the royal family, specifically by Bhishma Deva. This is the very culture that the joint family system that prevails. Earlier, especially in the ancient times, everyone was properly taken care of by the elderly members of the family, especially the younger ones were taken care of by the elderly members of the family.

**Key Quote:** "Now in the modern society, this joint family system is no longer prevalent and therefore the children are missing out a great deal of wisdom that they could have got from the elders of the family in a joint family system."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the joint family system with modern nuclear families, highlighting the lack of elderly care and guidance for children in the latter.

So in a joint family system, the elders are there to guide the youngsters in every respect. It's not that we learn only by going to a particular school or going for some specific skill development only. No, one can learn simply by being in the association of great personalities, of responsible people. Just by observing, just by being in the association, so many things can be learned. Now in the modern society, this joint family system is no longer prevalent and therefore the children are missing out a great deal of wisdom that they could have got from the elders of the family in a joint family system. In these nuclear families, if... let us say, the mother or the father is not at home, the children are deprived so much of elderly care. And the conditions are becoming worse when both the parents have to go to work and the children are under the care of some maids or some neighbors or some daycares.

**Key Quote:** "So it was just plain cheating."
**Summary:** The speaker details Duryodhana's envy and cheating of the Pandavas, and Bhishma's difficult position as he was bound to support the caretaker king, Dhritarashtra.

such as Bhishma Dev. up bringing of these Pandavas in the palace, Hastinapura palace. Later on when the Pandavas were grown up, they were cheated by cunning Duryodhana and company. The Kauravas, especially Duryodhana. Duryodhana was very very envious of the Pandavas. Very envious of the Pandavas, because he knew that even though his father was the caretaker king, because of Pandu's early death, and the Pandavas were not of age, they were not mature to assume the throne. So Bhishma had taken a vow never to occupy the throne. So Bhishma could not take charge of ruling. And then Dhritarashtra was disqualified because he was blind. But in the absence of a suitable king to rule the whole world in the Kuru dynasty, so Bhishma instructed Dhritarashtra to be the caretaker king. The son of Pandu will inherit from his father, the kingdom. Pandu was the eligible king when he was ruling, but he died early. And therefore, Yudhishthira had to take charge, but Yudhishthira had to wait. So in the meantime, this Dhritarashtra was the caretaker king. They were cheated by cunning Duryodhana and party. So many ways Duryodhana cheated the Pandavas by an unfair gambling match. And before that also, he was occupying the throne and giving the Pandavas some small place, some insignificant place, to rule. So it was just plain cheating. No doubt about it. But Bhishma Deva, even though he knew the Pandavas were innocent and were unnecessarily put into trouble, Bhishma Deva could not take the side of the Pandavas for political reasons. Bhishma was being maintained by Dhritarashtra and Dhritarashtra was the caretaker king. So Bhishma thought that since Dhritarashtra was the caretaker king, he could not take the side of the Pandavas for political reasons. So Bhishma was being maintained by Dhritarashtra and Dhritarashtra was the caretaker king.

minded cunning cheating mentality asuri swabhava this is Duryodhana and Duryodhana was supported even not only by Dhritarashtra even his younger brothers they were also supporting him so whole gang of cheaters and cunning persons cunning fellows so Bhishma was feeling very very sorry for the Pandavas that he could not take their side and when the battle was fought Bhishma had to fight on the side of the Kauravas and Bhishma was very very straightforward and upright and righteous person so he would not cheat the Kauravas when fighting on their side but in spite of that because it will be extremely Because of Krishna, the Pandavas were protected in spite of the Kauravas being very very strong, they could not win the battle. So when Bhishmadeva saw his most exalted grandsons, the Pandavas, headed by Maharaja Yudhishthira, sitting very gently at his side, the great warrior grandfather could not check his loving tears which were automatically flowing from his eyes. So he was very very satisfied and happy that my grandsons, the Pandavas, who were cheated by Duryodhana, now they have got back their kingdom. They got back their kingdom. And Bhishmadeva knew it very well. The Pandavas are very very righteous, so virtuous, so they rule the kingdom perfectly. The citizens, the whole world will be benefited by Pandavas ruling the world. Krishna also wanted that. He wanted the Pandavas, his devotees, to rule the world. Not the non-devotee party of Duryodhana. No. That's why Krishna arranged the battle of Kurukshetra. And it is explained, Krishna arranged to assemble all those miscreants who had escaped the various times when Krishna was engaged in killing the demoniac natured persons. Krishna came to reduce the burden of the earth which was overburdened by demoniac forces. So all those who were remaining, they were assembled by Krishna's arrangement on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. All of them were killed. So Bhishma was very very happy. And Krishna arranged that Bhishma see the Pandavas after they had won the battle, and he could die peacefully, satisfied that there was justice ultimately for the Pandavas.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Yudhisthira's unwavering adherence to Dharma, which Duryodhana exploited to cheat the Pandavas and send them into exile.

So Bhishma Deva is speaking to the Pandavas. He is very much in line, not just with your sup& tú & phimbs factory, he is in line with our spiritual warp positions, very happy that the Pandavas have won the battle, and he's shedding tears of ecstasy seeing the Pandavas having won the battle of Kurukshetra and got back their lost kingdom. So he is now remarking, "What terrible sufferings and what terrible injustices you good souls suffer." The Pandavas are headed by Yudhishtira. Yudhishtira is the son of Dharma, Yama Dharma Raja, Yama Raj, the one who gives justice. He administers justice to all those souls at the end of their human beings, at the end of their life. If they have deviated from the religious principles, then according to the degree of violation, they are given suitable punishment by Yama Raj. So Yudhishtira, as a son of Yama Raj, he knows perfectly what is Dharma, and he was very, very strictly following all the religious principles. And that was how Dyuryodhana was able to cheat Yudhishtira and the Pandavas, even though sometimes Bhima would actually protest against Yudhishthira's being very, very righteous against Duryodhana's cheating. Then even when Duryodhana, there was a lot of people who cheating, Bhima would protest, but still Yudhishthira would not break any religious principle in order to avoid getting cheated by Duryodhana. Duryodhana took undue advantage, knowing very well that Yudhishthira is very righteous, he took undue advantage of that, and that is how Yudhishthira was, and the Pandavas were cheated and sent away to exile in the forest for 13 years.

**Key Quote:** "Shakuni decided I am going to completely destroy this Kuru dynasty so in order to destroy the Kuru dynasty he plotted with this Duryodhana knowing very well that Duryodhana wants to cheat the Pandavas"
**Summary:** The speaker details Duryodhana's sinister plan to keep the Pandavas in perpetual exile and Shakuni's motivation for destroying the Kuru dynasty due to his sister Gandhari's marriage to the blind king Dhritarashtra.

And Duryodhana was ruling for 13 years, and he was making all plans that when they come back, his plan was never that they should come back. You know how cleverly Duryodhana had sent them away in exile. He had sent them away for 12 years they live in the forest, and the 13th year, the last year, one year they live incognito, they have to hide somewhere. And if Duryodhana and party discover where they are hiding, then another 13 years they will go for exile. Duryodhana's plan was that he will have his informers everywhere, and wherever the Pandavas go for hiding, he'll discover, he'll point out the Pandavas are hiding here, and then send them again in 13 years. So he thought, "As long as I'm alive, or as long as the Pandavas are alive, I'll be ruling, because wherever the Pandavas are, I'll discover where they are hiding and send them again and again 13, 13, 13, 13 years." This was the plan, that sinister plan this Duryodhana had made in consultation with his maternal uncle Shakuni. Shakuni was very much angry at the Kuru dynasty because his beautiful sister Gandhari, who was the most eligible princess before she was married, she was married to the blind king Vritrashtra. So he was very, very unhappy, "My sister did not get a suitable husband." That was what Shakuni, the brother of Gandhari, was thinking. So when he saw that he could not stop Gandhari getting married to Dhritarashtra, then the blind king, he decided, "I am going to marry Vritrashtra, completely destroy this Kuru dynasty," because Dhritarashtra was the head of the Kuru dynasty as the emperor of the world. Of course, he was a caretaker king, but still Shakuni decided, "I am going to completely destroy this Kuru dynasty." So in order to destroy the Kuru dynasty, he plotted with this Duryodhana, knowing very well that Duryodhana wants to cheat the Pandavas, and in that way the Pandavas will not be able to rule the Kuru dynasty, successors will not be able to rule the world properly. He wanted that the Pandavas should not rule the world by being cheated of their claim for the throne. So he and Duryodhana plotted to cheat the Pandavas in a gambling match.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how Shakuni used his gambling expertise to ensure Yudhishthira's defeat, leading to the Pandavas' exile, and reiterates Bhishma's lament about the injustice they faced.

You see, this is, this is how Duryodhana was not very, very intelligent in that sense to have cheated the Pandavas, but Shakuni, he was expert in this gambling. So he, he arranged in such a way that always Duryodhana will win and Yudhishthira will lose the match, and that's how Yudhishthira lost everything and simply was sent away to the forest. So Bhishma Dev was remarking, "Oh, how terrible it is that you good souls, you don't deserve to actually suffer in this way, because you're upright, you're morally upright, you're following all the religious principles perfectly, still you have to suffer so much injustice."

**Summary:** The speaker recounts the story of the shellac palace, Duryodhana's attempt to burn the Pandavas alive, and how Vidura's warning allowed them to escape through a secret tunnel.

And he's further telling, "You did not deserve to remain alive under those tribulations." They should have died so many instances. For example, they were sent to a palace which is built with shellac, combustible material. But Vidura came to know about this and secretly informed Yudhishthira, and Yudhishthira with the help of Vidura actually managed to escape this plot by Duryodhana. Duryodhana and Pati, they were living with the Kauravas in the same palace, but Duryodhana once made this plan that, "Why the Pandavas should share the palace with us? Let us build them a beautiful palace, a very, very nice palace elsewhere, and then let them live separately. Why they should share, why we should share?" So he built another palace, beautiful palace, but he had arranged the palace into a mountain that it be built with combustible material, shellac. And when the Pandavas have gone and settled down there, suddenly one day he will arrange to set it on fire and they'll be burnt alive inside before they can escape, because immediately the fire will spread everywhere. So this was Duryodhana's plan. And because Yudhishthira came to know from Vidura before even moving to that new palace, Yudhishthira arranged to secretly dig a tunnel from underneath that new palace. And they escaped, Pandavas escaped before it could be set on fire. In fact, the Mahabharata says the Pandavas themselves set it on fire and escaped.

Through the tunnel. So when it was completely set on fire, everybody thought the Pandavas are inside that palace and they have been burnt alive. So even Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana, they knew that the Pandavas were not safe. They knew that they were supposed to be cheated in this way. But still, because of Dhritarashtra's blind affection for his son, unworthy son Duryodhana, and Duryodhana's enviousness and jealousy towards the Pandavas, that this whole plot was carried out. And they thought that they had effectively gotten rid of the Pandavas. But actually the Pandavas had escaped. So he was not going to escape. He was not going to escape.

**Key Quote:** "Morality is always on the side of the righteous persons who are God-conscious people. Those who are godless, they can never be morally upright. Never, never."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the Pandavas were protected by Brahmanas, God (Krishna), and religion because of their righteousness, contrasting this with the lack of morality in godless individuals like Duryodhana.

So he was not going to escape. But he was not going to escape. So he was not going to escape. So, here it is said, all these types of terrible injustices, they actually were able to avoid being killed because of the protection by the Brahmanas, God, and religion. Brahmanas, because Brahmanas always bless those who are righteous, those who are following religious principles. Brahmanas will never extend blessings to sinful people, to unrighteous people like Duryodhana. They can never get the blessings of Brahmanas. Similarly, God, Krishna. Krishna is always on the side of Dharma. In the end of the Bhagavad Gita, it is said, "Morality is always on the side of the righteous persons who are God-conscious people. Those who are godless, they can never be morally upright. Never, never." Sometimes they make a show of being morally upright, but that is just a show. It is cheating, actually. It is to... To fool innocent people that we are very morally upright. We are truthful. We are honest. We are hardworking. But actually, if somebody is godless, even if they make a show of being honest, it is no real value. It is no real value. So, like that, Bhagavad Gita teaches us that morality is always with the god-conscious people, not with godless people. Always with the divine-natured people, never with demoniac-natured persons. Never. They cannot be morally upright. Not possible. So the Pandavas were protected, as Bhishma Deva is telling, by Brahmanas, by God, Krishna, and by religion.

The religious principles itself, is a protection. Those who follow religious principles, that religion, those religion, religion itself protects them. In the sense, the administrator of religious principles, Yama. Yama will always protect those who are following religious principles. He will punish those who are law-breakers, those who are irreligious, those who are going, violating religious principles. And this is the reason always, the Pandavas did not actually get killed, so many times, they were attempted to be killed.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 13th verse of the 9th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on Bhishma's recollection of Kunti Devi's suffering after Pandu's death.

In this session we will be discussing from the 13th verse of the 9th chapter of the first canto of Sriman Bhagavatam.

The meaning of this verse is, this is spoken by Bhishma, he is speaking to the Pandavas, as far as my daughter-in-law Kunti is concerned, upon the great general Pandu's death, she became a widow with many children and therefore she suffered greatly, and when you were grown up, she suffered a great deal also because of your actions. So Bhishma Deva is recollecting the history of the Pandavas, particularly Kunti Devi, she suffered more than the others, the Pandavas themselves.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Kunti's challenges as a widow raising five children, including Madri's decision to perform Sati and entrust her sons to Kunti's care.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the third quote, the sufferings of Kunti Devi are doubly lamented. She suffered greatly because of early widowhood and to get her minor children brought up in the royal family. Kunti Devi was one of the wives of the great general Pandu and Madri was the second wife. When Pandu died early, the children are all very small, three sons of Kunti Devi and two sons of Madri. Totally Pandu had five sons. Now Madri decided to actually perform the Sati rite, that means she wanted to quit her body along with the funeral of General Pandu on his death. It is called Sahagamana in Sanskrit and she entrusted her sons to the care of Kunti Devi and Kunti took responsibility for raising not only her three sons but even her co-wives two sons. So all the five Pandavas came under the care of Kunti Devi and Kunti Devi herself, she is without any protection as far as her husband is concerned, so she had to take shelter of the parents of Hastinapura which was having Dhritarashtra as the caretaker king and of course Bhishma was there and Vidura was also there in the palace. Bhishma was like the

father-in-law of Kunti Devi. Pandu's father Vichitravirya and Vichitravirya's brother was Bhishma, so Pandu's uncle, Bhishma was Pandu's uncle. So Bhishma had taken a vow to rule the kingdom, not to sit on the throne as the emperor of the world, he forsaken his claim and Vidura was not entitled. Vidura was one of the brothers of Dhritarashtra and Pandu, so Vidura was not entitled because he was the son of a maidservant, so Dasiputra, so he had no claim for the throne, but he was very, very wise, very intelligent and Dhritarashtra relied on his guidance, his advice, more than guidance it was advice. So both Vidura as the brother-in-law of Kunti Devi and Bhishma as the father-in-law of Kunti Devi, they were actually sympathetic to the Pandavas and therefore Kunti was under the care of the elders in the royal palace of Hastinapura.

**Key Quote:** "Kunti had to suffer a great deal of trouble from this envious Duryodhana and his brothers also and when Kunti's children were grown up she continued to suffer because of her son's actions"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the threats from Duryodhana and the continued suffering of Kunti, attributing it to destiny and the control of higher authorities.

But there were attempts by Duryodhana supported by Dhritarashtra to kill the Pandavas before they could even grow up, become adults. So Kunti had to suffer a great deal of trouble from this envious Duryodhana and his brothers also. And when Kunti's children were grown up, she continued to suffer because of her son's actions, whatever she is a widow. So once her sons were grown up, they had taken charge or responsibility of ruling, but they were denied the kingdom which was rightfully theirs, they were denied by so many tricks. So because the Pandavas had to suffer due to cheating by all of us, Kunti along with her sons had to simply suffer, so her sufferings continued. That's what Prabhupada is telling, her sufferings continued. This means that she was destined to suffer by providence. Providence is destiny according to one's own past actions and according to whatever is destined, whatever is given out by the higher authorities in the material world, everybody is under the control

We cannot make this out by the action of Kala, the influence of the gunas and the past reactions, reactions of the past activities we have performed that we are carrying as the load of karma. So Kala, Karma, Guna all three are very subtle. So as far as the modern civilization is concerned, they are independent about these controls, they are like animals, in the language of Bhagavatam, they are like donkeys and cows, animals. But those who are guided by the scriptures, those who are guided by their devotees, those who are guided by learned authorities in the Vedic language, they know that everyone is bound up by Kala, Karma and Gunas.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of tolerating suffering destined by providence, drawing from Vedic culture and Prabhupada's teachings.

So therefore it is said here, Kunti Devi was destined to suffer by providence. This is called providence, it is beyond our control. So here Prabhupada says, one has to tolerate such suffering which is destined without being disturbed in the mind. This is the training that is required for somebody who is born and brought up in the Vedic culture. Then the fourteenth verse, sarvam kala pritam manye bhavatam chayat apriyam sapalo yad vashe loko vayoriva ghanavadi. The meaning of this fourteenth verse, in my opinion, this is all due to inevitable time under whose control everyone in every planet is carried just as the clouds are carried by the wind. So this is the explanation given by Bhishma Deva that inevitable time, karma kala pritam sarvam kala pritam manye. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, there is control by time all over the space within the universe.

**Key Quote:** "There is control by time all over the space within the universe as there is control by time all over the planets you see total control by kala"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the pervasive control of Kala (time) in the material world, contrasting it with the eternal nature of the spiritual world.

As there is control by time all over the planets, you see total control by kala. Kala is a representative of the supreme lord in this material world. The action of kala is only in the material world, it is not there in the spiritual world. Spiritual world is eternal, material world has got a limited duration of existence. So there is creation, maintenance, destruction, then there is some time when there is nothing happening, inactivity, again creation, maintenance, destruction, inactivity, again creation, maintenance, destruction, inactivity. This is perpetually going on, perpetually it is going on. So everyone who takes birth in this material world at the beginning of creation, they are completely controlled. So it is said here, all the big gigantic planets including the sun are being controlled by the force of air as the clouds are carried by the force of air. The clouds are scattered in the skies and they don't remain in one place, they are carried by the wind. Similarly the big gigantic planets they are floating and they are not stationary, they are moving in their orbit all by the force of the wind. Similarly the inevitable kala or time controls in the action of the air and other elements above the vayu or wind or the air, there is the control of kala. Kala is representative of the supreme, everything therefore is controlled by the supreme kala, a forceful representative of the lord within the material world.

So now the important thing what Prabhupada explains here, you should understand carefully, thus Yudhisthira should not be sorry for the inconceivable action of time. Everyone has to bear the actions and reactions of time as long as one is within the conditions of the material world. Actions and reactions are coming continuously, we should learn to bear them. Yudhisthira should not think that he had committed sins in his previous birth and is suffering the consequence. Generally a person suffers due to some past deeds, but somebody who is very, very pious, very strict in following all the principles like Yudhisthira is not suffering because of his past sinful actions. It is said here, even the most pious has to suffer the conditions of material nature, but a pious man is faithful to the lord for he is guided by the bona fide brahmana and vaishnava following the religious principles. So pious people they are guided by the brahma, the religious principles, then brahmanas and vaishnavas and they are also surrendered to the supreme lord. So these three guiding principles should be the aim of life, one should not be disturbed by the tricks of eternal time. So one should not worry even though I am following the religious principles why am I suffering, so one should not grudge being controlled by time despite being a true follower of religious principles. This is the important part.

I will stop here, thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "O how wonderful is the influence of inevitability over time, it is irreversible, otherwise, how can there be reverses in the presence of King Yudhishtira..."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 15th verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on the influence of time and the seemingly paradoxical situation of the Pandavas despite their righteousness and Krishna's presence.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 15th verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Sriman Bhagavatam. This chapter describes the passing away of विश्म देवा in the presence of Lord Krishna. यत्र धर्म सुतो राजा गदा पानिर भृको दरहा कृष्णोस्त्री गांडीवं चापं सुरित कृष्णस्ततो विपत. The meaning of this 15th verse is, "O how wonderful is the influence of inevitability over time, it is irreversible, otherwise, how can there be reverses in the presence of King Yudhishtira, the son of the demigod-controlling origin, Bhima, the great fighter with the club, the great bowman Arjuna with his mighty weapon Gandiva, and above all the Lord, the direct belligerent of the Pandavas." So this is a verse spoken by निष्म; he is describing the influence of time, तार्वा, it is irreversible under all circumstances. Now he is explaining, look at the situation of the Pandavas, particularly he mentions

**Key Quote:** "Though we prefer happiness than distress, it is actually illusory, both happiness and distress are illusory, they are effect of illusory."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes performing one's duties according to religious principles, understanding the illusory nature of material happiness and distress, and maintaining the single-pointed aim of returning to Godhead.

पाता की शक्ति के लिए नहीं बिलाएंगे, Param Velayut insignificant creatures, we have to do our duties depending upon the law, and our aim should always be to go back home, back to Godhead, where we actually are meant to live eternal blissful life full of knowledge in the association of the Supreme Personality of God. Because here, both happiness and distress are effect of the illusory energy. Though we prefer happiness than distress, it is actually illusory; both happiness and distress are illusory, they are effect of illusory. So the transcendentalists advise us, follow the religious principles under proper guidance of a bona fide spiritual master in the association of great Vaishnavas, and come to the platform of self-realization, where you will be able to perceive the effect of the illusory energy as either illusory happiness or illusory distress. That is called the duality of this material world. Dvandva Mohena Bhadra Dvandva Moha. So that is the nature of this material existence, nobody can change that. So therefore we are advised, you do your duties, depending on Krishna, and always have the single-pointed aim of going back to Godhead,

**Key Quote:** "O King, no one can know the plan of the Lord, Shri Krishna, even though great philosophers inquire exhaustively, they are bewildered."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the 16th verse, explaining that even great philosophers and deities cannot fully understand the Lord's plan, and that Yudhishthira's bewilderment is negated by Bhishma, one of the twelve authorized Mahajanas.

In the 16th verse, it is said, Narhyasya Karhi Chitrajan Pumaan Veda Vinit Siddham Yad Vijignaasaya Yukta Mukhyanti Kavayokihi. The meaning of this 16th verse is, this is Bhishma addressing Yudhishthira, "O King, no one can know the plan of the Lord, Shri Krishna, even though great philosophers inquire exhaustively, they are bewildered." So it is a fact that by analyzing things in this material world, by becoming learned in the material world, by learning in the Vedic literature, one cannot ascertain what is exactly the plan of the Lord in different times, in different places, for different people. Even though great philosophers inquire exhaustively, they are bewildered. Kavayokihi Mukhyanti, they are bewildered. It explains this in the first part. The bewilderment of Maharaj Yudhishthira over his past sinful acts and the resultant sufferings is completely negated by the great authority of Bhishma. Yudhishthira was lamenting, "I am responsible for the massacre of millions of people in this bad and poor chamber. Just to enthrone me, so many people have to die." So, he was bewildered by seeing the number of deaths. And therefore, this bewilderment is completely negated by Bhishma. Now what is Bhishma's position? One of the twelve authorized Mahajanas, those who know religion perfectly. Among the created beings, only twelve personalities are described as Mahajanas. These are described as authorities in understanding the workings of nature.

### limitations of understanding, abiding by the Lord's orders, going back to Godhead

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Rather, we should abide by the orders of the Lord, the instructions given by the Lord, and pray to the Lord for His mercy to be able to maintain the single desire to go back to Godhead"
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the futility of trying to understand the Lord's plan, as even Brahma and Shiva cannot fully grasp it, and advocates for abiding by the Lord's instructions and striving to return to Godhead.

Bhishma wanted to impress upon Maharaj Yudhishthira that since time immemorial, no one including such deities as Shiva and Brahma could ascertain the real plan of the world. Shiva and Brahma are the topmost devatas. Of course, above them is Vishnu or Krishna. But other than Vishnu or Krishna, who is the supreme one, everyone else is unable to properly understand what is the plan of the Lord. So what can we understand about it? We, human beings on the earth, what can we understand? When great devatas like Brahma and Shiva themselves cannot understand the plan of the Lord, human beings can never, never, never understand it. It is useless also to inquire about it, about the plan of the Lord. Rather, we should abide by the orders of the Lord, the instructions given by the Lord, and pray to the Lord for His mercy to be able to maintain the single desire to go back to Godhead in His association, in Krishna's association, in Krishna's personal abode, as a pure devotee of the Lord. This is the whole program. Other than this, everything else is simply the reactions, and reactions of the Kala, Karma, that's all, interactions.

### following Krishna's orders, Pandavas' suffering, establishment of virtue

**Key Quote:** "Even exhaustive philosophical inquiries of great sages cannot ascertain the plan of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that even great sages cannot understand the Lord's plan and that the Pandavas' suffering was part of Krishna's plan to establish virtue, even if it meant temporary hardship for his devotees.

You can never understand. So Prabhupada says, "Even exhaustive philosophical inquiries of great sages cannot ascertain the plan of the Lord." Great sages also do not know exactly what is the plan. So we are instructed by the Acharyas, by our spiritual master, that simply abide by the orders of Krishna without argument. There are people who argue to get into debates, but they are never able to ascertain the truth or the reality of this material world. It is wisdom given to the greatest of philosophers. So it is now being concluded that the sufferings of the Pandavas were never due to their past deeds. Pandavas are pure devotees. They are participating in Krishna's Leela in the material world. The Lord had to execute the plan of establishing the kingdom of virtue, and therefore his own devotees suffered temporarily in order to establish the conquest of virtue. So this is Krishna's plan. Even his devotees have to temporarily suffer.

**Key Quote:** "Bhishma Deva was a great devotee of the Lord. But he chose to fight against the Pandavas by the will of the Lord."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Bhishma's satisfaction at seeing Yudhishthira on the throne despite fighting against him, emphasizing that Bhishma's actions were in accordance with the Lord's will to demonstrate that even a powerful fighter cannot win on the wrong side.

Because after this, Vigishtha is going to rule. Everything will be very nice after the passing of Vishnu Deva. Bhishma Deva was certainly satisfied by seeing the triumph of virtue, and he was glad to see King Yudhishthira on the throne, although he himself fought against Yudhishthira. Bhishma is also a pure devotee. He is doing his duty of fighting on the side of Kauravas because he will never take back Kauravas. But, Bhishma was certainly very happy because Yudhishthira was ascending the throne. Even a great fighter like Bhishma could not win the battle of Kurukshetra. Why? Because Lord Krishna wanted to show that the wise cannot conquer virtue. Virtue is always the supreme. Bhishma Deva was a great devotee of the Lord, but he chose to fight against the Pandavas by the will of the Lord. It is the will of the Lord that Bhishma Deva should fight against the Pandavas. Why? Because the Lord wanted to show to the whole world that if a powerful fighter like Bhishma cannot win on the wrong side—he has taken the side of Kauravas—he can never win even though he is the most powerful fighter.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "To simply accept the inconceivable plan of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses verse 1.9.17 of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining Bhishma's advice to Yudhishthira to accept the Lord's plan and take care of his subjects.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 17th verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Tasmalidam Daivatantram Vyavasya Bharatarsyabha Tasyanu Vihito Anatha Natham Pahi Praja Prabho. The meaning of this verse is, O best amongst the descendants of Bharata, I maintain therefore that all this is within the plan of the Lord. Accepting the inconceivable plan of the Lord, you must follow it. You are now the appointed administrative head, and my Lord, you should now take care of those subjects who are now rendered helpless. So Yudhishthira is being advised by Bhishma to simply accept the inconceivable plan of the Lord. This is the Lord's plan. Yudhishthira should rule the world. So Yudhishthira should not think that it was his selfish desire because of which the battle was fought. No, this is Krishna's plan. The battle should take place to actually bring together the miscreant demons who burden the earth and to actually finish the battle. So that plan of the Lord is inconceivable. The Pandavas are instructed to follow the plan of the Lord. Now Yudhishthira is the appointed administrative head. He should take care of the subjects, especially those who are rendered helpless after the battle.

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Lord teaches the world by teaching the devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a mother-in-law teaching a daughter-in-law through her own daughter to explain how Krishna teaches the world through his devotees, and how even pious people undergo tribulations.

So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, the popular saying is that a housewife teaches the daughter-in-law by teaching the daughter. There is a Vedic culture that a young girl who gets married, she is trained up. When she goes to her husband's house, she is trained up by the mother-in-law. But the mother-in-law cannot directly teach the daughter-in-law because the daughter-in-law is totally new to the house. So she teaches by teaching her own daughter with whom she is very, very familiar. And while she is teaching the daughter, the daughter-in-law has got ample opportunity to learn also. So if the daughter is making a mistake, she can learn. She can be easily corrected. So the daughter-in-law can learn by the teaching of the mother-in-law and the mistakes made by the sister-in-law. Both is possible. So like that, the example is given. Lord teaches the world by teaching the devotee. Devotee doesn't require the teaching, but the Lord teaches the world by teaching the devotee. Through Arjuna, Bhagavad Gita was spoken. Through the Pandavas, Krishna is teaching the whole world how even pious people may have to undergo some tribulations, which are the actions and reactions of the three modes.

**Key Quote:** "There is no other purpose of this creation."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the purpose of creation is to practice Krishna Consciousness and return to Godhead, highlighting the Lord's internal guidance to sincere devotees.

So this word is simply meant for practicing Krishna Consciousness while you move out of life and go back to consciousness. There is no other purpose of this creation. The devotee does not have to learn anything new from the Lord because the Lord teaches sincere devotee always from within. The Lord is seated in everyone's hand, but for the devotee, the Lord is giving constantly the directions. TESHAM SATHATAYUKTANAM BHAJATAM PRITI KURVARKAM DADAMI BUDDHI YOGAMTAM YENAMAM UPAYANTITE. Krishna directs the devotee from within the heart how to ultimately attain the abode of the Lord. And if the Lord is teaching from within the heart of the devotee, what is the need for the devotee to learn externally from the Lord? What is the need? But the Lord is doing that. He is teaching from within the heart because the Lord actually wants to instruct the whole world through His instructions given to the devotees who go to the quiet.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Suffering is also mercy."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna teaches less intelligent people through devotees and that a devotee should accept tribulations as a benediction, quoting Brahma's prayer that suffering for a pure devotee is the mercy of the Lord.

Whenever therefore a show is made to teach the devotee, as in the case of the teachings of Bhagavad Gita, it is for teaching the less intelligent men. Krishna wants to reclaim all the conditioned souls who are His own part and parcel, who are suffering in this material world. Krishna doesn't like that. As a father doesn't like His children to suffer. Krishna is our Supreme Father. We are all His children in the material world. So Krishna doesn't want us to suffer. Therefore Krishna comes and He teaches the less intelligent people through different means. A devotee's duty, therefore, is to ungrudgingly accept tribulations from the Lord as a benediction. There is a verse in the Bhagavad Gita: tattenu kampamsu saveksha māno bhunjāna evātma kṛtaṁ vipākam pradvāvapurvir vidanam namaste jīveta yogukti padesad āyapa. Lord Krishna actually is very kind to His devotees. This verse I just quoted, tattenu kampamsu saveksha māno, is a verse which is a prayer offered by Brahma to Krishna. After the Brahma vimohana leela, what is Brahma telling? That when a devotee suffers, a pure devotee, when a pure devotee suffers miseries, those are the mercy of the Supreme Lord only.

**Key Quote:** "Let me suffer for whatever past sinful activities I have performed."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how a devotee prays to suffer for past sins and engages in devotional service without being disturbed by difficulties, and how Bhishma advised Yudhishthira to take responsibility for administration to protect the citizens after the battle.

Suffering is also mercy. bhunjāna evātma kṛtaṁ vipākam. The devotee always prays to the Lord, My dear Lord, let me suffer for whatever past sinful actions I might have performed. This is pure devotional service. Let me suffer for whatever past sinful activities I have performed. Once a devotee prays like that, then he simply engages in his duties in Krishna consciousness without being disturbed by any difficulties, any material calamities or material trouble. Without being disturbed by that, he simply engages in devotional service to Krishna. Always tries to remain devotional. The Pandavas were advised by Bhishma Deva to accept the responsibility of administration without hesitation because Krishna wants pure devotees like the Pandavas to rule this world for the welfare of all the citizens. The poor subjects were without protection due to the battle of Kurukshetra. They would have lost their elders, they would have lost their...

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "None of them are real."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that pure devotees accept tribulations as favors from the Lord, understanding that happiness and distress are interactions of the gunas and that anything favorable for devotional service is auspicious.

...the others who were fighting in the battle, who were protecting them. They would have lost all those persons. So therefore, Bhishma is advising Yudhishthira, take care of these Prajams who are left without any superior help, with the help of some other well-to-do people. So therefore, Bhishma is advising Yudhishthira. Srila Prabhupada, a pure devotee of the Lord, accepts tribulations as favors from the Lord. How is it possible that I am getting some suffering and I should think it is a mercy of the Lord? It is only possible if we understand that both happiness and distress are interactions of the Gunas. None of them are real. They are interactions of the Gunas. So while Gunan interaction is happening, we foolishly interpret something according to our conditioning as nice or bringing joy, based on how it gratifies our senses. What is the basis when I say something is auspicious or in the material world something is not auspicious? It is something which is favorable for devotional service and the other thing is what is unfavorable for devotional service. So this should be the understanding of the devotees that all pure devotees accept any difficulties they face in this world as mercy of the Supreme Lord. Since the Lord is absolute, there is no mundane difference between happiness and distress or between tribulations and favors. There is no difference.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Devotional service is the only way to prepare oneself to go to this personal abode of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that devotees also face problems, but these are directly related to the Lord and help them become fixed in Krishna consciousness, emphasizing that devotional service is the only way to reach Krishna's abode and that Krishna consciousness helps overcome difficulties.

Therefore, the influence of Kala that cannot be reversed, that cannot be avoided, as much as non-devotees undergo problems, devotees also have to face some problems. But these problems that devotees face are, if they are pure devotees, it is directly related to the Lord. It is directly given by Krishna. It is given by Krishna for the sake of making his devotee fixed up in Krishna consciousness. When there are dangers, when there are difficulties in Krishna consciousness, a pure devotee by facing those dangers actually becomes strong spiritually within the heart. This one has to actually remember all this. That devotee does not mean no more problems. That is not the correct understanding of Kali Bhakti. Current understanding of Bhakti is that devotional service is the only way to prepare oneself to go to this personal abode of Krishna. There is no other way. There is no other possibility. So therefore, this correct understanding, it is not an adjustment of the mind. It is a training for the mind to realize the purity of the original scriptures and to abide by all the injunctions of the Shastras which are relevant to us without carrying any grudge within the heart. Without carrying any grudge. This is important. So how to remain cheerful even while going through some hell and that is through all the activities of Krishna Consciousness. Any activity in Krishna Consciousness will actually help us to overcome the difficulties or dangers we may face.

**Key Quote:** "Bhishma Deva is revealing, Krishna is the original personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** Bhishma Deva reveals Krishna's true identity as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, despite his appearance within the Vrishni dynasty.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 18th verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. एशवै भगवान साक्षाद आध्यो नारायण फुमान मोहयन मायया लोकम गूडश्चरति वृष्णिशूम्. The meaning of this verse: This Shri Krishna is no other than the inconceivable original personality of Godhead. He is the first Narayana, the supreme enjoyer. But he is moving amongst the descendants of King Vrishni just like one of us, and he is bewilderingly bewildering us with his self-created energy. This verse is spoken by Bhishma Deva. He is addressing the Pandavas and all the assembled sages. Bhishma Deva is revealing the identity of Shri Krishna. Shri Krishna appeared as one of the members of the Vrishni dynasty. Vasudeva, the father of Krishna, belonged to the Vrishni dynasty, descendant of King Vrishni. So Krishna appeared as the son of Vasudeva. In that dynasty, he is counted among the members of the Vrishni dynasty. So even though he is moving amongst the descendants of the Vrishni dynasty as one of them, he is actually the supreme personality of Godhead. He is not another living being. So who can recognize this? Only the pure devotees can recognize Krishna. Only the pure devotees can recognize Krishna. Others cannot. So therefore, Bhishma Deva is revealing, Krishna is the original personality of Godhead.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains the deductive process of receiving Vedic knowledge through discipline succession, contrasting it with the ascending process of modern scientific research.

Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport very nicely. Srila Prabhupada says, "The Vedic system of acquiring knowledge is the deductive process." What is the meaning of deductive process? It descends or comes down from Krishna to Brahma to Narada to Vyasa. Successively, the knowledge is handed down, without any change, as it is. Without any change, the knowledge is handed down. This is the deductive process. As opposed to this, there is the ascending process. Ascending process is the method of currently we know something by our own efforts. As opposed to this, there is the ascending process. By our own efforts, collective efforts, individual and collective efforts, we have done some amount of research in science. We know something. But further on they keep doing more research, and they add to the knowledge base. So this is the ascending process, going from the known to the unknown, little by little, but the process is fraught with so many problems. Those problems are not there in the Vedic system of deductive process, a descending process. The perfect complete knowledge is given by Krishna, the source of all knowledge, the all-knowing Supreme Personality Buddha Krishna. He gives that knowledge to Brahma, the first created being in the whole universe, whole creation. And Brahma receives that knowledge and he hands down that knowledge to his sons and disciples. So it is perfect knowledge, it is complete knowledge, and it is properly transmitted and received without any change, without any speculation, without any errors, without any additions or subtractions without any of

**Key Quote:** "The perfect system of learning is to receive it from authority if you had a proper authorized source then what you receive from that source is perfect perfect knowledge the very same system is accepted universally as truth but only the false arguer speaks against it"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of accepting Vedic knowledge through authorized sources in discipline succession, contrasting it with the blind faith people place in modern science, and how people are taught not to believe the Vedas.

those. So that is the Vedic system. So Srila Prabhupada says further, "The Vedic knowledge is received perfectly by discipline succession from authorities." Discipline succession means guru to disciple, then the disciple to his disciple, he becomes the next guru, and he hands over to his disciple. That's called the discipline succession. The Dharma Narada Vyasama 물어 ramana Bastiani like that is coming now the Ricardo Vasивa, Dr. Hernandez de Soto, is the master of dharma различiamo come down. Such knowledge is never dogmatic as ill-consumed by lesson intelligent persons. There are people who don't accept this knowledge which is coming down in parampara. They think it is dogmatic. The mother is the authority to verify the identity within the father and the few the identity of the father. She is the authority for such confidential knowledge. A child, how can a child know who is my father? The mother has to say such and such gentleman is your father. Other than that, there is no other way. Therefore, authority is not dogmatic. In the Bhagavad-Gita, this truth is confirmed in the fourth chapter, in the second verse of the fourth chapter, and the perfect system of learning is to receive it from authority. If you had a proper authorized source, then what you receive from that source is perfect, perfect knowledge. The very same system is accepted universally as truth, but only the false arguer speaks against it. Now Prabhupada is pointing out a particular problem with the present generation of people who don't accept this method of receiving from authorities in discipline succession. For example, modern space crafts fly in the sky, and when scientists say that they travel to the other side of the moon, men believe these stories blindly because they have accepted the modern scientists as authorities. Isn't that what is happening? They say we have gone to the moon and we didn't find any life there and some rocks they have got it and that's the end of the story of moon exploration. Now the people simply believe the scientists because they accept the scientists as authorities. The authorities speak and the people in general believe them. But in the case of Vedic truths, they have been taught not to believe. When it comes to the Vedas, Vedas are perfect knowledge handed down discipline succession as it is coming from the ultimate source of everything Krishna, but people have been taught not to believe. Even if they accept them, they give a different interpretation. There are some people who accept the Vedas, but they give their own interpretation. Each and every man wants a direct perception of Vedic knowledge, but foolishly they deny it if something cannot be directly perceived using their five senses. This is the system of science, so called science, modern science, that what is acceptable is what is perceivable by the five senses.

**Key Quote:** "Bhishma Deva is one of the twelve Mahajanas who knows the principles of transcendental knowledge."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the limitations of relying solely on the five senses for knowledge, using the example of the mind, and how rejecting Vedic authority leads to moral degradation, while highlighting the authority of Bhishma Deva and even Shankaracharya in accepting Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

them. For example, we have something called the mind. Now the mind is not perceived by the five senses. You cannot see the mind, you cannot touch the mind, you cannot smell the mind, you cannot taste the mind, you cannot feel the mind, you cannot hear the mind. Now does it mean that the mind doesn't exist? We all know I have got a mind, you have got a mind, everybody has got a mind, and we say mind is very disturbed, our mind is not peaceful, our mind is peaceful. We accept for sure that there is each one each and every person has got a mind. Now if it is not perceived by the five senses, does it mean it doesn't exist? That's what they say, the scientists, modern day scientists say that this is their this is their way of ascertaining what is in existence, what is reality. This means that the misguided man can believe one authority, the scientist, but will reject the authority of the Vedas. The result is that people have degenerated. Without Vedic guidance, with a guidance of Vedic knowledge, people have become godless, they have become they have become very very they have become very much their moral values are are degrading, they are losing good values just because they are rejecting the authority of the Vedas. Now Prabhupada says here is an authority speaking about Shri Krishna as the original personality of Godhead and the first Narayana. Bhishma Deva is an authority. Even such an impersonalist as Acharya Shankara has said in the beginning of his commentation on the Bhagavad Gita that Narayana, the personality of Godhead, is beyond the material creation. Narayana Paro unavyaktat. This is the Bhagavad Gita BASSHA by Shankaracharya. The universe is one of the material creations, but Narayana is transcendental to such material paraphernalia. This is what told by Shankaracharyam. Now about Bhishma Deva, Prabhupada says Bhishma Deva is one of the twelve Mahajanas who knows the principles of transcendental knowledge. These twelve Mahajanas are mentioned in the Srimad Bhagavatam. So Bhishma Deva is one of them. His confirmation of Lord Shri Krishna's being the original personality of Godhead is also corroborated by the impersonalist Shankara.

**Key Quote:** "So this is the way of receiving transcendental knowledge."
**Summary:** The speaker reinforces the acceptance of Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, supported by various Acharyas and scriptures, and explains the concept of Narayana expansions in the spiritual world, concluding with the importance of receiving transcendental knowledge through authorized sources.

All other Acharyas have also confirmed this statement and thus there is no chance of not accepting Lord Shri Krishna as the original personality of Godhead. So Bhishma Deva is one of the twelve Mahajanas. He is declaring Krishna to be the supreme personality of Godhead. Shankara Acharya is one of the Acharyas about who is explained the Vedic texts, and he accepts Krishna as the supreme personality of Godhead. The other Acharyas, Madhavacharya, Ramanujacharya, Lord Chaitanya, so many Acharyas, they have all accepted. They are confirming. So there is no question of not accepting Krishna as the supreme personality of Godhead. And even Brahma has confirmed this in the Bhagavatam, in the 10th canto, 14th chapter, 14th verse. So Krishna is the first Narayana. In the spiritual world, what is the meaning of first Narayana? Prabhupada explains this. In the spiritual world, there are unlimited number of Narayanas who are all the same personality of Godhead and are considered to be plenary expansions of the original personality of Godhead Krishna. Krishna expands as Balarama. Balarama expands as Sankarsana. Sankarsana expands as Narayana. So there are many Narayana forms, each Vaikuntha planet having one form of Narayana. There are unlimited Vaikuntha planets, unlimited forms of Narayana predominating each Vaikuntha planet. So this is the explanation given in the Bhagavatam, in the Vedas, in the Upanishads. So this is very very clear, perfect knowledge. But it has to be accepted based on the authority of Bhishma Deva, based on the authority of Shankaracharya, based on the authority of the other Acharyas, based on the authority of Brahma, Narada, Vyasa. So this is the way of receiving transcendental knowledge. That is the conclusion.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is known very confidentially as the Supreme Personality of God only through pure devotional service."
**Summary:** Bhishmadeva explains that Krishna's glories are known confidentially through direct contact by pure devotees engaged in transcendental loving service, who experience different rasas in their relationship with Him.

The meaning of this verse is, O King, this is Bhishmadeva addressing King Yudhishthira. O King, Lord Shiva, Narada, the sage amongst the demigods, Devarshi, and Kapila, the incarnation of Godhead, all know very confidentially about his glories through direct contact. This verse is spoken by Bhishmadeva to King Yudhishthira and all the other assembled sages that Krishna is known very confidentially as the Supreme Personality of God. This verse is spoken by Bhishmadeva to King Yudhishthira and all the other assembled sages that Krishna is known very confidentially about his glories through direct contact because they have direct access to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which common men do not have, because he is the transcendental personality. So, in our material condition, we are not able to see him, we are not able to approach him, we are not able to perceive him, we are not able to understand him. He is an inconceivable personality, he is a very, very great personality, he is a transcendental personality, etc. So, Prabhupada explains in the purport to this verse, "Pure devotees of the Lord are all Buddhas, or persons who know the glories of the Lord in different transcendental loving service." Bhagavad Gita has explained that Krishna can be known only through pure devotional service. So, those who are established in pure devotional service, they are called pure devotees of the Lord, and they engage always in transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord. And in that way, they know the glories of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Of course, the glories of the Supreme Lord are unlimited, because he is an unlimited personality. He is the unlimited personality. But, they know the glories according to the service they render and the revelation by the Supreme Lord. They know the glories. As the Lord has innumerable expansions of his plenary form, there are innumerable pure devotees of the Lord, because the Lord is not limited to one form. He has many, many, many, many forms. So, accordingly, he has many, many, many, many devotees of each of the form. Many devotees.

**Key Quote:** "Bhishmadeva himself is one of the Mahajanas, he has mentioned only three important names of the twelve who know the glories of the Lord."
**Summary:** The lecture identifies the twelve Mahajanas, great devotees of the Lord, and notes that Bhishmadeva, himself one of them, only mentions three names in the verse.

Now, these devotees are engaged in pure devotional service in different humors, different rasas. Humor means rasa. Some are situated in sakya rasa, some are situated in vatsalya rasa. Just like Arjuna is situated in sakya rasa. He is a friend of Krishna. Yashoda and Nanda Maharaj are situated in vatsalya rasa. Radharani, Lalitha, Vishakha, they are situated in madhurya rasa. So, like this, there are different devotees situated in different rasas in their relationship and devotional service to Krishna. Ordinarily, there are twelve great devotees of the Lord. They are called the Devotees of the Lord. They are called the Devotees of the Lord. They are called the Devotees of the Lord. They are called Mahajanas. Their names are mentioned here by Prabhupada: Brahma, Narada, Shiva, Kumara, Kapila, Manu, Prahlada, Bhishma, Janaka, Shukadeva Goswami, Bali Maharaj and Yamaraj. Twelve names. Four sets of three names were mentioned. Twelve names. Bhishmadeva, although one of them, Bhishmadeva himself is one of the Mahajanas, twelve Mahajanas. Although Bhishmadeva himself is one of the Mahajanas, twelve Mahajanas. Although Bhishmadeva himself is one of the Mahajanas, he has mentioned only three important names of the twelve who know the glories of the Lord. He has mentioned only three important names of the twelve who know the glories of the Lord. Which three names has he mentioned? In this verse, the names are mentioned of Shiva, Narada and Kapila. So he has mentioned three names out of twelve names. He himself is one of them.

### Anubhava, Devotional Service, Revelation, Bhava

**Key Quote:** "As we progress in devotional service, more and more revelation about Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, happens within our heart, within our consciousness."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how devotional service leads to a better understanding of Krishna, culminating in the stage of bhava, where one understands the absolute nature of Krishna and experiences ecstasy.

Srila Vishwanath Chakraborty Thakur is another Acharya. He is a previous Acharya. In the Gaudiya Vaishnava Sampradaya, he is one of the great Acharyas of the modern age. He explains, what does he explain? That Anubhava or the glory of the Lord is first appreciated by the devotee in ecstasy, manifesting the symptoms of perspiring, trembling, weeping, bodily eruptions, etc., which are further enhanced by steady understanding of the glories of the Lord. So, this is a little technical thing. Let me explain this. As we progress in devotional service, more and more revelation about Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, happens within our heart, within our consciousness. Just like in the beginning, we just are told, chant Hare Krishna, and you hear about Krishna from the Bhagavad Gita, from the Bhagavad, through the medium of the pure devotees or their representatives, who repeat what the pure devotees are explaining. So, this practice of Sadhana Bhakti gradually leads to a better understanding of Krishna as the transcendental personality. Transcendental personality means he is not like one of us. He is not like... He is not like an ordinary, a created being. He is not a created being. He is the original Lord. He never accepts a material body. He never accepts a material body. He never has a material body. He doesn't require a material body. He has a transcendental form. He has the transcendental supreme form. So, he comes and incarnates in that same form. So, these things we will understand gradually as we practice devotional service, by chanting, hearing, reading, doing some practical service, worshipping the Deity, etc. All these different ways of rendering service to Krishna, if we engage in those different activities, gradually our heart becomes cleansed of misgivings, of misconceptions, of ignorance, and we become enlightened, gradually. It takes time. So, as the enlightenment... As the enlightenment increases, as the knowledge about Krishna becomes more and more revealed in the heart, we come to a stage called bhava. Bhava is the stage where we are able to understand the absolute nature of Krishna. He is non-different from his name, from his quality, from his activity, from his paraphernalia, from his... From his code, from his form, from his deity, from his descriptions in the Bhagavatam, he is non-different. All are identical, absolute, personality of Godhead.

### Anubhava, Ecstasy, Ashtasatvika Vikara, Krishna-Yashoda Relationship

**Key Quote:** "Anubhava is appreciated by the devotee in ecstasy."
**Summary:** The lecture elaborates on anubhava, a subdivision of bhava, characterized by ecstasy and physical symptoms like perspiring and trembling, using the example of Yashoda binding Krishna with a rope.

In that bhava, there are different sub-divisions, one of which is explained here as anubhava. Anubhava is appreciated by the devotee in ecstasy. Ecstasy means bhava. Ecstasy means bhava. Ecstasy means bhava. So, in the stage of bhava, there is ecstasy, and that ecstasy means one is able to experience extreme joy, spiritual joy, through symptoms like perspiring, trembling, weeping, bodily eruptions, etc. There are eight such symptoms called ashtasatvika vikara. There is a change in the body. The body cannot contain the spiritual transformation. There is a transcendental joy called ecstasy. So, therefore, there are changes in the body. And these are all symptoms which are manifest in this body, which confirms that the devotee has advanced to the stage of being able to experience the ecstasy because of coming to the stage of bhava, advancing to the stage of bhava. Now, these symptoms of bhava, like perspiring, trembling, weeping, etc., are further enhanced by steady understanding of the glories of the Lord. There is an initial understanding of the glories. We begin to understand the glories of the Lord. And then after that the devotional service continues and the understanding becomes steady. It is not an effect that is experienced for a little time and then the effect is gone. No, it becomes steady, it becomes continuous. Such different understandings of bhava are exchanged between Yashoda and the Lord as a small child, the son of mother Yashoda. The Lord binding Krishna, Yashoda binding Krishna with the rope, Damodar Leela and in the chariot driving by the Lord in the exchange of love with Arjuna. These are not ordinary activities.

### Krishna-Arjuna Relationship, Subordination, Love, Glories of the Lord

**Key Quote:** "The glories of the Lord which are exhibited in this being subordinated before his devotees is another feature of the glories of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Krishna's relationship with Arjuna, highlighting how Krishna assumes a subordinate position as Arjuna's chariot driver out of love, showcasing another aspect of His glories.

Or Krishna driving the chariot of Arjuna, Partha Sarathi on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. This is also an exchange of love between the Lord and his pure devotee Arjuna. Krishna has no need to do anything. Bhati is engaged in activities and relationship with his devotees out of love for them. And the devotees also, they are engaged in serving Krishna in their relationship with Krishna in different ways. So, in some of these exchanges of love, the Lord assumes an equal position or a subordinate position. In the case of Arjuna, normally Arjuna and Krishna as friends are on an equal platform. But, when Krishna agreed to become the chariot driver of Arjuna, then Krishna assumed the subordinate position. Arjuna is ordering Krishna. In the first chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, this statement is there by Arjuna to Krishna: "Kindly take my chariot between the two armies who are assembled for fighting in the battlefield of Kurukshetra." Arjuna is ordering Krishna. Now, the special feature of such an exchange is explained here by Prabhupāda. The glories of the Lord which are exhibited in this being subordinated before his devotees is another feature of the glories of the Lord. You see, when the Lord agrees to become subordinate of Krishna, he agrees to become subordinated by the devotees because he is the Supreme Lord. He is always the Lord. He is always the Master in all circumstances. But, he agrees to become subordinate in the exchange of love. So, it is another feature of the glories of the Lord. It is the glory of the Supreme Lord. Even though he is unconditionally always the Supreme Lord, he agrees to become subordinate to his devotees out of love for the devotees.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord says, I put my devotee into difficulty and thus the devotee becomes more purified in exchanging transcendental bhava with me."
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by explaining that the difficulties experienced by devotees, like the Pandavas, are not material problems but opportunities for exchanging transcendental bhava with the Lord and becoming purified.

So, Prabhupāda says, even the Pandavas experiencing some difficulties, that is another exchange of transcendental bhava between the Lord and the devotees, the Pandavas. So, the Lord says, "I put my devotee into difficulty and thus the devotee becomes more purified in exchanging transcendental bhava with me." So, don't think the Pandavas experiencing difficulties is any kind of material problems which ordinary conditioned souls experience in their daily life. No, it is not that at all. The devotees are always free from material miseries even in the material world. But, apparently they sometimes become distressed. But, that is due to the Lord putting them in difficulty to exchange transcendental bhava.

### Krishna's energies, Paramatma, Guidance, Devotional service

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is already the chariot driver and counsel of every living being."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Krishna is present everywhere through his energies and as the Paramatma, guiding everyone from within, and that his role as Arjuna's chariot driver was due to Arjuna's devotional service.

The sun is identified with every inch of the sun rays. The sun is somewhere in the spiritual sky, millions of miles away from the earth, but the sunshine is coming to the earth and providing heat and light and energy and sustaining life on this planet. So that sunshine is, in one sense, not different from the Sun. It is the energy of the Sun, and we can identify the Sun as full of this energy, which we call sunshine, sun rays. Similarly, the Lord is distributed by his different energies. The Lord is present by virtue of his being present as energy, his own energy spread everywhere. He is Paramatma, the Supersoul, present in everything that is present in the universe and in the universe and in the universe, and everyone has a supreme guidance. Not only Krishna's energies are spread everywhere in this material world as a material energy, he has also entered into everyone's heart, every living being's heart, as the Supersoul, as the Paramatma. That is another form of Krishna, who is an expansion of Krishna, who has entered into everybody's heart, and he is giving guidance to every living heart, and he is giving guidance to every living being from within the heart. Therefore, Krishna is already the chariot driver and counsel of every living being, Sarathi. He is not just guiding Arjuna alone; he is guiding everyone as the Paramatma in their heart. So, therefore, Prabhupada is explaining how, when Krishna exhibits himself as chariot driver of Arjuna, there is no change in his exalted position. He is already seated in Arjuna's heart as the Paramatma. He is guiding Arjuna, so externally when he apparently becomes the chariot driver of Arjuna and guides Arjuna while driving his chariot, there's no change in his position. So it is only because of the devotional service that Arjuna wants to render to Krishna.

### Krishna's absolute nature, Superior and inferior positions, Loving reciprocation, Devotee relationship

**Key Quote:** "Krishna being absolute there is no difference between his superior position and inferior position in his relationship with his devotees he remains always the supreme lord"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the absolute nature of Krishna, explaining that there is no difference between his superior and inferior positions, and that all his actions are loving reciprocations with his devotees.

Otherwise, to give guidance to Arjuna, Krishna is already in Arjuna's heart. What is the need for Krishna to come externally, appear as the chariot driver of Arjuna? There is no need. Then Prabhupada explains he does that for the sake of teaching the others, not Arjuna. For the sake of teaching others, he speaks the Bhagavad-Gita to Arjuna. Even though he is a chariot driver of Arjuna, he is the Lord, and he speaks Bhagavad-Gita, and through Arjuna, he is instructing and educating the whole world. So this is the absolute nature of Krishna. For Krishna, there is nothing superior and inferior action. When he is instructing Arjuna as the spiritual master of Arjuna, he is in apparently in a superior position. Arjuna is submitting, surrendering, and Arjuna is inquiring from Krishna, "Kindly guide me, kindly instruct me, kindly enlighten me," and Krishna is instructing, enlightening Arjuna, so superior position. When Arjuna is ordering, "Take my chariot between the two armies," Krishna is in an inferior position apparently, but actually, it is explained Krishna being absolute, there is no difference between his superior position and inferior position. In his relationship with his devotees, he remains always the supreme Lord. He may assume any—He may do any activity, inferior or superior according to our calculation, but as far as Krishna is concerned, it is simply his loving reciprocation with his devotees, whether it is Mother Yashoda, whether it is Radharani, whether it is Arjuna, whether it is any devotee, even Bhishma. We will hear how Bhishma is praying to Krishna, "Kindly be present before me at the time of my death, quitting the body."

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udhirayet In this session we will be discussing from the 22nd verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This chapter is entitled The Passing Away of Bhishma Deva in the Presence of Lord Krishna. Tathapi Ekanta Bhakteshu Pashya Bhupanukampitam Yanme Asums Tyajatasakshat Krishnodarshanam Aagataha The meaning of this verse is, Yet despite his being equally kind to everyone, he has graciously come before me while I am ending my life, for I am his unflinching servitor. Bhishma has already described Krishna, that Krishna is the absolute personality of Godhead. He is present in everyone's heart. He is equally kind to everyone. He is free from the false ego of differentiation. Therefore, whatever he does, he is equi-balanced. He is free from all material inebriety. Now further, he is describing Krishna's kindness upon himself, that when he is about to quit his body, Krishna has come in front of him. Now this is a very, very... Because Bhishma is describing his position as his unflinching servitor.

### Dependence on Krishna, illusory energy, limitations of material affection

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This is the position of every one of us, that we have no other protector other than Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the idea that true protection comes only from Krishna, as material affection is limited by the illusory energy and the modes of material nature.

Unflinching servitor, the word used is Ekanta Bhakteshu. Ekanta Bhakta. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, The Supreme Lord, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, Sri Krishna, although equal to everyone, is still more inclined to his unflinching devotee who is completely surrendered and knows no one else as his protector and master. This is the position of every one of us, that we have no other protector other than Krishna. Why do I say that? Because, even though in the material world we have our well-wishers, our parents, or our near and dear family members, who actually, within the heart, they have a sense of affection. For us, each one of us has got somebody who is very dear to us. Even then, all this affection is on the platform of the illusory energy. This truth is not known to most people in this world. I don't mean to say that people make a show of being affectionate while they don't have any affection in the heart. I don't mean that. What I mean is, each one of us, we are in ignorance about our real self. We are completely under the clutches of the three gunas, three modes of material nature. So, we are not able to express our affection when our consciousness gets bewildered by the influence of the external energy. So, even though I want to give protection to somebody whom I consider as my very, very, very dear relative or friend, still, because I myself am a person who is a person, I am not able to express my affection. Not in a secure position, how can I give protection to somebody else when my own position is very, very insecure? So therefore, who is the person who can really give everyone real protection, who is above the three gunas, who's transcendental to the modes of material nature? So that is explained by Prabhupada.

### Eternal life, illusory energy, spiritual vs. material platform, absolute dependence on Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Having unflinching faith in the Supreme Lord as one's protector, friend and master is a natural condition of eternal life."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the temporary nature of material life under the influence of the illusory energy with the eternal life attained through absolute dependence on Krishna on the spiritual platform.

So Srila Prabhupada further says, Having unflinching faith in the Supreme Lord as one's protector, friend and master is a natural condition of eternal life. This is exactly what I mentioned, that it is natural for all of us to seek Krishna's protection, provided we are situated on the spiritual platform, the condition of eternal life. Right now, what is our condition? We are under the clutches of the illusory energy and therefore our life in this body is temporary. We are on the material platform of the three gunas in which there is creation, maintenance, and destruction. The characteristic of Raja Guna is creation. The characteristic of Sattva Guna is maintenance. The characteristic of Dhamma Guna is destruction. So this body is created and that is when we say birth takes place and then this body is maintained when we say there is sustenance of this body the body is maintained and then at a certain time after a limited duration of time this body will be destroyed. This body cannot be maintained anymore. We say death. Death means the destruction of the body. So it is totally different on the spiritual platform. We as each one of us is spirit soul. It is totally different. A living entity is so made by the will of the Almighty that he is most happy when placing himself in a condition of absolute dependence. See the nature of spiritual life is such that there is absolute dependence on Krishna. And material life means there is relativity. Somebody I can depend more somebody I cannot depend as much somebody else may be somewhat dependable all these relativities exist but there is no one I can absolutely depend on because nobody is fully secure themselves. Their own position is always shaky. In terms of their material body anyone who is in a position of security anyone who possesses a material body because of taking birth under the illusory energy their own position is insecure. So what security they can give to others when their own position is not secure. The opposite tendency is the cause of fall down.

### False egotism, independence from Krishna, desire to lord over, root cause of troubles, Bhishma Deva's teaching

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The root cause of all troubles is there in false egotism."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the tendency to be independent of Krishna, driven by false egotism and the desire to lord over material nature, is the root cause of all troubles and the fall down of the living entity.

The tendency to be independent of Krishna's protection. The living entity has to be and has this tendency of falling down by dint of misidentifying himself as fully independent to lord it over material nature or material world. We have this tendency because of the enviousness towards Krishna or because of the desire to lord over like Krishna. Krishna is the supreme lord. He is the absolute lord of everyone and everything. So trying to imitate Krishna trying to compete with Krishna trying to forget Krishna all these tendencies cause the fall down of the living entity from Krishna's protection. The root cause of all troubles is there in false egotism. As soon as one desires to be independent of Krishna or one desires to lord over others or take Krishna's position or imitate Krishna immediately there is this false ego. This is the root cause of all problems. That covers our original consciousness of complete dependence on Krishna. To become secure and safe under the protection of Krishna under the absolute protection of Krishna means to draw towards the supreme lord Krishna in all circumstances. And that is what Bhishma Deva is teaching all of us.

### Unflinching devotion, Krishna's protection, relationship of the soul, Bhishma's example

**Key Quote:** "The appearance of Lord Krishna at the deathbed of Bhishma ji is due to his being an unflinching devotee of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that Krishna's appearance at Bhishma's deathbed is due to his unflinching devotion and emphasizes that the relationship between the soul and the Supreme Soul is eternal and not based on bodily connections.

The appearance of Lord Krishna at the deathbed of Bhishma ji is due to his being an unflinching devotee of the Lord. So when somebody is a pure devotee under all circumstances, unfailing in all circumstances, then the Supreme Lord protects such a devotee always, especially when the devotee has to quit the body at the time of death. That is a critical moment in one's life. Arjuna had some bodily relation with Krishna because the Lord happened to be his maternal cousin. But he did not have any physical relation with Krishna. But Bhishma had no such bodily relation. When Krishna helps the Pandavas, somebody may think that, Oh, because Krishna is related to the Pandavas through some bodily relationship. Actually, there is no bodily relationship between Krishna and anybody. Krishna does not have a material body. So where is the question of bodily relationship? But even if for the sake of his Leela, he appears as the son of Devaki or Vasudeva. Vasudeva and Kunti are having that blood relationship. Vasudeva is the brother of Kunti. So Kunti's sons, the Pandavas, and Vasudeva's son Krishna, through such relationships between Vasudeva and Kunti, they are related as maternal cousins. But what about Bhishma? Bhishma has no such bodily relationship. So therefore, Prabhupada says, in the case of Bhishma, the cause of attraction was due to the intimate relation of the soul. So how is it that Krishna appeared in front of Bhishma? And Bhishma is acknowledging that very kindly the Supreme Lord has appeared when I am about to quit the body. It is because of the relationship of the soul. And that relation is eternal. It is never based on any bodily connections. It is a relationship between the soul with the Supreme Soul.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by explaining that while Krishna has no material body, he is pleased when addressed in terms of his loving relationships, and ultimately, Krishna appeared to Bhishma because of their eternal relationship as Lord and unflinching servitor.

Yet, it is particularly explained by Prabhupada here, because the relation of the body is very pleasing and natural, the Lord is more pleased when he is addressed as the son of Maharajananda, the son of Yashoda, the lover of Radharani. Though the Lord has no bodily relationship, but when he appears to have some relationship through his Deela of appearing as the son of Yashoda and Nanda, and he appears to have a loving relationship with Radharani, so then when he is addressed as Radharamana, Radhakanta, Yashodanandana, Nandanandana, he is very, very, very pleased. So, we have to understand this point that Krishna has appeared because Bhishma is the unflinching servitor of the Lord, which is an eternal relationship with the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains how attentive devotion, meditation, and chanting the holy name can liberate a devotee from fruitive activities at the time of death.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 23rd verse of the 9th chapter.

He is explaining how, when the Lord appears in the mind of the devotee by attentive devotion, meditation, chanting of the holy name, that is explained here: VACHA YANNAM KIRTAYAN. So by chanting of the holy name, by attentive devotion and meditation, the Lord releases the devotee from the bondage

of fruitive activities exactly at the time of quitting the body. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, yoga means concentration of the mind detached from all other subject matter. Simultaneously, concentration of the mind on the lotus feet of Krishna, or on the holy name of Krishna, or on the form of Krishna, this transcendental form of Krishna, while simultaneously being completely detached from all other subject matter. So such concentration, Srila Prabhupada explains, is Samadhi, the highest perfection of yoga, or cent per cent engagement in the service of the Lord. Even though a devotee may not be engaged in Ashtanga Yoga practice, in Bhakti Yoga also the same perfection of Ashtanga Yoga called Samadhi, or cent per cent absorption in the Supreme Lord, is possible by cent per cent engagement in devotional service of the Lord, either through chanting or through hearing or through worshipping or through remembering the Lord's pastimes, the Lord's form, the Lord's name. So Srila Prabhupada further explains, one who concentrates his attention in that manner is called a yogi.

Atmaniveenam, last one. By such practice of yoga, or linking up in the service of the Lord, one is recognized by the Lord himself, as it is explained in the Bhagavad Gita concerning the highest perfectional stage of samadhi. In the Bhagavad Gita, 6th chapter, Krishna explains this total absorption of the mind in devotional service is actually Samadhi. The Lord calls such a rare devotee the best amongst all the Yogis: Yoginam api sarvesham madhgate na antaratmana sraddhavan bhajate yomam same yukta tamo matah. Yukta, yukta tara, yukta tama. Positives, comparative and superlative. So, the best amongst all Yogis, yukta tamo matah, Yoginam api sarvesham, among all Yogis, the best amongst all Yogis is a devotee who is totally absorbed in devotional service of the Supreme Lord 24 hours a day.

Even though physically we may be doing so many activities, even though mentally we may be engaging in different kinds of thoughts, but in the background, the consciousness, which is the energy of the soul, is a very important consideration. What is the background consciousness? Generally, those who are non-devotees, their background consciousness is that of sense enjoyment, or self-gratification, the sense of independent existence without any connection with Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a sense of consciousness, independent existence, is actually the reason for the material bondage. And the opposite of this is the sense of belonging to Krishna eternally, absolute dependence on Krishna. And this sense of consciousness is called the perfect sense of consciousness, where one is able to concentrate the attention

completely on Krishna. By the divine grace of Krishna, such concentration is not possible without the mercy of the Lord. And the Lord is very, very merciful and kind to his pure devotee, unflinching servitor. Thus, by chanting his holy name before quitting the body, the yogi is at once transferred by the internal energy of the Lord to one of the eternal planets, where there is no question of material life and its concomitant factors. See what happens at the time of death, the devotee quits the body, chanting the holy name of the Supreme Lord, because he has practiced chanting constantly, always. Satatam kirtayam domaam. Kirtaniya Satatam. The devotee is at once transferred by the internal energy of the Lord. This has been explained by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. This Daivim Prakriti is referring to the internal energy of the Lord, the personal energy which is specially meant for his devotees. For the Lord and his devotees, this personal energy which is the yoga maya, antaranga shakti, spiritual energy.

So this gunamayi maya offers an obstacle for those who want to get out of this material existence. It offers an obstacle, duratyaya. And the yoga maya or the atma maya, personal energy of the Lord, simply transfers the devotee immediately, at once, to the eternal planets. And what is the nature of eternal planets? Parastasma tu bhavonyo vyakto vyakta sanatana. Sanatana. Those planets are sanatana, where there is no question of material life and its concomitant factors. Material life is characterized by repetition of birth and death. And between birth and death, there is janma mrittyu jara vyadhi dukha dosha anudarshanam. Again and again, repeatedly, we have to face these concomitant factors of disease, old age, death, rebirth, disease, old age, death and rebirth. We have to keep on facing these concomitant factors. In the eternal planets, there is no death, there is no old age. This knowledge is not known to many people.

**Summary:** The lecture concludes by stressing the importance of guidance from a pure devotee and spiritual master to understand the Bhagavad Gita and the possibility of transferring oneself to the eternal planets through devotional service and chanting at the time of death.

That there is another world, Parastasmatubhavonyo, Anyabhava, that is transcendental, Paraha. Parambhavam, or Parambrahma, Paramdhama. So this Paramdhama, that transcendental world, that is unknown to people. They read Bhagavad Gita, but because they are not guided by the proper authority, therefore they do not know that Krishna doesn't belong to this world. They do not know Krishna is a transcendental supreme personality. He has his personal abode. He is inviting us, please come back to my personal abode. Don't remain in this material world which is subject to creation and destruction repeatedly. Bhutva Bhutva Praliyate. Everything is explained in the Bhagavad Gita very clearly. But if you are not guided by a pure devotee, spiritual master, you will never understand all these things merely by your reading the Gita, or following some translation which is done by a speculator, non-devotee. You will never understand all these facts. So here it is explained that simply by practicing devotional service and preparing oneself to be able to chant the holy name at the time of death, one can simply transfer oneself to the eternal planets where there is no repetition of birth and death.

Lord Krishna. What is the identity of Krishna? Though he appears as a son of Vasudeva and Devaki, though he appears to be like one of the descendants of the Vrishni dynasty, a Kshatriya, but he is not a Kshatriya, he is not a person of this world, he is the transcendental Supreme Personality. So Shri La Pravapada says in the purport, Bhishma Deva knew well that Lord Krishna is the original Narayana, Govindam Adi Purusham Tamaham Bhajwami, this is what is said in the Brahma Samhita, by Lord Brahma, he declares Govinda or Krishna, Ishwaraha Paramahakrishnaha, he is the original Supreme Personality of God.

plenary expansion of Lord Krishna, that Bhishma Deva knew. So he did not consider Krishna as an ordinary person. Indirectly, he desired Lord Shri Krishna to manifest himself in his four-handed feature of Narayana. Bhishma Deva is preparing to quit the body because he had the blessing from his father that he could quit his body whenever he desired. In what sense, whenever he desired, what does it mean? It means that he can choose the most auspicious moment to quit the body. Again, this is explained in the Bhagavad Gita, that for somebody who is not a pure devotee of Krishna, they have to select an auspicious time to quit the body in order to escape rebirth.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the fate of those with material desires, who are forced to take rebirth, with that of devotees, who are directly taken by Krishna to the spiritual world.

In order to escape rebirth. For a common person, generally, because the person has some material desires, he has the right to quit the body. So he has to quit the body. Such a person has to take birth again in this material world to fulfill those desires. But somebody who is free from all material desires, even such a person, if he is not a devotee, he has to quit the body at an auspicious time. That means the passage of the soul from this material world to the spiritual world is controlled by higher authorities, in the case of non-devotees. For devotees, Krishna directly takes charge. As was explained in the previous words, at once, by Krishna's arrangement, a pure devotee is transferred by the internal energy to one of the eternal planets, as soon as the devotee quits the body. As soon as. So that's not true for non-devotees.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Bhishma's humility as a Vaishnava, highlighting his desire to see the Lord's face at the moment of death despite being guaranteed to go to Vaikuntha.

body. Now why is Bhishma desiring this? That Srila Prabhupada says, a Vaishnava is always humble in his behavior. This is Bhishma's humility as a Vaishnava. Why is it said that Bhishma is humble? Because it is explained by Prabhupada, although it was certain that Bhishmadeva was approaching Vaikunthadharma just after leaving his material body, still as a humble Vaishnava he desired to see the beautiful face of the Lord, for after quitting the present body, he might not be in a position to see the Lord anymore. See, this is the humility of the Vaishali. Bhishma's mind is completely absorbed in the thought of Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So he is guaranteed to actually go to the Vaikuntha planet after quitting his material body, because he is absorbed in that kind of thought. But then, he is doubly ensuring that he wants, at the last moment of quitting the body, to see the beautiful face of the Supreme Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Bhishma's desire to see Krishna's lotus face at the time of death and references the Bhagavad Gita to explain how devotees who are always absorbed in Krishna can leave their bodies at any time.

That's why the description is there, that Kalevaram yavad idam hinomi when I quit this body, prasanna-hasa-aruna-lochi na ullasat mukham bujaha. The lotus face of the Lord may be visible to me at the time of quitting the body, because the Lord has come personally before Bhishma Deva. So, as a humble Vaishnava, he is thinking, I may not be able to see the Lord after I quit this body. Of course, that is assuming that he may not actually go back to the spiritual world. In that case, he still, till the last moment, he wants to be having darshan of the Lord, the last darshan he wants to have. A Vaishnava is not puffed up, although the Lord guarantees his pure devotee entrance into his abode. Krishna says, for his pure devotees, in the 8th chapter, Krishna explains this in the Bhagavad Gita, for my devotees, they can quit their body any time, because they are always absorbed in thinking of me,

Like this, a devotee, such a devotee, who is constantly engaged, tesham satata yuktanam bhajatam priti purvakam. So, such a devotee, Krishna guarantees that such a devotee will straight be transferred to the eternal world of the personal abode of the Supreme Lord. So, Bhishma says, as long as I do not quit this body, that's what Bhishma Deva is telling, yavad idam hinomi aham kalevaram as long as I do not quit this body, this means, Prabhupada says, the great general Bhishma Deva would quit the body by his own will. He was not being forced by the laws of nature.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that unlike ordinary people who are forced to leave their bodies, Bhishma had the blessing from his father, Maharaj Shantanu, to choose the time of his death.

For ordinary people, who are not yogis having that perfection of being able to quit the body at the chosen auspicious moment, for those who are not such yogis, they are forced to leave the body at a certain time by the laws of nature, higher laws. And all such people generally are attached to their body because they don't want to quit the body and they are forced and if they refuse to quit the body, the Yamadutas are there to force them to leave the body. They cannot remain against the laws. Whereas Bhishma, because he is blessed by his father, Maharaj Shantanu blessed Bhishma, who was his son, Shantanu's son Bhishma, was blessed by Shantanu, that you be blessed to quit your body at the auspicious time of your choice. So, Bhishma was very, very powerful. He could stay in his body as long as he desired. He got this benediction from his father.

So therefore, Bhishma very humbly, he is praying to the Lord. He desired that the Lord stay before him in his four-handed Narayana feature so that he might concentrate his attention upon this Narayana feature and thus be entranced in that meditation. Already, Bhishma, being an unflinching servitor, is always engaged in devotional service of the Supreme Lord. But additionally, he wants that now that the Supreme Lord has appeared in front of me, let me concentrate my attention on his lotus face, beautiful lotus face, and be situated entranced in that way, by concentrating my attention on his lotus face. He is thinking that just in case my mind is not pure at the time of quitting this body, by such concentration of my attention on the lotus face of the Supreme Lord, Krishna, my mind will be sanctified

by thinking of the Lord. Then, in such a state, if he quits his body, he did not mind wherever he might go. A pure devotee actually is not very anxious that he has to quit this world and go to the spiritual world, the personal abode of the Lord. The devotee is not very anxious about that. Why? Srila Prabhupada says here, a pure devotee is never anxious to go back to the kingdom of God. Though, that is the destination of the pure devotee, and it is guaranteed by the Supreme Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that a pure devotee is always dependent on the Lord's mercy and is ready to serve the Lord anywhere, even in hell, because their only business is to serve the Lord's mission.

Hmm? Aha! In the Bhagavad Gita, punar janma naiti mam eti sorjuna Krishna guarantees this for his devotees, pure devotees, that mam eti, they come back to me, my abode, madbhava magata. Hmm? Several places. So, a pure devotee is completely dependent on the good will of the Lord. A devotee is never proud to think that I am a pure devotee. I am entitled to enter the personal abode of the Supreme Lord after quitting this body. He never thinks like that. So, a pure devotee always is dependent on the mercy of the Supreme Lord. And, even if the Lord wants him to go to hell, a devotee is ready. Hmm? In the sense that, a devotee is ready to serve the Lord anywhere, even in the material world, even in hellish planets, because the devotee's only business is to serve the mission of the Lord in this material world, especially the mission of the Lord to actually deliver the condition, and deliver the condition source. So, that, in that way, a pure devotee doesn't particularly desire to go to the spiritual planet. Anywhere the Lord wants him to serve, the devotee is ready. So, I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes Bhishmadeva's authority on religious principles (Dharma) as one of the twelve Mahajanas, highlighting the confidential nature of Dharma and its understanding by great personalities.

Now here is the most important part of the Mahabharata. In the Mahabharata, the conversation between Yudhishthira and Bhishmadeva on principles of religion, dharma, is the bulk of the Mahabharata. Three parvas cover this conversation and the instructions Bhishmadeva gives to Yudhishthira about dharma. Bhishmadeva is one of the twelve great authorities in matter of understanding dharma. The Mahabharata says, Sattvam Nihitam Guhayam. The most confidential understanding of what is dharma is hidden in the heart of such great personalities called Mahajanas. Mahajana Yena Gata Sapanta. So Bhishmadeva is the most authoritative personality to speak on religious principles.

**Key Quote:** "Yudhishthira after the battle was over and he had won the Pandavas had won the battle but seeing the Massacre Yudhishthira was aggrieved and he could not be pacified by so many other saintly persons sages and even Krishna himself"
**Summary:** This segment describes Yudhishthira's grief and remorse after the Kurukshetra war, emphasizing the magnitude of the massacre and how even Krishna couldn't pacify him, leading to Bhishmadeva's role in providing solace and guidance.

Yudhishthira was put into a situation where he was aggrieved at the massacre that took place just for Yudhishthira to be enthroned as the Emperor of the world. Six forty million Kshatriyas were killed in that battle of Kurukshetra which lasted just 18 days because huge armies, totally 18 Akshohini divisions of armies, were participating in that battle, which is actually a world war. So Yudhishthira, after the battle was over and he had won, the Pandavas had won the battle, but seeing the Massacre, Yudhishthira was aggrieved and he could not be pacified by so many other saintly persons, sages, and even Krishna himself could not pacify Yudhishthira. He was thinking, "I am the most sinful person on the surface of this planet earth. Look at my greed for becoming the Emperor. I have become responsible for this huge massacre." So Yudhishthira was to be pacified by Bhishma Deva. This is Krishna's arrangement. So Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport that Bhishma Deva, speaking in that appealing tone, convinced Maharaja Yudhishthira that he was very soon passing away, who, it is Bhishma Deva. Bhishma Deva soon going to pass away and Maharaja Yudhishthira was inspired by Lord Shri Krishna to ask him of the

principles of religion. It is Krishna who is seated in the heart of Yudhishthira, and Krishna who is seated in the heart of Bhishma Deva. Krishna is seated in everyone's heart as the Paramatma, and particularly devotees are guided by the supreme Lord in the heart always. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita in the third chapter, 17th verse, that it is explained for the liberated souls there are no duties to be performed as prescribed in the scriptures. So does it mean that liberated souls don't follow any authority, they whimsically act? No, the liberated souls are not required to go by the principles of the Shastra of the Lord, Shastra, because they are constantly in touch with Krishna within the heart. It is Krishna only who has given us the Shastra. The Shastras are meant for those who are not in touch with Krishna within the heart, the conditioned souls, and the liberated souls, they are receiving direction from Krishna within the heart.

every moment. Every moment they're receiving the directions. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita, in the third chapter, 17th verse. So it is said here by Srila Prabhupada that Krishna inspired Yudhishthira to ask Bhishma Deva about the principles of religion, and Krishna inspired Bhishma Deva to speak even though Bhishma was in a very, very difficult situation. Bhishma spoke about the principles of Dharma elaborately to Yudhishthira. This also coincided with Bhishma waiting for the most auspicious time to quit his body because he had such a benediction from his father. Bhishma had a benediction that he could quit his body according to the time of his choice. This particular choice is not available for most souls who are forced to quit their body at a particular time of death when the lifespan is exhausted. Our lifespan is taken away with every sunrise and sunset.

**Key Quote:** "Bhagavad Gita is the complete knowledge for every human being on the surface of the earth in every aspect of their duties in different stages"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the perfection of life through Krishna consciousness and criticizes the superficial understanding of the Bhagavad Gita, asserting that it contains complete knowledge for all aspects of human life.

We have a fixed duration and we have to leave the body, which is called death, at a particular time when our lifespan is exhausted. But somebody like Bhishma Deva, they have this perfection, Siddhi, it's called Siddhi, that they can quit the body whenever they choose to. That means they can select the most auspicious time for quitting the body. This is explained in the 8th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. You see, everything is there in the Bhagavad Gita, but unfortunately people don't study Bhagavad Gita under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, therefore they are misled into thinking Bhagavad Gita is some kind of scripture which is merely talking about do your duty. Don't be attached to result. Most people, if you ask them what do you know about Bhagavad Gita, they only tell these two things. They have no understanding that Bhagavad Gita is the complete knowledge for every human being on the surface of the earth in every aspect of their duties in different stages. Now Bhishma will explain, it will be told in a later one.

verse, he explained Dharma pertaining to four varanas and four ashramas, varana dharma, ashrama dharma. So those details are there in the Mahabharata, but Bhagavad Gita contains the essence. The essence is given in the Bhagavad Gita. So Bhishma Deva spoke about Dharma to Yudhishthira in the presence of many people. Verse, he explained Dharma pertaining to four varanas and four ashramas, varana Dharama Dharama Svarga dharma, ashrama dharma, ashrama Dharama Svarga and other dans office place you superior to many great sages including Vyasadeva. Vyasadeva was present also when Bhishma was instructing Yudhishthira. Now Bhishmadeva was lying on a bed of arrows at the time when Yudhishthira approached Bhishmadeva. So he was greatly aggrieved in that condition lying on a bed of arrows. So one should not have asked him any question at that time, but Lord Krishna wanted to prove that his pure

devotee like Bhishmadeva is always sound in body and mind by dint of spiritual enlightenment. See, somebody is sent person, Krishna conscious, then irrespective of the condition of the body or the mind, they are perfected. So inside this house, they are tightly situated in Krishna consciousness always. So they are ready to speak on the principles of Dharma, on the principles of Krishna consciousness at any time you may approach them. This was demonstrated by Srila Prabhupada also. Towards the end of his manifest presence in this world, Srila Prabhupada has had over a lifetime of service to the Brahmins in the Brahmins. He was always in every place to meet the Brahmins. So in that time, the Brahmins and the weak and initiated, but still he was surrounded by devotees who were constantly chanting the Hare Krishna mantra and Prabhupada used to receive reports about preaching all over the world in so many centers and he would give directions when they were, when the disciples were asking questions and he was dictating purpose of Bhagavatam. The last chapter that Srila Prabhupada translated and gave purpose of the Bhagavatam was the 10th canto, 13th chapter. You can go through that 10th canto, 13th chapter translation and purpose by Srila Prabhupada. He was dictating, he was very, very weak, but the consciousness was perfectly clear. Devotees have actually recorded that, then they have transcribed as they usually did, always were doing that even before, so Prabhupada was giving perfect

It also emphasizes Krishna's desire to glorify his devotees, highlighting that worship of devotees is more valuable than worship of Krishna himself, and Krishna inspired Yudhishthira to ask questions to Bhishma.

knowledge coming in the parampara, perfect knowledge. So it is described here, in any circumstances, a devotee of the Lord is in perfect order to speak the right way of life. And Maharaj Yudhishthira, he preferred to solve this problematic questions by asking Bhishma Deva rather than ask anyone else present there because many great saintly persons and sages arrived there understanding that Bhishma Deva is going to quit his body at the most auspicious time and that privilege that Bhishma had, not everyone has got that, it's very rare and this is the perfection of life to quit the body, to be able to go back to Godhead, to be able to go back to Godhead, that is the, that is the perfection of one's life, no more taking birth again. So Bhishma Deva was ready to quit his body actually because he was fully Krishna conscious. He could have quit any time, but taking a humble position, he decided to quit his body at the time, at the most auspicious time, Uttarayana Punyakala, it's called, and while he was waiting, he spoke to Yudhishthira about the principles of religious duties and Prabhupada says that worship of his devotee is more valuable than the worship of Lord Krishna himself. So Krishna wants to glorify his devotees while devotees want to glorify Krishna. Krishna wants to glorify his devotee and Krishna wanted to glorify Bhishma, therefore Krishna inspired Yudhishthira to ask questions about Dharma to Bhishma.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 26th verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Purushasvabhava Vihitam Yathavarnam Yathashramam Vairagya Rago Padibhyam Amnatobhaya Lakshanam. The meaning of this verse is: At Maharaj Yudhishthira's inquiry, Bhishma Deva first defined all the classifications of caste and orders of life in terms of the individual's qualifications. Then he systematically, in two-fold divisions, described counteraction by detachment and interaction by attachment. So the description continues by Suta Goswami to the sages of Naimisharanya that this conversation between Yudhishthira making inquiry about caste and orders of life, about dharma, and Bhishma replying is given in great details in the Mahabharata, but the summary is given here.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Everything goes by quality not by birth"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Varna Dharma, explaining the four divisions of society (Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras) based on their acquired nature and occupational duties, emphasizing that it is based on qualification, not birth.

So Bhishma first of all explained Varna Dharma. A civilized society is divided into four Varanas based on occupational duties, occupational engagements, according to their acquired nature. So those in Sattva Guna, their acquired nature is suitable for doing Brahmanical duties: Brahmanas. Kshatriyas, their acquired nature is Rajoguna. So they are suited for doing occupation of a Kshatriya: administrative duties, protection against harm of the innocent people, saintly persons, weaker sections of society. And the Vaishyas, their acquired nature is a mixed mode of passion and ignorance. So they are suited for doing Vaishya duties. They are the economic generators of the society. And the Shudras are mostly in the mode of ignorance, and they are mentioned in the Mahabharata. They are meant for doing some labor. They are meant to engage in the service of the upper three divisions: Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas. Everything goes by quality, not by birth, not by some hereditary title. No. It goes by qualification. So in terms of the individual's qualifications, he described Varana Dharma. What is Brahmana Dharma? What is Kshatriya Dharma? What is Vaishya Dharma? What is Shudra Dharma?

**Key Quote:** "Everyone should get free from bondage"
**Summary:** The speaker briefly mentions Ashrama Dharma, the spiritual divisions of life, and emphasizes that the ultimate goal of both Varna and Ashrama Dharma is to liberate everyone from material bondage.

And he described the Dharma of the different Ashramas. Ashrama is spiritual division: Brahmachari, Grahastha, Vanaprastha, Sanyas. So Brahmachari Dharma, Grahastha Dharma, Vanaprastha Dharma, Sanyas Dharma, everything Bheeshma Deva described systematically. Then he also described counteraction by detachment and interaction by attachment. So Srila Prabhupada explains these things in the purport. Prabhupada has written elaborate purport. I don't have time to go through the whole purport. I will try to cover some important points that the conception of the four Varanas and four Ashramas as planned by the Lord Himself, as described in the Bhagavad Gita: Chatur Varnyam Mayasrishtam Gunakarma Vibhagshah, is to accelerate transcendental qualities of the individual person so that he may gradually realize his spiritual identity and thus act accordingly to get free from material bondage with your conditional life. See, the goal is that everybody should be freed from bondage, not just the brahmanas, not just some few educated or learned people. No. Everyone should get free from bondage, and that's possible by following the Dharma. Anyone and everyone can actually become liberated.

**Verse References:** BG 4.13
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "That is not Varnashrama Dharma"
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the common misunderstanding of Varnashrama Dharma as a system of artificial domination, clarifying that it is meant to train individuals for self-realization and liberation, distinguishing human life from the activities of animals.

That is the whole idea. In the Mahabharata, it is most elaborately explained by Bhishma Deva in the Shanti Parva beginning from the 60th chapter. Prabhupada has given reference. Where do you get details? Here it is briefly explained. It is just mentioned. It is not even explained. But Prabhupada gives a little explanation here. Now the Varnashrama Dharma is most often misunderstood, especially in the modern times, that this caste system has created artificial domination of Brahmanas or Brahmanas and Kshatriyas over the other sections of society. No. That is not Varnashrama Dharma. That is a misinterpretation. That is the degradation of the Varnashrama Dharma. When unqualified people claim to be Brahmanas or Kshatriyas, they tend to exploit the weaker sections of society. That is not Varnashrama Dharma. So Varnashrama Dharma is prescribed for the civilized human being just to train him to successfully terminate human life. What is successful termination of human life? Self-realization to attain self-realization and thereby become free from material bondage.

**Key Quote:** "One cannot be called a civilized person without acquiring the above mentioned preliminary qualities"
**Summary:** The speaker outlines nine preliminary qualities necessary for a civilized person, according to Bhishma Deva, and mentions that each Varna has specific occupational duties outlined in the Vedas.

So self-realization is distinguished from the life of the lower animals who are simply engaged in four activities: eating, sleeping, fearing, and mating. So Bhishma Deva advised for all human beings, not just for Brahmanas or not just for some people. No, 9 qualifications. What are they? Not to become angry, not to lie, not to equally distribute wealth, to forgive, to beget children only by one's legitimate wife, to be pure in mind and hygienic in body, not to be inimical toward anyone, to be simple. And the ninth one is to support servants or subordinates. It is explained here by Srila Prabhupada based on the description given by Bhishma Deva in the Mahabharata. One cannot be called a civilized person without acquiring the above mentioned preliminary qualities. Then there are specific qualities by which Brahmanas work, the Kshatriyas work, the Vaishyas work, and the Shudras work. Everybody has got specific occupational duties mentioned in the Vedas.

**Key Quote:** "controlling the senses is the most essential qualification"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the specific duties of Brahmanas (controlling the senses), Kshatriyas (giving charity), and how their roles contribute to a perfect society where Brahmanas guide and enlighten the population.

Now briefly Prabhupada says for the intelligent men, that is the Brahmanas, controlling the senses is the most essential qualification. Now it is the basis of morality. Why control the senses? It is the basis of morality. So if an intelligent man abuses his position, if he does not follow the Vedic way of life, he should seriously study Vedic literatures, especially Bhagavatam and Bhagavad Gita, and it is imperative that such a person willing to study should approach a bona fide spiritual master. He should not do anything which is forbidden in the Shastra. For the Kshatriya, it is especially advised to give charity and never accept charity in any circumstances. Kshatriya especially should give charity. So the Kshatriyas were meant to support the Brahmanas by giving them profuse charity, and thereby the Brahmanas could give free service to everyone in the society in matter of guiding them, giving them direction, enlightening them, and helping them whenever they were in difficulty. So this is the perfect society as described

**Summary:** The speaker describes the duties of Kshatriyas (protecting the weaker sections), Vaishyas (protecting cows and growing grains), and Shudras (rendering service), emphasizing the importance of each role in maintaining social order.

in the Shastras. Now one of the important duties of the Kshatriya is to actually protect the weaker sections of the society, the rest of the society, by not pretending to become non-violent when there is a need to chastise the miscreants, the rogues, the thieves, the plunderers. They should be severely chastised by using violence by the Kshatriyas. Then the Vaishyas, they should particularly protect cows and grow sufficient grains and agriculture and distribution of foodstuff, especially meant for the Vaishyas, and Kshatriyas were given charge of protection of the citizens. Vaishyas were given charge of protection of the cows, Goraksh, and they used to produce profusely agricultural produce and milk and milk products. And then the Shudras, they have no independence because they are not sufficiently intelligent enough to use their independence, so they are meant to render sincere service to the upper three sections so that they can get all their comforts of life simply by rendering service to the higher classes because as soon as a Shudra accumulates wealth, he should never be given money because as soon as he accumulates wealth, it will be misused for sinful activities in wine, women, and gambling.

And that's what we see happening today. Whoever is not intelligent enough to utilize accumulated wealth, they will misuse it for sinful activities, and that's what is happening. Population becomes degraded. In Kali Yuga, it is said population becomes degraded to the level of Shudras or even lower than that, Chandala. The Shudras should always be provided with all the necessities without giving them money so that they are satisfied in all respects and they don't have accumulated wealth to misuse them. And the upper three sections, they should maintain the Shudras under all circumstances. Never should the Shudras be abandoned by any of the upper sections.

**Summary:** The speaker briefly explains the Ashramas (Brahmachari, Grahastha, Vanaprastha, Sanyas) as progressive stages for developing spiritual qualities and achieving self-realization, highlighting the roles of attachment and detachment in different Ashramas, and concludes the lecture.

And the Ashramas, the student life Brahmachari, Grahastha the householder life, the retired life Vanaprastha, and the renounced life, it is progressively meant for developing spiritual qualities and progressing in self-realization systematically, and that is also explained by Bhishma Deva in detail. And the household life is for one who is attached, and Vanaprastha and Sanya's orders of life are meant for those who are detached. Hmm, householders are generally attached to family and so many family paraphernalia, but the Brahmachari Ashram is especially meant for training both the attached and the detached so that the goal is self-realization. Either somebody is attached or somebody is detached, but the goal is self-realization. That should not be forgotten. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

By divisions, acts of charity, dāna dharma, the pragmatic activities of a king, rāja dharma, and activities for salvation, mokṣa dharma. Then he described the duties of women, strī dharma, and devotees, what is bhagavad dharma, devotees, activities of the devotees both briefly and extensively, samāsa and vyāsa briefly.

**Key Quote:** "Charity is not to be given to somebody who is poor, somebody who is handicapped. No, that is not charity. That's not dāna. That is different. That's called daya."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of charity (dāna) according to Vedic culture, emphasizing that it should be given to those engaged in spiritual activities, differentiating it from compassion (daya) which is given to the needy.

So, Śrīla Prabhupāda says briefly about these different types of dharmas. These are explained elaborately in the Mahābhārata. It is given. So, here he says, to give charity is one of the householder's main functions. Among the four āśramas—Brahmachārī, Grahastha, Vānaprastha, and Sannyāsa—the Brahmachārī's, Vānaprastha's, and Sannyāsa's is, don't earn money, don't have a means of living, don't have a means of getting their livelihood. So, they are dependent on bhikṣa. They beg or live by whatever is available easily in nature. So, the Grahasthas have to do this charity, giving dāna to whom? To Brahmachārīs, to the Vānaprasthas, and Sannyāsas. All three are engaged in spiritual activities exclusively. So, charity is to be given to somebody exclusively devoted to spiritual activities. Charity is not to be given to somebody who is poor, somebody who is handicapped. No, that is not charity. That's not dāna. That is different. What is that called? That's called daya. See, try to understand the difference between dāna and daya. Prabhupāda explains this elsewhere. Daya means to show compassion to somebody who is less privileged, who is, let's say, a handicapped person, who is not able to do any work to earn money. You may support such a person by giving some help, but that is not dāna. That is called daya. It's compassion. A doctor may give free treatment to some poor person who is sick or diseased. That is called daya. That is not dāna.

**Key Quote:** "So Prabhupāda explains the concept is that everyone's energy is generated or borrowed from the reservoir of energy of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the roles of different ashramas in Vedic society, emphasizing the importance of charity from householders to those dedicated to spiritual life, and explaining that all energy originates from Krishna and should be returned to Him through loving service.

Dāna is specifically the householder, or those having wealth, giving charity only to those who is exclusively engaged in spiritual activities. And in the Vedic culture, the varnāśrama dharma is followed strictly. In such a society, the brahmachāris, the vāna-prasthas, and sannyāsīs, they don't do any activity other than spiritual activities. So a brahmachāri has got specifically the duty to learn, to get trained up, how to practice spiritual life. That is the main duty of a brahmachāri. A householder should give charity, and a person in the retired and in the renounced order of life, Vāna-prasthas and sannyāsīs, should practice penances and austerities. These are general functions for all the ashramas. Actually, the brahmachāri training is such that they should understand all the property in the entire world belongs to Krishna, the supreme personality of Godhead. No one can claim any proprietorship over anything. Therefore, the life of the householder is meant to give charity, especially to the brahmachāris, vāna-prasthas, and sannyāsīs. So Prabhupāda explains the concept is that everyone's energy is generated or borrowed from the reservoir of energy of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, the resultant actions of such energy must be given to the Lord in the shape of transcendental loving service.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Whatever we do, whatever we undergo as penance, whatever we sacrifice, whatever we eat, whatever we give in charity, must be offered to Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of rivers returning to the sea to explain that our energy, borrowed from Krishna, should be returned to Him. He quotes Bhagavad Gita to support the idea that all actions should be offered to Krishna, and explains that giving to Brahmacharis, Vanaprasthas, and Sannyasis is a way of giving to Krishna.

Rendered to Krishna. The example is given: the rivers draw water from the sea through the clouds and again go down to the sea. Similarly, our energy is borrowed from the Supreme Source, the Lord's energy. It must be returned to the Lord. That is the perfection of our energy. And Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, whatever we do, whatever we undergo as penance, whatever we sacrifice, whatever we eat, whatever we give in charity, must be offered to Krishna: yad karoṣi yad aṣṇāsi yad yahoṣi dadāsi yad yad tapasyaśi kaunteya tath kurusva madharpanam. Now, why Krishna is telling that we should give it to Krishna? Krishna is not in need. He is the source. He is the reservoir of everything. He's got unlimited wealth. So why we should give in charity to Krishna? It is actually through giving to actually the Brahmacharis and the Vanaprasthas and Sannyasis, we are giving to Krishna because they are going to utilize it for spiritual activities. In that way, it goes back to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "So the proper utilization is minimum required for your own maintenance, you definitely do utilize whatever you are earning or whatever your wealth you have inherited or earned or got from nature."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that giving charity is not renouncing something that belongs to you, but returning something that ultimately belongs to the Lord. He then transitions to discussing Rajadharma, emphasizing that the king's role is to guide citizens towards self-realization, not just sense enjoyment.

So when you give charity, actually it is going back to the original source from where you have got your wealth. So giving charity is not that something which belongs to you, you are renouncing. No, you are actually possessing something which does not belong to you. So the proper utilization is minimum required for your own maintenance. You definitely do utilize whatever you are earning or whatever your wealth you have inherited or earned or got from nature. You definitely utilize a portion of that for your own maintenance, for your subsistence, yourself, your family members, and the balance should be returned to the Lord to whom it belongs through the spiritualist, transcendentalist. That way it is going back to the Lord because the transcendentalist will only use whatever bhiksha they get for the Lord's service and not for any other purpose. Rajadharma is a great science. It is the science of ruling perfectly the kingdom, guiding the citizens so that they understand the goal of human form of life is self-realization and not sense enjoyment.

**Key Quote:** "The kings were systematically trained to become not merely tax collectors, but to become munificent in giving charity to the saintly persons."
**Summary:** The speaker continues discussing Rajadharma, highlighting the king's duty to perform sacrifices for the prosperity of the subjects and to ensure they live a life aimed at self-realization, contrasting this with modern political diplomacy.

The kings were systematically trained to become not merely tax collectors, but to become munificent in giving charity to the saintly persons. So for the prosperity of the subjects, the kings were supposed to do sacrifices. When sacrifices are performed, there is plenty of supply by the arrangement of the Supreme Lord through the agents called the Devatas. And the greatest duty of the king was to ensure that he leads the citizens in attaining ultimate salvation from material bondage. So this is Rajadharma. This is totally different from modern training in political diplomacy. This is not Rajadharma. Political diplomacy is mainly how to govern the citizens so that ultimately the citizens are going to attain complete liberation from material bondage. And it is also explained here that the taxation law was very simple. The king had a right to take one-fourth of the production made by the citizens. And who would produce? Mainly the vaisyas. And people were not grudging in parting with one-fourth of their produced wealth because that wealth which the king collected as taxes was used for providing for the citizens in so many ways. And the citizens also were rich in agriculture and animal husbandry. Therefore, they had enough grains, fruits, milk without any need for artificial ingredients like soaps and toilets and cinemas and bars. None of these things are required. Neither people had any of those in the Vedic culture.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the Vedic culture, where people were directed towards self-realization, with modern times, where wealth is often misused for sense gratification.

So this is what people were directed to live, a life mainly aimed at self-realization, not that they have wealth, they misuse that for sense gratification in so many sinful ways as is happening in the modern times. No. So that the Rajadharma was then moksha dharma. Salvation is ultimately possible by conquering the principles of lust, anger, unlawful desires, avarice, and bewilderment.

**Key Quote:** "Salvation is ultimately possible by conquering the principles of lust, anger, unlawful desires, avarice and bewilderment."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Moksha Dharma, explaining that liberation is achieved by conquering negative qualities like lust and anger. He also touches upon the roles of women in Vedic culture and the importance of pleasing the Lord.

So this is explained in the Mahabharata by Bhishma to Yudhishthira, which Bhishma is instructing. Learn to forgive people's mistakes and to become free from unlawful desires. One should not make plans, plans for enjoyment. By spiritual culture, one can be unlawful, but not more than what is minimum required. Excess sleep means one becomes lazy, one becomes dull, one becomes lethargic, and everything is spoiled by excess sleep. Sleep is very, very important. つ Cha All Explain R The Dream Insight What Suppuhan What To Why O S Name This Head Association So What Is ное so many sinful activities like that. So Bhishma Deva explained so many things. As far as the women class are concerned, they are accepted as a power of inspiration for men. So women should always be chaste, and in this way, the women will be a source of inspiration for the men under whose protection they are supposed to live. This is the Vedic culture. So like this, there are so many things. The most important thing Bhishma Deva explained is the process of pleasing the Lord, bhagavad-dharma.

How to please the Lord. So we should understand every one of us ultimately is eternal servant of Krishna and simply by worshiping the Lord but with simple ingredients but with devotion if one offers even one leaf or little water to the Supreme Lord Krishna that is the easiest way of pleasing the Lord but the important thing is bhakti, devotion. So in this way, one will actually guarantee ultimate liberation by worshiping the Lord and pleasing him through our activities. I'll stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "The correct understanding is that the Puranas, Itihases, Mahabharata, Ramayana contain factual historical narrations."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Puranas, Itihasas, Mahabharata, and Ramayana are factual historical narrations, countering the British propaganda that they are mythology.

In this session we will be discussing from the 28th verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Dharmartha Kama Mokshamscha Sahopayan Yathamune Nanakhyana Nanak Aakhyana Itihaseshu Varanaya Masatatvavit. The meaning of this verse is: Then he described the occupational duties of different orders and statuses of life, citing instances from history, for he was himself well acquainted with the truth. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport to this verse, incidents mentioned in the Vedic literatures such as the Puranas, Mahabharata and Ramayana are factual historical narrations that took place sometime in the past, although not in any chronological order. So this is a very, very important understanding for all of us that the British propaganda was that our Vedic scriptures, especially the Puranas, Itihases, like Ramayana, Mahabharata, are all mythology. The word mythology comes from the word myth. Myth means something which is not a fact. As opposed to the British propaganda that all these are imaginary stories, the correct understanding is that the Puranas, Itihases, Mahabharata, Ramayana contain factual historical narrations.

**Key Quote:** "So the descriptions in the Puranas and the Itihasas is meant to eradicate our darkness of ignorance, enlighten us about reality, about facts, not some imaginary stories."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates that the descriptions in the Puranas and Itihasas concern incidents in different planets and universes, including the spiritual world, and are meant to enlighten us about reality.

Puranas, Itihasas, Mahabharata, Ramayana contain factual historical narrations. They are all cent percent fact, though many of the descriptions may not match our present day experience of the world we live in now. We should always remember that the descriptions in the Puranas and the Itihasas, Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. concern descriptions of incidents that take place in different planets of this universe. And sometimes the descriptions are there of incidents that take place in other universes. And of course there is description of incidents that happen in the spiritual world beyond all the material universes. So that will never tally with our experience because we do not know what is the spiritual world. We do not know what are the upper planets. We do not know what are hellish planets. That is because of our ignorance. So the descriptions in the Puranas and the Itihasas is meant to eradicate our darkness of ignorance, enlighten us about reality, about facts, not some imaginary stories.

**Key Quote:** "We are simply concerned with the instructive lessons of such incidents even though they are not in order by our limited range of understanding"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the events in Vedic literature are not always presented chronologically, but the important point is the lesson we can learn.

So this has to be very properly understood and digested. Then only the reading of the Puranas, hearing of incidents in the Vedic literature will be taken seriously. So further Srila Prabhupada says, such historical facts being instructive for ordinary men were assorted without chronological reference. Just like to give in the Bhagavatam, the disappearance of Krishna is described in the 14th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 14th chapter is entitled The Disappearance of Krishna. The Disappearance of Lord Krishna. And the appearance of Krishna is described in the 10th canto of the first chapter, or 10th canto of the third chapter, first, second and third. So it is not chronologically arranged that first this happened, then this happened, then this happened. Always. Sometimes there is a description which is not necessarily in the chronological order, not necessarily in the order in which they occurred, but the important point is there is some lesson for us to learn and that lesson is important. Besides that Srila Prabhupada continues to explain, they happen on different planets, nay in different universes, and thus the description of narrations is sometimes measured by three dimensions. Our experience of life on this planet in the present age is limited. In former ages the demigods used to visit the earth planet and they were visible to ordinary men, but in Kali Yuga the demigods are not visible, they generally don't come to this earth planet.

**Key Quote:** "We should accept things because the source is perfect and authoritative"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the limitations of our understanding and the importance of accepting knowledge from authoritative sources, even if it's beyond our current experience.

In the Kali Yuga, even if they do come, they are not visible to us. So just because they are not visible doesn't mean they don't exist. Further Srila Prabhupada says, we are simply concerned with the instructive lessons of such incidents even though they are not in order. By our limited range of understanding, our understanding is very, very, very limited. We don't even know the life forms that exist in the bottom of the oceans. The scriptures inform there are 9 lakh or 900,000 varieties of aqueducts that exist in the ecology of the universe, and how many do we know? We hardly know some few hundred, that's all we do not know. We do not know of a kind of fish called Timmy Gila which can actually devour huge whales. That's a description in the Shastra, perfect description, perfect knowledge. Where do we have experience of a Timmy Gila? We don't even know such a aquatic exists, we do not know that. So we should not just accept what tallies with our understanding or our conceptions or our experience, we should accept things because the source is perfect and authoritative.

**Key Quote:** "People should not simply do anything and everything for the sake of earning money."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how spiritual practice qualifies us to perceive reality, and how the Varna Ashrama system is designed to help civilized people achieve self-realization.

And they are giving us knowledge about things which is beyond the range of our experience or understanding. And when we qualify, we are able to perceive this reality described in the scriptures. When we qualify, there is a way of acquiring these qualifications by spiritual practice. And that is what is being taught in the Vedic literature. Dheeshma Deva described such narrations before Maharaj Yudhishtira in reply to his different questions. Yudhishtira asked so many questions about Dharma. So, Varna Dharma and Ashrama Dharma. This is for civilized people. Varna Ashrama system. The society is divided into four parts, four occupational divisions according to the acquired nature. We have discussed this in the previous verses. And Brahmana Dharma, Kshatriya Dharma, Vaishya Dharma, Shudra Dharma. So, that is way of dividing the society for the sake of everyone having a common goal or aim of self-realization. That is the reason the particular occupations are recommended. People should not simply do anything and everything for the sake of earning money. No, they should not do anything sinful. So, to avoid sinful activities means to prepare oneself to advance in spirituality, to go back to the spiritual life, and prepare oneself to go back home, back to Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "They don't even know that we are accountable for every activity we do."
**Summary:** The speaker laments that modern education misses the goal of self-realization and the understanding that we are accountable for our actions, both in this life and the next.

That is the whole program. Now, the goal itself is missing in the modern education system. They do not know that we are eternal. Each one of us is eternal. They do not know this. So, the goal itself is missing. So, then where is the relevance? Studying the scriptures and living a life based on the goal of ultimate self-realization. They do not understand this. They don't even know that we are accountable for every activity we do. Not only now because of the government or the police force or some material laws that we know are enforced. Also, after quitting this body, next life we are accountable. All our actions are accountable. If I do some sinful activities in this life, I may have to suffer in this life itself the reactions for those sinful activities. I may not suffer in this life, but I will have to suffer in the next life or in future lives. So, these are certain laws that are working.

**Key Quote:** "The perfect Prayas Chitta for all types of sinful activities. Simply chant Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the human form of life offers an opportunity to correct sinful activities, and the best way to do so is by chanting the holy name of the Lord.

Now, why do the scriptures ordain that certain sinful activities, the reactions are given only in the future lives? Because in the human form of life, if I have done a sinful activity, I have got an opportunity to correct myself. Because human being has got developed intelligence. So, he can, he or she, any human being can correct their sinful activity done unknowingly or done accidentally, done inadvertently. Somehow, by force of circumstances, somebody did something wrong. They can correct themselves. That's called Prayas Chitta. And the best Prayas Chitta as described in the Bhagavatam is simply to chant the holy name of the Supreme Lord. The perfect Prayas Chitta for all types of sinful activities. Simply chant Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Therefore, people have to be educated in the subject matter of the Puranas, especially the Bhagavat Purana or the Bhagavatam and the Itihasis, two important Itihasis. There are many, many historical narrations in the Vedic literature. But the important ones, the two most important ones are the Ramayana and Mahabharata. And it is presented in a very, very interesting way, in the form of stories. But these stories are not imaginary stories. These stories are factual narrations, historical narrations. So they are real persons. Pandavas, the Kauravas, and the personalities in the Ramayana, Dasharatha, his queens, the monkeys, Hanuman, Sugriva. They are all real persons. And they actually had so much of power. They had so much of devotion. Hanuman, the topmost devotee of the Supreme Lord Ramachandra. The best devotee, among the best devotees who is engaged in Dasya, relationship as the servant of the Supreme Lord Ramachandra.

The meaning of this verse is, while Bhishma Deva was describing occupational duties, the sun's cores ran into the northern hemisphere. This period is desired by mystics who die at their will. So Bhishma Deva was specially blessed to quit his body at the most auspicious time so that he could make his destination going back home, back to Godhead. So that most auspicious time is being described in this verse as Uttarayana Kunya Kala. So Bhishma Deva was waiting for this most auspicious time to quit his body

**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing the yogi's ability to control their body and mind to choose their destination after death, a science not taught in modern education.

because he had that Siddhi. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, "The perfect Yogis or mystics can leave the material body at their own sweet will at a suitable time and go to a suitable planet desired by them." See, not only are they able to leave the body at an auspicious time, but also they can go to the planet they desire to go, which means first of all, they have full control over their senses. Their body is made up of senses. They have completely control over their senses. They have completely control over their mind because they are able to fix their attention on the particular destination they want to go. So this is a great science, and this science is not taught in our ordinary schools, colleges, modern day education system. This science is not at all taught

In the Bhagavad Gita, Srila Prabhupada says in the 8th chapter, it is said that self-realized souls who are exactly identified themselves with the interest of the Supreme Lord can generally leave the material body during the time of the fire gods effulgence, and when the Sun is in the northern horizon, and thus achieve the transcendental sky. See, there is a spiritual sky beyond this material sky. Parastasmatubhavonyo vyakto vyaktatsanatanah Paravyoma, the spiritual sky. The material sky is what we can see with these eyes, and we understand there are so many other planets in the material sky. Some are called upper planets, some are called lower planets where the conditions of living are different than those on the earth. But beyond all these material planets, beyond this universe, beyond all the material universes, there is a spiritual sky, and in the spiritual sky, there are spiritual planets, and the spiritual sky is illuminated by the personal bodily effulgence of Krishna. It's called Brahma Jyoti effulgence, spiritual effulgence. So there is no darkness. Then in the spiritual world, the material world is characterized by its being always dark, and therefore there is a necessity of illumination either by sunlight or moonlight or by fire or electricity. There is a need of illumination in this material world, otherwise by itself, the material world is dark, a dark place. Darkness means the absence of light because of which we cannot see in darkness. Our eyes are able to see only when there is light illumination. In darkness, we cannot see

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on ignorance as a characteristic of material existence and emphasizes the importance of Vedic scriptures as a source of enlightenment and knowledge.

Secondly, darkness also means ignorance. That is a characteristic of material existence. We are always in ignorance unless we become enlightened by acquiring the proper knowledge from the perfect authority, the perfect source. So that perfect source is the Vedic literature. The scriptures, the Vedic scriptures is the perfect source for this knowledge which will enlighten us. Who am I? What is this world? What is beyond this material existence? What is spiritual existence? Who is God? What is my relationship? What is my identity? Everything is a subject matter of the Vedic scriptures.

**Key Quote:** "Perfection of yoga means attainment of such supra mental states that means the mind is completely controlled"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the perfection of yoga, enabling one to leave the body at will and travel to other planets without material vehicles, contrasting this with the limitations of materialistic science.

So Prabhupada mentions here about achieving the transcendental sky, spiritual sky. In the Vedas, these times are considered auspicious for quitting the body, and they are taken advantage of by the expert mystics who have attained perfection in this system of yoga practice. The expert mystics, that means the yogis, Ashtanga yogis, they are called ashtanga yogis. They practice ashtanga yoga. Bhishma Deva was an expert mystic yogi or ashtanga yogi, so he had perfected the method of leaving the body at an auspicious time. So therefore, he was waiting for the rottrayana punya kala, and Srila Prabhupada says further, "Perfection of yoga means attainment of such supra mental states," that means the mind is completely controlled, and mind is actually elevated in the thought process, thinking process, and mind is elevated to the concept of mind and consciousness. There is no other state of mind to a spiritual level where one will be able to leave the body as desired. Yogis can also reach any planet within no time without a material vehicle. This yogic method of traveling within this universe or even beyond the universe is not a gross method that we know of ordinarily. There is no need of a vehicle, a material vehicle. Besides that, a material vehicle is useless when we are to travel to the planet sun. Sun is full of fire, so which material vehicle will withstand that? We know of now our modern day spacecraft and rockets and sputniks and all these, how they can withstand the temperature of the sun, so you cannot go to the sun planet

**Key Quote:** "So please try to understand that leaving this earth planet and going to another planet requires that we acclimatize our selves our body to the conditions prevailing there"
**Summary:** The speaker continues discussing planetary travel, emphasizing the need to adapt the body to different planetary conditions and reiterating that spiritual knowledge is a real science, exemplified by Bhishma Deva.

neither you can go in this body. So please try to understand that leaving this earth planet and going to another planet requires that we acclimatize ourselves, our body to the conditions prevailing there. So the yogis, they are able to leave this body, and in a suitable material body, they are able to go to the higher planets or to the spiritual world, the transcendental world in the suitable form. So transcendental world they can go only in a spiritual body, and upper planets also they can go in a suitable subtle body, not a gross body. The upper planets, the gross bodies are useless. One can't even go beyond a certain range of the atmosphere of the earth. The yogis can reach the highest planetary system within a very, very short time, and this is impossible for the materialist. See, yogis means they are transcendentalists as opposed to materialists. Well, no knowledge of transcendence or spirituality, spiritually they are zero. This modern day scientists, they're spiritually zero, so they are never able to reach the highest planetary system by any means. They cannot. They don't even know of its existence, what is Brahma loka. Even attempting to reach the highest planet will take millions of years at a speed of millions of miles per hour by the process that the modern day scientists talk about travelling in outer space. It will take them millions of years at a speed of millions of miles per hour, which means those planets are really, really, really far. They are very, very far, astronomical distances. That's what we hear about from the scientists, they're so far away. So Shilpa Pune Prabhupada says, this is a different science altogether. It's a science. It's not some mythology. It's not some fiction. It's not some imaginary story. It is fact, 100% fact, and Bhishma Deva knew well how to utilize it. He had to learn from the proper source, the spiritual knowledge, the spiritual techniques. Bhishma Deva knew this.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that while pure devotees don't need to wait for an auspicious time to die, Bhishma Deva waited to instruct his grandsons as desired by Krishna.

And therefore, he was just waiting for the suitable moment to quit his material body, and the golden opportunity arrived when he was instructing his noble grandsons, the Pandavas. Bhishma Deva, even though he could quit his body at any time he desired, he chose to quit his body at the auspicious time of Uttarayana Punni. One more confidential understanding we get from the Srimad Bhagavatam is that Bhishma Deva is a pure devotee of Krishna. The Bhagavad Gita says, for a pure devotee of Krishna, there is no need to quit the body at an auspicious time only. Of course, those who are practicing Ashtanga Yoga, they have to quit the body at an auspicious time in order to be able to go to the spiritual world for eternal life, full of bliss and knowledge. But those who are Bhakti Yogis or pure devotees like Bhishma Deva, they don't have to quit the body at an auspicious time. They can quit any time and their destination is always the spiritual world. They have only one destination, that is the personal abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the spiritual world. So devotees need not wait for the auspicious time. Now Bhishma Deva here, it is described, was waiting for the suitable moment so that he could instruct his grandsons as desired by Krishna. So devotees need not wait for the auspicious time. Now Bhishma Deva here, it is described, was waiting for the suitable moment so that he could instruct his grandsons as desired by Krishna.

Krishna desired that Bhishma Deva instruct the Pandavas, especially Yudhishthira who was aggrieved at the massacre that had taken place due to the battle of Kurukshetra, to enthrone Yudhishthira as the emperor of the world. So Yudhishthira's grief was mitigated by instructions given by Bhishma Deva. Also, Bhishma Deva was lying on a bed of arrows, but his mind and his intelligence was in perfect order in spite of the most uncomfortable situation in which he was lying there on the battlefield bed of arrows. So he was detached from the physical pain, completely detached because of his being situated in Krishna consciousness. That's a proof of Krishna consciousness. He was speaking perfectly the perfect knowledge to his grandsons when they were inquiring about Dharma. He spoke, the greatest authority on Dharma was speaking on Dharma. Yudhishthira was asking about Dharma. Bhishma is the Mahajana, so he's speaking about Dharma perfectly. So that is being now explained here that Bhishma instructed the Pandavas and chose the

**Key Quote:** "Krishna wanted to glorify Bhishma."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains the context of Yudhishthira visiting Bhishma on his deathbed, highlighting Krishna's desire to glorify Bhishma and instruct Yudhishthira on Dharma.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the third verse of the ninth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Bhagavanapi Viprarshe Rathena Sadhananjayaha Satair Vyarochata Nripaha Kuvera Iva Guhyakaihi. The meaning of this verse is, O Sage amongst the Brahmanas, Viprarshe, Lord Sri Krishna, the personality of Godhead, also followed, seated on a chariot with Arjuna. Thus, King Yudhishthira appeared very aristocratic, like Kuvera, surrounded by his companions, the Guhyakas. So the description continues, as I mentioned in the previous session, Yudhishthira Maharaj is going to the site of the battlefield where Bhishma is lying on the bed of arrows, ready to quit his body at his chosen time, and Yudhishthira is very much affected by the massacre, so he is going to consult Bhishma, and it is Krishna's will that Bhishma should instruct Yudhishthira specially at the last moment before he quits his body. Krishna wanted to glorify Bhishma. Bhishma is one of the Mahajanas, and he is such a great personality that he instructed Yudhishthira in the intricacies of what is Dharma, what is real religious principles. In all details he instructed, and that is the bulk of the Mahabharata, Bhishma instructing Yudhishthira, and Yudhishthira asked so many questions about Dharma.

### Krishna, Arjuna, Kurukshetra, Pandavas, Duryodhana, Materialism

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna was on the side of the Pandavas therefore the Pandavas were most powerful."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's role as Arjuna's chariot driver and the significance of Krishna being on the Pandavas' side, contrasting it with Duryodhana's materialistic calculations and inability to understand the true source of power.

So the description here is that Krishna also accompanied the Pandavas. Now, Krishna was seated on a chariot with Arjuna because in the battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna voluntarily agreed to be the chariot driver of Arjuna. This is because of Arjuna's friendship with Krishna. Krishna said he is not going to fight on any side in the battle, but whichever side he is going to be present, he is just going to give the instructions or the strategies how to fight, but he himself is not going to fight, he is not going to use any weapon in the battle. So Arjuna requested Krishna to be his chariot driver and to instruct him and direct him in the battle, in fighting the battle. And Krishna's army, the Yadu army, was on the Kaurava side. They were all well equipped to fight, so it seems like it was not so much of a powerful support that the Pandavas had, but actually the reality is, the truth is, Krishna was on the side of the Pandavas, therefore the Pandavas were most powerful. That Duryodhana could not understand. He was a materialistic person, so he was making some material calculations. Oh, we are very strong. Duryodhana was thinking that Bhishma is on our side, Dronacharya is on our side, Karna is on our side, the whole Yadu army is on our side, even though Krishna is on the side of the Pandavas, Krishna is not going to fight. So he is making material calculations, but as Sanjaya says, even before the battle begins in Dhritarashtra, that at the end of the Bhagavad Gita, Sanjaya says that Yatra Yogeshwara Krishna Yatra Partho Dhanurdhara Tatra Sri Vijaya, so victory belongs to the Pandavas because Krishna is on the side of the Pandavas, and Krishna is there, Arjuna is there. Krishna and Arjuna, they are Narayana and Nara. Arjuna is no ordinary person. Arjuna is the pure devotee of Krishna, and Krishna is a supreme personality of Godhead, so that Duryodhana is unable to understand. Those who are materialistic, those who are demoniac, they are unable to understand this.

**Key Quote:** "Bhishma always felt very sorry for the Pandavas suffering injustice at the hands of Kauravas."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Krishna's desire to give darshan to Bhishma and elaborates on Bhishma's sympathy for the Pandavas' suffering and his obligation to the Kauravas due to being maintained by them.

Any case, Krishna accompanied the Pandavas who were actually going to visit Bhishma. Now, Krishna wanted to actually give his darshan to Bhishma, especially at the time of Bhishma quitting his body. That is Krishna's mercy on his devotee. Bhishma is pure devotee, the Pandavas are pure devotees, so therefore Krishna was accompanying the Pandavas, and Yudhishthira, it is described here, appeared very aristocratic like Kuvera surrounded by his companions, the Guhyakas. Now, that is explained by Srila Prabhupada in the purport: Lord Sri Krishna wanted the Pandavas to be present before Bhishma Deva in the most aristocratic order so that he might be pleased to see them happy at the time of his death. Bhishma always felt very sorry for the Pandavas suffering injustice at the hands of Kauravas. Bhishma knew the Pandavas cause is just, but still why was he fighting on the side of the Kauravas? Because he was obliged to the Kauravas who were maintaining him. Actually, the entire kingdom belonged to Bhishma. He was the inheritor, but he voluntarily gave up, and because he voluntarily gave up, Dhritarashtra's father, Vichitravirya, became the emperor. That is Bhishma's brother. Bhishma gave up, so but still Bhishma, because he was, he had renounced the claim for the throne, he was being maintained as the elder member of the family in the royal family, he was looked after nicely.

**Key Quote:** "Bhishma was not very happy with the injustice that the Pandavas had to suffer at the hands of the Kauravas"
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain Bhishma's feelings towards the Pandavas and the Kauravas, and then transitions to explaining the comparison of Yudhishthira to Kuvera due to the wealth acquired for the Ashwamedha Yagna.

But he considered himself maintained by Duryodhana, Dhritarashtra, by the Kauravas when they were caretakers, and the Kauravas never gave the kingdom to the Pandavas, so Kauravas were all the while ruling, and they were giving the maintenance to the kingdom to Bhishma and Drona. So Bhishma and Drona, though they knew the Pandavas cause is just, still because they were maintained by the Kauravas, they had to fight on the side of Kauravas. This is etiquette. So Bhishma was not very happy with the injustice that the Pandavas had to suffer at the hands of the Kauravas, so at the last moment of his life, he was very happy to see the Pandavas get back their rightful claim to the throne of Hastinapura, the ruling of the entire world, and he also was, might have been pleased to see the Pandavas in a very aristocratic order because they deserve that. They are the proper claimants to the throne, and their cause is just, and they are very, very righteous in their conduct, and they are very law abiding. They are followers of Dharma. Yudhishthira particularly, he was very, very meticulously following the principles of Dharma, so Krishna wanted to actually make Bhishma very satisfied seeing the Pandavas very aristocratically taking charge of ruling the the world at the end of the battle of Kurukshetra. Now the comparison is made to Kuvera, why? Because Kuvera is the richest of all the demigods. He is the treasurer of the demigods. Kuvera is very rich, so Yudhishthira, he was very, very rich at the end of the battle of Kurukshetra, so it is explained that Yudhishthira was to perform Ashwamedha Yagna as advised by the sages, and for that he required money.

**Key Quote:** "Brahmanas were completely detached."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Maruth Maharaj's grand Ashwamedha Yagna and the immense wealth given to the Brahmanas, emphasizing their detachment from material possessions and their focus on spiritual pursuits.

And he sent his brothers to fetch wealth for performing the sacrifice because at the end of the battle of Kurukshetra, the treasury was empty, so they had to fetch wealth. So Krishna instructed Arjuna that there is lot of gold lying somewhere in the Himalayas. Now, Krishna knew this because Krishna is of course the supreme personality who has got the super soul in everyone's heart. Formerly there is, there was one a king, one emperor of this earth planet, Maruth Maharaj. He had performed a very, very grand Ashwamedha Yagna, and in that Yagna, he had spent lot of money. He had given lot of gold in charity to the Brahmanas who were performing the the sacrifice, and those Brahmanas, they were given so much gold that the Brahmanas were completely detached. They used to live a very simple life, even though they were respected the most in the society. They were given lot of charity specially by the Kshatriyas and the Vaishyas, but they never were attached to living a a aristocratic life. No, they kept their life very simple because they were devoted to to culture, to cultivating knowledge. They were devoted to to worshipping Krishna, worshipping God, and they were actually always very, very careful not to be overpowered by greed or lust or anger or or enviousness. You see, when somebody becomes very rich, there is a possibility that they may go on accumulating more and more wealth unnecessarily just out of greed. They may try to accumulate more and more wealth.

**Key Quote:** "Brahmanas want to be free from greed."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the role of Brahmanas in guiding society towards spiritual goals and the importance of detachment from material desires, then returns to the story of Arjuna fetching gold and earning the name Dhananjaya.

But Brahmanas want to be free from greed kama, krodha, loba, moha, mada, matsarya, then only they are in a proper position to guide and direct the entire society, the rest of the society. The Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras are guided by Brahmanas towards the higher aim of life, the spiritual goal, self-realization. Otherwise, the material world is entangling, and people easily forget what is the final goal of life, and they simply remain in material existence simply suffering repeated birth and death. So the Brahmanas always are enlightened. They maintain their position in that enlightened state of of having cultivated spiritual knowledge. They never want to be overpowered by greed or envy, so therefore these Brahmanas left behind all that golden utensils and golden plates and golden different varieties of golden paraffin that was given to them as dana, as charity. That was left behind, and that was lying there. Nothing happens to gold. It will be lying there, so Krishna directed Arjuna, go to that place and fetch all that gold and give it to your brother Yudhishthira for performing Ashramida Yajna. So that's how Arjuna got the name Dhananjaya. He is the one who fetched wealth for gold, especially gold for Yudhishthira to perform the Ashramida Yajna, so therefore he got the name Dhananjaya. Arjuna got the name.

So Yudhishthira was able to actually get so much gold for the sake of performing Ashramida Yajna, and that's that's the way Yudhishthira appeared very, very rich when he was visiting Bhishma accompanied by all the sages and also accompanied by his brothers who were who were riding on chariots driven by horses which were decorated with golden ornaments, so that's the description here. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Bhishma's focus on Krishna and explains why Krishna appeared to him in a four-handed Narayana form, emphasizing the personal relationship between the devotee and the Lord.

So something very interesting here is happening. Bhishma has stopped speaking. He was instructing the Pandavas. The Uttarayana Punikala has arrived, the auspicious time for him to quit the body, and he stopped speaking. Now after stopping speaking, he withdrew his mind from everything else and fixed his eyes, and thereby even his mind, upon the original personality of God at Sri Krishna. Sri Krishna was right in front of Bhishma. Remember, Krishna came along with the Pandavas to that spot where Bhishma was lying on the battlefield on the bed of arrows. So Krishna is in front of Bhishma. Bhishma fixed his attention, his eyes, his sight completely on Krishna. Now how did Krishna appear to Bhishma Deva? Krishna appeared in a four-handed form to Bhishma Deva. Why? Because Bhishma's relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead is as the four-handed Narayana dressed in yellow garments. That is the relationship of the Lord and Bhishma Deva.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna manifests in various forms according to the devotee's relationship with Him, highlighting that this relationship is spiritual and transcends material circumstances.

That is the relationship of the Lord and Bhishma Deva. So the Supreme Lord is one and his original form is the two-handed Shyama Sundara form, Krishna form. Even Krishna as Shyama Sundara is the form in which he relates with the Gopis, the young Gopis headed by Radharani. The same Krishna is present as a small child. The same Krishna is present as a five-year-old boy, covered boyfriends and the same Krishna is present before the Pandavas as the king of Dwarka, and the same Krishna is present before Bhishma Deva in this form as the four-handed Narayana. So the same supreme Lord is present in different forms according to the relationship of the devotees with the Lord. So Lord is one but his forms are according to the relationship the devotee has with the Lord and this relationship is a spiritual relationship. It is nothing to do with the material body that we have at present, the material situations we are in. It is nothing to do with this material world or material situation or circumstances.

**Key Quote:** "The most important form is the human form...The essence of material existence is misery."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the rarity and importance of human life, explaining that its primary purpose is to escape the inherent suffering of material existence.

It is totally different than this material situation. So it will be explained by Prabhupada this particular point: In the momentous hour of leaving this material body, Bhishma Deva set the glorious example concerning the important function of the human form of life. Of all the different species of life in this material world, the most important form is the human form. The Bhagavatam says Durlabham manusham janma. It is very, very, very rare that a living being in this material world gets the human form. It is very rare because there are millions and billions and trillions of living beings in so many different forms: insects and birds and animals and aquatics and plants, and trees and shrubs and reptiles, and all kinds of other life forms are there, and they outnumber the human form. Just like if I stand in a particular place, just say I occupy about 6 inches by 6 inches square flat land. Now if I dig just 1 inch down into that 6 inches by 6 inches square, there will be millions of microbes inside that. There will be so many worms. There could be so many insects. So we have no idea that the human form of life is very rare. It is very rare and it is very precious because in the human form of life, the most important function is to prepare ourselves to get out of this material existence, the essence of which is misery. The essence of material existence is misery. In any form, in any place, in the material world, there are always miseries.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore if one is absorbed in thoughts of the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna, He is sure to go back to Godhead without any doubt."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that true happiness and eternal life are attained by cultivating Krishna consciousness and remembering the Lord at the time of death.

And we don't want miseries. We are always desiring happiness. We always want to be joyful. We always want to be satisfied. We want eternal life. So that is possible by preparing ourselves in the human form of life to quit the body in the way Bhishma Deva is teaching us, by preparing ourselves to quit the body in proper consciousness. Then we go to the spiritual world for eternal life without any difficulty. We are directly transferred immediately if we are in the right conscious in the time of death. So it is explained by Prabhupada further: The subject matter which attracts the dying man becomes the beginning of his next life. This is the science described in the Bhagavat Gita. It is said, that ils invecousوا In this body there is a final moment of life in this body. That is called the moment of death. At that time, whatever is the subject matter that is attracting the person who is quitting the body, who is dying, that becomes the basis of the beginning of the next life. So Prabhupada says, therefore if one is absorbed in thoughts of the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna, he is sure to go back to Godhead without any doubt.

### Krishna consciousness, chanting, Bhagavad Gita

**Key Quote:** "Whoever at the time of death quits his body remembering me alone, that means remembering Krishna, at once attains my nature. Of this there is no doubt."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how to achieve perfection in life by constantly thinking of Krishna, even while performing daily duties, and emphasizes the importance of chanting Hare Krishna.

So how is perfection attained in this uniformed life? To be absorbed in thoughts of the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna always, so that even at the time of death we are absorbed in thought of Krishna, we go back to Krishna Loka, where we belong. Otherwise if we have some other thoughts, we have to take birth again in this material world. Again we will take birth, which means that continuation of suffering the miseries of material existence. So if you want to put an end to all material miseries and want eternal life, full of bliss and knowledge in this spiritual world in association with Krishna, then you should practice absorbing your mind in thoughts of Krishna. And how is this done? Srila Prabhupada explains in the introduction to the Bhagavad Gita: This is most easily practiced by practicing chanting of Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. So in the Bhagavad Gita, this is explained very elaborately in the 8th chapter verses 5 to 15. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita: Whoever at the time of death quits his body remembering me alone, that means remembering Krishna, at once attains my nature. Of this there is no doubt. Krishna's nature is completely transcendental, so one will get spiritual nature. And the general rule is, whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail. So Krishna tells Arjuna, therefore Arjuna should always think of me in the form of Krishna and at the same time carry out your prescribed duty of fighting with your activities dedicated to me and your mind and intelligence. And if your mind is fixed on me, you will attain me without doubt.

### Krishna consciousness, yoga, devotional service

**Key Quote:** "Bhakti Yoga is the easy process."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Bhakti Yoga with Ashtanga Yoga and Jnana Yoga, highlighting the ease and accessibility of Bhakti Yoga for attaining spiritual liberation.

Tasmat sarveshu kaaleshu. All the time if we are practiced thinking of Krishna by mind being absorbed in Krishna, even while doing our routine duties, Maa Manusmara Yudhya Cha, Krishna says two things: You remember me and you also do your duties. So that is to be practiced. That has to be practiced. So Prabhupada says you practice chanting Hare Krishna. So even while you are doing ordinary work, you practice chanting Hare Krishna. It is a matter of the consciousness, the background consciousness with which we do any activity. That is important. He who meditates on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his mind constantly engaged in remembering me, undeviated from the path, he, O Arjuna, is sure to reach me. So Krishna is describing. And in the scriptures, there are two different recommendations. One is the method of Ashtanga Yoga, other one is the method of Bhakti Yoga. So Ashtanga Yoga method is one who at the time of death fixes his life air between the eyebrows, and in full devotion engages himself in remembering the Supreme Lord, will certainly attain to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the Ashtanga Yoga method. And then there are the Jnanis who practice chanting Om. For them it is described: Persons learned in the Vedas, Jnanis, they should study the Vedas, who utter Omkara and who enter into Brahman and who are great sages in the renounced order, enter into Brahman. So this is three different: the Jnana process, the Yoga process, Ashtanga Yoga process, and the Bhakti process. The Bhakti process is simply to be engaged in devotional service and in that state of always being engaged in devotional service, one simply quits the body whenever, anytime, and simply goes back to Godhead. So that is the advantage for the Bhakti Yogis as opposed to the Ashtanga Yogis and the Jnana Yogis. The Jnana Yogis very, very difficult process. Ashtanga Yoga also very difficult process. Bhakti Yoga is the easy process. So therefore the Bhagavad Gita recommends practice Bhakti Yoga.

**Summary:** The lecture delves into the nature of the material body, describing it as full of inauspiciousness and made of undesirable substances, highlighting the ignorance in adoring it and forgetting its true nature.

at the end of this life in the human form of body. So here it is described, 'by pure meditation.' This is the practice of the ashtanga yoga, pure meditation upon whom? Upon the Supreme Lord in the heart. Now Krishna says, 'I am seated in everybody's heart.' So it is Krishna only who's seated in everyone's heart. Therefore, Bhishma Deva, by pure meditation, looking at Lord Shri Krishna, of course, for Bhishma, there is no need to focus his attention on the inside of the heart, no need, because Krishna was right in front of him. The same Krishna was seated on the heart, was right in front of Bhishma Deva. So Bhishma Deva simply had to fix his mind upon the form of Lord Krishna standing in front of him, and by doing so, Bhishma was at once freed from all material inauspiciousness. This material body is full of inauspiciousness in so many ways. What is this body made up of? Flesh and blood and bone and stool and mucus and urine and all kinds of obnoxious things. So this body, which we adore so much just because of some facility for sense enjoyment, we give a lot of value to the body, and we are forgetting that this body, after all, is something material and not made up of very nice substances. It is now simply packaged with a covering called the skin. It's in another place in the Bhagavatam described, it's a leather bag, a skin bag made up of three elements called vata, pitta, and kapha. Vata, pitta, and kapha, air, vata is air, and pitta is bile secretion, and kapha is mucus, obnoxious things, mucus and stool and urine and bone and flesh and blood, all horrible things, and we adore this body so much in ignorance. This ignorance, actually, you should understand from the scriptures that this body is not at all auspicious.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how Bhishma, by focusing on Krishna's transcendental form, was freed from material inauspiciousness and became situated in Krishna consciousness, emphasizing that identification with the material body is due to forgetfulness of our eternal relationship with the Lord.

you should understand from the scriptures that this body is not at all auspicious. It is full of inauspiciousness. So Bhishma Deva, by fixing his attention on Krishna, the transcendental form of Krishna in front of him, completely being absorbed in meditation on Krishna, he was freed at once from all material inauspiciousness. His conscience became completely spiritualized, Krishna consciousness. He became situated and complete Krishna consciousness and was relieved of all bodily pains caused by arrow wounds, all bodily pains completely gone because the consciousness is differently absorbed. Thus, all of the external activities of his senses at one stop. So Prabhupada explains, what is this external activities of the senses? So Prabhupada says in the purport, the material body is completely destroyed and the consciousness is completely destroyed. So this material energy is actually illusory energy, and this body is due to the illusory energy effect upon the soul, the spirit soul. So each one of us, we are not the body, we are spirit soul. We are completely spiritual by nature, but when there is the influence of the illusory energy, we become bewildered, we forget ourself, and we identify with the material body, which is the covering for our real self. Further, Sri Lakshmi says, identification with the material body is due to forgetfulness of our eternal relationship with the Lord. All of us, each one of us, we have an eternal relationship with Krishna because we belong to Krishna. We have a relationship with Krishna in the spiritual world. We have a relationship with Krishna in the spiritual world, but we forget that when we are situated in the material body, by the influence of the illusory energy, we forget Krishna, we forget our relationship with Krishna, and we identify with

**Summary:** The lecture continues by explaining that the identification with the body and mind is an illusion, which is removed by devotion to Krishna, comparing Krishna to the sun and material energy to darkness, which disappears upon Krishna's arrival.

this body as myself. If you ask me, 'Are you?' I describe myself in terms of my body and mind, body and mind, which is not the real self, which is not me, which is my covering. There is a subtle covering called the mind and a gross covering called the material body, the external gross body. For a pure devotee of the Lord like Bhishma Deva, this illusion was at once removed as soon as the Lord arrived. As soon as Krishna came in front of Bhishma Deva, by just fixing his attention on Krishna, who is the most attractive personality, most attractive beautiful form in the whole creation, that supremely attractive Krishna came in front of Bhishma Deva. Bhishma Deva at once fixed his attention on Krishna, and all his illusion was gone. You, of course, as a pure devotee, was never an illusion, but even if there was any material pain or material inauspiciousness, that is all completely, that is, that disappeared when Krishna arrived in front of Bhishma Deva. So how does it work? Prabhupada explains by giving example from the Chaitanya Charita Amrita, Lord Krishna is like the Sun, Krishna's Surya Sama, and the illusory external material energy is like darkness, Maya Hoy Andhakar. Maya, material energy, illusory energy is like darkness. Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is like the Sun. In the presence of the Sun, there is no possibility that darkness can stand, just like in the morning when the Sun rises, there is no darkness that remains which was there at the night when the Sun was not in the sky. Similarly, just on the arrival of Lord Krishna, all material contamination is completely removed, and Bhismadeva was thus able to be transcendentally situated by stopping the

**Summary:** The speaker explains that when we are not Krishna conscious, our consciousness is limited to the body and mind, leading to impure material activities through the senses, emphasizing the difference between material and spiritual senses.

activities of the impure senses in collaboration with matter. This requires little explanation now. When we are not Krishna conscious, then our consciousness is limited to our body and the mind. In such a state of consciousness, we are acting, we are performing activities with our senses, with the body, in collaboration with matter. That means the original senses, which are our spiritual senses, they are the ones we are utilizing for performing material activities through the covering called the body, the material senses like the hands, the legs, the eyes, the ears. We are seeing through the eyes, we are hearing through the ears, we are utilizing our hands for different activities or the legs for walking or for any any other purpose, material purposes. So all this is impure because it is material, it's impure. The soul is originally pure, and also the senses, original senses are pure senses, spiritual senses. By material contamination, the senses assume the role of imperfection and impurity. So when we are covered by the material body, we identify with the body, and we wrongly think that my this material hand is my real hand, or the material eyes, this whole arrangement called the material eye, I think that is my eyes. I am completely forgetful of my spiritual eye, which is different from this material life, my spiritual hand different from my material hand. All my spiritual senses are different from my material senses. The material senses are covering

Then our original senses, spiritual senses, are awakened, and we act with our spiritual senses. We act spiritually through with spiritual senses. We act, perform spiritual activities, the same activities, and through the material senses, we perform material activities, the same activities. So spiritual life means awakening our spiritual senses by contact with Krishna. This contact with Krishna is very easy through chanting and hearing the holy name of Krishna, chanting and hearing the holy name of Krishna, Hare Krishna. When I say Hare Krishna, Krishna appears in the form of transcendental sound on my tongue, and Krishna appears in the form of sound, so I hear that sound, and thereby I contact the transcendental personality Krishna in the form of this transcendental sound. So then immediately I am freed from this material misconception, material covering. I'm free in the level of the consciousness, then I can perform spiritual activities in spiritual consciousness. So this is the whole process of bhakti yoga. This has to be practiced, just like I say Hare Krishna, I am freed from the material misconception, but again after saying Hare Krishna, when I stop saying Hare Krishna, again I go back to my original consciousness, material consciousness. So by practice, we learn to come out of this material consciousness, and when we are completely out of the material consciousness by always being in Krishna consciousness, then no more this material covering will be effective, will be situated in our spiritual position, in spiritual consciousness. We'll discuss

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (1.9.33), explaining that it is Bhishma's prayer to Krishna as he is leaving his body, focusing on the beauty and attractiveness of Krishna's transcendental form.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Devim Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Raye.

TRIBHUVANA KAMANAM TAMALA VARNAM RAVIKARA GAURA VARAMBARAM DADHANE VAPURALAKA KULAVRTANAN AABJAM VIJAYA SAKHE RATI RASTUMENA VADHYA. The meaning of this verse is, Shri Krishna is the intimate friend of Arjuna. He has appeared on this earth in his transcendental body, which resembles the bluish color of the tamala tree. His body attracts everyone in the three planetary systems, upper, middle and lower. May his glittering yellow dress and his lotus face, covered with the paintings of sandalwood pulp, be the object of my attraction, and may I not desire fructive results.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna has got three kinds of energies... internal potency, his external potency and his marginal potency."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, elaborating on Krishna's three energies: internal (spiritual), external (material), and marginal (living beings), and their respective functions and influences.

So here is a description of the beautiful transcendental form of Shri Krishna, who is standing before Bhishma while Bhishma is quitting his body. Bhishma is very, very fortunate that Krishna has actually blessed him by his presence, actual presence. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, When Shri Krishna by his own internal pleasure appears on earth, he does so by the agency of his internal potency. What is the meaning of this statement? Krishna has got three kinds of energies. Krishna is the supreme person, he has got energies which are serving him, which are working for him. So everything he does through the agency of his energy. He personally has nothing to do because his energies carry out whatever he wants to do according to his will. Simply he has to decide or will to do something and it is carried out perfectly. These three categories of energies are his internal potency, his external potency and his marginal potency. Internal potency is a spiritual energy and it is meant for Krishna's own purposes exclusively. The external potency is the material energy meant for the conditioned souls. And the marginal potency consists of the living beings, innumerable, countless living beings, some of whom are in the material world, the conditioned souls. Majority of the living beings belonging to the marginal potency are in the spiritual world as pure devotees of Krishna. So, some very, very small number compared to the number of living beings who are pure devotees in the spiritual world, the number of living beings in this material world as conditioned souls are very small number.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna never comes in contact with the illusory energy or the material energy."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain how Krishna uses his internal potency when he appears in the material world and how the illusory energy affects conditioned souls but not Krishna or his pure devotees, and how Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva act as directors of the material energy under Krishna's will.

So, when it is said here by Srila Prabhupada that Krishna appears on this earth, by the agency of his internal potency, that is for his own purpose the internal potency is employed. Internal potency is completely spiritual as opposed to the external potency or the material energy which has an influence on all of us conditioned souls. It influences us by its illusory nature. The illusion that is created for enabling we conditioned souls to try to enjoy independent of Krishna, to try to think that I am independent, to try to think that I can be the lord of whoever I want to lord over. This is the necessity of the illusory energy acting on the conditioned souls. So, Krishna never comes in contact with the illusory energy or the material energy. Even when he comes to this material world, this material world is working by the action of the illusory energy or the material energy. But such illusory energy cannot act on Krishna, cannot or does not act on the pure devotees like Prabhupada, like Arjuna. The illusory energy does not act on them, the Pandavas. They are all pure devotees. And Krishna is the master, the controller of all energies including the material energy. But he directs the material energy through his directors, through his expansion as Vishnu and empowered living being as Brahma and through his incarnation as Lord Shiva. Brahma acts as the director of Rajoguna. Vishnu directs Satvaguna and Shiva directs the Tamoguna. Now, they three, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are acting as the directors exactly according to the will of Krishna. There are several verses in the scriptures to substantiate this explanation.

**Key Quote:** "When Krishna comes to this material world, it is said here, he comes by his internal potency... he appears in his transcendental form."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna appears in his transcendental form, untouched by material energy, and that his form is uniquely attractive, surpassing any beauty found in the material universe.

Now, when Krishna comes to this material world, it is said here, he comes by his internal potency. So, exactly according to his will, his internal potency also will act for his own purposes. And then, he appears in his transcendental form. Unlike us, even though we have a spiritual form, our spiritual form is covered by a material body or a material form. Krishna never is covered by any material body or material form. He comes in his transcendental form. That form looks like a human form, but it is his original form. Now, the attractive features of his transcendental body are desired in all the three worlds, namely the upper, middle and lower planetary systems. It's so beautiful, Krishna's form is so beautiful that everyone who can get an opportunity to see that beautiful form, they are attracted by all the attractive features. There are many, many attractive features of Krishna's beautiful form, transcendental form. Now, another important point Prabhupada says in this purport is that nowhere in the universe are there such beautiful bodily features as those of Lord Krishna.

### Arjuna as conqueror, Krishna as friend of Arjuna, Vijaya Sakhe, pleasing Krishna, transcendental humors (Rasas)

**Key Quote:** "Arjuna was always a conqueror because the Lord was his friend."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Arjuna's position as a conqueror due to his friendship with Krishna, and why Bhishma addresses Krishna as 'Vijaya Sakhe' (friend of Arjuna), highlighting Krishna's pleasure in being associated with his devotees and the different transcendental humors (Rasas) in their relationships.

Now, if there is some particular feature that is very attractive for everyone, nobody else in the entire universe possesses such beautiful features. It's not possible. Therefore, the conclusion is that Krishna's transcendental body has nothing to do with any material creation, with any materially created form. It is completely different. Arjuna is described here as the conqueror and Krishna is described here as his intimate friend. Now, Bhishma Deva is remembering the particular dress of Lord Krishna which Krishna put on as the driver of Arjuna's chariot. Krishna was acting as the Sarathi or the driver of Arjuna's chariot. He was having a particular dress. That dress Bhishma is remembering. Now, while fighting was going on between Arjuna and Bhishma, Bhishma's attraction was drawn by the glittering dress of Krishna. And indirectly, Bhishma is admiring his so-called enemy Arjuna for possessing Lord Krishna as his own friend. Hmm, Arjuna was always a conqueror because the Lord was his friend. And Bhishma Deva takes this opportunity to address Lord Krishna as Vijaya Sakhe meaning friend of Arjuna. Why is he addressing Krishna as friend of Arjuna? Because Krishna is always pleased when he is addressed conjointly with his devotees who are related with him in different transcendental humors. Humors means Rasa. There are five spiritual Rasas which the devotees relish in their relationship with Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Devotees are simply by remembering Krishna's beautiful form... able to completely situate themselves on the transcendental platform and they are never touched by the material energy."
**Summary:** The speaker lists the five spiritual Rasas and explains how devotees can elevate themselves to the transcendental platform by remembering Krishna's form, name, activities, and qualities, thus remaining untouched by material energy.

Hmm, Shanta Rasa, Dasi Rasa, Sakya Rasa, Vatsali Rasa, Madhuri Rasa. Depending on the type of relationship, they relish different Rasas. Arjuna is situated in Sakya Rasa. Therefore, Vijaya Sakhe, Vijaya Sakha Sakha is addressing form of address. So Vijaya is another name of Arjuna. So Arjuna's friend that is Krishna. While Krishna was the charioteer of Arjuna sun rays glittered on the dress of the Lord and the beautiful hue created by the reflection of such rays was never forgotten by Bhishma Deva. Devotees are simply by remembering Krishna's beautiful form, Krishna's beautiful smile, Krishna's beautiful address or Krishna's beautiful features or Krishna's name, Krishna's form, Krishna's activity, Krishna's quality, anything they are able to completely situate themselves on the transcendental platform and they are never touched by the material energy. So Bhishma Deva remembering Krishna's beautiful form as the chariot driver of Arjuna he is able to immediately situate himself on the platform of Krishna consciousness. Now, Bhishma is himself a great fighter and as a great fighter he was relishing the relation of Krishna in the chivalrous humor. It's called virya rasa. There are five primary rasas and seven secondary rasas. One of the seven secondary rasas devotees have with Krishna is called virya rasa, chivalrous humor. Bhishma is situated in a relationship with Krishna as his devotee in the virya rasa or chivalrous humor. So, transcendental relation with the lord in any one of the different rasas or humors is relished by the respective devotees in the highest ecstasy.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing that each devotee relishes their specific relationship (Rasa) with Krishna to the highest degree, using Bhishma's chivalrous humor (Virya Rasa) and Radharani's Madhuriya Rasa as examples.

This is very important to understand that a particular devotee's own relationship with Krishna is relished by the devotee to the highest degree. If Bhishma is situated in virya rasa relationship with Krishna, Bhishma relishes virya rasa to the highest degree. Radharani is situated in madhuriya rasa relationship with Krishna, she relishes that to the highest degree. Arjuna is situated in friendly relationship with Krishna, he relishes that friendly relationship to the highest degree. So, any of the rasas are relished to the highest degree by the respective devotees. I will stop here.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (1.9.34) describing Bhishma's remembrance of Krishna on the battlefield, focusing on Krishna's appearance and the arrows striking Him.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Devim Saraswateem Vyasam Tatham Jaya Mudhi Rayet. In this session we will be discussing from the 34th verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Shreemad Bhagavatam. Yudhi Turaga Rajo Vidhumra Vishvak Kachalulita Shramavarya Lankratasye Mama Nishita Sharair Vibhidhyamana Tvachi Vilasat Kavachestu Krishna Aatma. The meaning of this verse is: On the battlefield where Shri Krishna attended Arjuna out of friendship, the flowing hair of Lord Krishna turned ashen due to the dust raised by the hooves of the horses, and because of his labour, beads of sweat wetted his face. All these decorations intensified by the wounds dealt by my sharp arrows.

**Key Quote:** "So, that is the difficult part to understand for a common man. Therefore, we have to hear such descriptions from the lips of a pure devotee who will explain perfectly how to understand these dealings between the lord and his devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Bhishma's transcendental relationship (Virya Rasa) with Krishna, emphasizing that Krishna's transcendental body cannot be harmed and that understanding these concepts requires hearing from pure devotees.

Bhishma Deva, he is fixing his mind on Shri Krishna by remembering the different transcendental forms of the Lord on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. Bhishma, as has been explained earlier, is situated in a transcendental relationship called Virya Rasa with Lord Shri Krishna, so Krishna enjoys that fighting with Bhishma. And in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, Krishna is not fighting, Arjuna is fighting. So Bhishma is attacking Arjuna as the enemy, but Krishna is trying to protect Arjuna. So, Bhishma is releasing arrows to kill Arjuna, but Krishna is intercepting those arrows and those arrows are striking Krishna's transcendental body. Now, the transcendental body, as will be explained by Srila Prabhupada, cannot be wounded, cannot be destroyed, cannot be cut. It is completely spiritual. So, that is the difficult part to understand for a common man. Therefore, we have to hear such descriptions from the lips of a pure devotee who will explain perfectly how to understand these dealings between the lord and his devotees.

**Key Quote:** "The lord is the absolute form of eternity, bliss and knowledge."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's nature as eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, and discusses the five primary relationships (rasas) with Krishna: shanta, dasya, sakya, vatsalya, and madhurya.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains elaborately in this purport. The lord is the absolute form of eternity, bliss and knowledge. Eternity, his body, his form, his existence is eternal. Sat, chit, knowledge, full of knowledge, ananda, full of bliss. As such, transcendental loving service to the lord in one of the five principles, namely, shanta, dasya, sakya, vatsalya and madhurya—that is neutrality, servitorship, fraternity, filial affection and conjugal love—is graciously accepted by the lord when offered to the lord in genuine love and affection. Everyone has a specific relationship with Krishna, every living being. So, the perfection of our life is to reinstate ourselves in that relationship with Krishna, loving relationship with Krishna in one of the five primary relationships. So Sri Bhishma Deva is a great devotee of the lord in the relation of servitorship. There are secondary rasas and primary rasas. Primary rasas are based on the primary relationship, and while exchanging this rasa with the supreme lord, there are secondary rasas also in the course of exchange of the primary rasa. That is what gives rise to variety of the rasas exchanged in the activities of that relationship.

**Key Quote:** "Thus his throwing of sharp arrows at the transcendental body of the lord is as good as the worship of another devotee who throws soft roses upon him"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Bhishma's actions, though seemingly harmful, are a form of worship, and that Krishna's body is not pained due to its transcendental nature.

So Bhishma is situated primarily in the relationship of dasya as a servant, as a servitor. Thus his throwing of sharp arrows at the transcendental body of the lord is as good as the worship of another devotee who throws soft roses upon him. So how is Krishna receiving these arrows shot by Bhishma? Krishna is receiving it exactly like another devotee offers soft roses while worshipping the lord. For Krishna both are same, there is no difference. Why? Because Bhishma is a devotee. It appears that Bhishma Deva is repenting the actions he committed against the person of the lord. The way Bhishma is describing here in his prayers, it appears like he is repenting, 'Why did I shoot arrows at the supreme lord, or why did my arrows which are meant for striking Arjuna go and hit Krishna, my worshipable lord?' But factually the lord's body was not at all pained due to his actions.

**Key Quote:** "This material body is not our identity... we are eternally devotee of Krishna in the spiritual form"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the material body with the spiritual form, emphasizing that our true identity is as eternal devotees of Krishna, not as the temporary material body.

This is a transcendental existence. This we understand from the Bhagavad Gita. Spirit or spiritual form, transcendental form is of a different quality than material form. We know this material body is subject to being wounded. When somebody shoots an arrow at my body then my body can become wounded, but Krishna's form or body is not material, his body is not matter. Both he himself and his body are complete spiritual identity, spiritual. It is spiritual and Krishna has his identity as the supreme lord. This material body is not our identity. I appear like a human being because I have got a human like material body, but actually I am not this body, neither my identity is a human being. This is in this life my mind and body system works like a human beings mind and body. In another life if I have the body of a Devata then I will act and behave like a Devata. If some other living being has got the body of a dog then the living being in that dog's body will behave and act like a dog. But we are neither dog nor we are human nor we are Devata, we are eternally devotee of Krishna in the spiritual form. So that form, spiritual form, is not having an identity based on this material coverings. This is not our identity.

**Key Quote:** "Spirit is never pierced, burnt, dried, moistened etc... spirit is always uncontaminated and indestructible"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the spiritual form is indestructible, uncontaminated by matter, and eternal, referencing the Bhagavad Gita and Skanda Purana.

So Krishna's identity is he is the supreme lord and he is the supreme lord in a spiritual form. As Krishna, spirit is never pierced, burnt, dried, moistened etc. Spirit cannot be destroyed by anything, by any of the elements, by fire, by water, by air, by wind, by some weapon, material weapon made of one of the elements like metal or any of those elements, it cannot be destroyed. This is vividly explained in the Bhagavad Gita chapter verses 11 to 30, clearly it is explained. So also it is stated in the Skanda Purana, this confirmed in the Skanda Purana also, spiritual form cannot be destroyed by any weapon. It is said there that spirit is always uncontaminated and indestructible. Spirit is never contaminated by matter. Even in our case, even though there is a material covering for our original spiritual form, still that spiritual form or spirit cannot be contaminated by matter. This remains like a superficial covering only and it cannot be destroyed. Spiritual form cannot be destroyed, it is eternal form. It cannot be distressed nor it can be dried up, it cannot be distressed the spiritual form.

**Key Quote:** "Lord Vishnu in his incarnation appears before us, he seems to be like one of the conditioned souls... just to bewilder the asuras"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how Krishna appears to be like a conditioned soul to bewilder non-believers (asuras) who try to harm Him, emphasizing that the Lord is completely spiritual and cannot be killed.

There is no question of distress. When lord Vishnu in his incarnation appears before us he seems to be like one of the conditioned souls materially encaged. Encaged means material body has trapped us in this body or we have become imprisoned in this body, but that imprisonment is at the level of consciousness because the spirit soul is not a physical entity. So imprisonment here means I am conditioned now. Vishnu appears to be like one of the conditioned souls just to bewilder the asuras or the non-believers who are always alert to kill the lord even from the very beginning of his appearance. The asuras or the demons, they are always envious of Krishna and because they are envious of Krishna when Krishna appears they want to kill him. Kamsa wanted to kill Krishna and Ravana wanted to kill Rama, you have heard this from the scriptures, because foolishly they were unaware of the fact that the lord is never killed for the spirit is never annihilated. Lord is completely spiritual so how can he be killed by anybody by any weapon, not possible. Therefore Bhishma's piercing of the body of lord Krishna is a sort of bewildering problem for the non-devotee atheist.

**Key Quote:** "Bhishma Deva appreciated the all-merciful attitude of the lord because he did not leave Arjuna alone"
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by explaining how non-devotees are bewildered by Bhishma's actions, while devotees understand the pure devotion and kindness in the relationship between Bhishma and Krishna, ending with gratitude and Hare Krishna.

The non-devotees hear this they will ridicule you, consider Krishna as god, but how is Bhishma able to pierce his body by shooting sharp arrows? So non-devotees cannot understand, but those who are devotees or liberated souls are not bewildered by this description. They are not bewildered by this description. Nothing happens to Krishna as far as his transcendental form is concerned, it cannot be affected by any of the weapons. Bhishma Deva appreciated the all-merciful attitude of the lord because he did not leave Arjuna alone although he was disturbed by the sharpened arrows of Bhishma Deva, nor was he reluctant to come before Bhishma's deathbed even though he was ill-treated by Bhishma on the battlefield. See Krishna is so kind to his devotees, he understands the devotees mood of serving and therefore he did not mind the sharpened arrows of Bhishma when Bhishma was fighting on the battlefield, nor did he become reluctant to come in front of Bhishma when Bhishma was about to quit his body. So therefore Bhishma's relationship with the lord is one of pure devotion and that is to be understood in this exchange between Bhishma and the supreme lord. I will stop here, thank you very much.

In this session we will be discussing from the thirty-fifth verse of the ninth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, continuing the prayers by Bhishma Deva to Lord Krishna. The meaning of this verse is, "In obedience to the command of his friend, Lord Sri Krishna entered the arena of the battlefield of Kurukshetra between the soldiers of Arjuna and Duryodhana. And, while there, he shortened the life-spans of the opposite party by his merciful glance. This was done simply by his looking at the enemy. Let my mind be fixed upon that Krishna."

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is actually nobody's order carrier."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Krishna, despite being the Supreme Lord, acts as an order carrier for his devotee Arjuna, highlighting the sweet relationship between them, while clarifying that Krishna is not actually anyone's servant.

This is the glorification of Krishna by Lord, by Bhishma Deva, the great devotee of Krishna. So, it is clear, it is clearly explained here that Krishna simply by his merciful glance can shorten the duration of the life of the enemy to make Arjuna, his devotee, victorious. So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport to this verse, "In the Bhagavad Gita, 1.21-25, Arjuna ordered the infallible Lord Sri Krishna to place his chariot between the phalanxes of the soldiers. He asked Krishna to stay there until he had finished observing the enemies he had to face in the battle. When the Lord was so asked, he at once did so, just like an order carrier. Krishna is actually nobody's order carrier. Everyone is his servant and everyone carries out Krishna's order, whether willingly or unwillingly. Devotees carry out Krishna's orders willingly, and non-devotees are forced to carry out Krishna's orders unwillingly. Because non-devotees are in the material world in forgetfulness of Krishna, but they are forced by Krishna. They are forced by Krishna's material energy to act according to the conditioning. So, nobody is independent among the living entities. Nobody is independent. So, here it is described, the sweet relationship between Krishna and Arjuna, such that when Arjuna ordered Krishna, 'Take my chariot between the two armies,' Krishna did so, just like an order carrier."

**Key Quote:** "Out of his causeless mercy and affection for his pure devotees, sometimes Krishna carries out the order of the devotee like an awaiting servant."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's pleasure in fulfilling the desires of his devotees out of love, comparing it to a father indulging a child, emphasizing that this is not due to any authority of the devotee but pure, transcendental love.

Though he is not an order carrier. And the Lord pointed out all the important men on the opposite side saying, "Here is Bhishma, here is Drona, and so on." The Lord being the supreme living being is never the order supplier or carrier of anyone. Krishna is never the order supplier or order carrier of anyone. Wherever that person may be in the material estimation, there are some people who are very, very powerful, very great. Some people who are not so great. Some people are very insignificant. But Krishna has nothing to do with any of these material positions of different living beings. Out of his causeless mercy and affection for his pure devotees, sometimes Krishna carries out the order of the devotee like an awaiting servant. Krishna takes pleasure in doing this. That my devotee is very dear to me. So if my devotee wants something, I will gladly reciprocate with the devotee, exactly as the devotee wants me to reciprocate. By executing the order of a devotee, the Lord becomes pleased, as a father is pleased to carry out the order of his devotees. Similarly, the Lord is pleased to carry out the order of a small child. You have experienced that a small child may sometimes ask the father like a master commands his servant. "Give me that toy." So the father out of love for the child will actually carry out the order. Not because the child has got any authority or any power. No. Similarly, nobody has authority or power to give orders to Krishna. On the other hand, Krishna is always the order giver.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is very very pleased if you address him in relationship with his devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's willingness to carry out orders is rooted in pure transcendental love and highlights Bhishma Deva's understanding of this relationship, emphasizing the importance of addressing Krishna in connection with his devotees.

And everyone is his servant without exception. But Krishna takes pleasure in executing the order of a devotee because of the devotee, the sweet relationship between Krishna and the devotee. Now, this sort of carrying out orders by the Lord of his devotee is possible only out of pure transcendental love between the Lord and his devotees. And Bhishma Deva was aware of this fact. He therefore addresses the Lord as the friend of Arjuna. Partha Sakha. Vijaya Sakha. As Prabhupada has explained earlier, Krishna is very very pleased if you address him in relationship with his devotees. Keshodanandana. Radhakantam. Gopijanavallabha. Always Krishna in relationship with his devotees. Krishna is never without his devotees. And devotees are never without Krishna. So always both devotees and Krishna like to hear an address which is describing the relationship of the Lord and his devotees. Therefore, Bhishma is addressing Krishna as Partha Sakha. Vijaya Sakha.

**Key Quote:** "Simply by seeing Krishna at the time of death, one is able to get liberation immediately."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how Krishna can shorten or extend lifespan, and how those who died in Kurukshetra attained salvation by seeing Krishna at the time of death, emphasizing Krishna's mercy.

Further, Srila Prabhupada says, "The Lord diminished the duration of life of the opposite party by his merciful glance." Our lifespan, at the time of birth is fixed, of a certain duration is fixed based on our past karma. But that duration, even though it is fixed, it can be shortened or increased by Krishna. If somebody becomes very very sinful, their duration of life is shortened. If somebody is able to please a pure devotee, their duration of life may be extended. So, the duration of life though fixed is subject to being reduced or increased by Krishna or by a pure devotee. So in this case, it is described that the duration of life of the enemy of Arjuna was shortened by Krishna. It is said that all the fighters who assembled on the battlefield of Kurukshetra attained salvation by personally seeing the Lord at the time of death. Krishna was present on the battlefield of Kurukshetra to deliver all those who were eligible because simply by seeing Krishna at the time of death, one is able to get liberation immediately.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Factually, he was merciful to the opposite party because they would not have attained salvation by dying at home in the ordinary course of life."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that Krishna's actions on the battlefield, including shortening the lives of Arjuna's enemies, were not partial but ultimately beneficial, granting them liberation through death in Krishna's presence.

So that is the mercy of Krishna upon the living entities. Therefore, his diminishing the duration of life of Arjuna's enemy does not mean that he was partial to the cause of Arjuna. Somebody may think that Krishna is shortening the duration of life of the enemy. So he is giving benefit to Arjuna in fighting this battle which is not fair. But actually Krishna is not doing this simply for benefiting Arjuna alone. He is also benefiting the enemy. Whether the enemy is dying in the battlefield or the enemy will have to die later on somewhere else, death is certain for every living being who has taken birth in this world. So death cannot be avoided. But if the death is caused by a pure devotee of Krishna, then the person who dies actually attains liberation immediately because of the presence of Krishna, the glance of Krishna. So Krishna benefited the enemy also, not only Arjuna. Factually, he was merciful to the opposite party because they would not have attained salvation by dying at home in the ordinary course of life.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna is always good and impartial, and that both protection and being killed by Krishna are ultimately beneficial spiritually, leading to liberation.

This we have to remember. Somebody may not die on the battlefield, but they have to go back home and they have to die afterwards. Such death is not at all going to give them liberation, ordinary death. Here was a chance to see the Lord at the time of death, and thus attain salvation from material life. See, Krishna's mercy upon the enemies. So therefore, Krishna is always all good. He has no enmity. He has no feeling of partiality. He does not favour one person and deny another person. Never. Krishna never does that. Because every living being is his part and parcel. mamayivamso jivaloke jivabhuta-sanatana. Eternally we are parts and parcel. So how can Krishna be partial to anyone? It's not possible. Therefore, the Lord is all good. And whatever he does is for everyone's good. Krishna's actions are on the absolute platform. So Krishna's protection and Krishna's killing both are good for the person who receives the protection from Krishna or is killed by Krishna. For both of them,

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by urging listeners to avoid material calculations and seek Krishna consciousness, emphasizing that understanding the transcendental nature of Krishna's activities leads to liberation.

it is ultimately beneficial spiritually. Don't make material calculations. That is not going to help the person by some material calculations if they think they are escaping dying on the battlefield. They are forgetting that they have to die sometime later. And at that time, they may not have the benefit of Krishna consciousness. Because we have to take birth again in this material world and suffer the consequences. So to put an end to this miserable existence is possible by coming in contact with Krishna or his pure devotee. Apparently, it was victory for Arjuna. But factually, it was for the good of Arjuna's enemies. Whatever Krishna did was good for Arjuna's enemies also. That way, the Lord is all good. Such are the transcendental activities of the Lord. And whoever understands this also gets salvation after putting his material body. janma karma chame divyam evam yo veti tatvaram yo veti tatvatah. The activities of the Lord are all transcendental. And if we understand the transcendental nature of Krishna's activities, we also become liberated. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

The meaning of this verse is, when Arjuna was seemingly polluted by ignorance upon observing the soldiers and commanders before him on the battlefield, the Lord eradicated his ignorance by delivering transcendental knowledge. May his lotus feet always remain the object of my attraction. So this prayer by Bhishmadeva refers to Arjuna's bewilderment upon seeing the enemy at the beginning of the battle of Kurukshetra, when Krishna eradicated Arjuna's ignorance by speaking Bhagavad Gita. So directly it is a reference to Krishna instructing Arjuna in the subject matter of Bhagavad Gita.

### Kshatriya duty, Leadership, Vedic society, Modern society

**Key Quote:** "Unlike the modern-day defense ministers or presidents, head of state, who never go to a battlefield to fight or defend the country."
**Summary:** This segment contrasts the Vedic Kshatriya's role of leading from the front with modern leadership, highlighting the courage and chivalry expected of ancient rulers compared to contemporary leaders.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "The kings and the commanders were to stand in the front of the fighting soldiers." They are the system of actual fighting. The kings and commanders were not so-called presidents or ministers of defense as they are today. Prabhupada is comparing the Vedic times when the Kshatriyas with the proper spirit, they would execute their duties boldly, courageously, chivalrously, unlike the modern-day defense ministers or presidents, head of state, who never go to a battlefield to fight or defend the country. They simply sit in closed offices, secure offices and issue commands. They would not stay home while the poor soldiers or mercenaries were fighting face to face. This is not the case with the Kshatriyas like Arjuna. Bhishma, all of them fought in the front line. The soldiers were behind. The generals and the commanders were in the front. This may be the regulation of modern democracy. But when actual monarchy was prevailing, the monarchs were not cowards elected without consideration of qualifications. Nowadays, when we elect a monarch, we elect a monarch. We don't check the qualification of the person who is elected or the person who is able to face the enemy in a battle. We don't check that. Whereas in the former times, a Kshatriya was not a Kshatriya for namesake. He was actually bold, he was brave, he was ready to lay down his life for protecting the citizens in a battle, as it was evident from the battlefield of Kurukshetra, all the executive heads of both parties like Drona, Bhishma, Arjuna and Duryodhana were not sleeping. All of them were actual participants in the fighting, which was selected to be executed at a place of war away from the civil residential quarters.

**Key Quote:** "This means that the innocent citizens were immune from all effects of fighting between the rival royal parties."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the protection of citizens in Vedic society, emphasizing that battles were confined to the battlefield and citizens paid taxes to the ruler regardless of who was in power.

Civilians were not affected by the battle of Kurukshetra because the battle was fought between Kshatriyas only. This means that the innocent citizens were immune from all effects of fighting between the rival royal parties. Citizens were kept safe irrespective of who would rule and if they had to challenge one king had to challenge another king they would fight on the battlefield, not fight in the middle of some other place. No, they would not do that. The citizens had no power, no business in seeing what was going to happen during such fighting. It is not that they are watching some match, wrestling match. No. It's not like that. The citizens were protected whoever was the king. Prabhupada explains they were to pay, the citizens were to pay one fourth of their income to the ruler whether he be Arjuna or Duryodhana. Who was the ruler? The scriptures state…

**Key Quote:** "Arjuna saw them with great compassion and lamented that he was to kill his kinsmen on the battlefield for the sake of the empire."
**Summary:** This segment explores Arjuna's compassion and reluctance to fight, attributing it to his merciful nature as a devotee, while also suggesting that his intelligence was seemingly polluted by illusion.

All the commanders of the parties on the battlefield of Kurukshetra were standing face to face and Arjuna saw them with great compassion and lamented that he was to kill his kinsmen on the battlefield for the sake of the empire. This was Arjuna's beginning reaction when he saw the enemy party. He saw all his own friends and relatives and he felt compassion for them. Why should I kill them? For me to win this battle and rule over the kingdom of the whole world? No, I don't want. Arjuna felt like that. Arjuna was not at all afraid of the giant military phalanx presented by Duryodhana, but as a merciful devotee of the Lord, renunciation of worldly things was natural for him. There is a quality of a devotee. Prabhupada explains in the first chapter of the Bhagavad Gita in one of the purports. Arjuna's kind and soft-hearted nature is the reason why Arjuna was feeling compassion for his enemies. He was not afraid of his enemies. Never. And thus Arjuna decided not to fight for worldly possessions. But this was due to a poor fund of knowledge and therefore it is said here that his intelligence became polluted. kumatim aharad atmavigyaya kumatim, his intelligence became polluted. kumatim. His intelligence was polluted.

Actually as a devotee Arjuna's intelligence cannot be polluted, but it was apparently polluted because Krishna wanted to speak Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna. And through Arjuna Krishna wants to instruct the Bhagavad Gita to all other living beings in this world. It is Krishna's plan to deliver all the conditioned souls in so many different ways.

**Key Quote:** "Both you and I keep taking birth again and again. You can't remember your previous births, I can remember all my previous appearances."
**Summary:** This segment addresses Arjuna's question about Krishna's ability to impart ancient knowledge, highlighting Krishna's eternal nature and his plan to show mercy to conditioned souls by putting Arjuna in a state of illusion.

Now Arjuna is described as a constant companion of the Lord as is clear on the fourth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. In the fourth chapter Arjuna asks Krishna that you are telling me you spoke this science of yoga to some god millions of years back. Now how can I understand you spoke this millions of years back when I am seeing that you were born at about the same time I was born. So how could he have spoken this knowledge before millions of years to the sun god. So Krishna answers both you and I keep taking birth again and again. You can't remember your previous births I can remember all my previous appearances. So Krishna's position is that he never is any time forgetful of Krishna. Arjuna's position is like that pure devotee's position is like that. But still to show mercy upon the conditioned souls Krishna put Arjuna into a position of becoming illusioned and spoke the Bhagavad Gita to become, make him free from illusion.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is speaking the Bhagavad Gita for the good of all polluted conditioned souls who are engaged in material bondage by the conception of the false material body."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that the Bhagavad Gita was spoken for the benefit of all conditioned souls trapped in material bondage, primarily due to identifying with the body rather than the spirit soul.

Otherwise his devotee can never come under the influence of illusion. Apparently Arjuna's intelligence became polluted because otherwise there would have been no chance to deliver the teachings of the Gita for the good of all polluted conditioned souls. For our benefit Krishna spoke Bhagavad Gita. So it is for our sake that Krishna spoke the Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna. Now Prabhupada explains Krishna is speaking the Bhagavad Gita for the good of all polluted conditioned souls who are engaged in material bondage by the conception of the false material body. We are having this body we wrongly think I am this body each one of us and we are misled by the body to think in terms of material existence. We are simply bound up the more we engage in different activities in this world, material activities, the more we become entangled in this material world. So therefore the Bhagavad Gita is spoken by Krishna to help us understand primarily that we are spirit soul and Krishna suggests a method by which we can come out of this material existence itself by devotional service, by understanding Krishna, by knowing Krishna, by understanding Krishna, by understanding Krishna. So therefore it is explained the Bhagavad Gita was delivered to the conditioned souls of the world to deliver them from the wrong conception…

**Key Quote:** "We are spirit soul but we identify with this body and that is the greatest mistake."
**Summary:** This segment reiterates the fundamental problem of identifying with the body and stresses the importance of re-establishing our eternal relationship with Krishna through transcendental knowledge, which is available to everyone.

This is the fundamental problem all of us have. Each one of us we are spirit soul but we identify with this body and that is the greatest mistake. In ignorance we only think in terms of body that is all. Whereas Krishna speaks Bhagavad Gita to help us get out of this misconception and we should also re-establish our eternal relationship with the Supreme Lord Krishna and with the Supreme Lord Krishna. Nearly getting out of material existence is not enough. We have to also re-establish our lost relationship with Krishna. So therefore Atma Vidya or transcendental knowledge of himself was primarily spoken by the Lord for the benefit of all concerned in all parts of the universe. Krishna is speaking Atma Vidya or Brahma Vidya, transcendental knowledge, spiritual knowledge for the benefit of everyone throughout the universe. There is no restriction or limitation for anyone to take up the instructions of Krishna given in the Bhagavad Gita and make their life successful. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

## Daily Evening Bhagavatam Discourse | HH Stoka Krishna Swami | SB 1.9.37 | 06-05-2022

### Transcendental nature of Krishna's actions, Elevating consciousness through remembrance of Krishna

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "And every action of Krishna is completely transcendental."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains that Krishna's actions, even in the material world, are transcendental and elevate one's consciousness.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 37th verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, continuing the prayers by Bhishma Deva. स्वनिगमं अपहाय मत्पतिज्ञाम् रितं अधिकर्तुम् अवप्लुतो रतस्तः दृतरत्थ चरणोभ्या चलत्गुर् हरीरीवहंतुम् इभं गतोत्तरियह. The meaning of this verse is: Fulfilling my desire and sacrificing his own promise, He got down from the chariot, took up its wheel, and ran towards me hurriedly, just as a lion goes to kill an elephant. He even dropped his outer garment on the way. Bhishma Deva is recollecting the different events that happened in the past in relationship with Krishna, and every action of Krishna is completely transcendental. So remembering such events is automatically elevating the relationship with Krishna and elevating one's consciousness to the spiritual platform. So every single activity the Lord performs, He does so on the spiritual plane. None of the activities of Krishna are material, even though Krishna is in the material world. In the past times, He does not come in contact with the material energy at all. He is completely aloof from it.

### Battle of Kurukshetra, Kshatriya principles, Duryodhana's criticism of Bhishma

**Key Quote:** "The battle of Kurukshetra was fought on military principles, but at the same time in a sporting spirit like a friend's fight with another friend."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, focusing on the sporting spirit of the Kurukshetra war and Duryodhana's criticism of Bhishma's perceived reluctance to kill Arjuna.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The battle of Kurukshetra was fought on military principles, but at the same time in a sporting spirit, like a friend's fight with another friend." See, they are simultaneously fighting, following the military principles, at the same time in a friendly spirit they are fighting. That's the nature of a kshatriya. A kshatriya doesn't mind losing a battle provided he fights to his best capacity and gives up his life in the course of fighting, sacrifices his life. Such a kshatriya actually is able to elevate himself to the heavenly planets, minimum, by fighting in the proper kshatriya spirit in a Dharma Yudha. So here it is explained by Srila Prabhupada in the purport: Duryodhana criticized Bhishma Deva, allegedly, that he was reluctant to kill Arjuna because of paternal affection. Now see, Bhishma's position is very unique. He is related to both the Pandavas and Kauravas. Both the Pandavas and Kauravas are the grandsons of his brother, Bhishma's brother, so Bhishma is equally related to the Pandavas and Kauravas. He was not acting partially, but Duryodhana criticised like that, that Bhishma is not killing Arjuna because he has some affection for the Pandavas and especially Arjuna. So it is explained by Prabhupada here, "A kshatriya cannot tolerate insults on the principle of fighting because of this..." A kshatriya cannot tolerate insults under client's protection.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Bhishma's vow to kill the Pandavas, Duryodhana's safeguarding of the arrows, and Krishna's plan to have Arjuna retrieve them.

the principle of fighting. Bhishma Deva therefore promised that the next day he would kill all the five Pandavas with special weapons made for the purpose. Bhishma Deva, when he heard this criticism of Duryodhana, he became angry and he took a vow that he is going to kill all the five Pandavas the next day of the battle. Duryodhana was satisfied and he kept the arrows with him to be delivered the next day during the fight. Bhishma prepared five special arrows and Duryodhana thought that Bhishma has prepared these arrows, but if anything happens from now onwards till the next day morning when the battle starts, anything can happen. So Duryodhana said, "Please give me those five arrows and I'll keep them with me safely and I'll give to you tomorrow morning just before the battle begins." Bhishma said, "Okay." By tricks, Arjuna took the arrows from Duryodhana and Bhishma Deva could understand that that was the trick of Lord Krishna. So he took a vow that the next day Krishna would have to take up weapons himself, otherwise his friend Arjuna would die. What happened? Krishna knew that Bhishma has prepared five special weapons and it is safely kept with Duryodhana, so Krishna sent Arjuna, "Go and ask Duryodhana for those five arrows." So Arjuna went to Duryodhana's camp and Duryodhana welcomed him and said yes, and then Krishna and Bhishma Deva were the first... Duryodhana said Arjuna said, "I want the five arrows which Bhishma has prepared and kept it safe. You have kept it safely with you." Duryodhana said, "Okay, I will give you those arrows." He gave away those arrows. And Bhishma came to know that Duryodhana was supposed to safe keep those weapons. In spite of that, by Krishna's trick, the arrows were taken away by Arjuna. So he said, "Never mind. Even if those arrows are not there, I am going to fight very, very vigorously and Arjuna's life is really in danger the next day, unless Krishna will break his promise and take weapons and fight himself to save his friend."

### Krishna's promise, Bhishma's devotion, Krishna breaking his promise to save Arjuna

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna wanted to please his devotee Bhishma by keeping Bhishma's promise, which is more important than his own promise."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the intense battle where Arjuna is about to be killed, leading Krishna to break his promise and rush towards Bhishma, who welcomes being killed by the Lord.

So the next day's fighting, Bhishma Deva fought so violently that both Arjuna and Krishna were in trouble. It was such a fierce battle. Arjuna was almost defeated. The situation was so tense that he was about to be killed by Bhishma Deva the very next moment. At that very moment when Bhishma was about to kill Arjuna, Krishna wanted to please his devotee Bhishma by keeping Bhishma's promise, which is more important than his own promise. Bhishma's promise was that to save Arjuna, Krishna will have to take his weapon. Otherwise, if Bhishma was to take IS or not, Krishna did not have to take it. Krishna promised to not use his own weapon, but left Bhishma with enemies who are his obligations. When Bhishma left, Krishna saw Krishna was not in the right position in the old age and forced him to give up his 2020 success. He promised before the beginning of Kurukshetra's ancient battle, Chris's duty to Kurukshetra, that one day he would not use his wealth on the intimidated battles, and support anorm the Kurukshetra group. When Krishna was killed, Kurukshetra's aid was punched into hold by Arjuna without depending upon his strategy towards safety. But to protect Arjuna, Bhishma's promise was refused. He confessed to Arjuna's promise to Kurukshetra, for which, I never know why he betrayed him, and hurriedly rushed Bhishma Deva in an angry mood as a lion goes to kill an elephant. When there is a fight between a lion and an elephant, both are very powerful, but they are powerful in their own way. So generally lions don't bother elephants, elephants don't bother lions, because both are very powerful. But sometimes when there is a fight between a lion and an elephant, then both will fight very vigorously and the outcome of this fight is uncertain. Sometimes the elephant is victorious, sometimes the lion is victorious. So in this case, Krishna rushed at Bhishma just like a lion goes to kill an elephant. That's the description here. Now while Krishna was going in that angry mood, charging at Bhishma Deva, he dropped his covering cloth on the way and out of great anger he did not know that he had dropped it. Bhishma Deva at once gave up his weapons and stood to be killed by Krishna, his beloved Lord. For a devotee, if the Lord is going to kill me, that is the greatest blessing, because the devotees know, Lord's killing and Lord's protection both are absolute. There is no difference. So Bhishma did not mind Krishna killing him. He said that is the best way to ensure that I will be completely purified and I will get ultimate salvation and liberation.

**Key Quote:** "So there was no possibility of Arjuna's death because the Lord himself was on the chariot, but because Bhishma Deva wanted to see Krishna take up some weapon to save his friend Arjuna, so the Lord created the situation making Arjuna's death imminent."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the battle ended due to Kshatriya principles and that Krishna orchestrated the situation to fulfill Bhishma's desire to see him take up a weapon.

So the fighting of the day ended at that very moment and Arjuna was saved. Because the Kshatriya principle is, if somebody surrenders, then the battle has to be stopped. It cannot continue. One Kshatriya will not kill another Kshatriya if that other Kshatriya surrenders. He will not kill. That's the military principles by which the battle of Kurukshetra was arranged to be fought. So there was no possibility of Arjuna's death because the Lord himself was on the chariot. But because Bhishma Deva wanted to see Krishna take up some weapon to save his friend Arjuna, so the Lord created the situation making Arjuna's death imminent. Krishna created the situation. It should be for Bhishma Deva to show that his promise was fulfilled. Bhishma's promise was fulfilled and that Krishna had taken up the wheel as Bhishma had predicted. So this is a confidential explanation of the Lord's action on the battlefield.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing Krishna's love for his devotees, the sporting spirit of the battle, and the confidential nature of the explanation, distinguishing it from mere political or personal conflicts.

breaking his own promise and taking up the wheel of a chariot in order to save Arjuna while Arjuna's life was in danger when Bhishma was fighting very violently. So it is explained here by Bhishma that the Lord fulfilled my desire because I am his devotee. He broke his own promise. Bhishma will not care for anything else other than fulfilling his devotee's desire. That is Krishna's love for his devotees, his affection for his devotees. So that is being described here by Srila Prabhupada in great detail, the confidential explanation for this whole incident which ordinarily people will not understand. They will think something is going on between Arjuna, Krishna, Bhishma. Something is going on. No, it is not any kind of political diplomacy or not any kind of enmity. It is actually in a sporting spirit the whole battle was fought. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya, Narayanam Namaskritya, Naram Jai Vanarottamam, Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tatho Jayam Udhirayet.

Shita Vishikha Hato Vishirna Damsaha Shataja Paripluta Atatayinome Prasabham Abhisasara Madvadhartham Sabhavatume Bhagavan Gathir Mukundaha. The meaning of this verse is, May He, Lord Sri Krishna, the personification, the personality of Godhead who awards salvation, be my ultimate destination. On the battlefield He charged me as if angry because of the wounds dealt by my sharp arrows. His shield was scattered and His body was smeared with blood due to the wounds.

**Key Quote:** "The astounding feature of such dealings between the Lord and his devotees is that a devotee can please the Lord by playing the part of an enemy."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the relationship between Krishna and Bhishma, explaining that their apparent enmity on the battlefield was actually a display of special favor and devotion, highlighting the unique way a devotee can serve the Lord even by acting as an enemy.

So this whole description we should remember that that exchange between Bhishma and Krishna is an exchange between the Lord and His beloved devotee. Krishna's form is completely transcendental. There is no possibility of any injury for Krishna's transcendental body. But apparently it looked like Bhishma's arrows were striking Krishna's body and there were some wounds because of the arrow piercing the body. It is actually a leela of the Lord because Bhishma relates with Krishna in the virya rasa relationship. So therefore this show of apparently Bhishma enduring making wounds on the body of Krishna. So Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport, The dealings of Lord Krishna and Bhishma Deva on the battlefield of Kurukshetra are interesting because the activities of Lord Sri Krishna appeared to be partial to Arjuna and at enmity with Bhishma Deva. But factually all this was especially meant to show special favor to Bhishma Deva, a great devotee of the Lord. You see. For a common man, the battle is going on between Pandavas and Kauravas. They are enemies. Krishna is on the side of the Pandavas and Bhishma is on the side of the Kauravas. So Krishna, Bhishma are enemies for a common man's understanding. But the confidential understanding is Krishna is the Supreme Lord and his beloved devotees Arjuna and Bhishma both are there on the battlefield. So Krishna by his inconceivable potency he is able to show favor special favor to Bhishma and at the same time protecting Arjuna completely because Arjuna is his devotee also. So Srila Prabhupada says the astounding feature of such dealings between the Lord and his devotees is that a devotee can please the Lord by playing the part of an enemy.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna wants that bhakti."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna accepts service from devotees in any form, as long as it's offered with devotion, and uses the example of Mother Yashoda scolding Krishna to illustrate the loving and confidential exchanges between the Lord and his devotees.

See the wonderful description here, that a devotee is serving the Lord by becoming the Lord's enemy. The Lord being absolute can accept service from his pure devotee even in the garb of an enemy. Devotee whatever role he plays. Krishna can accept the service because it is with devotion. A devotee serves Krishna always with devotion. Krishna wants that bhakti, whether somebody serves Krishna as an enemy or as a friend in any capacity. The Supreme Lord cannot have any enemy, nor can a so-called enemy harm Krishna. Why? Because Krishna is Ajita or unconquerable. He is infinitely powerful and everyone else is, if at all they have any power, that is given by Krishna and it is very, very, very insignificant power that Jeevas have. So how can Krishna's life be in danger? Krishna is immortal. Krishna is unconquerable. Krishna is infinite power. So this should always be remembered. Don't make the mistake of making material calculations and thinking that Krishna's life was in danger. No. But still Krishna's pastimes are such that he takes pleasure when his pure devotee beats him like an enemy or rebukes him from a superior position, although no one can be superior to the Lord. In Krishna's dealings with his devotees when Krishna assumes the inferior position Krishna doesn't become inferior. He remains the Supreme Lord. Just like Mother Yashoda sometimes scolds Krishna. So Krishna as a small child begins to cry apparently being very much affected by Yashoda's scolding. But actually has Krishna's position changed? He appears to be an inferior, an inferior position as a small child, a helpless child, but actually he is the Supreme Lord and Yashoda is always the devotee who out of love wants to serve Krishna as a mother. It is a loving exchange between Krishna and his devotee. So this is not easily understood by everyone. Only a devotee can understand this confidential dealings of the Lord with his devotees

**Summary:** The speaker describes Srimad Bhagavatam as the exclusive literature on pure devotional service, focusing on the transcendental interactions between the Lord and his pure devotees, which are free from material contamination and difficult for non-devotees to understand.

on the platform of pure love. Mind you these exchanges are simply happening out of the Lord's love for his devotee and the devotee's love for the Lord. These are some of the transcendental reciprocatory dealings of the devotee with the Lord. Bhagavatam is the particular exclusive literature which is telling us about pure devotional service. That's why it's called Amala Purana. The entire subject matter of the Bhagavatam is only this pure devotional service and nothing else. There is nothing about karma, jnana, ashtanga yoga, no. It's only pure devotional service because throughout the Bhagavatam the description is of the Supreme Lord and his interactions with his pure devotees. He has innumerable devotees and particularly Bhagavatam describes the transcendental activities which are completely free from any material contamination. Those who have no information of pure devotional service cannot penetrate into the mystery of such dealings.

**Summary:** The speaker stresses the importance of learning Bhagavatam from pure devotees like Prabhupada to understand the nature of pure devotional service, emphasizing that Krishna's supremacy is eternally true, and non-devotees are often bewildered by his actions and forms.

So you have to hear this Bhagavatam from the pure devotees. Bhagavatam has to be learned from a Bhagavata. Those who know the mystery of such dealings only they can explain properly, like Prabhupada is explaining for us. The elaborate purports Prabhupada has written is to help us understand what is the nature of pure devotional service. Bhishma Deva played the part of a valiant warrior and he purposely pierced the body of the Lord so that to the common eyes it appeared that the Lord was wounded. I have already explained this point, but factually all this was to bewilder the non-devotees. Non-devotees always think that the devotees are sentimental people who think that Krishna is some supreme God. No, it is not the devotee's sentimental feeling because of which Krishna is considered as the supreme. No, Krishna's supremacy is eternally true under all circumstances. He remains the supreme Lord always in the material world, in the spiritual world, before the creation, during the maintenance, during destruction, after the destruction. He is always the supreme Lord. That's his unique position, eternally true. So what happens to Krishna's position? Nothing happens to his position, but as part of his pastimes he assumes different forms, he has different interactions, different types of reciprocation with his beloved pure devotees. Only with his pure devotees

**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Krishna lifting Govardhan Hill to illustrate how Krishna proves his supremacy to non-devotees, reiterating that Krishna's all-spiritual body cannot be wounded and highlighting Bhishma Deva's unwavering devotion and desire to see Krishna's transcendental beauty.

he has his exchanges and the non-devotees are always bewildered when Krishna appears in any incarnation. The non-devotees are bewildered. They can't make out who is this Krishna because they make material calculations and they think Krishna is an ordinary person. But some actions of Krishna prove even to the non-devotees that Krishna is not an ordinary person. Indra, he sent torrential rain, devastating rainfall. That's the correct explanation, description, devastating rain in Vrindavan and Krishna simply lifted the Govardhan hill and held it up like an umbrella to protect the inhabitants against devastating rainfall. So then Indra came to his senses. Who is this small boy? He is my lord. He is my master. He is a supreme personality of Godhead. I am foolishly thinking he is an ordinary boy. So, every time a non-devotee or even sometimes the devatas they mistake Krishna to be an ordinary person or a person of this world, Krishna proves to them by his actions that he is the ultimate controller, supremely powerful personality of Godhead. The all-spiritual body of the Supreme Lord cannot be wounded. This we should always remember. Never forget this and a devotee cannot become the enemy of the Lord. Bhishma Deva cannot become the enemy. Had it been so, Bhishma Deva would not have desired to have the very same Lord as the ultimate destination of his life. What is the prayer here? Sabhavatume Bhagavan Gathir Mukundaha. That very Lord who on the battlefield was on the opposite side, enemy's side, may that Lord, Bhagavan Mukundaha be my ultimate destination. Had Bhishma Deva been so, had Bhishma Deva been an enemy of the Lord, Lord Krishna could have annihilated him even without moving. Does Krishna require to take one wheel of a chariot, break his promise, get down from the chariot and attack Bhishma? Is it necessary for Krishna, the Supreme Lord to do that? No. So there was no need to come before Bhishma Deva with blood and wounds, but he did so because the warrior devotee wanted to see the transcendental beauty of the Lord decorated with wounds created by a pure devotee. Krishna is beautiful regardless of the form he assumes. Now this is the form he has assumed for the sake of his devotee and this form is also very, very beautiful

**Key Quote:** "At the moment of death, let my ultimate attraction be to Shri Krishna, the personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (1.9.39) focusing on Bhishma Deva's prayer to be attracted to Krishna at the time of death and how seeing Krishna on the battlefield granted liberation.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudhirayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 39th verse of the 9th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, continuing the prayers by Bhishma Deva. Vijaya Ratha Kutumba Aatta Totre Dhritahaya Rashminita Sriyekshaniye Bhagavati Rati Rastume Mumurshor Yamiha Nirikshahata Gataswaroopam. The meaning of this verse is, at the moment of death, let my ultimate attraction be to Shri Krishna, the personality of Godhead. I concentrate my mind upon the chariot driver of Arjuna, who stood with a whip in his right hand and a bridle rope in his left, who was very careful to give protection to Arjuna's chariot by all means. Those who saw him on the battlefield of Kurukshetra attained their original forms after death.

**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the concept of Swaroopa (original form), our eternal relationship with Krishna, and how attaining this relationship is the ultimate goal of life.

Just try to picturize, Krishna is having a whip in his right hand, he is having the reins of the horses in his left hand, he is driving the chariot of Arjuna, and whoever saw Krishna on the battlefield, they attained their original forms after death. So, this is the perfection of life to attain one's Swaroopa, the original form. Each one of us, we belong to the spiritual world. In the spiritual world, we have a specific eternal relationship with Krishna, and our goal of life should be to attain that eternal relationship.

**Key Quote:** "Even for a moment, a pure devotee does not forget the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the difference between a pure devotee and a conditioned soul, highlighting the constant Krishna consciousness of a devotee and comparing the process of Bhakti Yoga to Ashtanga Yoga in attaining Samadhi.

After quitting this body, by preparing through practice of Bhakti Yoga. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, "A pure devotee of the Lord constantly sees the presence of the Lord within himself, because of being transcendentally related by loving service." Such a pure devotee cannot forget the Lord for a moment. Even for a moment, a pure devotee does not forget the Lord. And the conditioned souls have almost completely forgotten the Supreme Lord, even though they also have a relationship, eternal relationship. So, a pure devotee always being Krishna conscious is called trance, Samadhi. The mystic yogi tries to concentrate upon the super soul by controlling the senses from all other engagements, and thus he ultimately attains Samadhi. The Ashtanga Yoga process is a difficult process, very, very difficult process. But with great austerity, Ashtanga Yogis try to control their senses, their mind, withdraw the mind from all sense objects, focus it upon the form of the Lord in the heart, and fix it on this super soul, and become absorbed in meditation on this form of the super soul in the heart. And in that way, gradually, they attain Samadhi. A devotee more easily attains Samadhi or trance, by constantly remembering the Lord's personal feature along with His holy name, fame, pastimes etc.

**Key Quote:** "The concentration of the mystic yogi is mechanical whereas that of the pure devotee is natural in pure love and spontaneous affection."
**Summary:** The lecture describes the transcendental nature of Krishna's pastimes and the loving exchange between the Lord and his devotees, contrasting the mechanical concentration of a mystic yogi with the spontaneous affection of a pure devotee.

What is Vishwadevar doing now? Krishna is present in front of him, he just fixed his attention on Krishna, and he is reminding himself of all the past events, which are all completely transcendental, because they are in relationship with Krishna, transcendental personality of God. Simply by remembering them, which are very, very dear to the heart of the devotee, with great relish the devotee recollects all the incidents connected with and the interactions with Krishna with great, because every interaction is a loving exchange between the Lord and his devotee, that's the nature of the interaction. Therefore, Srila Prabhupada says the concentration of the mystic yogi and that of the devotee are not on the same level. The concentration of the mystic yogi is mechanical, whereas that of the pure devotee is natural in pure love and spontaneous affection. The devotee doesn't have to exert himself, oh, I have to remember Krishna, no.

**Key Quote:** "Our heart actually is full of love for Krishna in the pure state of our consciousness."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how material contamination clouds our innate love for Krishna, and explains the eternal nature of Krishna's pastimes, using the analogy of the sun rising in different parts of the world.

No, it is natural because it's spontaneous affection. Our heart actually is full of love for Krishna in the pure state of our consciousness. Right now, because of the material contamination and all the material desires we have developed in association with the gunas, our heart has become clouded, contaminated. Otherwise, if we purify the heart by the proper method, then the pure consciousness naturally awakens our devotion, our love for Krishna, and that is what is described by Srila Prabhupada here. Bhishma Deva was a pure devotee, and as a military marshal, he constantly remembered the battlefield feature of the Lord as Parthasarathy, the chariot driver of Arjuna, because Bhishma was related that way. He remembers that particular feature of Krishna as the chariot driver of Arjuna, Parthasarathy. Therefore, the Lord's pastime in Parthasarathy is also eternal. It is not a temporary display because Krishna agreed to be Arjuna's chariot driver for the sake of this battle that is described here 5000 years back, which took place now. It is an eternal feature. As Partha Sarathi, the past times of the Lord are going on. How do we understand? After it is over in this universe, in another universe the same past time continues. Then after it is over in that universe, then another universe. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu explains this eternal past times in the material world

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is continuously performing his pastimes in one universe after another universe."
**Summary:** The lecture continues to elaborate on the eternal nature of Krishna's pastimes, explaining how they occur continuously across different universes, and mentions the eternal associates of the Lord.

as just like the sun is continuously rising in different parts of the world as the time is progressing. Let us say now it is evening 7.40. Okay. In Bangalore or India 7.40 p.m. But in some other part of the world it is 6.40 p.m. Another part of the world it is 8.40 p.m. So, the sun appears to be moving but actually it is all relative motion. And the sun is continuously rising or setting in different parts of the world as time progresses. So similarly, Krishna is continuously performing his pastimes in one universe after another universe after another universe after that, another universe, like that. The pastimes of the Lord beginning from his birth at the prison house of Kamsa up to the Leela at the end. This is described in the eleventh canto, the pastime of the Lord, ending his pastimes in this material world and going back to his spiritual above. All these pastimes all move one after another in all the universes, just as the clock hand moves from one point to another.

### Bhishma's Vision, Parthasarathi, Lord's Forms, Devotee Relationship

**Key Quote:** "Bhishma Deva never forgot the beautiful feature of the Lord as Partha Sarathi, which even Arjuna could not see."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights Bhishma Deva's unique vision of Krishna as Parthasarathi and emphasizes that the Lord displays different forms according to the relationship he has with each devotee.

And in such pastimes his associates like the Pandavas and Bhishma are constant eternal companions. Not all the persons on the battlefield of Kurukshetra are eternal companions, only some select a few devotees are eternal companions, just like the Pandavas and Bhishma as mentioned here. So Bhishma Deva never forgot the beautiful feature of the Lord as Partha Sarathi, which even Arjuna could not see. Arjuna was being the Lord. So Arjuna could not see that form as Partha Sarathi, which Bhishma saw. Arjuna was behind the beautiful Partha Sarathi while Bhishma Deva was just in front of the Lord. As far as the military feature of the Lord is concerned, Bhishma Deva observed this with more relish than Arjuna. So this is an important point to note. For the sake of Bhishma, Krishna is displaying the particular form which Bhishma relates with. The Lord has so many forms, unlimited number of forms, because he has unlimited devotees, and each devotee relates with the Lord in a particular form, and that form the Lord displays for that particular devotee.

**Key Quote:** "Everyone attained their original spiritual form after death, because Krishna was present on the battlefield when they were dying."
**Summary:** The lecture explains that those who died on the battlefield of Kurukshetra attained their original spiritual form due to Krishna's presence, and emphasizes the importance of one's consciousness at the time of death.

Now Srila Prabhupada explains the point that, everyone attained their original spiritual form after death, because Krishna was present on the battlefield when they were dying. So Srila Prabhupada says, all the soldiers and persons on the battlefield of Kurukshetra attained their original spiritual form, like the Lord, after their death. Because by the causeless mercy of the Lord, they were able to see him face to face on that occasion, at the time of death. yamyam vapi smaranbhavam tyajati ante kalevaram. At the time of quitting the body, at the time of death, last moment of life in this body, whatever the state of consciousness, that same state one will attain without fail in the life after death. The soul is eternal. But what life will the soul attain after quitting this body? That depends on the consciousness in time of death. So, whoever saw the Lord at the time of his death face to face, because the Lord is completely transcendental, spiritual, they all attained their original eternal spiritual form.

**Key Quote:** "Till one breaks this cycle of repetition of birth and death by engaging in devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the cycle of birth and death, the foreign nature of material forms, and how devotional service is the key to liberation and attaining one's original spiritual form.

The conditioned souls rotating in the evolutionary cycle from the aquatics up to the form of Brahma, are all in the form of Prasannis, the form of Maya, all our forms of material body in any species, aquatics up to Brahma, are the form obtained by one's own actions and awarded by material nature. Simply we are rotating in different forms, that's all. In this life, if I don't take to Krishna consciousness, then I'll perform some pious activities or some sinful activities or a combination, and then according to the desires I accumulate, I will get another body, and in that body again there will be some activities, material activities that will lead to another body. So this goes on and on and on till one breaks this cycle of repetition of birth and death by engaging in devotional service and preparing oneself to quit the body in Krishna consciousness. So Srila Prabhupada explains the material forms of the conditioned souls are all foreign dresses. This material body is a covering which is not natural for us, it is an artificial imposition, and when the conditioned soul becomes liberated from the clutches of material energy, he attains his original form, original spiritual form. The impersonalist wants to attain the impersonal brahman effulgence of the Lord, but that is not at all congenial to the living sparks, part and parcels of the Lord. The Mayavadis is the impersonal, they want to merge into the brahman effulgence. The devotees, they want to be situated in their original spiritual form in the relationship with Lord Krishna

**Key Quote:** "The devotees when they take to Krishna consciousness and perfect their devotional service they never come back to the material world after going to the spiritual."
**Summary:** The lecture contrasts the paths of impersonalists and devotees, highlighting the instability of merging into the Brahman effulgence versus the eternal shelter found at Krishna's lotus feet in the spiritual world, emphasizing the devotees never return to the material world.

in a loving devotional relationship always engaged in devotional service, that's the position of the devotee. So the impersonalists, even if, first of all it is very great difficult, with great difficulty they may merge into the brahman effulgence, but they fall down because they don't have shelter of Krishna's lotus feet in the spiritual world. The devotees, when they take to Krishna consciousness and perfect their devotional service, they never come back to the material world after going to the spiritual. The impersonalists, even if they elevate themselves to the brahma jyoti, they fall down because there is no shelter.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Krishna's relationships with the Pandavas, highlighting his role as a younger cousin and intimate friend, while emphasizing that they all recognized him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

before him. We have to note that Krishna is referred to as Chakri. Chakri means one who carries the chakra, that is Krishna, another name for Krishna, shankhi Chakri, like that there are names for Krishna. So here Krishna is referred to as Chakri and Sreelah Prabhupada explains, Lord Krishna was also a younger cousin of Maharaja Yudhishthira as well as the intimate friend, Lord Krishna and a better beloved Rama Yudhishthir as well as the intimate friend Devasini as well of arjuna. Krishna was related to the pandavas as a younger cousin because by age krishna was younger than yudhishtira maharaj and yudhishtira maharaj's mother kunti and krishna's father vasudeva were sister and brother, kunti and vasudeva. So therefore krishna was the younger cousin of yudhishtira maharaj. Krishna was also related to arjuna in the same way as a cousin but more importantly krishna and arjuna were intimate friends, intimate friends. So in addition to being a cousin arjuna was also intimate friend of krishna but all the family members of the pandavas knew lord krishna as the supreme personality of godhead, all the five brothers dhishtira bhima nakula sahadeva arjuna everyone knew krishna supreme personality of godhead and even draupadi kunti everyone knew krishna is the supreme personality of godhead the lord although conscious of supreme position always behaved in a humanly custom and so he also bowed down before the dying bhishma deva as if he, that means krishna, were one of the younger brothers of king yudhishtira.

**Key Quote:** "the lord although conscious of supreme position always behaved in a humanly custom and so he also bowed down before the dying bhishma deva as if he that means krishna were one of the younger brothers of king yudhishtira"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses why Krishna, despite being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, bowed down before Bhishma, explaining that Krishna behaves in a humanly way to set an example.

Now this is very significant that when the pandavas have come to see bhishma, bhishma is elderly uh person compared to the pandavas, so pandavas grandfather pandu's father father's brother. So in that way the pandavas are perfectly right or correct in bowing down to bhishma deva, grandsons they are offering their respects to the elderly grandfather well-wisher and affectionate grandfather. But why is krishna bowing down before bhishma when krishna is the supreme personality of godhead? Now we have to carefully understand srila prabhupada explains even though krishna is always conscious he is the supreme personality of godhead is eternally so but still he behaves in a humanly way when he comes to this material world for the sake of his pastimes. So krishna behaves in a particular way in a particular situation which we have to understand from the scriptures as explained by the acharyas.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna when he was in Dwaraka whenever he would come back from his assembly house Sudharma after finishing his duties as the king of Dwaraka then he would actually enter his palaces by expanding himself into sixteen thousand one hundred and eight forms"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's actions are meant to teach ideal behavior, giving the example of how Krishna interacted with his queens in Dwaraka, teaching how an ideal husband should behave.

So krishna's personality is not like the personality of a any other human being. Krishna's personality is a lot different than that of any other personality. So the difference can be understood only if we hear our own personality. And let we not get distracted by what is the difference between Ahmad and the lord, we first understand about krishna from the vaishva acharyas as they explain based on the authentic shastras, vaishnava scriptures. So i can give an example, the bhagavatam says of two kinds one action one set of actions Krishna performs in his incarnation as Krishna are those which he wants to teach the common people ideal behavior of a human being. So Krishna when he was in Dwaraka whenever he would come back from his assembly house Sudharma after finishing his duties as the king of Dwaraka then he would actually enter his palaces by expanding himself into sixteen thousand one hundred and eight forms because he had married 16,000 108 Queens princesses and they became Queens because Krishna was the king and he would interact with his Queens exactly like a ideal husband should interact with his wife. Now Krishna knows his position Krishna is also aware that all the queens are are his devotees. The devotees, the queens know Krishna is the Supreme Lord but in his interaction he taught by his own example how a ideal husband should actually take care of his wife.

**Summary:** The speaker continues to illustrate Krishna's role as an Acharya, teaching by example, such as respecting his mothers and giving charity, even though he has no obligation to anyone.

Now Krishna in the morning when he wakes up, he wakes up very early even though he is lying comfortably with his wife, the queen but he wakes up and he performs his duties as a householder. Now these duties are described in the Srimad Bhagavatam 10th cantum, these duties are performed by Krishna to teach how an ideal householder to perform householder's duties. He would go and pay respect to his mothers. Of course, his mother is Devaki. But Vasudeva, his father had 16 queens. So, the other queens of Vasudeva were stepmothers of Krishna. Nonetheless, Krishna would respect all the stepmothers on an equal level with Devaki, his own mother. So, this is ideal behavior of Krishna. They all know Krishna is the Supreme Personality of God. But they also know Krishna is behaving in this way to teach by his own example how an ideal householder should carry out the duties of a householder. Grahasta Ashrama Krishna is teaching by his own example. He would give cows in charity to the brahmanas. Now, the brahmanas know Krishna is the Supreme Personality of God. Krishna has no obligation to anybody. He is in fact the maintainer of everyone. So, what obligation can he have for any brahmana or for any other living being? He is the maintainer of all the living beings. Eko bahunam yo vidhati kama. Krishna is teaching by his own example, but he must teach by his own example. Acharya.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Krishna's actions meant for teaching with those that reveal his supreme power, using the example of Krishna killing demons in Vrindavan and the cowherd boys' reaction, influenced by Yogamaya.

Acharya means one who teaches by his own behavior, by his own actions. So, Krishna's one set of activities are meant for teaching the common man about the proper behavior. Now, Krishna performs another set of actions. Hope this is helpful. Did you take a hint from this? I really liked it. Because this is what I wanted to show you. You may have some doubts about this. But all you need to know is, even when you are unique to his position as the supreme personality you've got it which is the position as a supreme lord is eternally true even though he appears like a human being he is the supreme lord his powers are always with him they are never lost they are never ineffective so for example when he's playing with the covered boys in vrindavan he is like another covered boy but when a demon comes to attack krishna krishna effortlessly playfully he simply kills the demon and the covered boys they are very happy that this some demon came to disturb us and krishna just killed the demon very easily so they are all very happy they embrace krishna well done well done excellent excellent and they continue their play they never pause to think krishna is another covered boy like us how could he have killed that demon we cannot kill how can krishna kill they never think

that is the action of yogamaya by yogamaya's influence everyone participating in krishnalila all the devotees that is all the devotees other than krishna everyone else is devoted krishna so the devotees except balaram of course balaram is not um in the position of a devotee he acts like a devotee but he is not like the other devotees belonging to a different tatva he is actually an expansion of krishna but still for the sake of krishna's pastimes he also behaves like one of the other covered boys he also behaves as a devotee of krishna as another covered boy so um all the covered boys being influenced by yogamaya they forget krishna is the supreme personality of god though they know that the fact is known but for the sake of krishna's pastime they forget that they don't consider that they think krishna is one among them and if you have a friend who is your equal and the friend does something very nice then you appreciate the friend embrace her and that is the reason why all the devotees who worship him are very happy you congratulate him like that the coward boys exactly behave that way with krishna and krishna kills a demon but we understand that demon was no ordinary demon he was sent by kamsa he had so many mystic powers he was a terror for everyone else but krishna effortlessly killed him because krishna is supremely powerful

we understand such activities of Krishna as those of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When Brahma stole the calves and the cowherd boys, Krishna actually expanded himself as a calves and cowherd boys. Now Brahma came back after hiding those calves and cowherd boys who were stolen by Brahma using Brahma's mystic power. He was hiding them somewhere and when Brahma came back after one moment of his time, already one year had passed on the earth and Krishna had expanded himself so nobody knew that the cowherd boys and the calves, original cowherd boys and calves were kidnapped by Brahma and they were hidden by Brahma in some place away from the earth planet and they were all sleeping under the mystic power of Brahma. A spell cast by Brahma by Brahma's mystic power but nobody knows in Vrindavan. How is that? Krishna has expanded exactly resembling each of the cowherd boys and each of the calves and Brahma came and saw there is a second set of the same cowherd boys and calves playing with Krishna. So Brahma was bewildered. He knows he has hidden there, cows and cowherd boys, he has stolen in his particular place and he knows by his mystic power they are all sleeping under the spell of his mystic power. But Brahma also seeing a second set and who are these second set of cowherd boys and calves. Brahma is wondering. So like this, Krishna's second set of activities are those to help and meant for helping us understand Krishna is the Supreme Personality of God so we have to understand when Krishna bows down to Bhishma Deva it is teaching us how a younger one should show respect

### bhakti, Gopis' devotion, pure devotion, conjugal love

**Key Quote:** "They simply want to please Krishna. That's all."
**Summary:** This segment explains Bhishma Deva's prayer to Krishna, focusing on the Gopis' unparalleled pure devotion characterized by selfless love and a desire only to please Krishna, contrasting it with other forms of worship motivated by personal gain or knowledge.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Jai Vanarottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudhirayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 40th verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Lalitha Gati Vilasa Valguhasa Pranaya Niriksana Kalpitoru Manaha Krita Manu Krita Vatya Unma Dandhaha Prakritim Agan Kilayasya Gopa Vadhvaha. The meaning of this verse is, let my mind be fixed upon Lord Sri Krishna, whose motions and smiles of love attracted the damsels of Raja Dharma, the Gopis. The damsels imitated the characteristic movements of the Lord after his disappearance from the Rasa dance. This is yet another precept. This is the same prayer offered by Bhishma Deva to Lord Krishna. Bhishma is fixing his mind upon Lord Sri Krishna and remembering the different pastimes of Krishna. Smaranam, remembering the pastimes of Krishna, remembering the form of Krishna, remembering the name of Krishna, remembering the qualities of Krishna. This is bhakti. This is the practice of bhakti. Here, specifically, Bhishma Deva is remembering Krishna's pastimes with his topmost devotees, the Gopis of Vrindavan. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains what is the characteristic of the Gopis' devotion to Krishna. It is explained by Srila Prabhupada in the purport, By intense ecstasy in loving service, the damsels of Vraja Bhumi, that is the Gopis, attained qualitative oneness with the Lord by dancing with him on an equal level, by embracing him in nuptial love, by smiling at him, by looking at him in joke, and by looking at him with a loving attitude. The Gopis are in a relationship with Krishna in conjugal love. Conjugal love means love between opposite genders. Actually, Krishna is the only male, and everyone else is female. Krishna is the only Purusha, everyone else is Prakriti. So, this love between Krishna and the devotees is natural, is our constitutional position. So, among the devotees of Krishna, the topmost devotees are the Gopis. Now, Srila Prabhupada says, the relation of the Lord with Arjuna is undoubtedly praiseworthy for devotees like Bhishma Deva, because Arjuna's friendship with the Lord was very, very intimate friendship. It was transcendental relationship, not material friendship. But, the relation of the Gopis with the Lord is still more praiseworthy because of their still more purified loving service. Now, how is Gopis' devotional service more purified? To understand that, Srila Prabhupada explains, that according to Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, ramyakachit upasana vrajavadhu vargena yakalpita. The meaning of this is, this is what Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says about the Gopis' devotional service rendered to Lord Krishna. There is no better method of worship than the system invented by the Gopis. Worship of Krishna. The best method of worship is that which was performed by the Gopis of Vrindavan. So, the Gopis' invention of worshipping Krishna was to remain always Krishna conscious without any material profit. That is the super excellence of the Gopis. Super excellent devotional service. They never expected any return from Krishna. That was not their business. Their attitude was not like, Krishna, we have done so much for you. Can you give us some benediction, Krishna? No. They never expected any benediction from Krishna. Though Krishna is the Supreme Lord, who is the only giver of all kinds of benedictions, but the Gopis, they never expected any benediction from Krishna. Gopis' attitude was that you take whatever you like from us, but we do not ask anything in exchange, in return. Nothing. We want nothing. They simply want to please Krishna. That's all. They only want to see Krishna happy. That's all. We have got everything to give you, and we have no need to ask you anything at all.

### types of devotees, pure vs. mixed devotion, Gopis' supreme devotion

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Whereas, the pure devotees do not want anything in return for their worship or in return for their service to Krishna."
**Summary:** This segment differentiates between devotees who approach Krishna with ulterior motives (Artha, Artharthi, Jignasu, Jnani) and pure devotees like the Gopis, who seek nothing in return for their selfless service, highlighting the Gopis' supreme position in devotional service.

This is the Gopis' worship. Generally, people worship the Supreme Lord either because they are Artha, Artha means they are in distress, or they are in need, or they are Artharthi, or they are desiring some wealth, some money. So, they want some relief from some suffering, or they want some money. Two classes of people, Artha and Artharthi. And another two classes of people who also worship God, Jignasu and Jnani. Jignasu means they are inquisitive to know who is this God, or who is God. Curiosity. And Jnani are the ones who are after pure knowledge of God. In any case, all these four categories of persons who approach Krishna, they are classified as devotees, but they want something in exchange for their worship, for their devotion. They want something. Whereas, the pure devotees do not want anything in return for their worship or in return for their service to Krishna. Because they are approaching Krishna, even such devotees who want something in exchange are classified as devotees. And they do get some spiritual benefit because of approaching Krishna. But they are not pure devotees. Whenever the service is rendered, devotional service is rendered with some motive, expectation of something in return, then the service is not considered pure devotional service. It is mixed devotional service. So, the gopis' activities in devotional service are on the supreme platform of pure devotion. This is the position of gopis. Therefore, Prabhupāda says, the loving service of the gopis is the topmost, is most praiseworthy. And, the gopis, by their service, they practically became one with the Lord of attaining equal footing with the Lord.

### Gopis' mercy, equality with the Lord, unconditional love, selfish vs. selfless interest

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Lord, Supreme Lord Krishna, is always more satisfied when his pure devotees are glorified."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Bhishma's aspiration for the Gopis' mercy, their equality with the Lord through perfect ecstasy, and the nature of unconditional love between Krishna and the Gopis, contrasting it with the selfish desire of Mayavadis to merge into God's existence.

Now, Bhīṣma's aspiration to remember the gopis at the last stage of his life is to have their mercy also. Devotees generally want mercy of Krishna and his pure devotees. Bhīṣma is teaching us. The Lord, Supreme Lord Krishna, is always more satisfied when his pure devotees are glorified. And, therefore, Bhīṣma Deva not only glorified the activities of Arjuna, but he also glorified the activities of the gopis, the topmost devotees of Krishna. Now, the gopis, their equality, which is being described here, is one of perfect ecstasy, in which the differential conception is completely eradicated. Why? Because, in the gopis' service to Kṛṣṇa, the centrist interest of the lover and beloved all respects that is Krishna has nothing to expect from his devotees and the devotees have nothing to expect from Krishna so in this way both are unconditionally loving each other and that is the way their interest becomes one now the Maya bodies they also want to merge into the existence of God they also want to become one but that oneness is an attempt to extinguish their own individuality in a sense they want to become God so it is actually a selfish interest the Maya bodies interest is a selfish interest because they want to become God in a sense whereas the devotees they want to retain their individuality which is always eternally existing and they want to serve God by determining whether or not they should do that so they want to look at their individuality in a idea of that which is a personal project dreams and their lives and their health their their demands or their desires Krishna maintains his devotees Krishna maintains everyone it's not just his devotees he maintains he maintains everyone but particularly his devotees who are completely dependent on him he never lets down his devotees he never lets down anybody but he never lets down his devotees certainly even if the devotees don't have any demands so such devotees are being glorified by Bhishma Deva I'll stop here thank you very much.

### Rajasuya Yajna, Yudhishthira, Krishna's glorification

**Key Quote:** "Yudhishthira wanted to glorify Krishna, therefore he performed this Rajasuya Yajna."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of Bhishma Deva's prayer, focusing on Yudhishthira's Rajasuya Yajna and his intention to glorify Krishna.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 41st verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Munigana Nripavarya Sankhulentaha Sadasi Yudhishthira Rajasuya Esham Arhanam Upapedha Ikshaniyo Mamadrishi Gochara Esha Aaviratma. The meaning of this verse is: At the Rajasuya Yajna performed by Maharaj Yudhishthira, there was the greatest assembly of all the elite men of the world, the royal and learned orders. And in that great assembly, Lord Sri Krishna was worshipped by one and all as the most exalted personality of Godhead. This happened during my presence, and I remembered the incident in order to keep my mind upon the Lord. This is yet another prayer by Bhishma Deva to Lord Krishna. Bhishma is remembering Krishna's different pastimes. So one of the pastimes was the performance of Rajasuya Yajna by Yudhishthira. Generally, the Rajasuya Yajna is performed by a king who is on the level of being the emperor of the world, and he wants to establish his supremacy by performing this Rajasuya Yajna. But Yudhishthira's aim was different because Yudhishthira is a pure devotee of Krishna. Yudhishthira wanted to glorify Krishna.

### Rajasuya Yajna, Emperor, Challenge Horse

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Yudhishthira also dispatched such challenging horses all over the world, and every ruling prince and king all over the world accepted Maharaj Yudhishthira's leadership as the emperor of the world."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the historical context of the Rajasuya Yajna, including the tradition of the challenge horse and Yudhishthira's acceptance as emperor.

Therefore, he performed this Rajasuya Yajna. So it is explained by Sri Lakshmi that after gaining victory in the battle of Kurukshetra, Maharaj Yudhishthira, the emperor of the world, performed a Rajasuya sacrificial ceremony. The emperor in those days, upon his ascendance to the throne, would send a challenge horse all over the world to declare his supremacy, and any ruling prince or king was at liberty to accept the challenge and express his tacit willingness either to obey or to disobey the supremacy of the particular king of the world. The world was ruled in different provinces by different kings, but one king was the emperor of the whole world. Generally, the king whose capital was Hastinapura, at least 5000 years back, that was the system. So one who accepted the challenge of the emperor, whichever king, king of a smaller province, he had to fight with the emperor and establish his own supremacy by victory. The defeated challenger would have to sacrifice his life, making a place for another king or ruler. This was the system. So Maharaj Yudhishthira also dispatched such challenging horses all over the world, and every ruling prince and king all over the world accepted Maharaj Yudhishthira's leadership as the emperor of the world.

**Key Quote:** "Such performances required hundreds of millions of dollars and it was not an easy job for a petty king... Under the present circumstances is now impossible in this age of Kali."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the scale and expense of the Rajasuya Yajna, noting its impracticality in the current age of Kali due to the lack of resources and qualified priests.

In terms of the dynasty, Kuru dynasty, Yudhishthira was the descendant of the emperors of the past. So the ruling kings and the princes, they all knew Yudhishthira to be a very, very powerful emperor, so they accepted his leadership. After this, all the rulers of the world under the regime of Maharaj Yudhishthira were invited to participate in the great sacrificial ceremony of Rajasuya. Such performances required hundreds of millions of dollars, and it was not an easy job for a petty king. Such a sacrificial ceremony, being too expensive and also difficult to perform under the present circumstances, is now impossible in this age of Kali. This is something that happened in Dwapar Yuga. Nor can anyone secure the required expert priesthood to take charge of the ceremony. It's not just a question of money alone; even qualified brahmanas are unavailable for performing such sacrifices.

**Key Quote:** "The qualified brahmana has to chant the mantra with purity, then only the mantra will have the potency to give the benefit to the performer of the sacrifice."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of qualified brahmanas and the potency of mantras, describing the assembly of kings and sages at Yudhishthira's capital, and highlighting Krishna's central role.

Because the qualified brahmana has to chant the mantra with purity, then only the mantra will have the potency to give the benefit to the performer of the sacrifice. After being invited, all the kings and great learned sages of the world assembled in the capital of Maharaj Yudhishthira in Hastinapura. The learned society included the great philosophers, religionists, physicians, scientists, and all great sages were invited. That is to say, the brahmanas and the Kshatriyas were the topmost leading men in society, and they were all invited to participate in the assembly. This was the Vedic system. The Vaishyas and Shudras were unimportant elements in society, and they are not mentioned here. Due to change of social activities in the modern age, the importance of the society, the importance of men, has also changed in terms of occupational positions. Today, practically the whole world is run by the Vaishyas. There are no qualified brahmanas or Kshatriyas to occupy the positions of power or to guide those in positions of power. So the times have changed, and Prabhupada explains that during that time, Yudhishthira Maharaj invited all the kings and the learned sages and the great brahmanas for this Rajasuya Yajna. In that great assembly, Lord Sri Krishna was the cynosure of all the people. Everyone wanted to see Lord Krishna, and everyone wanted to pay his humble respects to the Lord.

### Krishna's Beauty, Rajasuya Yajna, Assembly, Transcendental

**Key Quote:** "Everyone's eyes was glued on the beautiful, exceptionally beautiful form of Krishna... This personality is the most beautiful creation of Brahma."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Krishna's unparalleled beauty and how everyone in the assembly was captivated by Him, clarifying that Krishna's beauty is transcendental and not a creation of Brahma.

Now, elsewhere it is described that when Krishna was elected the president of the assembly in that Rajasuya sacrifice, where all great personalities had assembled, everyone wanted to see Lord Krishna. Everyone's eyes were glued on the beautiful, exceptionally beautiful form of Krishna. They all began to wonder, probably this beauty is not to be found anywhere in the whole universe, so very beautiful. They thought this personality is the most beautiful in the whole universe. This personality is the most beautiful creation of Brahma, that's what they thought. Actually, beauty in the material world is relative, that's a fact. But Krishna is not a created person. He is not a creation of Brahma. Krishna is the only exception in that assembly who is not a creation of Brahma. Krishna's beauty is his original transcendental beauty, his transcendental Supreme beauty. So it is not at all surprising for devotees that Krishna was the center of attraction in that entire assembly.

### Bhishma Deva, Meditation, Krishna's Pastimes, Impersonal Feature

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "To meditate on the Supreme Lord means to meditate on the activities, the form, the pastimes, the name and fame of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Bhishma Deva remembered Krishna's pastimes and emphasizes the ease of meditating on Krishna's form and activities compared to the difficulty of meditating on the impersonal feature of the Supreme.

Now, Bhishma Deva was also present in that assembly, and he remembered all this and was glad that his worshipful Lord, the personality of Godhead, was present before him in his actual formal presence. Krishna, the Supreme Lord, Bhishma knew the Supreme Lord. He was actually present in front of Bhishma, and Bhishma remembered this incident. So to meditate on the Supreme Lord means to meditate on the activities, the form, the pastimes, the name and fame of the Supreme Lord. Now, this type of meditation is what is performed by the devotees of Krishna. Now, this type of meditation in Bhakti is easier than the imaginary meditation on the impersonal feature of the Supreme. This is stated in the Bhagavad Gita, that to meditate upon the impersonal feature of the Supreme is very, very, very difficult.

**Key Quote:** "To meditate upon the impersonal feature of the Supreme is very very very difficult."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the difficulty of meditating on the impersonal feature of the Supreme, which is described in negative terms and requires imagination and speculation.

There are people who are attached to the impersonal feature of the Supreme, and they attempt to meditate on the impersonal feature. That is very, very difficult because the impersonal feature is described in a negative way. In the Bhagavad Gita also, it is mentioned to meditate on the Supreme, who is inconceivable, who is not having any material form, is formless, is not having any material attributes, is not having any material body. Like that, denying all material attributes, qualities, material form, material names, etc. So what can they meditate upon, really speaking? So they imagine, they try to speculate and imagine something which is beyond everything material, and that is the impersonal meditation.

### Meditation, Devotees, Krishna's Form, Pastimes, Bhakti Yoga

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The devotees meditation however, upon the Lord's factual form, factual pastimes, factual qualities, is very easily done by the devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts impersonal meditation with the ease of meditation on Krishna's form, pastimes, and qualities, highlighting the accessibility of the Lord through devotional service (Bhakti Yoga).

And that is very, very difficult. Srila Prabhupada says it is practically no meditation at all or simply a waste of time because very seldom is the desired result obtained. Meditation means to fix the mind completely upon the Supreme. Now, when there is no definite understanding of the features of the Supreme, the spiritual mind, the spiritual attributes, then it is very difficult to fix the mind. The devotees' meditation, however, upon the Lord's factual form, factual pastimes, factual qualities, is very easily done by the devotees, and therefore the Lord is easily approached by the devotees. This is the way it is also explained in the Bhagavad Gita, in the twelfth chapter itself, the chapter on devotional service, Bhakti Yoga. Devotees very easily approach the Lord. The Lord is non-different from his transcendental activities in the spiritual platform. The Lord is absolute. The Lord is absolute means he is identical with his name, with his form, with his qualities, with his pastimes, with his paraphernalia, with his pure devotees. He is identical. So thinking of the Lord's pastimes is the same as thinking of the Lord. So that is what Bhishma, he was doing, remembering Krishna's pastimes.

Actually, he remembered the Lord's pastime and thereby he wanted to fix his attention on the Lord at the time of his death.

**Key Quote:** "This is the last prayer by Bhishma Deva in this series of prayers given in this chapter."
**Summary:** The lecture begins with prayers and introduces the context of Bhishma Deva offering his final prayer to Krishna while preparing to leave his body.

Om Agyana Timiraandhasya Gyananjan Shalakaya Chakshurunmeelitam Yena Tasmai Shri Gurave Namaha Nama Om Vishnupadaya Krishna Preshtaya Bhutale Srimate Bhaktivedanta Svamin Nithinamine Namaste Saraswate Deve Gauravani Pracharine Nirvishesha Shunyavadi Pashchatyade Shatarine Jaya Shri Krishna Chaitanya Prabhu Nithyananda Shri Advaita Gadadhara Srivasa Adi Gauravakta Vrinda Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudhirayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 46th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, from the 2nd verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Tamimam Aham Ajam Sharira Bhajam Hridi Hridi Dishtitam Atmakalpitanam Pratidrisham Iva Naikadharkham Ekam Samadhi Gatosvi Vidhuta Bhedam Ohaha. The meaning of this verse is: Now I can meditate with full concentration upon that one Lord Sri Krishna now present before me because now I have transcended the misconceptions of duality in regard to his presence in everyone's heart, even in the hearts of the mental speculators. He is in everyone's heart. The sun may be perceived differently, but the sun is one.

### misconceptions, Krishna's expansions, duality, ignorance

**Key Quote:** "The conception of duality is due to ignorance of his inconceivable energy."
**Summary:** The speaker explains common misconceptions about Krishna's presence and expansions, emphasizing that the perception of duality stems from ignorance of Krishna's inconceivable energy.

This is the last prayer by Bhishma Deva in this series of prayers given in this chapter. Bhishma is offering this prayer to Krishna while preparing to quit his body because he had the benediction that he could quit his body at a chosen auspicious moment, and as you are aware, he chose the auspicious Uttarayan Punyakala, generally, which comes during the Shankranti Makara Shankranti. So, here, the last prayer Bhishma Deva is offering to the Supreme Lord clarifying that people have some misconceptions about the presence of the Lord in everyone's heart; there is some misconception. So that is explained by Prabhupada in the purport: what is that misconception and how pure devotees don't have that misconception. Prabhupada says in the purport: Lord Shri Krishna is the one absolute Supreme Personality of Godhead. God is one, Krishna is one, supreme absolute truth is one, but he has expanded himself into his multi-plenary portions by his inconceivable energy. Krishna can expand and Krishna does expand into unlimited forms of his personal self. The conception of duality is due to ignorance of his inconceivable energy. That means to think that Krishna is different, Rama is different, Paramatma is different, Narsimha is different, Vishnu is different; this conception is due to ignorance. All one supreme Lord, though they are present as if they are different persons because their activities are variegated, their forms appear different, and they have their own devotees, they have their own planets in the spiritual sky, they appear on their own schedule in the material world.

### Krishna's omnipresence, Paramatma, inconceivable energy

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is one but he appears in so many different forms and he is present in everyone's heart."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's simultaneous presence in various forms and in everyone's heart as Paramatma, using the analogy of the sun to illustrate this concept.

So the people in general who do not exactly know who is God or what is the nature of his personality, that even though he is one, he is simultaneously present in so many different forms, all transcendental, all equally powerful, though the source of all these forms is Krishna, the original form of which the other forms are expansions, that original form is Krishna: Govindam Adipurusham Tamaham Bhajami. So that is explained in the Brahma Samhita, that is explained in the Bhagavatam: ete chamsh kalapumsaha krishnastu bhagavan svayam. So all the incarnations and the expansions are plenary portions of Krishna, but Krishna himself is the original personality of God, svayam bhagava. He is the original person. In the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord says that only the foolish take him to be a mere human being. Foolish people think Krishna is an ordinary person: avajananti mamudha manushin tanumashritam, that is the verse in the Bhagavad Gita. Such foolish people are not aware of Krishna's inconceivable energies, achinthya shakti. Krishna has achinthya shakti. By his inconceivable energy, he is present in everyone's heart. Krishna has entered into every person's heart. He says that in the Bhagavad Gita: sarvasya chaham hrithi sannyi vishto, and the example is being given, just like the sun is present before everyone all over the world. The sun is one. If the sun appears overhead, you go in any direction hundreds and hundreds of times and thousands of miles, they will all say sun is above their head. How can the sun simultaneously appear overhead for so many people? So that is an example. Krishna is one, but he appears in so many different forms and he is present in everyone's heart. The Paramatma feature of the Lord is an expansion of his plenary portions. Paramatma feature is the Lord in the form of the Lord in the heart of every living being. He expands himself as Paramatma in everyone's heart by his inconceivable energy.

### Brahmajyoti, Vasudeva, Mahajana, Bhishma Deva

**Key Quote:** "Vasudeva Sarvamiti... Vasudeva is all in all in everything and there is no existence of anything without Vasudeva."
**Summary:** The lecture discusses the Brahmajyoti as an expansion of Krishna's personal glow and emphasizes the understanding of Krishna as Vasudeva, the ultimate reality, as confirmed by the Mahajana Bhishma Deva.

And he also expands himself as the glowing effulgence of the Brahma Jyoti by expansion of his personal glow. Krishna's form has got unlimited light coming out of it, spiritual light, so that light expands as Brahma Jyoti in the entire spiritual sky. That Brahma Jyoti is the source of illumination in this material world. The sunshine, the moonshine, the light of the fire, the light of electricity, every illumination is an expansion of that Brahma Jyoti, is an expansion of the personal glow of Krishna. This is confirmed in the Brahma Samhita, that Brahma Jyoti is the personal glow: Yasyaprabha Prabhavato Jagadanda Koti is the statement of the Bhagavad Gita Brahma Samhita. Therefore, there is no difference between him, that is Krishna, his personal glow, the Brahma Jyoti, or his plenary portion as all are identical: vadantita tattva vidaha tattvam yajnanam advayam advayagyana non different brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavaniti shabhyati. Less intelligent persons who are not aware of this fact consider Brahma Jyoti and Paramatma features to be different from Krishna. This misconception of duality is completely removed from the mind of Bhishma Deva. So Bhishma Deva knows that Krishna is the original personality of Godhead, he has expanded himself and entered the heart of everyone as Paramatma, and his personal glow is expanded as Brahma Jyoti, that Bhishma Deva knows, and all the pure devotees of Krishna know this. So Bhishma is fully satisfied that Krishna only is all in all in everything, only one who is all in all in everything. So only Krishna who is the ultimate reality in everything in existence. This enlightenment of the truth about Krishna is attained by the great Mahatmas or the great devotees as it is stated in Bhagavad Gita: Vasudeva Sarvamiti Samahatma Sudurlabha. Vasudeva Sarvamiti, Vasudeva is all in all in everything and there is no existence of anything without Vasudeva. So Vasudeva or Lord Sri Krishna is the original supreme person as confirmed now by

**Summary:** The speaker stresses the importance of following spiritual authorities like Bhishma Deva in the devotional path and clarifies that Krishna as Parthasarathy and Shama Sundara are the same supreme person.

a Mahajana. Bhishma Deva is a Mahajana, one of the twelve great authorities in this universe who know the secret or confidential knowledge of Dharma. What is Dharma or who is God? What is the absolute truth? Now both the pure devotees and the neophytes, everyone should try to follow in the footsteps of Bhishma Deva. That is the devotional, that is the way of the devotional line in Bhakti. Always we follow the authorities, the spiritual authorities. We don't concoct, we don't try to imagine, we don't try to discover by our own strength. We never do that because we are limited, we are prone to defects, we are affected by ignorance by the gunas, so therefore it is impossible for us to attempt to discover or find out by our own strength individually or collectively. We follow the spiritual authorities. Now Ravupan explains another important point here, that the worshipable object of Bhishma Deva is Lord Krishna as Parthasarathy. This is described earlier because Bhishma is situated in the relationship of Vediyarasa with Krishna, and the worshipable object of the Gopis is the same Krishna in Vrindavan as the most attractive Shama Sundara. Gopis, they relate with Krishna as Shama Sundara and Bhishma relates with Krishna as Parthasarathy. Now Prabhupada says less intelligent scholars sometimes make a mistake and think that the Krishna of Vrindavan and that of the battle of Kurukshetra are different personalities. This is not correct. Both the forms of Krishna, Parthasarathy and Shama Sundara, are one person, the supreme person, one and only supreme

person Krishna. Even the impersonalist object of destination is Krishna as the impersonal Brahmajyoti, that is also Krishna only, and the yogis destination of Paramatma, yogis meditate on Paramatma in the heart, that is also Krishna only. So even though all are identical with Krishna, still in his personal feature as Krishna, either as Parthasarathy or Shama Sundara, Krishna is present as the person, but in the impersonal feature as Brahmajyoti or in the feature as Paramatma, Krishna is not personally present. This we have to understand. So therefore devotees object is always the personality of God is Krishna. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

### Krishna Consciousness, Nirvikalpa Samadhi, Total Absorption

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This is the highest stage of perfection, this total absorption."
**Summary:** This segment explains the verse describing Bhishma Deva's passing in Krishna consciousness, defining Nirvikalpa Samadhi as total absorption in Krishna through mind, speech, sight, and actions, and emphasizing that this state is attainable through devotional service.

Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya, Narayanam Namaskritya, Naram Chai Vanarottamam, Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session we will be discussing from the 43rd verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The prayers are over. Now Suta Goswami, who is narrating this whole incident to the sage Sunaimisharanya, he is speaking now. Suta Uvacha Krishna Evam Bhagavati Manovag Drishti Vritti Bhihi Atmani Atmanam Aveshya So Anta Shvasa Uparamat. The meaning of this verse is: Suta Goswami said, "Thus Bhishma Deva merged himself in the Supersoul, Lord Sri Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, with his mind, speech, sight and actions, and thus he became silent and his breathing stilled." So this is the verse that is describing Bhishma Deva has quit his body in Krishna consciousness, because his mind, his speech, his sight and actions are all completely absorbed in Krishna. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "The stage attained by Bhishma Deva while quitting his material body is called Nirvikalpa Samadhi." This is a technical term. What is the meaning of this term Nirvikalpa Samadhi? That is also explained by Srila Prabhupada. Nirvikalpa Samadhi, it is called Nirvikalpa Samadhi because he, that is Bhishma Deva, merged himself into thinking of the Lord and his mind into remembering, remembering his different activities. He chanted the glories of the Lord, that is his speech. And by his sight, he began to see the Lord personally present before him. And thus, all his activities became concentrated upon the Lord without deviation. Samadhi means total absorption. Total absorption of the mind, of the thinking, that is the mind, activity of the mind, the speech, and the sight, and the very self. So, thinking, remembering, glorifying, and seeing, in all these ways, Bhishma was totally absorbed in thought of Krishna. This is the highest stage of perfection, this total absorption, and it is possible for everyone to attain this stage by practice of devotional service. So here, Prabhupada is teaching us that there is the highest perfectional stage to be attained in the practice of devotional service. Devotional service means practicing, focusing our attention on Krishna. Krishna means the Supreme Personality of Godhead. We are focusing our attention on Krishna. He has so many different features. So every possible way if we can absorb our self in thought of Krishna, in thinking of Krishna, in glorifying Krishna, in hearing about Krishna, in seeing Krishna's form either as the Deity or as the personally Krishna is present in the case of Bhishma. He is personally present. So Bhishma is directly seeing Krishna before quitting his body and the beautiful form. He is describing, he has already described in his prayers the beautiful form of Krishna.

### Devotional Service, Nine Principles of Bhakti, Service Attitude

**Verse References:** SB 7
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Devotional service is not something idle."
**Summary:** This segment details the nine principles of devotional service (Shravanam, Kirtanam, Smaranam, etc.) as outlined in the Bhagavatam, emphasizing that bhakti involves active service with a loving attitude towards Krishna, and that any of these practices can lead to perfection.

So this is the highest perfection to be attained and it is possible for anyone provided one practices devotional service. Now devotional service itself, how is it performed? So Srila Prabhupada says based on the explanation in the seventh canto of the Bhagavatam. The devotional service of the Lord Krishna consists of nine principles of service activities. Devotional service is not something idle, simply sitting and doing nothing. No. Devotional service, Bhakti, means devotional service. So it consists of service activities, activities rendered while having a service attitude. I want to serve Krishna to please him. I want to serve Krishna in a loving attitude. And these nine principles of service activities are described in the Bhagavatam seventh canto as: Number one, hearing, hearing about Krishna, Shravanam. Number two, chanting, Kirtanam. Number three, remembering, remembering in Sanskrit it is called Smaranam. Number four, serving the lotus feet of Krishna, Padashevanam. Number five, worshipping, Archanam, Deity worship, specifically Deity worship. Number six, praying, Vandanam, offering prayers, just like Bhishma did. He was remembering Krishna's pastimes. He was praying, offering prayers. He was chanting the glories of Krishna, and like that he was engaged in all possible ways in service activities before quitting his body, totally absorbed in that. So number seven, executing the orders, it's called Dasyam. A servant is specially meant for simply carrying out the orders of the master, just like Hanuman. Whatever Rama ordered, Hanuman simply carried out that order. So that is Dasyam. Then eighth one of the list of nine service activities, eighth one is fraternizing, Sakhyam, acting as a rendering service rather, as a friend of the Lord, friend of Lord Krishna, just like Arjuna, rendering service as a friend of Krishna. And the final one, ninth one, fully surrendering, Atma Nivedanam, total self surrender. Bali Maharaj. Each one of these, we have an ideal described in the Bhagavatam. Any one of them, any one of the nine or all of them are equally competent to award the desired result. That is the highest perfection of total absorption of oneself in the Supreme Lord Krishna, but they require to be practiced persistently

### Guidance of Spiritual Master, Hearing, Krishna Katha

**Key Quote:** "Bhakti begins with hearing."
**Summary:** This segment stresses the importance of practicing devotional service under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, highlighting hearing (Shravanam) as the most important of the nine principles, and advocating for hearing and reading Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam as Krishna katha.

under the guidance of an expert devotee of the Lord. Who is that expert devotee of the Lord? The bona fide spiritual master. So the bona fide spiritual master gives guidance, gives instructions, helps the disciple to actually practice one or more of these nine items, nine principles of service activities rendered for Krishna by a devotee. And they have to be practiced. In the beginning, it will not be very nicely done, but by repeatedly doing, again and again, abhyasa yoga yuktena cetasa na anyagamina, without deviation of the attention, persistently focused. The attention, mainly the attention, completely focused on Krishna. So of these nine, Srila Prabhupada says, the first item, hearing, is the most important item of all. Bhakti begins with hearing. So the most important item is hearing, shravanam. And therefore, hearing of the Bhagavad Gita and later on Srimad Bhagavatam is essential for the serious candidate who wants to attain the stage of Bhishma Deva at the end. So practice hearing Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam. From whom should you hear? From Srila Prabhupada. For all of us now, we should hear from Prabhupada. Prabhupada has given discourses and he also has written Bhagavad Gita translation and purport, Bhagavatam translation and purport. So we should read or we should hear somebody else reading Prabhupada's book, Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam. And in this way, we should completely become absorbed in the subject matter that is described in the Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam. Both are Krishna katha. Bhagavad Gita is personally spoken by Krishna and Bhagavatam is spoken by Shukadeva Goswami and other great devotees about Krishna. So they are both Krishna katha and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has instructed everyone to hear these two scriptures, Krishna katha as given in these two scriptures, Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam and thereby perfect our devotional selves.

### Sound Incarnation, Bhagavad Gita, Srimad Bhagavatam, Perfection

**Key Quote:** "His words of the Bhagavad Gita or those of Srimad Bhagavatam are identical with the Lord."
**Summary:** This segment explains that even without Krishna's physical presence, one can attain Bhishma Deva's state of Nirvikalpa Samadhi by engaging with the sound incarnations of the Lord, Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam, and emphasizes the ideal of dying in thought of Krishna.

The unique situation at Bhishma Deva's time of death can be attained even though Lord Krishna may not be personally present. In the case of Bhishma, he was very very fortunate and it's rare that Krishna is personally present before the devotee who is quitting his body. That's very special, very rare. Bhishma Deva was blessed by Krishna. But even if Krishna is not personally present in front of us, when we are quitting the body, we can attain that situation that Bhishma was himself in. In that Nirvikalpa Samadhi, total absorption of the self in Krishna is possible. How? So Prabhupada says, "His words of the Bhagavad Gita or those of Srimad Bhagavatam are identical with the Lord." This is the meaning of Krishna is absolute. Krishna, the person, his form, his qualities, his pastimes, his words, his descriptions, his paraphernalia, his abode, all are identical 100% with Krishna. And there is no difference at all between them. So Prabhupada describes Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam as sound incarnations of the Lord. And one can fully utilize them to be entitled to the stage of Sri Bhishma Deva, who was one of the eight Vasus. Bhishma Deva, before this birth, he was one of the eight Vasus in the upper planets. He took birth as Bhishma and he attained this perfection. Everyone has to quit the body, but quitting the body like Bhishma Deva is the ideal, not dying in ignorance, not dying in thought of something else or someone else, but dying in thought of Krishna. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse about Bhishma Deva quitting his body and draws an analogy to birds returning to their nests and becoming silent at the end of the day.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Jai Vanarottamam Deviim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 44th verse of the 9th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The description is continuing what happened after Bhishma Deva quit his body. Sampadyamanam Agyaya Bhishmam Brahmani Nishkale Sarve Babhu Te Tushneem Vayam Siva Bhishma Dinakya Ye. The meaning of this verse is, knowing that Bhishma Deva had merged into the unlimited eternity of the Supreme Absolute, all present there became silent like birds at the end of the day. Now here is an analogy given that when birds are living in one tree, there are a lot of birds. In the morning they go out searching for food, etc. They go chirping and they come back in the evening around the time of sunset. Again they come back chirping and once they settle down in their particular nest, they become silent.

**Key Quote:** "That's where all of us belong. Everyone, every living entity belongs to the home, our home, that is Kṛṣṇa's personal abode, the unlimited eternity of the Supreme Absolute."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Bhishma's absorption in Krishna at the time of death and explains Srila Prabhupada's interpretation of merging into the unlimited eternity, which means returning to our original home, Krishna's abode.

Something like this happened after Bhishma quit his body. Of course, he was lying there on the bed of arrows. But he chose the most auspicious moment as one who had the benediction to choose an auspicious time to quit the body. But most importantly, he was fully absorbed in thought of Krishna who was personally present before Bhishma Deva. So everyone present there, so many great saintly persons had assembled to witness Bhishma quitting his body. They knew Bhishma was a great personality. He is one of the Mahajanas, one of the ideal devotees in the whole universe. So when he was quitting his body, all the great saintly persons from all over the universe had come. Great sages had come there, assembled there. All of them, they became silent, knowing that Bhishma Deva had attained his perfection of going back home, back to Godhead. That is described here as, He had merged into the unlimited eternity of the Supreme Absolute. So Srila Prabhupada explains what does it mean to merge into the unlimited eternity of the Supreme Absolute. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, To enter into or become merged into the unlimited eternity of the Supreme Absolute means To enter the original home of the living being. This is described by Prabhupāda many times in other places as, let us go back home, back to Godhead. That's where all of us belong. Everyone, every living entity belongs to the home, our home, that is Kṛṣṇa's personal abode, the unlimited eternity of the Supreme Absolute.

**Key Quote:** "Our relationship with Kṛṣṇa is eternal. We are connected with Kṛṣṇa eternally."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the eternal relationship between the living being and Krishna, emphasizing that we are all tiny parts and parcels of Krishna meant to serve Him in loving devotional service.

So Śrīla Prabhupāda says further, the living beings are all component parts and parcels of the Absolute Personality of Godhead. We are all very, very, very tiny spirit souls, part of Kṛṣṇa. Parcel means inseparable part, cannot be separated. Our relationship with Kṛṣṇa is eternal. We are connected with Kṛṣṇa eternally. Only point is that temporarily we may forget when in the material world we forget Kṛṣṇa under the influence of the material energy, we forget Kṛṣṇa. But the relationship is not broken. It is permanently there. It's a spiritual relationship, so it can never be broken. Spirit means eternal. Spiritual relationship is eternal. Therefore, they are eternally related with Him as the servitor and the served. Every spirit soul, every living being, each one of us, we are related with Kṛṣṇa as His servitors. We are meant to serve Him. Don't mistake this to be something like material service. It is actually spiritual service, loving, devotional service. That's the correct explanation. The Lord is served by all His parts and parcels as the complete machine is served by its parts and parcels.

### Analogy, Service to Krishna, Material Activities, Uselessness

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So, we as spirit soul, tiny, tiny, tiny spirit soul, we are totally useless when we are separate from Kṛṣṇa."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of a machine and its parts, the speaker explains that a spirit soul separated from Krishna is useless, and that material activities are also useless because they are not in service to Krishna.

This is an example being given by Prabhupāda to help us understand how we are connected with the Lord. Any part of the machine removed from the whole is no longer important. You can understand this point. Let's say there is a small screw which is holding some particular item in the entire machine, huge machine, several parts. Now that screw, if it falls off, what is the value of this screw? But as long as it is connected with the machine, it is very, very important. It is doing a very specific function and it is very important. So, any part of the machine removed from the whole is no longer important. So, we as spirit soul, tiny, tiny, tiny spirit soul, we are totally useless when we are separate from Kṛṣṇa. Of course, we cannot be separated, inseparable. But if we want to separate or we want to try to separate, then our life is useless. Similarly, any part and parcel of the Absolute detached from the service of the Lord is useless. Now, material activity means so many activities we perform which is not service of the Lord. That is useless. All material activities are useless because they are not of the nature of service of the Supreme Lord Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "When we develop a desire, let me go back home, back to Godhead, where I belong, where life is eternal, full of bliss, full of knowledge, in association with the most loving, supreme personality of Godhead, Krishna, very, very attractive proposition, then that's called the spiritual urge of the living being begins."
**Summary:** The speaker describes life in the material world as a prison and explains that when a living being becomes conscious of this fact, a spiritual urge arises to return to Godhead, which is called Brahma Jijnasa.

The living beings who are in the material world are all disintegrated parts and parcel of the Supreme Whole and they are no longer as important as the original parts and parcels. Originally, we are all part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. So, as original parts, we are very, very important. Now, apart from the living beings in this material world Prabhupāda is telling, there are, however, more integrated living beings who are eternally liberated in the spiritual world. They are eternally liberated. The material energy of the Lord called Durga Shakti or the superintendent of the prison house takes charge of the disintegrated parts and parcels and thus they undergo a conditioned life under the laws of material nature. What is our life in this material world, material existence as we say? It is a life in a prison. Prison because we are originally liberated souls but now we are conditioned by the laws of material nature. The laws of material nature are forcing us to live in this body and this body means full of limitations. When the living being becomes conscious of this fact, just like all of us are now understanding this point as we study here Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavatam, we become conscious of this fact, then the living being tries to go back home, back to Godhead and thus the spiritual urge of the living being begins. When we develop a desire, let me go back home, back to Godhead, where I belong, where life is eternal, full of bliss, full of knowledge, in association with the most loving, supreme personality of Godhead, Krishna, very, very attractive proposition, then that's called the spiritual urge of the living being begins. This spiritual urge is called Brahman. Brahma Jijnasa or inquiry about Brahman. Brahman means Krishna. So inquiry about Krishna. It's called Brahma Jijnasa. Inquire about Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Three things are required to ensure success of Brahma Jijnasa, the spiritual urge: Jnana, Vairagya, Bhakti."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Jnana (knowledge), Vairagya (renunciation), and Bhakti (devotional service) are required for success in Brahma Jijnasa and introduces the three categories of transcendentalists: Jnanis, Yogis, and Bhaktas.

Human form of life is meant for this. Principally this Brahma Jijnasa is successful by knowledge, renunciation and devotional service to the Lord. Jnana, Vairagya, Bhakti. Three things are required to ensure success of Brahma Jijnasa, the spiritual urge. Jnana or knowledge means knowledge of everything of Brahman, the Supreme. We should get proper understanding of who is Krishna or what is Krishna, from the proper source, from the proper authorities. Renunciation means detachment of material affection. In this material world we develop so many different types of material attachments to so many things, to so many material situations, material desires, material objects, material bodies, material relationships. We get attached. So that material affection we have to give up. That is renunciation. And devotional service is the revival by practice of the original position of the living being. Our original position is in the spiritual world in relationship with Krishna as his servant, as his servitor, as his devotee, serving in love. The successful living beings who are eligible to enter into the realm of the Absolute are called the Jnanis, the Yogis and the Bhaktas.

### Impersonal Brahman, Vaikuntha, Devotional Service, Spiritual Planets

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Those who don't render loving service, they have no place in the Vaikuntha."
**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between the destinations of Jnanis and Yogis (impersonal Brahman) and Bhaktas (Vaikuntha planets), emphasizing that only those who render loving service to the Lord can enter Vaikuntha.

Three categories of transcendentalists: Jnanis, Yogis and Bhaktas. Now of these three categories of transcendentalists, the Jnanis and Yogis enter into the impersonal race of the Supreme. In the spiritual world, Krishna is personally present in his personal abode, the spiritual planets, one of the spiritual planets. And outside the spiritual planets is the spiritual sky consisting of the impersonal Brahmajyoti. So the Jnanis and Yogis enter the impersonal Brahmajyoti, not the spiritual planets, not the personal abode of Krishna. But the Bhaktas enter into the spiritual planets known as the Vaikunthas. The spiritual planets, Bhaktas enter. This is basically the third category of transcendentalists: Jnanis, Yogis, Bhaktas. Only the Bhaktas enter into Vaikuntha. In these spiritual planets, the Supreme Lord as Narayana predominates. And the healthy, unconditioned living beings live there by rendering loving service to the Lord in the capacity of servant, friend, parents and fiancée. Four kinds of relationship: Dasya, Sakya, Vatsalya, Madhurya. Different types of relationship different devotees have with the Supreme Lord in the spiritual world. They render service. There the unconditioned living beings enjoy life in full freedom with the Lord. Whereas the impersonalist Jnanis and Yogis enter into the impersonal glowing effulgence of the Vaikuntha planets. So they can't enter because they have to graduate to come to the point of Bhakti, rendering loving service. Those who don't render loving service, they have no place in the Vaikuntha.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that Jnanis and Yogis may fall back to the material world if they don't take to devotional service, while devotees who reach the spiritual planets never return.

So these Jnanis and Yogis, if they take to devotional service, then their spiritual life is successful. If they don't take to devotional service after attaining the Brahmajyoti, then they fall down into the material world. This is explained in the Bhagavatam. They come back to the material world. Whereas devotees, they never come back, having gone once there in the Bhagavad Gita. yad gatva na nivartante taddhama paramam mama. So that is the position of the devotees.

**Key Quote:** "Although he was a human being, as Bhishma he was a human being. But his position was on the level of Brahma."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Bhismadeva's position as a Mahajana, comparing him to Brahma, Narada, and Shiva, emphasizing his spiritual perfection.

That is the greatness of Bhismadeva. So, in the purport, Sri Laprabhupada explains the significance of this way of showing respect to Bhishma Deva. Bhishma Deva was respected both by the human beings and by the demigods. The human beings live on earth and similar other planets in the Bhur and Bhuvara group of planets. Bhuloka, Bhuvarloka. Bhuloka is the earthly planetary system. There are planets which are on this level of the Bhuloka. Loka means a group of planets belonging to a similar category. Bhuvarloka is above Bhuloka, but that is also a planetary system where the humans live, human beings live. But the demigods live in the Svarloka group. Svarloka, heavenly planets. And all of them knew Bhishma Deva as a great warrior and devotee of the Lord. So what is Bhishma Deva's position actually? As a Mahajana or authority, he was on the level of Brahma, Narada, and Shiva. Although he was a human being, as Bhishma he was a human being, but his position was on the level of Brahma. Three other Mahajanas are being mentioned by Prabhupad here. Brahma is the topmost personality in the whole universe. Shiva is greater than even Brahma. Among the Devatas, Shiva is called Mahadeva, greater than even Brahma. And Narada, the topmost devotee of the lord in the whole universe, so Bhishma's position was in an equal level as a Mahajana.

with Brahma, Narada, Shiva. Qualification on a par with the great demigods is possible only an attainment of spiritual perfection, not by material qualifications. One can get such a position as Bhishma got it's only by spiritual perfection. Thus, Bhishma Deva was known all over the universes, and during this time interplanetary travel was affected by finer methods than the futile endeavors of mechanical spacecraft. Prabhupada is comparing in the Vedic times there was interplanetary travel. Demigods used to come to the earth planet, and great yogis and great devotees like Narada, they travel from the earth planet to upper planets. So that was possible by yogic methods, by spiritual methods. Narada, as a pure devotee, simply by desiring to go from swarga loka to bhuloka, he just travels without any separate endeavor at all. Just he desires, let me go to visit Yudhishthira in the palace of Astinapura, he just is there next moment in the palace of Astinapura on the earth from wherever he is before he traveled. So this is unknown to the modern society on this earth planet. So here they are trying to go to other planets by some mechanical spacecraft that is never to happen, especially they cannot travel to upper planets of the category of Swarga Loka. So it is explained by Prabhupada, when the distant planets were informed of the passing away Bhishma Deva, all the inhabitants of the upper planets as well as of the earth dropped showers of flowers.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the showering of flowers is a sign of recognition by demigods and not a mere decoration of a dead body, emphasizing that Bhismadeva's body was spiritualized through devotional service.

to show due respect to the departed great personality. They showered flowers from heaven, and even on the earth they showered flowers on Bhishma Deva because he was such a great personality who quit his body in the ideal way, teaching all of us how to quit the body perfectly. Everybody has to die, but one should not die in ignorance, one should die in knowledge, proper knowledge. So further, Sri La Prabhupada explains the showering of flowers from heaven is a sign of restlessness recognition by great demigods, and it should never be compared to the decoration of a dead body. So in modern times, they have a procession of a person who has quit his body by seating him on a nice throne and carrying the the dead body on the throne in a procession that is called decoration of a dead body. Why? Prabhupada explains here, the body of Bhishma Deva lost its material effects due to being surcharged with spiritual realization, and thus the body was spiritualized as when iron becomes red hot when in contact with fire. So the body of a pure devotee is never material, even if there is some material light that is not material, even if there is some material light that is not material, even if there is some material light at the end of his procession there is a huge shri mithra at that end of the procession which will return to the ark guer sri sri maka what has happened is flavored with the power of spiritual realization by spiritual realization it becomes spiritualized just as a piece of iron placed in red-hot fire gradually becomes red hot and becomes as well as fire similarly this body when completely engaged in pure devotional service before Beschut hatab designatedly this body said and disrupting its Ini искranian mission as one itself is knit on theодcusam very much like the Devacham Stenton that is written in the sri fahiha and Matthias if you followed the following those którego b kendang jr styrage presiding by diestro ot 오케이 elleninki如果ansen septen coron er si phiphan kiya bimaстьaa become spiritualized and this body is as good as a spiritual body it's no longer a material body the body of a fully self-realized soul is not therefore accepted as material.

**Summary:** The lecture distinguishes between honoring spiritually advanced souls and the misuse of 'Jayanti' ceremonies for ordinary people, reserving it for the Lord and His pure devotees.

special ceremonies are observed for such spiritual bodies. The respect and recognition of Bhishma Deva never to be imitated by artificial means as it has become a fashion to observe the so-called jayanti ceremony for any and every common man nowadays, even those who are not spiritually advanced or spiritually perfect, even for them they observe what is called as jayanti ceremony. According to authorized shastras, such a jayanti ceremony for an ordinary man, however exalted he may be materially, is an offense to the body of the lord. Shastras say jayanti is exclusively reserved for the supreme lord and his pure devotees, not for other people who are spiritually ignorant, though they may be materially very, very accomplished. Jayanti is reserved for the day when the lord appears on the earth. When the lord appears on the earth, he appears in his original spiritual form. He appears out of his own sweet will. He comes for the sake of showing his mercy upon the conditioned souls in this world, and he does not come in contact with material energy. He remains in a spiritual uh position. So appearance of the lord is not a secondary thing at all. So Bhishma Deva was unique in his activities and his passing away to the

kingdom of God is also unique. So this is uh the way Bhishma Deva passed away, nirvikalpa samadhi, completely absorbed in thinking of Krishna, in offering prayers to Krishna, in remembering Krishna's pastimes, in fixing his sight completely on that beautiful form of Krishna who was standing in front of Bhishma Deva. In this way, Bhishma squirting his body or passing away was ideal. So it is it deserves to be shown respect by all others who can follow in the footsteps of Bhishma Deva and also try to achieve perfection of going back home, back to Godhead. So this should not be a a ritual just like nowadays they say such and such a great politicians jayanti they say jayanti now that word jayanti is reserved for the lord it's the day on which the lord appears we say narsimma jayanti the day on which lord narsimma appeared vaishakashukla chaturdashi this year it falls on 15th of may vaishakashukla chaturdashi every year we celebrate narsimma jayanti it is indicating the appearance day anniversary of lord narsimma so the supreme lord appears in this world for the sake of protecting the devotees for the sake of delivering the conditioned souls it's his causeless mercy and his appearance is never to be

So uh Bhishma Deva's passing away is uh ideal, and as Prabhupada has explained in a in previous verses, everyone can achieve this perfection that Bhishma Deva achieved of going back to Godhead simply by practicing devotional service to Godhead. So this is the ultimate goal of Bhishma Deva service, especially by practicing hearing and chanting of all the methods of bhakti. This hearing and chanting is very easy, very effective, very powerful in especially in this kali yuga. The subject matter is important, subject matter of hearing and chanting, either you hear and chant the harikrishna mantra or you hear in chant about Krishna's activities as described in the Bhagavatam or about Krishna's instructions in the Bhagavad Gita. Especially these two books, Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam, are very, very important, and they contain the essence of all Vedic wisdom very nicely described, perfectly described.

### Bhishma Deva, Yudhishthira's grief, Dhritarashtra's ambition, Pandu's death, Succession

**Key Quote:** "Bhishma Deva was the most affectionate grandfather of the Pandavas, and caretaker of the widow daughter-in-law Kunti Devi."
**Summary:** The lecture begins with an explanation of the verse, focusing on Yudhishthira's grief after Bhishma Deva's death and then delves into the historical context of Dhritarashtra's ambition and the Pandavas' rightful claim to the throne.

In this session we will be discussing from the 46th verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. तस्य निर्हरणादीनि संपरे तस्य भार्गव युदिष्ठिरक कारयित्वा मुहूर्तं दुख्यितो भवत। The meaning of this verse is, O descendant of Bhrigu, शवनका, after performing funeral rituals for the dead body of Bhishma Deva, Maharaj Yudhishthira was momentarily overtaken with grief. So, Suta Goswami speaking this verse, he is addressing Shavunaka Rishi, the sages headed by Shavunaka Rishi. Shavunaka Rishi is addressed as Bhargava, descendant of Bhrigu Rishi or Bhrigu Muni. He is coming in the dynasty of Bhrigu Rishi, Bhrigu Vamsha. So, the description is being given here that Yudhishthira, after Bhishma Deva passed away, he quit his body at the most auspicious moment, and more importantly, he quit his body in the presence of Lord Sri Krishna, and he quit his body while his mind was completely absorbed in thought, in remembrance of Krishna. So, perfect way of quitting the body, ideal for all the devotees, for everyone. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, Bhishma Deva was not only a great family head of Maharaj Yudhishthira, but also he was a great philosopher and friend to him, his brothers and his mother, the entire Pandavas. Kunti is the name of a family, the five Pandavas brothers, and their mother Kunti, Kunti Devi. Since Maharaj Pandu, the father of the five brothers headed by Maharaj Yudhishthira, had died, Bhishma Deva was the most affectionate grandfather of the Pandavas, and caretaker of the widow daughter-in-law Kunti Devi. Bhishma Deva's granddaughter was the daughter of Lord Pundit, Krishna's daughter, Bhishmadeva's brother was Vichitravirya. Vichitravirya's son was Pandu. So, Bhishmadeva's daughter-in-law or Vichitravirya's daughter-in-law was Kuntidevi. In that way, it is being described here, Bhishmadeva's relationship with Kuntidevi. Although Maharaj Dhritarashtra, the elder uncle of Maharaj Yudhishthira, was there to look after them, his affection, that is Dhritarashtra's affection, was more on the side of his hundred sons, headed by Duryodhana. Dhritarashtra was very much unhappy about the fact that Dhritarashtra himself could not ascend the throne of the emperor of the entire world, the throne of Hastinapura, because Dhritarashtra was blind by birth. He was disqualified. And Pandu had taken charge of ruling the entire world as the emperor, and Pandu died. And Yudhishthira should have ascended the throne, but if Dhritarashtra is not dead, would that mean he shall not be a successor? Since Yudhishthira was not an adult, a major—he was not quite eighteen years old—therefore, after Pandu died, as long as Yudhishthira would yield to the throne, a caretaker king was needed. And that caretaker king Bhishma refused because Bhishma had taken a vow not to sit on the throne. He had given a promise to his father. Therefore Dhritarashtra was the caretaker king and Bhishma and Vidura were advising.

**Key Quote:** "Ultimately a colossal clique was fabricated to deprive the five fatherless brothers of the rightful claim of the kingdom of Hastinapura."
**Summary:** This segment details Dhritarashtra's unfair treatment of the Pandavas, the conspiracy to deprive them of their kingdom, and the attempt to kill them in the house of shellac, highlighting Vidura's role in warning Yudhishthira.

They were advisors to Dhritarashtra and the entire royal household. But Dhritarashtra was not fair in his dealings, especially with the Pandavas. So Srila Prabhupada explained, "Ultimately a colossal clique was fabricated to deprive the five fatherless brothers of the rightful claim of the kingdom of Hastinapura." There was a great intrigue common in imperial palaces and the five brothers were exiled to wilderness. This is explained by Prabhupada in another place. What was this? This was a colossal clique that because these Pandavas were great devotees of Krishna and Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana were very materialistic. Naturally, Pandavas were put into many dangerous conditions. That is the policy of Dhritarashtra. How to kill the sons of Pandu? He wanted to kill the five sons of Pandu and usurp the kingdom for his own sons. He could not ascend the throne. So he felt that at least my sons should become the emperors. So he wanted to kill the five sons of Pandu just so that his son can become the emperor. So this was the policy from the very beginning. But the Pandavas, they were very obedient to Dhritarashtra because Dhritarashtra was their guardian, their uncle, elderly uncle, who had taken charge of protecting the five Pandavas and their mother Kunti in the absence of Pandu. So what did Dhritarashtra do? He constructed a house of shellac. Shellac means as soon as you touch one matchstick, immediately the whole palace will be on fire. So he asked his nephews and sisters-in-law Kunti that for some time you go. I constructed a very nice palace for you. You go and live there. Why you have to share this palace? So Vidura, he was very alert. He knew that Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana were plotting to kill the Pandavas. So Vidura informed Yudhishthira very secretly that Dhritarashtra wants to burn you to ashes when you go to that house. Be careful. And Duryodhana could understand that Vidura had already informed. Therefore Duryodhana was very anxious. He was very angry against Vidura. And these are all, this is the politics that was going on in the palace of Hastinapura during the time of the Pandavas and Kauravas.

### Yudhishthira's obedience, Pandavas' trials, Draupadi's protection, Gambling match, Exile

**Key Quote:** "So although Yudhishthira knew that my uncle is sending me to this house to set it on fire, still he was very obedient."
**Summary:** The segment recounts the various trials faced by the Pandavas, including their escape from the house of shellac, the attempt to poison Bhima, Draupadi's protection by Krishna, and their exile following the rigged gambling match.

So although Yudhishthira knew that my uncle is sending me to this house to set it on fire, still he was very obedient. So he agreed to go. He didn't want to disobey the superior because Yudhishthira was always morally upright. So they dug a subway into that house and they escaped. They dug a subway within that house, a tunnel, and then they escaped. So this is the way they escaped that danger to their life. The five Pandavas along with Kunti. Then another time Bhima was fed a poisoned cake. And again it's described in detail in the Mahabharata. Bhima was also saved. Then they had to meet one man-eater, rakshasa demon, Hidimba. So Bhima fought with him and killed him. And then in the assembly of ruffians, asatsabhaya, they attempted to disrobe Draupadi. But Draupadi took shelter of Krishna and she was protected. Then that is also described in detail in the Mahabharata. And then in a gambling match, which was completely rigged, the Pandavas were totally cheated. And when they lost the match, the terms were that whoever loses has to go and stay in the forest in exile for 13 years, out of which the last year, 13th year, they have to live incognito. They have to hide themselves. So in this way, the Pandavas, they were cheated and their life was in danger. Even when they were living in exile, Duryodhana attempted to attack the Pandavas and kill them. But the Pandavas fought back. And therefore the description is that they could not ultimately kill the Pandavas, though they tried. And in the battle of Kurukshetra, because Krishna was on the side of the Pandavas, the Pandavas could not be defeated by the Kauravas, even though the Kauravas were very powerful.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is always on the side of his devotees."
**Summary:** This segment explains why Krishna sided with the Pandavas, emphasizing the importance of devotion and highlighting Bhishma's knowledge of the Pandavas' eventual victory due to Krishna's presence, concluding with Yudhishthira's grief over Bhishma's death.

Because Krishna was on the side of the Pandavas. So it is described here, even though Bhishma was fighting on the side of the Kauravas, because he was obliged to the caretaker, Dhritarashtra, but still he was a sincerely sympathetic, well-wisher, grandfather, friend and philosopher to Maharaja Yudhishtira. Even up to the last moment of his life, he died very happily seeing Maharaja Yudhishtira ascend to the throne. Otherwise, he would have died long, long back. Instead of suffering agony over the undue suffering of the Pandavas, he would have quit his body long back. But he was waiting for the opportune moment because he knew that the sons of Pandavas would come out victorious. He knew this in the battle of Kurukshetra. And he knew that because Krishna was on the side of the Pandavas. Now why did Krishna take the side of the Pandavas? Krishna is always on the side of his devotees. And who can be a devotee of Krishna? Anyone, everyone can become a devotee of Krishna. But these demoniac minded people, they refuse to become devotees of Krishna. And as a result of that, they keep on suffering. And Bhishma knew Yudhishtira cannot be ultimately vanquished because he is a pure devotee of Krishna. Therefore, Yudhishtira also, he had respect for Bhishma Deva. And he felt great separation when Bhishma Deva quit his body. And therefore, momentarily he was feeling grief on account of the death of Bhishma.

**Key Quote:** "application of the knowledge, that is called realization"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse and explains that while sages possess knowledge, applying it and achieving realization is a different and difficult process.

In this session, we will be discussing the 47th verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Tushtuvur Munayo Hrshtaha Krishnam Tadguhya Namabhihi Tataste Krishna Hridayaha Svashraman Prayayuk Punaha. The meaning of this verse is: All the great sages then glorified Lord Sri Krishna, who was present there, by confidential Vedic hymns. Then all of them returned to the Lord and returned to their respective hermitages, bearing always Lord Krishna within their hearts. So, the description was being given earlier in this chapter that at the time of Bhishma preparing to quit his body, great sages from all over the universe, from all the upper planetary systems, they assembled at the site where Bhishma had made preparations by lying on a bed of arrows, and they all heard Bhishma instruct Yudhishthira in the presence of Krishna. Therefore, after Bhishma's passing away, which they witnessed, how perfectly Bhishma quit his body, that was a lesson for everyone, even all the great sages, because even though the great sages know philosophically, in terms of knowledge, they have knowledge how to quit the body, but in reality, when one has to put that knowledge into practice, that is a different thing altogether. Application of the knowledge, that is called realization.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that applying knowledge requires the mercy of liberated souls and the Supreme Lord, which is attained through submission, service, and humility.

That realization is not very easy. Of course, the knowledge also is quite difficult to understand, but even if the knowledge is quite difficult to understand, even if somebody somehow acquires that knowledge and gets an understanding, to apply that knowledge, that is only possible by blessings, mercy of great liberated personalities, of great souls, great devotees, great tapasvis, of the Supreme Lord Himself. The mercy is required, and that mercy one has to actually get by submission, by service, by humility. So here the description is given that all the great sages glorified Lord Sri Krishna, who was present there, by confidential Vedic hymns, then all of them returned to their respective hermitages, bearing always Lord Krishna within their hearts.

**Key Quote:** "the devotees of the Lord are always in the heart of the Lord and the Lord is always in the hearts of the devotees"
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's commentary on the verse, highlighting the reciprocal relationship between the Lord and his devotees, where each resides within the other's heart.

This is the description of this verse. So Srila Prabhupada explains, the devotees of the Lord are always in the heart of the Lord, and the Lord is always in the hearts of the devotees. It is described in this verse that the sages who had assembled, they went back to their home always remembering, always bearing Lord Krishna within their hearts. This is the perfection of life, that one is able to constantly think of Krishna, or one is able to constantly remember Krishna, one is able to constantly chant the holy name of the Supreme Lord Krishna. That way they can remain Krishna conscious. Whenever death comes, they are ready to quit the body. That is the practice actually which Krishna himself recommends in the Bhagavad Gita: tasmat sarveshu kaaleshu maa manu smara yudhya ca. So in the Bhagavatam this is described: sadhavo hrudayam mahyam sadhunam hrudayam tu aham maranya tena jananti naaham tebhyo managapi. This means the pure devotee is always within the core of my heart. This is a statement spoken by Lord Vishnu to Durvasamuni. So Vishnu is telling, Supreme Lord Vishnu is telling, the pure devotee is always within the core of my heart, and I am always in the heart of my pure devotee. See, it is reciprocal. Vishnu or Krishna carries always the memory of the pure devotee within his heart, and a pure devotee always carries Vishnu or Krishna within his heart, always, always. So in this way Vishnu is telling, my devotees do not know anything else but me, and I do not know anyone else but them. See, this is the sweet relationship between the Lord and his devotees.

**Key Quote:** "the Lord is always busy in attending to the welfare of his devotees"
**Summary:** The speaker describes how the Lord is always anxious to guide his devotees on the right path and provides special protection to those engaged in pure devotional service.

Prabhupada said this is a sweet relationship due to unalloyed love and devotion for the Lord. The devotees always see the Lord within themselves, and although the Lord has nothing to do and nothing to aspire for, he is perfect and complete in himself, still he is always busy in attending to the welfare of his devotees. So for the ordinary living people, for the ordinary living beings, the laws of nature is there for all actions and reactions, but the Lord is always anxious to put his devotees on the right path. If somebody is taken to pure devotional service, then in the stage of practice of pure devotional service, sometimes devotees may slip away from the actual path, then Krishna is always watching, guarding, protecting, so he will put back the devotee who is on the pure devotional path back on track. That is a special protection personally given by Krishna to his devotees who are on the path of pure devotional service.

**Key Quote:** "the devotees meaning the pure devotees or those on the path of pure devotional service therefore are under the direct care of the Lord"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the protection offered to devotees with the lack of such protection for those practicing Jnana, Ashtanga Yoga, or Karma Yoga, and explains how the Lord engages in pastimes to show his care for devotees.

This particular protection is only for those who are on the path of pure devotional service. It is not there for those practicing the process of Jnana, process of Ashtanga Yoga, process of Karma Yoga. For them this specific protection is not there personally by the Lord. That protection is not there. So Prabhupada says the devotees, meaning the pure devotees or those on the path of pure devotional service, therefore are under the direct care of the Lord, and the Lord also voluntarily puts himself under the care of his devotees. Only this is the pastime of the Lord. This is the Leela, Krishna Leela, Vishnu Leela. What is that? The Lord appears in this world as a son of his pure devotee, or he appears as an associate of another pure devotee. So that way also the Lord, even though he is completely independent, still he puts himself under the care of his devotees. So all the sages headed by Vyasadeva were devotees of the Lord. This is very important. A sage reaches perfection when he becomes a devotee of the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "a sage reaches perfection when he becomes a devotee of the Lord"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that sages reach perfection by becoming devotees of the Lord, and that all Vedic literature is meant for understanding Krishna.

So by this statement we understand those who are impersonalist sages, they are not exactly perfect in their spiritual life. They have not yet reached perfection of the spiritual life. They are yet to reach perfection because they have not yet taken to the pure devotional service of Krishna, but Vyasadeva, he himself of course is the incarnation of Supreme Lord, but he appears as a sage, and he is conducting himself exactly as a pure devotee, and not only Vyasadeva, the other sages whose names have been mentioned earlier, they were all devotees of the Lord. Therefore, they chanted the Vedic hymns after the funeral ceremony just to please the Lord who is present there personally. Now why did they chant the Vedic hymns? So Prabhupada explains all the Vedic hymns are chanted to please Lord Krishna. All the Vedas, this is confirmed in the Bhagavad Gita in the 15th chapter, 15 verse. Krishna says, vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyo. What is the meaning of this? All the Vedic literature is meant for understanding me. Who is telling this? Krishna. So all the Vedic literature is meant for understanding Krishna, knowing Krishna, and Prabhupada also says all the Vedas, Upanishads, Vedanta are seeking Krishna only, and all Vedas and all hymns, Vedic hymns are for glorifying Krishna only.

**Key Quote:** "only Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is explained, only He is glorified"
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Chaitanya Charitamrita to explain that all Vedic literature glorifies Hari (Krishna), and describes how the sages participated in Bhishma's funeral rituals.

In the Chaitanya Charita Amrita this is explained: VEDE RAMAYANE CHAIVA PURANE BHARATE TATHA ADHAV ANTE CHA MADHYA CHA HARI SARVATRA GIYATE. The meaning of this verse is: In the Vedic literature including the Ramayana, Puranas, and Mahabharata, from the very beginning, ADHAV, to the end, ANTE CHA, as well as in the middle, MADHYA CHA, only HARI, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is explained. HARI SARVATRA GIYATE, only He is glorified, only He is explained, that's all. Therefore, the sages performed the exact activities suitable for the purpose of that occasion. Bhishma quitted his body in perfect Krishna consciousness. The sages who were assembled there, they participated in that funeral rituals, funeral ceremony of Bhishma Deva, great personality, and after that, before leaving for their own hermitages, they glorified Krishna, and how did they glorify Krishna? By reciting the Vedic hymns. Different sages are experts in different portions of the Vedas, and that's how Vyasa Deva, he divided the one Veda into four, and he entrusted each division of the Veda to different sages who are all his disciples and followers.

**Key Quote:** "all these are meant for glorification of Krishna only"
**Summary:** The speaker explains how the sages chanted Vedic hymns from different Vedas, Puranas, and Itihasas to glorify Krishna, and how they happily departed after witnessing Bhishma's perfect departure.

So whoever was expert in Rig Veda, they chanted the Vedic Rig Veda hymns. Somebody else was expert in Yajur Veda, they chanted the Yajur Veda hymns. Like this, these sages chanted the Vedic hymns to glorify Krishna who was personally present when Bhishma Deva was about to quit his body. That was Krishna's mercy on Bhishma Deva. So the sages, they were all chanting from their Vedic, the Vedic hymns from the different Vedas, and the Puranas and Itihasas. There are 18 Mahapuranas, 18 Upapuranas, and there are also the Itihasas, especially the Ramayana and Mahabharata. All these are meant for glorification of Krishna. They are called the 5th Veda, Panchama Veda Ucyate. Itihasa Purananam Panchama Veda Ucyate, the statement like this in the Chandogya Upanishad, as well as in the Bhagavatam is described, the 5th Veda. So even the experts in the Puranas and Itihasas, they also chanted verses from the Puranas and Itihasas glorifying Krishna. So that is the way they happily departed for their respective hermitages after glorifying Krishna and witnessing the greatest personality of their time, Bhishma Deva, quit his body in perfection thinking of Krishna in Krishna Consciousness.

she was an ascetic. So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari, the father and the mother of Duryodhana and his brothers, were the elder uncle and aunt of Maharaj Yudhishthira. After the battle of Kurukshetra, the celebrated couple, having lost all their sons and grandsons, were under the care of Maharaj Yudhishthira. What happened in the battle of Kurukshetra? All the 100 sons of Dhritarashtra and Gandhari, they were killed in the battle, and even the grandsons. Everyone was killed from Dhritarashtra's side, Kaurava side. Dhritarashtra was very, very confident that his sons will win the battle because they had the best support, but Dhritarashtra, being materialistic, he made a miscalculation, he did not stop the war. So, consider Krishna, even though he was not fighting, actually, he had not taken up any weapons in the battle, he was on the side of the Pandavas.

Yes, Jayastu Pandu Putranam, Esham Pakshe Janardana, whosoever side Krishna is, that side ultimately is going to win. Even Sanjaya, at the end of the Bhagavad Gita, while narrating what is happening on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, before the battle is about to begin, Sanjaya says, at the end of the Bhagavad Gita, 45 minutes, that's all, Krishna spoke Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna. So, Sanjaya concludes, Yatra Yogeshwara Krishna, Yatra Partho Dhanurdhara, Tatra Shri Vijayo, Bhutir Dhruva, Neetir Matir Mama. Wherever there is Krishna and wherever there is Arjuna, his pure devotee, there, there is certainly victory. So, even before the battle began, Sanjaya predicted and announced to Dhritarashtra that don't expect victory for the Kauravas because Krishna and Arjuna, Krishna and his pure devotee, of course, all the Pandavas are pure devotees, but still, wherever there is Krishna and Arjuna, there, there is victory. Pandavas.

**Key Quote:** "So, all of the material calculations, ultimately, are a failure."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the futility of material calculations, the limited free will of living entities, and the immense power of Krishna.

Pandavas are guaranteed to win. So, all of the material calculations, ultimately, are a failure. Everything actually happens even in the material world, according to the plan of the Supreme Lord, according to the will of Govinda. That's how everything actually is happening, is going on. Though Krishna never takes away the free will of the living entities, he never takes away the free will, but the living entities are very, very, very, very, very tiny. They are insignificant parts of the Supreme Lord, who is unlimitedly powerful. And we have some power, some strength, some knowledge, some ability. We are very, very, very, very, very, very tiny, insignificant, atomic, we are atomic, and Krishna is the complete whole, the total manifestation of the material, spiritual, everything. So, there is no comparison. It is foolish to think that... To think that, I can become God, I can compete with God, Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of humility in the presence of Krishna and contrasts it with the foolishness of trying to compete with God, also discussing the materialist's view of family and legacy.

That is utterly foolish, utterly foolish. So, therefore, only devotees have this sense that, what am I in comparison to Krishna? So, our devotees' humility is very... Reasonable and natural, and it is very meaningful, to take a humble position in presence of Krishna, and always remain so, because eternally that is our position. So, here the explanation is being given that, what is the situation of Dhritarashtra and Gandhari after the battle of Kurukshetra? They lost all... All their sons and grandsons. So, they were passing their days in great agony over such a heavy loss of life, and were practically living the life of ascetics. What did they have to aspire for further in their life? Even materially speaking. Of course, from a spiritual perspective, success in this life, whatever we may do, is if we become Krishna conscious, and put our body in Krishna consciousness, but for materialists they make calculations, I will live my life in such a way that I enjoy my the prime of my youth, and when I become old then my family members, my descendants will take over and they will enjoy life in this material world, power or

wealth or some fame etc., all these things, but that is never to happen, that is never to happen. Everyone meets with defeat, though everyone means all those who are materialistic, they meet with defeat in every step of their life in this material world because Maya is very, very powerful. We are very powerful, we are very powerful, we are very powerful, we are very powerful, we are very powerful, are on the clutches of Maya. Dhritarashtra was similarly in the clutches of Maya, making calculation, oh, somehow let me try to kill the fatherless sons of Pandu, and once the pond, the five Pandavas are killed, then my sons will take over from me. I am the caretaker King, but they will take over and become regular King,

Therefore, they required solace from Maharaja Yudhishthira. So, Maharaja Yudhishthira was conscious of his duty, and he at once hurried to the spot with Lord Krishna and satisfied the bereaved Dhritarashtra with kind words from both himself and the Lord also.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Krishna's compassion for all living beings and highlights Gandhari's spiritual advancement and asceticism, particularly her faithfulness to her blind husband.

who may be rebellious, who may be envious, who may be not following the principles of Dharma, but still the Lord is always looking upon every living being as his own child, a father looks upon his child same way because Krishna is the supreme father of every living being and Krishna naturally will have concern for the rebellious conditioned suffering souls of this world and Dhritarashtra is one of them like all other suffering souls of this world.

Now, regarding Gandhari, there's a particular mention here, Gandhari was a powerful and powerful woman, who was a powerful woman, who was a powerful woman, who was a powerful woman, who was a powerful woman, who was an ascetic, although she was living the life of a faithful wife and a kind mother. Gandhari, she was not like Dhritarashtra, materialistic, she was very, very, very advanced spiritually. The pravapada says she was on the level of Bhishma as regards Brahmapurias spiritual attainment because she was a very faithful wife of her husband Dhritarashtra. It is said that Gandhari also voluntarily closed her eyes because of the blindness of her husband when she came to know that I am going to get married to a blind King, before her marriage she voluntarily agreed to remain blind whole life voluntarily her eyesight was perfect but she voluntarily agreed to close her eyes whole life because of the blindness of her husband a wife's duty is to follow the husband cent percent and Gandhari was so true to her husband that she followed him even his perpetual blindness in the entire life she followed him.

**Summary:** The speaker continues to praise Gandhari's character, highlighting her tolerance of suffering, her adherence to Dharma, and her warnings to Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana against cheating the Pandavas.

you know, therefore interaction she was a great ascetic, tapas win increased Tapaswini described here particularly well described here besides this austere T here undertaken the shock she suffered because the wholesale killing of her 100 sons and grandsons also a searchance a whole jam killing of her 100 sons and grandsons also a searchance a whole jam same aggressive really to stop iPads beatings to your mother so she couldn't certainly too much for a woman. They are soft hearted. They are very, very soft in their heart. So Gandhari was very much aggrieved on the loss of all her sons, all her sons. But she suffered all this just like an ascetic, tapasvini. That means she tolerated the suffering, the grief. She tolerated the grief. So Gandhari, although she was a woman, she is no less than Bhishma Deva in character, perfect character. She did all her duties exactly according to the scriptural directions. She was a faithful wife. She was a kind mother. But she knew that her policy was always that Dhritarashtra should not cheat the Pandavas. She warned Dhritarashtra, her own husband, and she warned her son Duryodhana to not cheat the Pandavas, to not attempt to usurp the kingdom which rightfully belongs to the Pandavas. That was Gandhari's policy.

This is the great responsibility of the king in the Vedic culture as given in the scriptures.

### Rajadharma, King's Responsibility, Liberation

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The responsibility is there for the king towards his citizens ensure the upliftment of the citizens ultimately the citizens have to become Attraction liberated by practicing spiritual life becoming responsible to understand the great opportunity as a human being this is the responsibility"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Rajadharma, the science of kingship, and the king's duty to lead citizens towards spiritual liberation from birth, death, disease, and old age.

Rajadharma, which describes the duties of the Raja or the king, what are the duties of a king, so Prabhupada says Rajadharma is a great science. Elsewhere he describes this, unlike modern diplomacy for political supremacy, being a king or an emperor is actually based on following the science of Rajadharma as given in the Dharma Shastras. The kings were trained systematically to become munificent and not merely be tax collectors, not that I am the king and I enjoy power, wealth, and a nice army and then simply lord over everyone else and try to, you know, suppress any rebellion, quell any uprising. So, this is not the way to rule the kingdom. The responsibility is there for the king towards his citizens to ensure the upliftment of the citizens. Ultimately the citizens have to become liberated by practicing spiritual life, becoming responsible to understand the great opportunity as a human being. This is the responsibility of the king. The kings were trained to perform different sacrifices only for the prosperity of the subjects, only for the prosperity of the citizens. The king was to lead the prajas to the attainment of salvation. That was the great duty of the king. So, Prabhupada says the father, the spiritual master, and the king are all natural leaders of their respective dependents and they are not to become irresponsible in the matter of leading their subjects to the path of ultimate liberation from birth, death, disease, and old age. This is the responsibility whether somebody is a father or somebody is a spiritual master or somebody is a king. Father has got responsibility towards his children and the spiritual master has got responsibility towards his disciples and the king has got responsibility towards the citizens.

You, whom is ruling, so they have to liberate ultimately their dependents from birth, death, diseases, and old age. This is the prerogative of the human being. When you got a human form of life, you are meant to prepare yourself to attain ultimate liberation from these four fundamental miseries which is there throughout the entire material creation. So, Krishna instructs in the Bhagavad-Gita these are four fundamental miseries and one should aim how to get out by cultivating Krishna consciousness under the able guidance, leadership, direction of these superiors.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Vedic kingship with modern administration, criticizing the lack of training and the focus on taxation rather than the welfare of citizens.

In modern days, Prabhupada says, as opposed to what was actually the Vedic culture, modern days the people in general occupy the administration by the strength of manipulated votes, but they are never trained in the primary duties of the king and everyone cannot be trained unless they have some basic qualification. Under the circumstances, the untrained administrators play havoc to make the subjects happy in all respects. They try somehow to make people happy, but it is not going to happen unless they are trained how to ensure happiness of the citizens under all circumstances. So, these modern day administrators, they increase the tax to finance a top heavy administration that is useless for all purposes. They don't do the real duties of an administrator or a king or a government leader or government head. They don't perform their duties.

**Key Quote:** "In the Vedic times or the Vedic culture Vedic culture Vedic civilization the qualified brahmanas are meant to give direction to the kings for proper administration"
**Summary:** The speaker describes the role of qualified Brahmanas in guiding kings according to Dharma Shastras like Manu Samhita and the qualities of pious kings.

In the Vedic times or the Vedic culture, Vedic civilization, the qualified brahmanas are meant to give direction to the kings for proper administration in terms of the scriptures like Manu Samhita and the dharma shastras of Parashara, Parashara Smriti. They describe exactly how the king should rule and the king is given instructions and directions according to the codes given in the Manu Samhita and other dharma shastras. So, the brahmanas are well-versed in the dharma shastra, they are well-versed in these scriptures and they give correct advice, correct guidance to the kings. If the king is pious, religious, chivalrous, and munificent, the citizens generally will follow him. It's natural. Such a king is never a lazy, sensuous person living at the cost of the subjects, but he is always alert to kill thieves and decoys in the kingdom to protect the weaker sections of the society. The kings, the pious kings in the former days were not merciful to decoys and thieves in the name of nonsensical ahimsa.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that kings should not be foolishly non-violent when dealing with criminals and gives an example of strict punishment in Kashmir.

It's like modern-day politicians, they say non-violence. No, they should remain silent, never be non-violent when it comes to punishing thieves and decoys. They should never show non-violence principles. Now, the thieves and decoys were punished in an exemplary way so that in future no one would dare commit such nuisance in an organized form. That was the way. Prabhupada says even about 150 years ago in Kashmir, the ruling king was so very strict in punishing the thieves that if somebody dropped, let's say, a gold coin on the way, that gold coin would lie on the street till the actual owner who has lost it comes and picks it up. Nobody else would dare touch that because it's not theirs. The king would punish those who would steal or take somebody else's wealth in such a way that if somebody was caught stealing, their fingers would be cut off. So, this is the way to rule that there will be no nuisance of these thieves, rogues, plunderers, and anti-socials.

**Key Quote:** "The king must know that the human form of life is meant for liberating the trapped soul from the bondage of material conditions."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the king's duty to help citizens attain liberation and mentions Krishna's teachings in the Bhagavad Gita.

So, Prabhupada says in the purport, the king must know that the human form of life is meant for liberating the trapped soul from the bondage of material conditions. Therefore, the king's duty is to see that the citizens are properly looked after to attain the highest stage of perfection. The king has got a goal, he's got a target, how the citizens can get out of this material bondage. King Yudhishthira followed these principles strictly as will be explained in the next chapter. Not only did he follow the principles but he got approval also from his old uncle who was experienced in political affairs and it was also confirmed by Lord Shri Krishna, the speaker of the philosophy of Bhagavad Gita. See, Krishna spoke Bhagavad Gita first to Sun God because they are to rule in accordance with the teachings of Bhagavad Gita. That's why Krishna spoke to Sun God. Later he spoke to Arjuna, was also a Kshatriya, rulers. Maharaja Yudhishthira is the ideal monarch and monarchy under a trained king like Maharaja Yudhishthira is by far the most superior form of government.

**Key Quote:** "A trained, shatria who can rule according to the codes of Dharmashastra is far far superior than an elected government by the people who do not have the qualification to select a proper government leader."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts monarchy under a trained Kshatriya with modern democracy, arguing that unqualified voters in Kali Yuga cannot elect responsible leaders, and concludes the lecture.

Superior to modern republics or governments of the people by the people. Nowadays people are very proud that we have got what is called as democracy. But in democracy, the defect is that the mass of people who elect their leaders or their rulers, they are, especially in the Kali Yuga, they are basically low born, they are ill trained, they are unfortunate and badly associated. This is described in the Bhagavatam. In Kali Yuga people are disqualified in so many ways. So, they themselves do not know the highest perfectional aim of life, therefore votes cast by them actually have no value. And persons elected by such illiterate people, irresponsible votes, cannot be, people elected by such irresponsible votes cannot be responsible representatives like Maharaja Yudhishthira. So, the conclusion is a trained Kshatriya who can rule according to the codes of Dharmashastra is far, far superior than an elected government by the people who do not have the qualification to select a proper government leader. So, I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "The rishis are those who attain perfection by spiritual achievements that means they practice spiritual life and by advancement in spiritual life they are able to attain certain types of perfections"
**Summary:** The lecture discusses the difference between material and spiritual perfections, highlighting the achievements of rishis through spiritual practice and detachment.

explains the rishis are those who have attained perfection by spiritual achievements. There are both material and spiritual methods of attaining different kinds of perfection. This, like my practice of Ashtanga Yoga, one can get what is called Ashta Siddhi, eight kinds of material perfection. One can become very small, one can grow very big, one can become very light, or one can become very heavy, or one may manufacture a planet, one may extend one's subtle hand thousands of miles away and pick up something from a very, very distant place. Like that, different material achievements are possible by practice of Ashtanga Yoga. But the rishis are those who attain perfection by spiritual achievements. That means they practice spiritual life, and by advancement in spiritual life, they are able to attain certain types of perfections, like becoming enlightened in transcendental knowledge, acquiring some powers by which they freely travel from one planet to another planet without any machine, without the help of any aircraft. Like this, the rishis have so many types of perfection. Now Srila Prabhupada says here, such spiritual achievements can be earned by all, whether one is a king or a mendicant. Mendicant means a beggar. So spiritualists keep themselves in a politics taken condition because they don't want to be carried away by wealth, they don't want to become greedy, they don't want to become opulent. So they keep themselves in a very but is taken condition, but they are very humble, they're very simple, they are very straightforward, they work for the welfare of all the people in general in this world. So such rishis are those who have spiritual achievements, and it is possible for anyone to practice this, practice spiritual life, make advancement, and obtain some or all of these spiritual perfections.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Bhishma's status as a brahmarshi and the importance of the quality of goodness (sattva guna).

even material perfection. So further, Srila Prabhupada says, Bhishma Deva himself was also one of the brahmarshis and the chief of the descendants of king Bharata. That means Bhishma Deva, he first attained brahmanical status. That means he engaged in activities by which he became learned, he became self-controlled, he became peaceful, he became a tapasvi, he became very tolerant, he acquired all those qualities by practicing brahmacharya, and then he also became the rishi, brahmarshi, that is one who has achieved some perfection by spiritual advancement. So that is Bhishma Deva's position as a brahmarshi. So to see this brahmarshi, not only because he was a brahmarshi, but because he was the greatest among the uh his transcendentalists of his time, because of his devotion to Krishna, he was among the greatest of transcendentalists. So all great souls came to see that now Bhishma is going to quit his body, how is he going to quit? Srila Prabhupada further clarifies, all rishis are situated in the quality of goodness. In this material world, there are three qualities that are working: goodness, passion, ignorance, or sattva guna, rajoguna, and tamoguna. Of these three qualities, goodness or sattva guna is the best.

**Summary:** The lecture begins to explain about Parvatamuni and his association with Narada, highlighting their ability to travel without material vehicles through yogic siddhis.

So, so many sages assembled there in order to see the passing away of a great soul. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada has explained about some of the sages. He begins by explaining the sage Parvatamuni. He says, Parvatamuni is considered to be one of the oldest sages. He is almost always a constant companion of Naradamuni. Naradamuni and Parvatamuni always travel together, generally. They are also spacemen competent to travel in the air without the help of any material vehicle. So, this science is unknown to the modern man, but about 50 years back, let us say there used to be yogis who would travel from one place to another without the help of a machine. Yogis can travel through the Ganga river. Let us say they are in Haridwar and they want to come to Prayag. So, they take a dip in the Ganga in Haridwar and they come out of the Ganga in Prayag. So, this is a Siddhi, a perfection. And those who are very strict Ashtanga Yogis, when they perfect their Ashtanga Yoga meditation, they are able to actually utilize the Siddhis for their travel. So, one of the Siddhis is they travel through the Ganga river. And so, they travel through a ray of sun. They travel without a machine by simply deciding to go from one place to another. So, like this both Parvatamuni and Naradamuni are able to travel without the help of any material vehicle.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Parvatamuni and Narada's presence at Janamejaya's snake sacrifice and the reasons behind it.

Parvatamuni is also a Devashi or a great sage amongst the Demigods like Narada. Narada is also a devarshi. So it is described here, Parvata Muni was present along with Narada at the sacrificial ceremony of Maharaj Janmejaya, a son of Maharaj Parikshit. After Parikshit, Janmejaya took charge of ruling the world, and Janmejaya once decided to perform a sacrifice, a big sacrifice for which he invited Narada as well as Parvata Muni. In this sacrifice, all the snakes of the world were to be killed. Janmejaya was angry that his father was killed by a snake bird, so he decided to kill all the snakes of the world, but this sacrifice was stopped by uh some mature sages instructing this Janmejaya, don't annihilate the entire race of snakes. No, that is not proper just because one snake somehow bit your father and your father died, it does not mean that you kill all other snakes. So on the advice of the saintly persons, he stopped the sacrifice.

**Key Quote:** "Like Narada Muni, Parvatha Muni used to visit the royal assembly in the heaven of King Indra."
**Summary:** The lecture continues describing Parvatamuni and Narada as Gandharvas, their ability to travel in the air, and their visits to the assemblies of Indra and Kuvera.

So Parvata Muni and Narada Muni are called gandharvas also because they can travel in the air singing the glories of the Lord. Devotees generally sing the glories of the Lord everywhere. So Parvata Muni, Narada Muni, while they are traveling, they are also singing the glories of the Supreme Lord Krishna. So yeah, okay. Since they can travel in the air, they observe Draupadi's Swayamvara ceremony from the air. They didn't have to land on the earth, no. From the air itself, they saw the ceremony, marriage ceremony of Draupadi. It's actually called the Swayamvara ceremony where she selects her own husband. Like Narada Muni, Parvatha Muni used to visit the royal assembly in the heaven of King Indra. So Indra receives great saintly persons and he takes advice from them. So both Parvatha Muni and Narada Muni were regularly visiting Indra. As a Gandharva, sometimes he visited the royal assembly. In the royal assembly of Kuvera, one of the important demigods. Kuvera is the treasurer of the demigods and Kuvera has got a very important position. So the... , Kuvera's assembly, sometimes both of them used to visit. So this is the brief description of Parvatha Muni. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

Now the sage bradashwa is being described by the sages as an introduction to the top in the purport, an ancient sage who used to meet maharan yudhishthiram now and then. In the vedic times, kings who were ruling would receive saintly persons very respectfully and would worship them, inquire from them, hear from them, and take their blessings to rule the kingdom according to the religious principles.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the sage Bradashwa's visits to Yudhishthira and the importance of hearing stories of great personalities for inspiration and guidance, especially during times of exile.

So bradashwa, a great sage, used to visit maharan yudhishthiram now and then. First of all, he met king, this sage narrated the history of maharaj. When yudhishthira and the pandavas were in exile, they were always accompanied by some sages, and the sages used to give association by narrating ancient histories of great personalities. Simply by hearing, they would be able to understand the history of maharaj, and they would be able to actually get inspiration, get the courage to spend their time in the proper manner. Otherwise, what will they do in the forest? They are all kings, they are all chakras. So for a kshatriya to live in the forest and spend time for the past 13 years, the pandavas had to be in exile. So how they spend their time? So the process of bhakti is such that one engages in hearing, chanting, and other such devotional practices in the association of great saintly persons, great devotees, great sages, great rishis like that.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Maharaj Nara, emphasizing his devotion and success despite difficulties, and connects it to the importance of self-realization to escape the miseries of the material world.

So, this sage narrated the history of Maharaj Nara. Nara was another king who lived in an earlier time than the time of the Pandavas, and Nara also underwent a lot of difficulties. But because of his being very much devoted to following religious principles, he was able to actually come out successful, even though he was facing a lot of difficulties. The material world is declared to be a place filled with so many difficulties. That's the nature of this material world. So, if we are fixed on the goal of self-realization, because of which we become qualified to go to the spiritual world at the end of this life, then we don't have to anymore face these miseries or difficulties by taking birth again and again in this place, which is declared to be a place filled with miseries. So, by spending time hearing from saintly persons about great personalities of the past, how they led their life in an ideal way, following the religious principles, taking association from saintly persons, and not losing their focus on the ultimate goal in spite of difficult circumstances. That is what we have to learn from Nara.

That is what we have to learn from these historical narrations. Then Bharadwaja, he is one of the great seven rishis, saptarishis, and was present at the time of the birth ceremony of Arjuna. The powerful rishi sometimes undertook severe penances on the shore of the Ganges, and his ashrama is still celebrated Prayamdhama. The Bhagavatam says, becoming man after acquired power and terrorizing the whole universe, no, not that kind of austerity. That is austerity in the mode of ignorance. We should practice austerity in the moment goodness. Goodness means the ultimate goal of all such austerities or any sacrifices or any other spiritual practices simply for the sake of spiritual advancement by which our existence becomes purified of all material contamination, making us eligible to actually elevate ourselves to the spiritual platform to go back.

**Summary:** The speaker continues describing Bharadwaja, mentioning the unusual birth of his son Dhona and Bharadwaja's desire for peace during the Kurukshetra war.

It is learned that this rishi, while taking bath in the Ganges, happened to meet one of the beautiful society girls of heaven, and thus the discharge semen, which is kept and preserved in an urban pot and from which dhona was born. These are all extraordinary events in the lives of great sages, that in spite of not combining with this society girl so that the rishi could conceive his son in her womb, his semen was kept in a pot from which dhona was born. So dhronacharya is the son of bharadvaja muni. Marshi bharadvaja was a great devotee of dhronacharya, and he was a great devotee of brahma. Once he approached dhronacharya and requested him to stop the battle of kurut ship. Now, ultimately people want peace. They don't want to be engaged in fighting and battle and war. So in that sense, these are all great personalities who are situated in the mode of goodness.

So naturally, they strive for peace. Next is the description of parashurama. He is also called as renuka sutta. Why? Because he is the son of maharshi javadadmi and srimati renuka.

Parashurama instructed the dhanu veda on the science of fighting to dronacharya, who was a brahmana.

Bhishma refused to obey his order, although he was one of the spiritual masters of bhishma deva. Parashurama was a spiritual master, a teacher of bhishma deva. Parashurama fought with bhishma when bhishma neglected his warning. Both of them fought very severely, and at last, parashurama was pleased with bhishma and gave him the divine blessing.

**Summary:** Description of Shukadeva Goswami's travels and attainment of the transcendental realm, followed by an explanation of the Prajapatis' power to generate different species.

Shukadeva Goswami went to the sun planet, with the permission of his father and Narayanji. Descriptions of his travel and space are given in the Shanti Parva of the Mahabharata. Mahabharata is generally understood as containing the narration of the Pandavas and Kauravas, but it contains much much more than that. It is the history of Greater India, Mahabharata. At last, Shukadeva Goswami attained the transcendental realm. He is known by different names, like Araneya, Aranesuta, Vyasaki, and Asatmaja. These are some of the other names of Shukadeva Goswami. Next, Srila Prabhupada describes Tashya Pamuni, one of the Prajapati, the son of Marichi, and one of the sons-in-law of Prajapati Daksha. Kashyapa Pamuni married many daughters of Daksha. Kashyapa Pamuni is the father of the gigantic bird Garuda, who was given elephants and tortoise as eatables. Garuda is the son of Kashyapa Pamuni. Now, how is it possible that a bird can be the son of a Rishi, Kashyapa Pamuni? This is the power of the Prajapatis at the time of the beginning of the creation, at the time of the beginning of the creation of this Universe. Brahma takes birth from Vishnu, Garbhodakshayi Vishnu, and Brahma is empowered to create the Prajapatis. So when the Prajapatis have to further increase the population in different species, they are empowered to generate the different species.

So it's only by being empowered specifically to generate a specific species that the Prajapatis can give birth, can generate different species of living beings. Kashyapa Pamuni married thirteen daughters of Prajapati Daksha and their names are given in the Bhagavad Gita: Aditi, Diti, Dhanu, Kashtha, Arishta, Surasa, Ila, Muni, Prothashwa, Tamra, Surabhi, Sarama, and Kini. He begot many children, both demigods and demons by those wives. Generally the sons of Aditi are called Adityas and the sons of Diti are called Daityas. Daityas are generally demons and Adityas are demigods. From his first wife Aditi all the twelve Adityas were born and one of the Adityas is Vamana, the incarnation of God. This great sage Kashyapa was also presented at the time of Arjuna's birth. Now Arjuna's birth is extraordinary, it's not ordinary because Arjuna is the constant companion of Krishna. So when Krishna appeared as the sage Narayana, Arjuna appeared as his twin brother Nara, Nararishi. So Nara Narayana Rishi are twins,

So they are teaching by their example, Nara Narayana Rishi. So like this, Arjuna's birth is not ordinary.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the context of the verse, describing Bhishma Deva's impending departure from the body in the presence of Krishna and the assembled Rishis.

So the background for this verse is Bhishma is above the Buddhist body and the Pandavas have come to meet Bhishma Deva to receive instructions from him, especially Yudhishthira, and Krishna has also accompanied the Pandavas, and all the great Rishis from all over the world, all over the universe, they have arrived there. Why? Because a great soul is going to quit his body. Bhishma Deva is one of the twelve Mahajanas, so this quitting the body in the right consciousness is the perfection of one's life. This is what Lord Krishna describes in the Bhagavad Gita: Antakaale Chamam eva Smaran Muktva Kalevaram Yaprayati Samadbhavam Yati Nargajya Samushayaham. Krishna says, "Whoever quits his body remembering me alone attains to my nature." And we will see in this chapter of Bhagavatam, Bhishma Deva is going to quit his body thinking of Krishna, glorifying Krishna, and it is Bhishma's good fortune that Krishna is right in front of him. But still, Bhishma Deva received all the great sages who had come at that time, so he received and welcomed all the great and powerful Rishis because he knew perfectly the religious principles according to time and place.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the third part, expert religionists know perfectly well how to adjust religious principles in terms of time and place. According to time and place some adjustments have to be made. The religious principles are given very elaborately in the dharma shastras, but some adjustment has to be made according to time and place, and Bhishma Deva knew all the principles and therefore he is able to properly receive the great and powerful rishis. Srila Prabhupada says all the great acharyas or religious preachers or reformers of the world executed their mission by adjustment of religious principles in terms of time and place. Just like Srila Prabhupada himself, he went to the western countries and introduced Krishna consciousness among those who are not very familiar with the very culture, though he did not change any essential fundamental principle, but he adapted according to the time and place circumstances. So the acharyas know how to make adjustment of religious principles in terms of time and place. Even in the past Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, all of them made adjustment of religious principles according to time and place. There are different climates and situations in different parts of the world, and if one has to discharge his duties to preach the message of the Lord, he must be expert in adjusting things in terms of time and place.

Bhishma Deva is also one of the twelve mahajanas, so he perfectly knew all the religious principles and he could make adjustments according to time and place, so therefore he could receive and welcome all the powerful sages assembled there at his death bed from all parts of the universe.

### Bhishma Deva, benediction, auspicious time, devotees, liberation

**Key Quote:** "Bhishma Deva as a pure devotee he need not choose an auspicious time for quitting the body neither he has to choose an auspicious place because he is a pure devotee he is guaranteed to go back to Godhead"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Bhishma Deva's benediction to choose the time of his death and contrasts the importance of auspicious timing for non-devotees versus the guaranteed liberation of devotees regardless of time or place of death.

He had a benediction from his father that he could quit the body whenever he desired to by choosing an auspicious moment. That's the sense in which that particular benediction was used because in the eighth chapter of the Bhagavatam Bhishma describes different auspicious and inauspicious times which are applicable for quitting the body. If somebody quits the body at an auspicious time they are able to get out of this material existence and get liberation beyond this material existence. If they quit at an inauspicious time then they cannot go out of this material world letting rebirth again, but that is only applicable to non-devotees. Why? Because devotees whenever they quit their body it doesn't matter because they are Krishna conscious. Whenever they quit their body they are definitely going back to Godhead, they are getting ultimate liberation whenever they quit their body wherever they quit their body it doesn't matter time and place.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing that Bhishma Deva, despite being a pure devotee, waited for an auspicious moment to depart, setting an example for others, and ultimately achieved liberation by focusing on Krishna at the time of death.

So Bhishma Deva as a pure devotee he need not choose an auspicious time for quitting the body, neither he has to choose an auspicious place because he is a pure devotee, he is guaranteed to go back to Godhead, he is already liberated because he is a pure devotee, but still in order to teach others because he was an expert yogi, so he was waiting for the most auspicious moment to quit his body and the great sages knew that Bhishma is an authority in Dharma so they all assembled to witness Bhishma quitting his body at the most auspicious time, Uttarayana Punyakala. But Bhagavatam also describes in this very chapter that Bhishma Deva he quit his body in the presence of Krishna glorifying Krishna fixing his complete attention on Krishna at the time of his death, so both ways Bhishma Deva was successful in quitting his body to attain ultimate liberation. I will stop here.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "These two scriptures are very important and enough for understanding the codes of the Supreme Lord Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verses to be discussed (SB 1.17.12-13), explains the importance of Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam for understanding Krishna's codes, especially for leaders.

In this session, we are discussing two verses, the twelfth and the thirteenth verses of the Bhagavad Gita, of the seventeenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Ko avrishchat tavapadam strin Saurabheya chatushpada Mabhuvams tvadrisha rashtre Raghnam krishnanu vartinam. The meaning of this twelfth verse is: He, Maharaj Parikshit, repeatedly addressed and questioned the bull, 'O son! O son of Surabhi, who has cut off your three legs? In the state of the kings who are obedient to the laws of the Supreme Personality of God Krishna, there is no one as unhappy as you.' So Parikshit was very pained to see the condition of the bull suffering, because it had lost three of its legs, somehow wobbling along on one leg. So he is questioning, who has done this? Purport, by Srila Prabhupada, Prabhupada says in the purport, 'The kings or the executive heads of all states must know the codes of Lord Krishna.' And the codes of Lord Krishna generally mean the Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam. Two scriptures are enough. Though there are varieties of scriptures, many, many, many scriptures, but for the present age of Kali Yuga, these two scriptures are very important and enough for understanding the codes of the Supreme Lord Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "To make an end to all miseries of material conditions human life is a definite goal and a definite purpose as described in scriptures."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam are Krishna Katha and discusses the mission of human life, which is to end the miseries of birth, death, old age, and disease (janma, mrityu, jara, vyadhi).

The Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavad... They are both described by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu as Krishna Katha. Bhagavad Gita is Krishna Katha spoken by Krishna himself. Devotees, so these are two scriptures which are very important, so the king or the executive head must act accordingly in order to fulfill the mission of human life. What is that mission of human life? Which is to make an end to all miseries of material conditions. Human life is a definite goal and a definite purpose as described in scriptures, that we should put an end to all miseries of material existence. And Bhagavad-Gita summarizes these miseries under four headings: janma, mrityu, jara, vyadhi. Janma means the misery of birth, taking birth in this material world. Mrityu means death, the misery of death. And jara means the misery of old age, invalidity due to old age. Old age doesn't mean just having some wrinkled skin or some general weakness, no, it means the invalidity and there are many symptoms of old age which are making life very, very difficult. And fourth one is vyadhi, vyadhi means disease.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the suffering within the mother's womb and reiterates that the mission of human life is to end these miseries by following the codes in Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam.

The construction of the body itself is such that there has to be these four miseries pertaining to the body we have acquired. It's after all in the mother's womb, the development of the body takes place beginning with a very, very, very tiny p-shaped small two particles, the sperm and the ovum combine to form that embryo and then it starts developing in the mother's womb and develops into a nice baby, baby boy or baby girl. Nine months in the mother's womb the development takes place. It's not at all, though it's the most conducive for the development of the body, for the child, the mother's womb is most conducive, but it is not at all pleasant and that's described in the Bhagavatam, third canto, what are the conditions inside the mother's womb which the child experiences in terms of suffering, acute pain, acute pain, that is a misery of birth. We all have gone through it but we forgot after coming out of the mother's womb, you forgot. So to put an end to these miseries is the mission of human life by following the codes given in the Bhagavad...

Gita and the Bhagavad. One who knows the codes of Lord Krishna can achieve this end without any difficulty. Perfect life, leading a perfect life is possible by following the instructions of the Bhagavad-Gita and Bhagavatam. In the Bhagavad-Gita in a synopsis we can understand the codes of Godhead and the Srimad-Bhagavatam the same codes are explained further. Many times Srila Prabhupada says, Bhagavad-Gita is the preliminary study of Bhagavatam or Bhagavatam is the elaborate description of the life full of Brahma. Such quotes are presented in the pages of Srimad Bhagavatam for the guidance of the blind persons who happen to be at the helm of all affairs. Kalau nashtat drishamesha puranarko adhunoditaha. Bhagavatam, it is said, in Kali Yuga people have lost the vision of the goal of human life because of the dense darkness due to the influence of Kali and this darkness is dissipated by the Srimad Bhagavatam which is the horizon like the sun at the beginning of Kali Yuga to give direction to all those people who have lost the direction for the...

Making progress in human life. The 13th verse, aakhya hi vrishabhadram vaha sadhunam akrita agasam, atma vairupya kartaram parthanam kirti dusanam.

Please tell me of the perpetrator of these mutilations, which blackmailed you and made you feel the reputation of the sons of Pritha, kirti dusanam.' So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, 'The reputation of the reign of Maharaja Ramachandra and that of the kings who followed in the footsteps of Maharaja Ramachandra, like the Pandavas and their descendants are never to be forgotten because in their kingdom, offenseless and honest living beings were never in trouble.'

**Key Quote:** "They are facts, historical facts, cent percent true."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the ideal rule of Ramachandra and Yudhishthira, emphasizing the correlation between Dharma and good governance, and asserting that scriptures like Ramayana and Mahabharata are historical facts, not mythology.

Ramaraja, you have heard of Ramaraja? So when Rama was ruling, everybody was happy. People were getting all their necessities in plenty. When Yudhishthira was ruling also, that was the situation. So there is a correlation between the way a king governs the state or the kingdom and the codes of Dharma given in the scriptures, there is a correlation. Exactly according to the Dharma Shastra, the Samadhi rules, there is peace, prosperity, plenty of supply, and people will be able to live very nicely. And these are described in the authorized scriptures. How people were living during Maharaja Yudhishthira's time is described in the Mahabharata. How people were living during Ramachandra's time is described in the Ramayana. So you should read that. And they are not just stories. They are not fiction stories. They are facts. That also people do not know. They use the term mythology to describe Ramayana, Mahabharata, our ancient scriptures. But mythology means something which is false, myth, just imaginary, which is not true. But that is a wrong description of Mahabharata, Ramayana, the Puranas. Mythology is wrong.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the importance of scriptures compiled by sages and emphasizes that the bull and cow are symbols of offenselessness, and even their stool and urine are beneficial.

They are facts, historical facts, cent percent true. Great sages performed severe tapasya in order to compile these literatures for the perfect... For giving perfect direction to people in general. So they did... They had no business writing fiction stories. They simply documented the facts and figures and the principles perfectly without any trace of any mistake in these scriptures. That is the standard of these scriptures. They say Shastra. The bull and the cow are the symbols of the most offenseless living beings. The bull and the cow completely offenseless. And the value of these animals Prabhupada explains is that even the stool and urine of these animals are utilized to benefit human society. No other animal stool except the cow is useful for human society. Even the human being's stool also is not useful. But the cows, cow dung, gober, gomedhya. So that is very, very valuable.

**Key Quote:** "The ignorance about Dharma Shastra is a very, very serious lacuna in modern society."
**Summary:** The speaker continues discussing the value of cows, the importance of protecting animals for maintaining a king's reputation, and criticizes modern leaders for their ignorance of Dharma Shastra, emphasizing the need for knowledge from liberated souls.

How many ways it can be used. Nowadays, of course, people do not know so much. But if you go to some villages even now, multiple ways they use this cow dung and cow urine. So, if the stool and the urine are also useful for human society, how valuable are these animals for human society? You can only imagine. The descendants of the sons of Pritha, like Maharaj Parikh, are afraid of losing their reputation when the animals are not protected. They don't think they will be able to retain the reputation of giving proper protection to the Praja. But in modern days, the leaders are not even afraid of killing such offenseless animals. So, therefore, Prabhupada says, 'Herein lies the difference between the reign of pious kings and the modern states ruled by irresponsible executive heads without knowledge of the codes of conduct.' The ignorance about Dharma Shastra is a very, very serious lacuna in modern society. So, they can only rule properly if they have proper knowledge. And this knowledge should be based on taking the knowledge from the perfect source, not imperfect theories or speculations given by conditioned souls. No. You take knowledge from liberated souls. So, I'll stop here.

By curbing dishonest miscreants, one automatically benefits the offenseless. These are words spoken by Parikshit Maharaj, and he is addressing the bull dharma in the shape of the bow.

**Key Quote:** "Dishonest miscreants flourish because of cowardly and impotent executive heads of state. This is the present situation."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's purport, discussing the degraded state of leadership in Kali Yuga, where unqualified and sinful leaders fail to protect the innocent and curb miscreants.

So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains: Dishonest miscreants flourish because of cowardly and impotent executive heads of state. This is the present situation. As Kali Yuga progresses, there will be no qualified Kshatriyas, no qualified Brahmanas, except for the devotees, who are anyway most qualified persons in the entire world. Other than devotees, who will also be not so many in number, there will be few devotees, but the majority of the population, as Kali Yuga progresses, will be people who are sinful, people who are ignorant about who they are, about what is this world, about who is God, people who are full of desires for material enjoyment. So then, among such people, some person who can garner some votes or get some popularity will somehow become the executive head of the state, and they will not be sufficiently strong or powerful to curb the miscreants because they themselves will be miscreants mostly. And because they are themselves miscreants, they won't really protect the innocent, the honest, the weaker sections.

**Key Quote:** "When the miscreants are punished in an exemplary manner, automatically all good fortune follows."
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the importance of strong and qualified leadership that can effectively punish miscreants, deter others, and protect peaceful citizens, highlighting the prime duty of the executive head of state.

They won't do that. But Srila Prabhupada says further, when the executive heads are strong enough to curb all sorts of dishonest miscreants in any part of the state, certainly they cannot flourish. So if there is a strong person as the head of the state who is qualified, then he can easily curb all dishonest miscreants. And further, Srila Prabhupada says a very important point: When the miscreants are punished in an exemplary manner, automatically all good fortune follows. The punishment given should be appropriate for the mischief performed by the dishonest miscreant. It should be a suitable punishment which will deter the other miscreants. So that is called punishing in an exemplary manner. It will send a proper signal to all the other miscreants that better stop your nefarious activities, otherwise you are going to be severely punished. As said before, Srila Prabhupada is further explaining, it is the prime duty of the king or the executive head to give protection in all respects to the peaceful, offenseless citizens of the state. It is a prime duty to be in a position of responsibility means to actually carry out one's duties properly, being equipped with the right qualifications, being equipped with the right knowledge, and the right support of the able assistance. So that is required. All these are required.

**Key Quote:** "Sankirtana Yajna is the most recommended process for cleansing the hearts of the people in general."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the role of devotees as peaceful citizens and the importance of preaching Krishna Consciousness through Sankirtana to purify the hearts of the people and create a peaceful society.

The devotees of the Lord are by nature peaceful and offenseless, and therefore it is the prime duty of the state to arrange to convert everyone to become a devotee of the Lord. So how is it possible for a king or an executive head of state to actually rule properly for the citizens? There should be a program to preach Krishna Consciousness, by which the material contamination in the hearts of the people in general will be cleansed. Like Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says about Sankirtana, what is he saying? Chetodarpana marjanam. The first effect of Sankirtana, public Sankirtana, is that the heart of the public, simply if the holy name falls on their ears, whether they hear it willingly or unwillingly, knowingly or unknowingly, anyhow it will work, it will act, it will purify their heart. Of course it's a gradual process, it takes time, but the purification begins as soon as the holy name, the vibration of the holy name enters their ears. So this is the primary program in the present age. Yajnai Sankirtana Prayi Riyajantihi Sumedha Saha. Sankirtana Yajna. Sankirtana Yajna is the most recommended process for cleansing the hearts of the people in general.

**Key Quote:** "In spite of this program, Sankirtana program, some demoniac natured persons will not mend themselves. They will have to be punished by the able administrator king."
**Summary:** The lecture explains how people become contaminated by bad association and the influence of Rajoguna and Tamoguna, leading to lust and greed, and reiterates the need for punishment for those who do not reform despite the Sankirtana program.

Thus automatically there will be peaceful, offenseless citizens. There has to be some program because people are contaminated or polluted in their heart by association with other spirits, other sinful people, bad association. By association with the gunas, which are particularly in Kali Yuga, Rajoguna and Tamoguna is very prominent. So people become polluted in their consciousness with this Rajoguna and Tamoguna. Rajoguna and Tamoguna effect is mostly lust and greed. Very lust and greed will dominate in the hearts of so many people. So they will be unable to control their senses, control their mind, and they will act in so many sinful ways, being forced to actually endeavor to satisfy their lusty desires, satisfy their greed, satisfy their crazy material desires like that. Then the only duty of the king will be to curb the dishonest miscreants. In spite of this program, Sankirtana program, some demoniac natured persons will not mend themselves. They will not correct themselves. They will have to be punished by the able administrator king. That will bring about peace and harmony all over the human society.

**Key Quote:** "An upstart living being who commits offenses by torturing those who are offenseless shall be directly uprooted by me even though he be a denizen of heaven with armor and decorations."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains verse 15, focusing on the idea that even beings from higher planets are subject to justice if they commit offenses, and discusses the relative immortality of heavenly beings.

So Prabhupada has outlined a very clear method for the executive head of state to curb these miscreants. The 15th verse. The meaning of this 15th verse: An upstart living being who commits offenses by torturing those who are offenseless shall be directly uprooted by me even though he be a denizen of heaven with armor and decorations. So Parikshit Maharaj is warning the miscreants, even if they are persons from the upper planets, still they cannot create any nuisance or any mischief on this earth planet as long as Parikshit is ruling. They are very, very powerful and capable and qualified and conscientious. So in the Purport, Shlap Prabhupada says the denizens of the heavenly kingdom are called Amar or deathless due to their possessing a long span of life. Actually they are not deathless in terms of the body they have, material body they have, but they are like deathless because of the long span of life they have, far greater than that of the human beings. For a human being who has only a maximum 100 year duration of life, a span of life spreading over millions of years is certainly considered to be deathless. So it is relative. It is not exactly deathless. It is relative.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This means that the state executive head must be as strong as Maharaj Pariksit so that he may be determined to punish the strongest offenders."
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes that even denizens of heaven are not exempt from punishment if they violate divine law, and the executive head of state must be strong and impartial in administering justice.

Relatively very long life span. For example, Prabhupada gives the example from the Bhagavad Gita. We learn that on the Brahmaloka planet, the duration of one day is calculated to be 4,300,000 times 1,000 solar years, 12 hours of Brahma's time scale. The top most planet in this universe is some 4 billion years. 4 billion years is 12 hours of Brahma. Similarly, in other heavenly planets, one day is calculated to be 6 months on this planet, and the inhabitants get a life of 10 million of their years. Therefore, in all higher planets, since the span of life is far greater than that of the human being, the denizens are called deathless by imagination. See, this is an important point. Although actually no one within the material universe is deathless. Ultimately Brahma also has to die. Everyone has to die. Die means they have to give up the present material body. Now Maharaj Pariksit challenges even such denizens of heaven if they torture the offenseless. He says even if somebody is a resident of a higher planet, I don't care for your position or power. This means that the state executive head must be as strong as Maharaj Pariksit, so that he may be determined to punish the strongest offenders. It should be the principle of a state executive head that the offender of the codes of God is always punished. There is no discrimination when somebody is committing an offence. There is no discrimination as to who that person is. Whatever be his position, if he is an offender, he has to be punished.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of discussion: verses 16 and 17 of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on how Parikshit Maharaj dealt with Kali Yuga and how individuals can protect themselves from its negative influences by leading a pious life.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudhirayet. In this session, we are discussing from the 16th and the 17th verses of the 17th chapter, chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The title of the 17th chapter is Punishment and Reward of Kali. How the Kali Yuga, the Kali Purusha, the personality who is the personification of this age, Kali Yuga, of this period, how he is dealt with by Parikshit Maharaj when Kali Yuga is about to begin. He is trying to enter Parikshit's kingdom when Dwapar Yuga is ending and the Kali Yuga is going to begin, and how he is dealt with, that is very, very instructive for all of us. It gives us a clue why is it important for us. It gives us a clue as to how we can protect ourselves against the evil influence of Kali, this age, this time, this atmosphere, the prevailing external conditions, the bad influence. How can we protect ourselves, provided of course pious people want to lead a life free from sinful activities, want to lead an honest life, a clean life, a pious life. Then how do they protect themselves against the evil influence?

**Key Quote:** "The supreme duty of the ruling king is to give all protection to law-abiding persons and to chastise those who stray from the ordinances of the scriptures in ordinary times when there is no emergency."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of the 16th verse, emphasizing the king's duty to protect those who follow religious principles and punish those who deviate, while also discussing the concept of 'apadharma' or occupational duty in times of emergency, using the example of Vishwamitra.

That is the reason why this is being discussed here. The 16th verse, Ragnyohi paramo dharma ha swadharma sthanu palanam shasato anyan yatha shasram anapadi utpathan iha. Let me read this. Okay. The meaning of this verse is, the supreme duty of the ruling king is to give all protection to law-abiding persons and to chastise those who stray from the ordinances of the scriptures in ordinary times when there is no emergency. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "In the scriptures, there is mention of apadharma or occupational duty at times of extraordinary happenings. It is said that sometimes the great sage Vishwamitra had to live on the flesh of dogs in some extraordinary dangerous position." Flesh-eating at normal circumstances is completely forbidden. Or if somebody, somehow or the other, because they are very much desirous of enjoying eating some flesh, animal food, animal flesh, then if they do so, then they are liable to be punished by the laws of God, the laws of nature, laws of karma. But under extreme circumstances, when there is no food available except for flesh, nothing else is available, then one may eat flesh just to survive.

**Key Quote:** "When plenty of fruits, vegetables, grains, milk is available, then why should people eat flesh?"
**Summary:** The lecture condemns unnecessary animal slaughter and flesh-eating, stating that it is sinful and punishable, especially when other food sources are readily available, emphasizing that one should not kill animals simply to satisfy the tongue.

That is called apadharma, emergency time. So, Srila Prabhupada says, "In cases of emergency, one may be allowed to live on the flesh of animals of all description. But that does not mean that there should be regular slaughterhouses to feed the animal eaters and that this system should be encouraged by the state, this is completely sinful. When plenty of fruits, vegetables, grains, milk is available, then why should people eat flesh? Why should they kill animals for getting the flesh?" So, that is very, very sinful and severely punishable. So, Srila Prabhupada says, "No one should try to live on flesh in ordinary time simply for the sake of the palate." Palate means simply for satisfying the tongue. Oh, I like to eat. No. Just because you like to eat, you cannot kill other animals. As much as you have a desire to live, you want to subsist in this particular, in this particular present body. Similarly, every living being has got the desire to live and should be allowed. Should not be, there should be no unnecessary killing of even an ant, even a small plant, no unnecessary killing. So, it is said here, Srila Prabhupada further, "If anyone does so, it means they simply kill animals for the sake of satisfying their tongue. The king or the executive head should punish him for gross enjoyment."

**Key Quote:** "The state executive head is to see that such Swadharma is not changed by the follower, whatever it may be, and he should be given all protection."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the concept of 'Swadharma' or prescribed duty according to one's nature, referencing Bhagavad Gita 18.48, and emphasizes that the state should protect individuals in following their prescribed duties, which should not be violated except in emergencies.

There are regular scriptural injunctions for different persons engaged in different occupational duties, and one who follows them is called Swadharmastha or faithful in one's prescribed duties. Everybody has got a prescribed duty given in the scriptures. Hmm. In the Bhagavad Gita, 18.48, it is advised that one should not give up his occupational prescribed duties even if they are not always flawless. Swadharma, what is prescribed for you according to your acquired nature, according to your nature. Hmm. You have to perform a certain type of occupational duty to maintain yourself. Such Swadharma might be violated in case of emergency, but not in normal circumstances should you violate. If one is forced by circumstances, one may violate, but they cannot be violated in ordinary times. The state executive head is to see that such Swadharma is not changed by the follower, whatever it may be, and he should be given all protection. The follower of the Swadharma should be given all protection by the king.

**Key Quote:** "The duty of the king is to see that everyone strictly follows his occupational duty as prescribed in the scriptures."
**Summary:** The lecture explains that violators of Swadharma are subject to punishment according to the scriptures, drawing an analogy to civil and criminal laws to illustrate the different levels of transgression and the corresponding consequences, emphasizing that Shastras are perfect and given by the Supreme Lord.

The violator is subject to punishment in terms of the Shastra. Now what punishment who should get according to the particular violation. Hmm. Just like in ordinary law, there are civil laws and criminal laws. Civil laws is for some minor transgression, transgression of some particular rule or law of the land. Hmm. Just like somebody is driving, they are just exceeding the speed limit. So that's not a very serious violation of the road rules or the law of the road driving, driving laws. So such a person may be just, he may be just warned or he may be just given some small fine. He has to pay. That's all. But somebody is driving rashly and killing another person or bringing about severe accident, severe damages, then such a person is subject to criminal code of conduct. Criminal laws are applicable in such cases. So, there is a difference depending on the kind of violation. The duty of the king is to see that everyone strictly follows his occupational duty as prescribed in the scriptures. Shastras should be the basis, perfect. They are perfect in all respects. They are not made by some human beings with defects. Shastras are given by the Supreme Lord and further elaborated upon by liberated souls, saintly persons who are liberated personalities.

The 17th verse, dharmavacha, because Pariksit was speaking to dharma, to the personality of religion. So dharma is now responding to Pariksit Maharaj. etad vaha pandavayanam yuktam aartabhayam vachaha yesam gunaganai krishno dhautyadau bhagavan krutah. The meaning of this verse is the personality of religion said, he is replying to Pariksit Maharaj. These words just spoken by you, befit a person of the Pandava dynasty. Captivated by the devotional qualities of the Pandavas, even Lord Krishna, the personality of Godhead, performed duties as a messenger. Something wonderful.

**Key Quote:** "He was not falsely proud for a devotee of the Lord is equally as powerful as the Lord or sometimes more powerful by the Lord's grace."
**Summary:** The lecture explains that Parikshit Maharaj's assurances are not exaggerations but reflect his real power as a devotee of the Lord, emphasizing that devotees can be as powerful as or even more powerful than the Lord by His grace.

Dharma is telling about Pariksit Maharaj. He is glorifying Pariksit Maharaj. So in the Purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The assurances and challenges made by Maharaj Pariksit are never exaggerations of his real power." He is speaking, I will punish anybody who violates. I don't care even if that person who is violating is a denizen of the heaven. I don't care. So these words are befitting his actual position, and they are not simply some exaggerations. The Maharaja said that even the denizens of heaven could not escape his stringent garment if they are violators of religious principles. He is a strict ruler, and he has the power to rule and enforce the law of the scriptures, the rules and regulations and laws of the scriptures, even upon the devatas, even upon superior beings. He was not falsely proud, for a devotee of the Lord is equally as powerful as the Lord or sometimes more powerful by the Lord's grace. And any promise made by a devotee, though it may be ordinarily very difficult to fulfill, is properly executed by the grace of the Lord. You see, that's the position of a devotee. Pariksit Maharaj is a pure devotee of the Lord, so he has got extraordinary power. Nobody else can have it. Not even devatas can have as much power as Pariksit has, because Pariksit is a pure devotee.

**Key Quote:** "Pandavas, by their unalloyed devotional service, made it possible for the Lord to become a chariot driver or sometimes their letter messenger."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on how the Pandavas' pure devotional service allowed Krishna to become their servant, acting as a chariot driver and messenger, highlighting the Lord's desire to serve His unalloyed devotees.

So further, Srila Prabhupada says, "Pandavas, by their unalloyed devotional service, unalloyed devotional service, pure devotional service, and full surrender to the Supreme Lord, made it possible for the Lord to become a chariot driver or sometimes their letter messenger." See, Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, worshipable by everyone, including the devotees, everyone is subservient to Krishna and Krishna is supremely powerful, unlimitedly powerful. But that Krishna, being captivated by the Pandavas' wonderful qualities, devotional qualities, he became their servant. Voluntarily, he became their servant. He became the chariot driver of Arjuna in the battle of Kurukshetra. He became the messenger of Yudhishthira. He carried a message, a peace message on behalf of Yudhishthira to Duryodhana. Toward the war, the battle of Kurukshetra, before the war was actually fought, Yudhishthira wanted to avert this big world war. So Krishna personally carried this message from Yudhishthira to Duryodhana, personally went. So he was a letter messenger of Yudhishthira. Such duties executed by the Lord for his devotee are always very pleasing to the Lord because the Lord wants to render service to his unalloyed devotee whose life has no other engagement than to serve the Lord with full love and devotion. The devotee wants to serve the Lord unconditionally. The Lord wants to serve his devotees also without any hesitation, without any consideration that he is the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "So when Pariksit makes an assurance, it is always backed up by the special protection of the Supreme Lord Himself."
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by reiterating that Parikshit Maharaj, as a pure devotee like his grandfather Arjuna, was always protected by Krishna, even from the womb, and that his assurances are backed by the Lord's special protection, ending with gratitude and the Hare Krishna mantra.

Maharaj Pariksit, the grandson of Arjuna, the celebrated friendly servitor of the Lord, was a pure devotee of the Lord, like his grandfather. Who is his grandfather? Arjuna. Pariksit is the grandson of Arjuna. Arjuna's son was Abhimanyu. Abhimanyu's son was Pariksit. So Pariksit was also a pure devotee like Arjuna. Therefore the Lord was always with him even from the time when he was helplessly lying in the womb of his mother and was attacked by the blazing Brahmastra weapon of Ashwathama. This is the history of Pariksit. We discussed this earlier. He was saved in his mother's womb when he was an infant, not even an infant. He was not even born, not even come out of the mother's womb. He was protected by Krishna because he was a devotee. So when Pariksit makes an assurance, it is always backed up by the special protection of the Supreme Lord Himself. So the personality of religion, Dharma, accepted this fact and thanked the King for his being true to his exalted position. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

of theoretical philosophers. So what does this mean? It's difficult to ascertain the actual cause of our suffering, because so many different theories exist. There are many theoretical philosophers in the world who put forward their own theories of cause and effect, especially about the cause of suffering and its effect on different living beings. See, one thing is very common among all of us. What is the cause of suffering? All living beings, all human beings at least, nobody wants suffering. Everybody wants to enjoy without any suffering. But even if somebody does not want suffering, there is suffering in this world which practically everybody has to go through to different degrees, of course. Not that everyone is suffering. Not that everyone suffers the same extent. But suffering is definitely there in this world. This is the truth about material existences. Material existence means there will be suffering.

**Key Quote:** "Generally, there are six great philosophers."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the six great Vedic philosophers and their respective philosophies: Kanada, Gautama, Patanjali, Kapila, Jaimini, and Vyasa Deva.

So, what is the real cause of suffering and how to get rid of this suffering? That is the whole discussion that is now going to happen. So, Srila Prabhupada says about the statement of Dharma that there are many theoretical philosophers. Prabhupada says, "Generally, there are six great philosophers." Who are the six great philosophers? The first one is Kanada, the author of Vaisheshika philosophy. I will just briefly explain what these philosophies are. First, let me read this out in Prabhupada's purport. The first one is Kanada Rishi. He was a great sage in former times, Vedic times. He is the author of Vaisheshika philosophy. Then, there is the second one, the second sage, Rishi, Gautama Rishi, the author of Logic. Logic means Nyaya Shastra. The third one, the third great philosopher is Patanjali. You have heard this name very much. Patanjali Rishi, the author of mystic yoga. Mystic yoga means ashtanga yoga, hatha yoga. Then the fourth one, the fourth great philosopher is Kapila, the author of sankhya philosophy. This Kapila is nirishwara Kapila. In the Bhagavatam, there is a mention of Kapila who is the son of Devahuti, the incarnation of the Supreme Lord. The Kapila mentioned in this purport here among the six great philosophers is not that incarnation Kapila. This is another later Kapila in recent times, much after the ancient incarnation of the Supreme Lord Kapila. There is another Kapila, same name, and the philosophy is also the same name, sankhya philosophy, but the two are totally different. So, fourth one is nirishwara Kapila, the author of sankhya philosophy. Then the fifth one is Jaimini Rishi, the author of karma mimamsa philosophy. And the last one, the sixth one is Vyasa Deva, our Vyasa, the author of Bhagavatam, the author of Vedanta Sutra, the one who compiled all the Vedas. He has given us what is called as Vedanta philosophy, Vedanta Darshana. So, six philosophers.

**Key Quote:** "without the sanction of the lord no one could inflict trouble upon them"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that even though Kali Purusha is the immediate cause of suffering, ultimately everything happens with the sanction of the Lord, and devotees understand this principle.

Six philosophies, and I will try to briefly mention what each of these philosophies are, though there is lot more explained by Prabhupad elsewhere about these philosophies, but briefly I will just mention. Let me complete this purport. Although the bull or the personality of religion and the cow, the personality of the earth, knew perfectly well that the personality of Kali was the direct cause of their sufferings, still, as devotees of the Lord, they knew well also that without the sanction of the Lord, no one could inflict trouble upon them. So, the analysis of who is the cause of my problem, if I am suffering, then who is the cause? So, there is a direct cause or the immediate cause. Now, in the case of the cow and the bull, Kali Purusha was actually beating the cow, was the immediate cause, but that immediate cause is not the only cause. So, in this world, there are always a series of causes and

**Summary:** Using the analogy of rainfall, the speaker illustrates the chain of cause and effect, emphasizing that even the actions of Kali Purusha are ultimately sanctioned by Paramatma.

effects for any happening. To give an example, if there is rainfall, the cause of the rainfall, immediate cause is the rain bearing cloud. The rain bearing cloud, ultimately, the cloud neighboring cloud is the Sun who evaporates water from the huge water bodies on this earth planet, and the clouds are formed which contain the water in a vapor state, water vapor. Evaporated water is there in the cloud form, and then that cloud which is gathered sufficient water vapor, it will condense, the vapor will become into water, and that water is poured down by the cloud at the appropriate time, like rainy season, to give an example. Now what is the cause of the Sun, the action of the Sun, or who or what is the cause? So like this, we can analyze a series of causes and defects, so here we should understand that the direct cause of the immediate cause is Kalipurusha. But as Prabhupada mentions, nothing in this world takes place if there is no sanction of the Paramatma seated in everyone's heart. So, without Paramatma's sanction, Kali Purusha cannot inflict suffering upon the cow or the bull. So, there is some role of Paramatma also who sanctions the Kali Purusha to inflict suffering upon the cow and the bull.

**Key Quote:** "The present trouble, if we are suffering now, is due to the fructifying of seedling sins."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that suffering is a result of past sinful activities (Papa Bija) that develop into Papa Phala, but pure devotional service can destroy these sinful seeds.

So, therefore, the bull is correctly, Dharma is correctly pointing out that it's not so easy to identify the exact cause of our suffering. And if we try to analyze all the different causes, then it is common. And it is complicated to analyze the various causes because there are different philosophers who tell there are different kinds of causes leading to a particular suffering. So, Srila Prabhupada says from the authoritative scriptures, according to the Padma Purana, which is the authentic scripture explaining these causes and effects, our process... The present trouble, if we are suffering now, is due to the fructifying of seedling sins. There is Papa Bija within our heart, everybody's heart. Everyone who has taken birth in this material world by force of karma has got in their heart what is called as Papa Bija, seedling sins. But even those seedling sins also gradually fade away by execution of pure devotional service. Anybody suffering is due to their own sinful activities performed in the past. And those sinful activities which they performed in the past resulted in Papa Bija being put in their heart. And that Papa Bija will gradually develop into Papa Phala. And that Papa Phala is what we experience as suffering. Different kinds of suffering depending on different kinds of Papa Phala. So, but somebody who performs pure devotional service... All the Papa Bijas are completely destroyed before they can fructify.

**Key Quote:** "Whatever a devotee suffers, he thinks, that by Krishna's mercy, the suffering is minimized."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how devotees tolerate suffering, understanding it as a minimized consequence of their past karma due to Krishna's mercy and intervention.

So, we become free from suffering because we are freed of sinful reactions by performing pure devotional service. Thus, even if the devotees see the mischief mongers, they do not accuse them for the suffering inflicted. They take it for granted that the mischief monger is made to act by some indirect cause. And therefore, they tolerate the sufferings, thinking them to be God-given in small doses. For otherwise, the suffering should have been greater. Whatever a devotee suffers, he thinks that by Krishna's mercy, the suffering is minimized. Token suffering. Otherwise, if I had not taken to devotional service, if Krishna would not have intervened in my life, I would have suffered much, much more due to my past sinful activities. So, a devotee considers, what I am getting as suffering now is very, very minimal. And let me tolerate that by the grace of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Only this is the best discovery. It is the greatest жеegdavu, which I would try to capture with my pen. So, it is further told by Prabhupada, Maharaj Pariksit wanted to get a statement of accusation against the direct mischief monger, but they, the Cow and the Bull, declined to give it on the abovementioned grounds. They said, if we try to analyse, we're not able to analyse exactly who is responsible.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the understanding of devotees, who recognize the Lord's sanction in all events, with speculative philosophers who are bewildered and unable to see Krishna as the ultimate cause.

Speculative philosophers, however, do not recognize the sanction of the Lord. Devotees, they directly understand and directly say that ultimately the sanction of the Lord is the ultimate cause of all causes, but the theoretical philosophers, the other five other than the Vyasa Deva, the other five philosophers, they do not recognize the role of the Paramatma. They try to find out the cause of suffering in their own way, their own analysis. According to Srila Jiva Goswami, such speculators are themselves bewildered, and thus they cannot know the ultimate cause of all causes, that is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna. They cannot know that the theoretical philosophers are bewildered, so when they try to analyze, their brain doesn't work perfectly. They are not able to see the ultimate cause, Krishna, in all circumstances, in all cases, in all conditions, that they are unable to see.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 19th verse of the 17th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, which discusses different philosophical perspectives on the cause of suffering, setting the stage for a discussion of various philosophical schools.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 19th verse of the 17th chapter of the 1st canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. Kechit Vikalpa Vasana Aahur Aatmanam Aatmanah Daivam Anya Apare Karma Swabhavam Apare Prabhum. The meaning of this verse is: Some of the philosophers who deny all sorts of duality declare that one's own self is responsible for his personal happiness and distress. Others say that superhuman powers are responsible, while yet others say that activity is responsible, and a gross materialist maintains that nature is the ultimate cause. So, dharma, the personality of religion, is replying to Pariksit's question: Who is the cause of your suffering? So, in the previous verse, 18th verse, we discussed that dharma says there are different theories and disciplines in a particular spirit. There are different theories that God has created them in the form of his own existence. Theoretical philosophers who put forward different theories as to the ultimate cause of suffering, and dharma says general people are confused, we do not know which whom to actually accept as correct. So, in the purport, previous verse purport proper, it said generally there are six great philosophers, and I mentioned in the previous session that I shall tell you briefly what are their philosophies, the six great philosophers. Now that is being described by dharma himself, those six philosophers.

**Key Quote:** "Jaimini analyzes people can perform either sinful activity or pious activity if they perform pious activity they are going to get enjoyment or happiness if they perform sinful activity they are going to get happiness and if they do not they are going to get suffering or pain or some distress this is jaimini's analysis"
**Summary:** The speaker delves into the Karma Mimamsa philosophy of Jaimini, explaining that suffering and enjoyment are direct results of one's past actions, both sinful and pious, and that even gods are bound by the laws of karma.

are mentioned by dharma. Four are mentioned here in this verse. The first one is one's own self is responsible for his personal happiness and distress. So, in the purport, Prilapravapad explains, as referred to above, philosophers like Jaimini and his followers establish that fructive activity is the root cause of all distress and happiness, and that even if there is a superior authority, some superhuman powerful god or gods, he or they are also under the influence of fructive activity because they reward result according to one's own action. The first philosopher being mentioned by dharma among the many philosophers, six great philosophers, first one is Jaimini. Jaimini is one sage who has put forward a philosophy, a theory that the cause of suffering is one's own actions, and he calls it Karma Meemamsa philosophy. Karma Meemamsa philosophy. What is this Karma Meemamsa philosophy? It says that if I am suffering, it is my own past specific action which I performed that is the cause of my suffering, and not only suffering, if I am enjoying, then the enjoyment also is my own past pious activity I have performed, and if I am suffering, it is my own past sinful activity. So, Jaimini analyzes people can perform either sinful activity or pious activity. If they perform pious activity, they are going to get enjoyment or happiness. If they perform sinful activity, they are going to get happiness, and if they do not, they are going to get suffering or pain or some distress. This is Jaimini's analysis. He says beyond this there is nothing more. This is Jaimini's analysis. So, his analysis is based on Karma Meemamsa philosophy that he has put forward. He says ultimately even if there is some god or godless god or gods, devatas, even if there are some powerful beings, they are all bound up ultimately by the laws of karma, and according to law of karma, everybody's suffering or enjoyment is according to the law, and that law states you suffer your own past misdeed and you also enjoy your own past pious activities.

**Key Quote:** "even if somebody is a devotee of some supreme god or devotee of some devata or believer of some some higher controller still that controller or controllers or supreme lord has to award the results of one's past activities and those results are awarded in terms of suffering or happiness enjoyment this is karma"
**Summary:** The speaker continues explaining Jaimini's Karma Mimamsa philosophy, emphasizing that even devotion to a supreme god or devatas does not override the law of karma, which dictates that everyone must experience the consequences of their actions.

So, Jaimini's explanation is that even if somebody is a devotee of some supreme god or devotee of some devata or believer of some some higher controller, still that controller or controllers or supreme lord has to award the results of one's past activities, and those results are awarded in terms of suffering or happiness, enjoyment. This is Karma Meemamsa philosophy as put forth by Jaimini Rishi. Now, Jaimini Rishi is not simply stating the way I am I am stating in just a few sentences, no, he has given evidence from the original Vedas. He studied the Vedas on his own and he has put forth the statements of the Vedas and he has proven in his freedom Horizon from which we now know to explain third-line topic whyIRE I just wanted to start and mid I just wanted to put towards each of these things what you saw with java traversed Jave shud Nuncabharata from which i am beginning a new dalai ometan while going back i have been a vassal for the past two centuries something i watched a lot in my old sister's advertisement from which we will also talk about again you have to spot his philosophy philosophical explanation of the cause of suffering that we see around us in this world among different people. So, he says whoever or whatever be the position, authority, or power, or how you see it used by anybody in resembles by the laws of karma, and the laws of karma means each one has to suffer his or her own past misdeeds or pious activities. This is in essence the karma memes of philosophy. And what about the sanction of the Supreme Lord or what about the control of the devatas that Jaimini Rishi says their control is also subject to the law of karma. Their control is subject to law of karma. So, law of karma is above the devatas, above God, above Paramatma, above all living beings, above everything.

**Key Quote:** "So, the Vedic philosophies, five Vedic philosophies other than Vyasadeva's Vedanta Darshana, um Nyaya, Vaisheshika, ah Yoga Sutra of Patanjali, ah Karma Mimamsa and and um and one more Sankhya. So, these five philosophies they have some merit, but they also are defective in some ways."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces Vyasadeva's refutation of Karma Mimamsa and other Vedic philosophies, stating that while they have some merit, they are incomplete compared to Vedanta Darshana, which is based on the parampara system.

So, this Jaimini Rishi holds law of karma as the supreme. This is his conclusion. Now, the refutation of this karma memes of philosophy as erroneous or incomplete, I have not say erroneous, I would say incomplete, is pointed out by Vyasa Deva. Vyasa Deva when presenting Vedanta darshana or Vedanta philosophy, he has refuted the other five philosophers and pointed out that there is some merit in what they are telling because they are basing it on the Vedas. There is something correct in what they are putting forth as the the philosophy of their own respective analysis, but there is also some defect. So, the Vedic philosophies, five Vedic philosophies other than Vyasadeva's Vedanta Darshana, um Nyaya, Vaisheshika, ah Yoga Sutra of Patanjali, ah Karma Mimamsa and and um and one more Sankhya. So, these five philosophies, they have some merit, but they also are defective in some ways. So, that is very clearly pointed out by Vyasadeva based on what? Based on the very Vedas, based on the very Vedas that they all refer to. But, Vyasadeva presents the Vedic understanding based on Parampara system. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says, evam parampara praptam imam rajarsha yo vidhu. The Vedic knowledge is originally coming from the Supreme Lord Krishna. Karma brahmodavam vidhi brahmaksara samudbhavam.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Vedic knowledge originates from Krishna and was imparted to Brahma, then passed down through the parampara system to Vyasa, who documented it in the Vedic literature.

Bhagavad Gita, it is explained very clearly that the scriptures are originating from the Supreme personality of Godhead, Krishna. At the beginning of creation, thene Brahma rudaya adikavaya muhyanti yatsuraya. So, in the Bhagavad Gita, it is explained that the shastras, the scriptures were first imparted, the Vedic knowledge was given to Brahma from within his heart by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna at the beginning of creation. And since then, Brahma became enlightened by the Supreme Lord's mercy, then Brahma imparted that very knowledge to his sons and his Brahma imparted to Narada, Narada imparted the same knowledge to Vyasa. Vyasa is documented in the form of this Vedic literature. Okay, so Vyasa is receiving this knowledge and perfectly explaining everything based on the knowledge he has received along with the explanation.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by explaining that while Karma Mimamsa is correct to some extent, it is incomplete because it doesn't account for Krishna's role in enforcing and nullifying karma, especially for devotees engaged in pure devotional service.

Explanations along the explanations of the various Vedic statements, the original Vedas. So, Vyasadeva based on the original Vedas, he has explained that this Karma Mimamsa philosophy is correct to the extent that the immediate cause of a particular suffering is the sinful reaction within my heart which is fructifying now, therefore I have to suffer now. If I get a disease, then a particular sinful activity I committed in the past is fructifying now, and Kala, the sanction of the Lord in terms of Kala, is enforcing that, inflicting that now upon me in terms of I contracting the disease and suffering some pain or some whatever the infection. So, this is a fact, I am suffering because of my own past mistake, yes, which is, but the sanction of the Lord is the Kala. Kala is under control of Krishna, the Supreme Lord Paramatma is Paramatma, and Paramatma sanctions when who has to suffer which particular reaction of his or her own past misdeed, and Paramatma also nullifies the sinful reaction when one executes pure devotional service because of which a person doesn't have to suffer his or her past reactions. Sinful reactions, there is also there that this Jaimini doesn't understand, he doesn't know, he doesn't understand that because this is confidential knowledge about the life of devotees who are engaged in pure devotional service that Jaimini doesn't know, and it's an exception, it's not the rule. The rule is everybody has to suffer according to their own past misdeeds, according to Kala also, but pure devotees or devotees engaged in pure devotional service don't suffer exactly whatever reactions are there in their heart, their reactions are nullified by their pure devotional service, and who does that? Krishna does it because only Krishna has got that power to nullify sinful reactions, nobody else can, only Krishna can do that.

**Key Quote:** "While yet others say that activity is responsible and the gross materialists maintain that nature is the ultimate cause."
**Summary:** This segment explores different philosophical perspectives on the cause of suffering, including individual responsibility, superhuman powers (destiny), activity (karma), and nature.

So this discussion is about the nature of the ultimate cause. So this is the question between Dharma and Maharaj Pariksit. Maharaj Pariksit directly questioned Dharma as to who is the cause of your suffering. And Dharma replied that it is very difficult to ascertain the particular miscreant who has caused our sufferings, because there are so many different theories. There are so many different theoretical philosophers who put forward different philosophies trying to explain what is the cause of our suffering, ultimately. So here four different kinds of philosophers are mentioned specifically. One class of philosophers say ultimately we ourselves are responsible for our own suffering or happiness, suffering or enjoyment. And some people say superhuman powers, it's not within our control, something beyond us is responsible, we simply have to accept whatever is coming our way, just like fatalists. In English there's a word fatalists. In Karanadhi say hane baraha, whatever is destined is going to happen, destiny, destiny is everything, superhuman powers. Then some, the third category philosophers, say activity is ultimately responsible. If you do good work, you will be responsible, if you do good work you get good results, you're happy, you enjoy life, everything is nice. If you do bad activities, if you do sinful activities, then you have to suffer, you have to undergo distress and you will have a very bad time. So they attribute the ultimate cause of one's own enjoyment of suffering to whatever actions a particular person does. The fourth category of philosophers, they say nature is the ultimate cause. They attribute nature as the ultimate cause of everything.

**Key Quote:** "The Srimad Bhagavatam or kapila, the first kapila, who appeared many millions of years back, he actually is teaching us the devotional Sankhya philosophy, which analyzes everything in existence and establishes the Supreme Personality of God, Krishna, as the ultimate cause of all causes."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the Sankhya philosophy and distinguishes between the theistic Sankhya of the original Kapila (an incarnation of the Supreme Lord) and the atheistic Sankhya of a later Kapila, emphasizing the former's focus on Krishna as the ultimate cause.

So accordingly people try to find a solution to their problems based on which philosophy dot nature Helsinki Professor of Health Sciences liquid quote nature as the ultimate cause of everything. So accordingly people try to find a solution to their problems based on which philosophy they subscribe to. So Srila Prabhupada has already explained in the purport to the 18th words, there are many theoretical philosophers in the world who put forward their own theories as to cause and effect, especially about the cause of suffering in this world. So in the Vedic tradition, there are six great philosophers who have written very elaborate thesis on the ultimate cause of suffering that is there in this world and those six philosophers have been named Granada, Gautama, then Patanjali, Kapila, Jaimini and Vyasa Deva. So now in the previous session I described Jaimini's philosophy of karma Mimamsa philosophy and now I will try to describe this atheistic materialistic Sankhya philosophy. The Sankhya philosophers, the Nirishwaravada Sankhya philosophers, because I mentioned this earlier also, I am repeating, there are two kapilas in history. The recent one is the Nirishwaravadi kapila, Atheist kapila, who does not accept the theistic conclusion of the Srimad Bhagavatam or the theistic conclusion of the Vaishnava tradition. This Atheistic kapila, because the incarnational Supreme Lord Shiva is not a kapila. The Srimad Bhagavatam or kapila, the first kapila, who appeared many millions of years back, he actually is teaching us the devotional Sankhya philosophy, which analyzes everything in existence and establishes the Supreme Personality of God, Krishna, as the ultimate cause of all causes. But this Atheistic kapila, Nirishwaravada, is not a kapila. The Nirishwaravadi kapila, he has got his own materialistic Sankhya philosophy, which says material nature is the ultimate cause of all causes.

**Key Quote:** "According to this atheist Kapila, there is only material nature."
**Summary:** The lecture delves into the atheistic Sankhya philosophy, highlighting its focus on material nature as the ultimate cause and its inability to comprehend the existence of the spirit soul or anything beyond matter.

So this Nirishwara kapila, he says that material nature, he analyzes material nature, and he has analyzed material nature as consisting of 24 elements, which is described by the original Kapila in the Srimad Bhagavatam, the Sankhya philosophy, the devotional Sankhya philosophy, by the incarnation of Supreme Lord Kapila. Kapila, son of Devahuti, the Supreme Lord himself, appeared to explain the Sankhya philosophy. Yes, the material nature consists of 24 elements, but material nature is one of the many energies of the Supreme Personality of God, Krishna. Now this point, that material nature is one of the energies of the Supreme Lord, Kapila, is a very important point. The material nature of the Supreme Lord, Krishna, is not known, not understood, not considered by the atheist Kapila. According to this atheist Kapila, there is only material nature. Just like we take birth in this material world, so atheist Kapila says, we are a product of material nature. That means he does not know anything beyond a personality. He is a person's material body. Of course, this atheist Kapila recognizes there is mind, there is intelligence, there is false ego. But he is unable to go beyond matter, because he is a gross materialist. He does not understand what is spirit soul. He does not even know it exists. And like other atheists, the reason is, if we say Bhagavad Gita describes there is something called spirit beyond matter, he says, oh, that's all simply your imagination. He'll dismiss that as something imaginary or some kind of theoretical philosophy. According to these atheistic philosophers, and according to this atheistic Kapila, what exists is what we can perceive with our five senses and with our mind and intelligence. That's all they accept. These atheistic people.

### 24 Elements of Matter, Material Nature, Sankhya Philosophy

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So, this Atheist Kapila analyzes matter as consisting of 24 elements."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the 24 elements of matter according to the atheistic Sankhya philosophy, referencing Krishna's description in the Bhagavad Gita.

So, this Atheist Kapila analyzes matter as consisting of 24 elements. What are the 24 elements? First of all, this is described in the Bhagavad Gita by Krishna himself in the 13th chapter. In the 7th chapter and 13th chapter, Krishna describes, in the 13th chapter particularly, Mahabhutani ahankara buddhir avyakta mevaca. That Mahabhutani, the five great elements, earth, water, fire, air and sky. These are called the five great elements. And then there are the ten senses. The five knowledge, the five knowledge acquiring senses, Gyanendriya: the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue and the sense of touch. Then the five karmendriyas or the five working senses: the hands, the legs, the voice, the anus and the genitals. So, totally that makes it 15. And then five more senses, the sense objects. For the eyes, there are form. And for the ears, there is sound. For the nose, there is smell, different kinds of fragrances or different kinds of smells. And then for the tongue, there are different kinds of tastes. And for the sense of touch, there are different kinds of feelings of softness, hardness, whatever the kind of sensation of touch. So, these five sense objects called indriya visaya. Totally, five fours are 20. And then four more for making it 24 total elements, which is what matter is constituted of: mind, intelligence, and false ego. Mind is manas, buddhi, intelligence, ahankara, false ego. And finally, there is the total stock of the unmanifested material energy, avyakta. Avyakta is the total stock of the material energy from which these elements are differentiated at the beginning of creation.

**Key Quote:** "But then who is actually causing material energy to come from the unmanifested state?"
**Summary:** This segment critiques the atheistic Sankhya philosophy, questioning its lack of explanation for the origin, changes, and destruction of the material world, and emphasizing its ignorance of spiritual nature.

This is what Krishna explains in the Bhagavad Gita, 13th chapter. But this atheistic Sankhya philosophers headed by atheist Kapila, they say this matter is everything. That's all that is there in existence. So, matter is manifest as these 24 elements, and these 24 elements combine, and so many varieties are produced, and they remain for some time, and afterwards everything is destroyed. So, material energy goes back to its unmanifested state, avyakta. But then who is actually causing material energy to come from the unmanifested state? From the unmanifested state to the manifest state, and remain for some time in the manifest state. In the manifest state, there are changes that are taking place. While this world exists as a material world, as a material universe, there are so many changes that are taking place. There are no explanations for this. They say it's automatic. And then, finally, what about destruction? Who brings about this destruction? How does destruction take place? But all the manifestations, they go back to their elemental state of the unmanifested condition of material energy, even before the five elements are formed. So, who is doing all this? How is it happening? There are no explanations. They say it's all nature. Nature. Who is behind nature? Whose nature? We had asked that question. Whose nature? Where is the nature? Where is the direction coming from? Where is the direction coming from for all these changes to take place in a definite way, in a systematic way? So, that they have no logical explanation. They have no reasonable, intelligent explanation. So, any intelligent person can understand these people are ignorant about the total reality.

**Key Quote:** "You do good actions, everything is fine. If you do sinful activity you will suffer."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of discussion, verse 1.17.19 of Srimad Bhagavatam, and outlines three philosophical viewpoints: karma mimamsa, atheistic Sankhya, and atomic philosophy.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will continue discussing the 19th verse of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is part 3 of the discussion. In the previous two sessions, we discussed the karma mimamsa philosophy, that is, karma is everything. You do good actions, everything is fine. If you do sinful activity, you will suffer. Then the second kind of philosophers, the atheistic Sankhya philosophers, who analyze material nature as the ultimate cause. Material nature consists of matter. Matter consists of 24 elements, and that they say is everything. Now, the third kind of philosophers, the philosophers headed by Kanada. They accept the combination of atoms as the original cause of the creation. Ultimately, they analyze entire material existence consists of material. Atoms, and that atom is the fundamental particle, and the combination of atoms, there are varieties of objects, persons, things, whatever, everything. Everything ultimately can be broken down only into an atom. So kana, kana means atom in Sanskrit. So this philosopher's name, the sage's name also Kanada because he is explaining everything in terms of atoms, so atomic philosophy.

**Key Quote:** "So, the Vedic conception of a material atom is different than the understanding of a material atom as given by today's scientists."
**Summary:** The speaker analyzes the defects in atomic philosophy, contrasting the Vedic concept of an indivisible atom with the modern scientific understanding of atoms consisting of subatomic particles.

It's also called atomic philosophy, the third kind. So let's analyze. What is the defect in this atomic philosophy? That yes, matter at the fundamental level is definitely the atom. Not the atom that is the fundamental. Not the atom that the modern day scientists and physicists call as atom because according to the Bhagavatam, the scriptures, our Vedic scriptures, atom is the indivisible particle, you cannot divide it any further, but these, our present day scientists, they say atom consists of subatomic particles. Like neutron, proton, electron, and so many more, now they have so many more. Photons, so many things they have. So they have not yet come to the atom, which is described in our scriptures, which is indivisible, cannot be divided any further. It is the smallest particle. So, very nicely, in the third canto, in a, this discussion between Vidura and Maitreya Muni, Maitreya Rishi. There is a clear description. Calculation of time from the atom. This is chapter, the eleventh chapter of the third canto. There, the calculation of time is given beginning from atomic time up to universal time. See, the smallest division of time that is given in our Vedic literature, in our scriptures is atomic time. And the largest division of time is the duration of this entire universe. So, atomic time to universal time is nicely explained in the third canto of the Bhagavatam and other places in the Vedic scriptures. So, the Vedic conception of a material atom is different than the understanding of a material atom as given by today's scientists. Of course, the scientists, when they make further advancement, they will one day come to understand what is this atom, which is described in the Vedic scriptures as the indivisible particle, ultimate particle, which is indivisible, cannot be divided.

**Key Quote:** "So, atomic time to universal time is nicely explained in the third canto of the Bhagavatam and other places in the Vedic scriptures."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the Vedic concept of time, from atomic time to universal time, highlighting the relative nature of time based on different planetary systems and referencing the duration of Brahma's day as described in the Bhagavad Gita.

So, they will come to that. If they take some more time, they will take time. Further advancement is required in material science. But, the scriptures are already explaining that ultimate indivisible particle called the material atom. So, that material atom, the time is measured based on the material atom. Time it takes for the sun to traverse that distance of the size of the atom that is called atomic time. It's very, very, very, very, very tiny. So the sun's movement is what is creating the concept or the perception of time, just like how do we know time is progressing? The movement of the sun. It's like we got day and night. So the sun rises and the sun comes overhead and then it sets. It rises in eastern direction and sets in the western direction and then after the sun sets there is darkness, that's the night, till again after about say about 12 hours again the sun rises. So this cyclically day and night constitute time. This is a unit of time called 24 hours account our measurement of the earth and then there is different planets different distance from the sun they have different measurement of time is relative time is related so the the higher planets the duration of their day and night much different their days are longer and than the day we experience on this earth planet and brahma loka brahma's 12 hours or brahma's day is described in the bhagavad gita sahasra yuga pariyantam maharyat brahmano vidhu.

**Key Quote:** "In the spiritual world there are no laws of karma, there are only laws of god which is the law of eternity."
**Summary:** The speaker continues explaining the calculation of time in relation to Brahma's day and night, contrasting the material world governed by karma with the eternal spiritual world beyond creation and destruction.

That sahasra yuga, that yuga is a cycle of four, satya, treta, dvapara, kali. So for us on earth planet as we measure time in terms of our sunrise and sunset when four yugas have completed one cycle that's called one maha yuga. So one thousand maha yugas constitute the duration of time of brahma's planet half a day. Half a day means the sunset to sunrise what we say as day twelve hours our twelve hours when our one thousand maha yugas have completed then brahma's twelve hours are over and similar duration is brahma's night another one thousand maha yugas on the earth planet is brahma's night so like this brahma's day and night is the longest day and night in the whole universe in our material universe but what the materialists do not know because they don't accept knowledge from the perfect source the supreme personality of godhead the parampara system of devotees descending from the supreme lord so they do not know that there is an eternal world beyond this material world of creation maintenance and destruction beyond this they do not know the materialists do not know so that eternal world there is no depth there is no creation or destruction there everything is eternal everything is ever existing so that understanding is lacking in modern science it is lacking in the atheistic philosophers or the people who analyze and study only everything in terms of matter or material atom or material elements or just the laws of karma laws of karma are working within this material world only in the spiritual world there are no laws of karma there are only laws of god which is the law of eternity the ways in which the husband is determined which karmic results simple cultural fertile movement in the Paradise where true love the supreme love of the supreme lord where to give love devotion.

**Key Quote:** "He does not know about spiritual atom which is smaller than the material atom. What is that spiritual atom? The individual spirit soul."
**Summary:** The speaker criticizes Kanada Rishi's atomic philosophy for focusing solely on the material atom and neglecting the spiritual atom (the individual soul) and the Supreme Soul (Krishna), ultimately deeming it a defective philosophy.

They do not know. They do not know anything about eternality. So that analysis of this material atom as a fundamental particle is only explanation of matter. Only explanation. That is what Kanada Rishi is establishing as the ultimate truth or reality is this atom, material atom, indivisible particle. He does not know that what atom he is speaking about as a fundamental particle is a material atom. He does not know about spiritual atom which is smaller than the material atom. What is that spiritual atom? The individual spirit soul. One 10,000 part of the tip of the hair point in size. Keshagra Shatabhagasya. This is described in the Upanishads also. Shrila Prabhupada explains this in the Bhagavad Gita. The Bhagavad Gita Krishna says the tiny spirit soul is the active principle within this body, living body. Because minus that spirit soul, this body is a dead body. What happens at time of death? The spirit soul, the individual soul leaves the body and then the body is the dead body, finished. No consciousness, no action, no sense, sense perception nothing so that spiritual particles spiritual atom that they are completely missing out this all these theoretical philosophers and of course the this theoretical philosopher who is the Canada and his followers they miss out this spiritual atom the spirit soul the spiritual particle that they miss out and of course they are completely ignorant about God Krishna the supreme soul supreme spirit that also they are completely ignorant so this is the defect of Kanada's analysis of what is the ultimate cause of this material existence of the world we are living in he is the ultimate cause of this material existence of the world we are living in he says material atom different combinations different types of objects and even life itself is simply when this body comes into existence there is life and when the atoms which are combined they disintegrate then there is no life after disintegration there is no life that is what is called a destruction or death Neta Siddesh Ganga caught the this a the stick philosopher ath Kunden Scherzer a solid the weight of but they don't know the conclusion of the weightors that krishna is the supreme personality of God at the supreme absolute truth the Ultimate Reality the cause of all causes and he is supremely powerful he has eternal aboard he has sla cousins he is extremely powerful he has eternal aboard and is the supreme far ther eternal existence, sanatana dhama, sanatana rupa, sanatana everything, everything eternal, that they have no understanding.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Pariksit Maharaj's encounter with Kali Purusha and the philosophical reply of the bull, who is actually the personality of religion (Dharma), emphasizing the importance of understanding philosophical truths through historical incidents in the Bhagavata Purana.

Pariksit Maharaj meeting Shukadev Goswami. So when Pariksit was ruling, Kali Yuga just was beginning, Kali Purusha was trying to enter Pariksit's kingdom, and Pariksit encountered this Kali Purusha, and he saw Pariksit saw this Kali Purusha beating cow and bull. Now he was questioning the cow and the bull, "Who is responsible for hurting you, harming you?" So the bull gives a very philosophical reply. That reply actually helps Pariksit understand. This is no ordinary bull, and he says that in his reply he will clarify this bull is actually the personality of religion, Dharma. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The statement of the bull, the personality of religion, was full of philosophy and knowledge, and the king was satisfied since he could understand that the suffering bull was not an ordinary one. It is not an ordinary bull. Unless one is perfectly conversant with the law of the Supreme Lord, one cannot speak such things touching philosophical truths." So Bhagavatam is such a scripture, you can read it in the book of Bhagavad Gita, and you can read it in the book of Bhagavad Gita, it explains the philosophical truths perfectly clearly, very nicely, and they are all connected with different events, incidents, historical incidents. Therefore, the Bhagavata Purana historical incidents, and these incidents are necessary to understand the truth of the Bhagavad Gita connected with the supreme personality of Godhead Krishna and the pure devotees of Krishna. So therefore, Bhagavata in relationship with Bhagavan, the devotee is called Bhagavata, this scripture is called Bhagavata in relationship with Krishna Bhagavata.

**Key Quote:** "A devotee's conclusion is that no one is directly responsible for being a benefactor or mischief-monger without the sanction of the Lord"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while there are multiple causes for suffering, ultimately everything happens with God's sanction, and no one is directly responsible without it.

You are no other than the personality of religion. Let's try to understand what does this verse mean in detail in the purport. The bull has said that it is very difficult to ascertain the particular miscreant who is responsible for our suffering, why? Because there are multiple causes, it's not just one cause. This has been discussed in the Vedanta philosophy in very detailed way, and we went through some of those philosophies in the previous sessions, that some philosophers say the self is responsible, some philosophers say that superhuman powers are responsible, some say nature is the ultimate cause, some say only God is the cause. So all kinds of different philosophies do exist, but Bhagavatam declares the proper understanding of all the causes, and particularly Bhagavatam declares the supreme cause of everything, that is Krishna, sarva karana karanam, the supreme cause. Yet we cannot blame God for our suffering, even though ultimately God is the cause of all causes, the supreme cause of everything, but still we cannot blame. How we will understand from the purport. In the purport Srila Prabhupada says, "A devotee's conclusion is that no one is directly responsible for being a benefactor or mischief-monger without the sanction of the Lord."

### karma, God's grace, devotion

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Whether the result of the action is beneficial for me or it is not beneficial it is harmful or it is a loss Both are God sent and thus it is his grace, God's grace."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the idea that both benefits and losses are God-sent and are ultimately God's grace, even though devotees may sometimes doubt this in the face of suffering.

You see, any action that has been committed to the Lord, even in this life, that takes place, there is a background for that action, because that action can take place only when the supreme lord, seated as Paramatma in the heart of everyone, has to sanction that act, good or bad, harmful or beneficial. Therefore, Srila Prabhupada says further, he means the devotee does not consider anyone to be directly responsible for such action. So nobody is directly responsible because there are a chain of causes and effects, but in both the cases, he takes it for granted that either benefit or loss is God sent, because in both cases, God is a sanctioner. Krishna is Paramatma in the heart of the performer of the action is sanctioning that action. So therefore, a devotee understands whether the result of the action is beneficial for me or it is not beneficial, it is harmful or it is a loss. Both are God sent, and thus it is His grace, God's grace. In case of benefit, no one will deny that it is God sent, because especially devotees, they always are dependent on the mercy of the Lord, and they are very pleased to receive God's mercy in the shape of so many nice benefits that they derive in any situation. But in case of loss or reverses, one becomes doubtful about how the Lord could be so unkind to His devotee as to put him in great difficulty.

### suffering, devotion, tolerance, karma

**Key Quote:** "If I am being harmed by another person, I am equally responsible for getting the suffering, as much as the person who is inflicting the suffering also is responsible, has to take the reaction for that sin."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how a devotee should understand suffering caused by others, using the example of Jesus Christ, and emphasizing that the devotee is equally responsible for the suffering due to past karma.

So how to understand, especially how can a devotee understand that if I am suffering due to somebody's mistreatment, ill treatment, just like the bull was directly being beaten by Kalipurusha. So how can Kalipurusha beat a devotee? Because unless God sanctions Kalipurusha's intention or desire to beat, Kalipurusha cannot do any harm independently. So then why would God sanction a devotee being beaten by a miscreant? Prabhupada gives an example. Jesus Christ was seemingly put into such great difficulty being crucified by the ignorant, but he was never angry at the mischief mongers. This is a fact. Pure devotees, acharyas, and great saintly persons, they know that in any difficult circumstances, they never blame the person who is the immediate cause of the problem. That is the way of accepting a thing either favorable or unfavorable. Thus for a devotee, the identifier is equally a sinner like the mischief monger. That means, if I am being harmed by another person, I am equally responsible for getting the suffering, as much as the person who is inflicting the suffering also is responsible, has to take the reaction for that sin, and I deserve to get that. That is the way of accepting a sin. This is the way of getting the great sin. This is how the person who is suffering from that sin can get a sense of loosing the sense of love, and this is the way of getting the great evil. See, the great evil, the right way to get rid of evil is not just to have the wrong action. This is a great way to end it. Life has a heart, the right way, the left way, the right way, and the right way to face the situation.

**Key Quote:** "A devotee tolerates all difficulties or dangers or any harm by thinking that due to my own past sinful activities in the past, my own past sinful activities, I deserve to suffer much more."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotees tolerate difficulties by recognizing them as a small punishment for past sins and maintaining Krishna consciousness under all circumstances to return to Godhead.

So, by God's grace, the devotee tolerates all reverses. There are some words in the Bhagavatam, in a later canto, in the tenth canto, Tatenu Kampam Susamikshamano Bhunjana Evatmakrutam Vipakam. A devotee tolerates all difficulties or dangers or any harm by thinking that due to my own past sinful activities in the past, my own past sinful activities, I deserve to suffer much more. But by Krishna's grace, I am getting a very small token of punishment. So let me just suffer. Let me not forget Krishna, even in the midst of difficulty or danger. And let me never forget Krishna, even if I am going through some happiness or going through some period where I have lot of benefits or lot of good things coming my way. In either case, I don't want to forget Krishna. My destination is to go back to Godhead, and I simply have to be Krishna conscious. That's all under all circumstances.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that devotees depend on Krishna in all situations, maintain Krishna consciousness, and ultimately return to Godhead, regardless of the circumstances of their lives.

Therefore, Maharaj Pariksit could understand that the bull was no other than the personality of religion himself. In other words, a devotee has no suffering at all because so called suffering is God's grace for a devotee who sees God in everything. The cow and bull never die. The cow and bull never placed any complaint before the king for being tortured by the personality of Kali, although everyone lodges such complaints before the state authorities. The extraordinary behavior of the bull made the king conclude that the bull was certainly the personality of religion, for no one else could understand the finer intricacies of the codes of religion. So therefore, the conclusion is that there are mudras. There are multiple causes and a devotee depends upon Krishna under all circumstances and by Krishna's grace, the devotee is able to go through all situations in Krishna consciousness and ultimately go back to Godhead, irrespective of whether there was suffering in the course of living life in this body or there was some enjoyment or there was some peace or there was some chaos. Whatever be the situation, devotees simply are Krishna conscious and they go back to Godhead at the end of life.

### inconceivable energies of the Lord, devotee's perspective, karma, illusory energy (Maya)
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/xsLpu-f0ZTY?t=51
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The material energy is always provoking doubts about the supreme authority of the Lord."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the inconceivable nature of the Lord's energies, the role of Maya, and how a devotee should not blame others or the Lord for difficulties, understanding the chain of cause and effect and the influence of past karma.

In this session we will be discussing from the 23rd verse of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. अथवा देवामायाया नूनम गतिर अगोचरा चेतसो वचसस्चापी भूतानाम इति निष्चयहा The meaning of this 23rd verse is, "Thus it is concluded that the Lord's energies are inconceivable. No one can estimate them by mental speculation or by word." Now, this is a conclusion that is drawn by Pariksit Maharaj. The Lord's energies are inconceivable. The Lord's energies are working, especially in this material world and even in the spiritual world. But in the spiritual world it is the spiritual energy, internal potency which is working. And in the material world it is the external potency, the material energy which is working. Both of them are controlled, owned, directed by the Supreme Lord only. Krishna only is the owner, controller, director, master of all the energies. So, by mental speculation we cannot figure out how the Lord's energies are working. How the Lord's energies are working in different circumstances. We cannot make calculation, material calculation. That's impossible. So, in the Purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, "A question may be raised as to why a devotee should refrain from identifying an actor, although he knows definitely that the Lord is the ultimate doer of everything. A devotee does not blame anyone for any difficulty or danger." A doer knows the problem he may be facing. Why? Even though he knows that the Lord is the ultimate doer. But that doesn't mean he blames the Lord. Neither he blames the person who is the immediate cause. And therefore he also blames the Lord as the person who is the immediate cause, because there are a chain of causes and defects. And every effect there is a cause, and every cause there is a particular justification why, why that cause is actually being sanctioned by the law. Knowing the ultimate doer, one should not pose himself as ignorant of the actual performer. So, it's not that because anyway, ultimately, every person suffers because of his or her own past bad karma, I or anyone else doesn't have the license to inflict harm on others, that is not a license. It's just like sometimes people say, anyway, the animal is going to die. So, if I kill it for some food, what is wrong there? It's going to die. Animal is not the body. After all, I can only kill the body. I cannot kill the soul. Animal or the living entity is the soul. So, this reasoning or argument is not correct, is invalid. The perpetrator of a sinful activity is definitely responsible for this sinful action, and is going to be punished by God's laws, the laws of karma. Of this, there is no doubt at all. Yet, when the sinful action is sanctioned by the Lord, then there is a higher cause. So, it is said here, to answer this doubt, the reply is that the Lord is also not directly responsible for everything, is done by his deputed maya shakti or material energy. In the material world, maya shakti, material energy is working. In every case, every material action, material energy is working. The material energy is always provoking doubts about the supreme authority of the Lord, because we directly don't see the Lord's hand in every action in this material world. But still, the fact is, the Lord is always in the background, and he only is directing the material energy. The personality of religion knew perfectly well that nothing can take place without the sanction of the Supreme Lord, and still he was put into doubts by the deluding energy. And thus, he refrained from mentioning the supreme cause. This doubtfulness was due to the contamination of both Kali and the material energy. When dharma does not complain against the Kali Purusha, so, does it mean that, oh, Kali Purusha is not directly responsible, so, he is not a culprit. So, Pariksit need not punish him? No, that is incorrect. At the same time, the Lord is sanctioning, only then Kali Purusha can do some harm. So, Lord is responsible? No, the Lord is not responsible. The whole atmosphere of the age of Kali is magnified by the deluding energy, and the proportion of measurement is inexplicable. The material world always, Maya's actions are definitely the direct cause of any suffering that anybody may undergo. But then, our own past sinful actions are also responsible. We are responsible. So, how does this illusory energy work? Is the question that may be raised. So, it is not easy to understand the working of the illusory energy in each and every case.

### illusory energy (Maya), Markandeya Rishi, prayer, spiritual practice

**Key Quote:** "I wish to see your illusory potency, by whose influence the entire world, together with its ruling demigods, consider reality to be materially variegated."
**Summary:** This segment introduces the story of Markandeya Rishi, who prayed to see the Lord's illusory energy in action, highlighting his detachment from material benefits and his desire to understand Maya's influence.

So, I want to briefly narrate a particular description in the 12th Kant of the Bhagavatam. Tiruvannamalai. There was one Markandeya Rishi. He once prayed to the Supreme Lord, "I want to see your illusory energy in action." Because he is himself a great tapasvi, he is situated above the influence of the illusory energy. But he is seeing the illusory energy working. So many people are under the clutches of maya and they are engaged in either material enjoyment or they sometimes suffer and they are in ignorance and they are perpetually in the cycle of birth and death. They have no clue how to get out because of ignorance. So how is this material energy working? I wanted to see. This is what Markandeya wanted to actually ask the Lord. So once when Markandeya Rishi was sitting in his ashram performing his spiritual practice, the Supreme Lord appeared in his incarnation as Naranarayanarishi, the twin sages. And Markandeya Rishi received Naranarayanarishi very nicely. And after they had been offered all kinds of good reception, according to Vedic culture, then when they were seated, Markandeya Rishi offered nice prayers to them and the Lord, being satisfied, asked him, "You can ask any benediction that you desire." So he said, "I am not interested in any material benefit," knowing very well that they are useless from a spiritual perspective. "But I want to... I wish to see your illusory potency, by whose influence the entire world, together with its ruling demigods, consider reality to be materially variegated." They mistake this material energy itself to be the absolute truth. No. Material energy is not the absolute truth. Krishna is the absolute truth. Krishna is in the background. Material energy is completely controlled, directed, owned by Krishna. Now, Markandeya's prayer to the Supreme Lord was accepted. And Supreme Lord said, "So be it." And they departed for their ashram in Badrikashram. Thinking always of his desire to see the Lord's illusory energy, Markandeya Rishi remained in his ashram, meditating constantly upon the Lord within fire, the sun, the moon, the water, the earth, the air, lightning, his own heart, and worshipping him with paraphernalia conceived in his mind.

**Key Quote:** "Even as Markandeya looked on, the rain pouring down from the clouds filled the ocean more and more and more until the great sea covered up the earth's islands, mountains, continents."
**Summary:** This segment describes the devastating flood created by the Lord's illusory energy, showing Markandeya Rishi's experience of fear, hunger, and disorientation as he wandered through the deluge.

One day, while Markandeya Rishi was performing his evening worship, suddenly a great wind arose. That wind created a terrible sound and brought in its wake fearsome clouds that were accompanied by lightning and roaring thunder. And the clouds poured down torrents of rain. Then on all sides, Markandeya Rishi saw the four great oceans swelling up. And there was gusty wind. And these oceans were filled with sea monsters. And they were very, very fearsome. There were whirlpools. The sage saw all the inhabitants of the universe, including himself, tormented by the harsh winds. The bolts of lightning, the great waves rising beyond the sky, the whole earth became flooded, and he became perplexed and fearful. Remember, Markandeya Rishi had prayed to the Lord, "I want to see your illusory energy in action." And now, actually the Lord is showing him what is my illusory energy like. Even as Markandeya looked on, the rain pouring down from the clouds filled the ocean more and more and more until the great sea covered up the earth's islands, mountains, continents. Completely the earth became submerged. Not only that water flooded the earth, but it also flooded the outer space, heaven, celestial region. Entire expanse of the universe was flooded in all directions. And it appeared like only Markandeya Rishi remained alive in that flood, great deluge, devastating flood. His matted hair scattered. The great sage wandered about alone in the water as if dumb and blind. He didn't know where to go, what to do. He's alive. He's somehow floating. And he doesn't know where to go and what to do. He was also tormented by hunger and thirst. He was attacked by monstrous makaras and timingala fish. Makaras means crocodiles. And very dangerous crocodiles which are huge. You can easily swallow up hundreds of Markandeya Rishis. And timingala fish. These fishes are very, very dangerous. They can devour an entire big blue sea whale. Huge. As big as ocean liners. That is attacked by a timingala. Timingala is very, very dangerous. So he saw timingala fishes. He saw monstrous crocodiles. And he was battered by the wind and waves. He moved aimlessly in the infinite darkness into which he had fallen. Suddenly, he saw millions of years pass like that, wandering in that huge flood. His mind bewildered by the illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Vishnu.

**Summary:** This segment narrates Markandeya Rishi's encounter with the infant Vata Patra Shayi, his experience of being inside the Lord's body, and his eventual return to his ashram, illustrating the power and mystery of the Lord's illusory energy.

Once while wandering in the water, millions of years have passed, this Brahmana Markandeya Rishi discovered a small island. Now on this small island was a young banyan tree. And it was having... It was unaffected by that flood, by the hurricane wind, by the violent storm, everything. This stood with nice fruits and nice blossoms of flowers. Now on a branch of that tree, he saw an infant boy, small boy, lying within a leaf. The child's effulgence was swallowing up the darkness. The infant's dark blue complexion was the color of a flawless emerald. His lotus face shone with a wealth of beauty. His throat bore marks like the lines of a conch shell. This is the Supreme Lord appearing in that form, Vata Patra Shai. He is lying on a banyan leaf, and he was sucking the toe within his mouth. So Markandeya when he saw the child, all his fatigue vanished. And just looking at the child, he felt great joy within his heart. Now who is this infant? He tried to go near the infant. And suddenly the child inhaled everything, and Markandeya found himself within the body of the child. And inside he found the universe was as it was before the dissolution. He was astonished. He saw the heavens. He saw the earth. He saw the stars. He saw the mountains. He saw everything. And he saw before him his own Badra river, his own hermitage. Now as he was kind of thinking, oh now the illusion is over, suddenly the infant exhaled and expelled the sage out of its abdomen. And he was back into the ocean of dissolution. At that moment that child, when he came out, became again visible, invisible, became invisible. And suddenly everything vanished. The whole storm and the oceans which were flooded, everything vanished. And Markandeya Rishi found himself in his ashram, as he was seated. So this was the display of the illusory energy by the Lord. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "In the age of Satya, truthfulness, your four legs were established by the four principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 24th verse of the 17th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining how Dharma, represented as a bull, stood on four legs (austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness) in Satya Yuga, but gradually lost three legs as the ages progressed.

In this session we will be discussing from the 24th verse of the 17th chapter of the 1st canto of Shri Madbhagavatam Tapashaucham Dayasatyam Iti Pada Kriteyam Kriyate Krutah Adharmam Shais Trayobhagna Smaya Sanga Madais Tava. The meaning of this verse is: In the age of Satya, truthfulness, your four legs were established by the four principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. But it appears that three of your legs are broken due to rampant irreligion in the form of pride, lust for women and intoxication. So Parikshit Maharaj is speaking to the personality of religious principle dharma, the bull in the shape of the bow. That dharma in the beginning of the cycle of four yugas in Satya yuga was established on four legs, four pillars of dharma, what are they? Austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. Tapaha, Shaucham, Daya, Satyam. Tapa means austerity, Shaucham means cleanliness, Daya means mercy, Satyam means truthfulness.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the decline of Dharma through the yugas, explaining that in Kali Yuga, only truthfulness remains as a pillar, while the others are broken due to pride, lust, and intoxication.

But by the time the ages rotate, time passes by, Satya, Treta, Dwapara, Kali. So from Satya yuga to Treta yuga, one of the leg is broken. Then from Treta yuga to Dwapara yuga, transition, one more leg is broken. And from Dwapara yuga to Kali yuga, yet one more pillar of religion is broken. So in Kali yuga, at the beginning of Kali yuga, Dharma is left with only one principle that is truthfulness. The other three principles...

**Key Quote:** "If we refrain from these four pillars of sinful life, then we are in the material world...Then, we can remain aloof from the influence of maya."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Prabhupada, explaining that the influence of Maya is proportional to our attraction to sinful activities, particularly intoxication, meat-eating, illicit sex, and gambling, and that refraining from these allows us to remain aloof from Maya's influence.

...and mercy are broken. Now, how are they broken? It is described here, they are broken due to rampant irreligion in the form of pride, lust for women and intoxication. So, Prabhupada explains this in the purport very nicely. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, the deluding energy or material nature can act upon the living beings proportionately in terms of the living beings falling prey to the deluding attraction of maya. We are in the material world, the material energy, maya is acting. But maya's action or influence is possible only if we become attracted by maya's allurements to enjoy, engage in sinful activities. Otherwise, if we refrain from sinful activities, particularly in Kali Yuga, four kinds of sinful activities: intoxication, meat eating, illicit sex and gambling. If we refrain from these four pillars of sinful life, then we are in the material world. We are in the material world.

**Key Quote:** "Don't get attracted. Don't get captivated by some, some illusion, illusory energies display of some opportunity for enjoyment in sinful ways. Don't get captivated."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of moths drawn to fire, the speaker explains how Maya captivates conditioned souls with illusions of enjoyment, warning against attraction to sinful activities and emphasizing the need to surrender to the Lord to overcome Maya's power.

Then, we can remain aloof from the influence of maya. So, that will be explained now by Srila Prabhupada in a little more detail. Prabhupada says, there is a standard example given in the scriptures. Moths are captivated by the glaring brightness of light and thus they become prey to the fire. Similarly, the deluding energy, deluding energy means the energy which influences us to become illusioned, is always captivating the conditioned souls to become prey to the fire of delusion. And the various scriptures warn the conditioned souls not to become prey to delusion, but to get rid of it. Don't get attracted. Don't get captivated by some illusion, illusory energies, illusory energies display of some opportunity for enjoyment in sinful ways. Don't get captivated. The Vedas warn us, not to go to the darkness of ignorance, but to the progressive path of light, tamasoma jyotir gama. Tamasoma. Don't remain in darkness or don't go more into darkness. Come out of darkness and go towards light. The Lord himself also warns that the deluding power of material energies is too powerful to overcome. Daivi, Hesha, Gunamayi, Mamamaya, Durakyaya. It's too powerful. Durakyaya. But one who completely surrenders unto the Lord can easily do so, can easily actually overcome. Ma mevaye prapadyante maya metam tarantite.

**Key Quote:** "Such surrender is possible by persons of austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that surrendering to Krishna is not easy but is made possible by practicing austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness, which are the pillars of religious principles, and that surrender is the key to overcoming the illusory energy.

But to surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is also not very easy. Such surrender is possible by persons of austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness. So on the one side are four things. So on the one side are four pillars of sinful life. The deluding energy, the illusory energy is attracting the conditioned souls come enjoy in sinful ways. Other side are the four pillars of religion, religious principles. Now simply avoiding sinful activities alone does not enable a person to surrender to Krishna. That is required. In addition to avoiding sinful activities one has to practice the principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness. Then it is possible to surrender to Krishna. And by surrendering to Krishna one can overcome the influence of the illusory energy completely.

**Key Quote:** "In that age every human being was practically a qualified Brahman of the highest order."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the ideal state of Satya Yuga, where everyone was a qualified Brahman, unaffected by Maya, and how the decline of Brahmanical culture (austerity, cleanliness, mercy, truthfulness) led to the rise of pride, attachment, and intoxication, pushing society away from salvation.

These four principles of advanced civilization were remarkable features in the age of Satya. The first age in the cycle of four yugas. Satya Yuga. In that age every human being was practically a qualified Brahman of the highest order. And in the social orders of life they were all Paramahamsas or the topmost in the renounced order. All human beings were of the topmost class in the Satya Yuga. By cultural standing the human beings were not at all subjected to deluding energy. They were not affected by Maya in Satya Yuga. All the human beings. Such strong men of character were competent enough to get away from the clutches of Maya. But gradually as the principles of Brahmanical culture. What are the principles of Brahmanical culture? Austerity. Cleanliness. Mercy. Truthfulness. Austerity is Tapa. Shaucham. Tapa is austerity. Shaucham is cleanliness. Daya is mercy. Satya is truthfulness. As these principles became curtailed by proportionate development of pride, attachment for women and intoxication.

The path of salvation or the path of transcendental bliss retreated far far away from human society. With the progression of the age of Kali people are becoming very proud. They are becoming too much attached to women. Women means I will explain this. And intoxication. Here women means objects of enjoyment, especially objects of sex pleasure. This characteristic of Kali Yuga. People are more and more and more after sex pleasure. And they are very easily become attached and attracted, attracted and hence attached to enjoyment with the member of the opposite sex, whether women or men. Women are attracted to men and men are attracted to women for sex pleasure.

**Key Quote:** "Even a pauper is proud of his penny."
**Summary:** The speaker continues describing Kali Yuga, noting that even the poorest are proud of their possessions, women dress attractively to entice men, and people are addicted to intoxication, leading to irreligiosity and corruption that cannot be solved by laws alone.

This is the characteristic of Kali Yuga. By the influence of the age of Kali, Srila Prabhupada explains further. Even a pauper is proud of his penny, as far as pride is concerned. There is no reason to be proud for a person who has very very very little money in his possession. But even the poorest of poor fellow, if he gets some money, little, few rupees let's say nowadays, few rupees, he is very proud. Oh I have so much wealth. I am a very rich person. He thinks like that. He becomes proud. The women are always dressed in an overly attractive fashion to victimize the minds of men. You see, the dressing fashion of the women in Kali Yuga, simply to attract men for sex enjoyment. They dress in a very bad way. And the man is addicted to drinking wine, smoking, drinking tea, chewing tobacco, etc. All varieties of intoxication. Hmm. All these habits or so called advanced under civilization are the root causes of all irreligiosities. And therefore it is not possible to check corruption, bribery and nepotism. Lot of people talk about too much corruption. Too much corruption. How to root out this corruption? So the root cause of corruption is being pointed out here. What is it? All these Irreligiosities. If people are addicted to intoxication, they are addicted to sex pleasures, they are addicted to more and more possessions, greed for possessions, because of which they become overly proud of possessing many things, then it is not possible to avoid corruption. Man cannot check all these evils simply by statutory acts and police vigilance.

But he can cure the disease of the mind by the proper medicine. It is actually a disease which is within the mind. This propensity for enjoyment by sinful activities is a disease of the mind. And what is the cure for this? The proper medicine for this disease of the mind. It is the principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness, which have to be followed by people in order to cure the mind of these propensities for sinful enjoyment. Modern civilization and economic development are creating a new situation of poverty and scarcity, with the result of blackmailing the consumers commodities. We can see that so many goods are produced but they are not growing grains. So many factories for manufacturing so many unnecessary things, anartha. But the most essential commodities, specially grains, fruits, vegetables, which is required for even survival of the human beings and the animals, that is not being produced enough.

**Key Quote:** "But it appears that three of your legs are broken due to rampant irreligion in the form of pride, lust for women and intoxication."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (1.17.24) which discusses the decline of dharma in Kali Yuga due to pride, lust, and intoxication.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet Om Namah Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam In this session, we continue to discuss the same words which we discussed in the previous session, the 24th verse of the 17th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is part 2 of discussion of the same words. The verse I will just recite again, the 24th verse. Tapasyaucham Dayasatyam Iti Pada Krite Kritaah Adharma Amshaihi Trayobhagnaha Smayasangamadai Stava The meaning of this verse, the 24th verse. In the age of Satya, in the Satya Yuga or age of truthfulness, your four legs were established by the four principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. But it appears that three of your legs are broken due to rampant irreligion in the form of pride, lust for women and intoxication.

### maya, desire, sinful enjoyment

**Key Quote:** "The influence of Maya is proportionate to the extent to which I become captivated by Maya's allurement for enjoying sinfully."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the influence of Maya is directly related to one's desire for sinful enjoyment.

So in the purport which we discussed in the previous session, part 1 of this presentation of the same verse, it is explained that the influence of Maya is proportionate to the extent to which I become captivated by Maya's allurement for enjoying sinfully. Understand this very carefully. Maya is alluring. Come, enjoy sinfully. And if I think, oh let me enjoy because I am seeking happiness. Let me enjoy, even if it is in a sinful way, let me enjoy. Then I become prey to the influence of Maya. So the scriptures are warning, don't be captivated by Maya's allurement. Now somebody may say, why should Krishna arrange Maya to allure us in the first place? That is because we have desire for enjoying in that sinful way. We have developed that desire. Why are we here in the material world? Because of our desire to enjoy materially. Materially means sinfully. So, if we have desire for enjoyment, then only we will become captivated by Maya's allurement.

### desire, sin, religious principles

**Verse References:** BG 7.11
**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna says, I am sex life, which is in accordance with religious principles."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of a teetotaler and a liquor store, the speaker illustrates how desire makes one susceptible to Maya's allurements and explains that Krishna is sex life which is in accordance with religious principles.

To give a very simple example, if, let us say, you are a complete teetotaller, you completely abstain from drinking any liquor. You don't take any liquor. You are strict in never touching even liquor. Now, you are walking in the market, on the street, when there are so many shops. Now, when you pass by a liquor store, either you don't even pay attention, or if you see, oh, liquor store. Okay, I have nothing to do with it. You just go by, pass by. You have nothing to do with liquor store. But somebody who is addicted to drinking liquor, or liquor store, the moment he sees, or gets the smell, or gets some idea of a liquor store, immediately so much attraction to enter the liquor store, to find out what is new, to buy something, or to taste something, or to consider enjoying some drink, etc. So, like that, the same principle that works in this material world is, if I have a desire in my heart, I want to enjoy sex pleasure. If I have a desire. And that too, I am having a desire to enjoy in sinful ways. Because, Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, dharma aviruddha kamosmi bhara tarshama dharma aviruddha bhuteshu kamosmi bhara tarshama Krishna says, I am sex life, which is in accordance with religious principles. Sex life has a place in this material world to bring forth Krishna conscious progeny, to bring forth devotees. So, sex life is required.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Sinful activity means a sinful reaction."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the consequences of sinful activities and emphasizes the importance of Krishna consciousness as a means to overcome illusion and suffering.

But, if that sex life is indulged in simply for the sake of sex enjoyment, and don't want to take any steps for following the religious principles in engaging in sex, without following the religious principles, simply because some people, they want to enjoy sex life sinfully, then maya captures such people, and then maya punishes them. Sinful activity means a sinful reaction. The laws are very, very stringent. Nobody can avoid it. So, there is suffering, there is punishment for sinful activities, and they are allured by maya because they have deep-rooted desire for sinful enjoyment. So, the Vedas are warning us, do not go to darkness of ignorance, tamaseema, jyotir gama, but go to the progressive path of light. Maya is compared to darkness. Maya hoya andhakaar. Krishna suryasama. Krishna or the spiritual path is compared to light. And if we can come out of darkness by coming into light of Krishna consciousness, then we are completely safe. We are saved from the illusion. No more illusion can bewilder us. No more illusion will allure us. No more illusion will be even present.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the root causes of corruption and imbalance in Kali Yuga, attributing them to a lack of austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness.

Illusion will disappear. Just like darkness can disappear as soon as there is light. So, continue to read the purport from where I stopped in the previous session. Prabhupada was describing that in this age of Kali, there is so much of corruption, bribery, nepotism. Now, what is the root cause of all these evils in Kali Yuga? Nobody likes them. But what is the root cause of all these evils? So, Prabhupada says in this purport that these evils are having a root cause. That is, the people in Kali Yuga not following the principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Spiritual practices meant for material gain is actually a cheating religious system."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that spiritual practices performed for material gain are considered cheating religion and that Krishna never sanctions money for material enjoyment.

The modern civilization and economic development in this present age, they are creating so much of imbalance in the life of people. So much of imbalance. Imbalance, that means no balance between material and spiritual activities. No balance. Practically, no spiritual activities. Or even if somebody is practicing some spiritual life, it is simply very, very meager or it is simply for the sake of these material benefits. So, Bhagavatam declares spiritual practices meant for material gain is actually a cheating religious system. Dharma projjita kaitava atra. Bhagavatam rejects all such materially motivated religious systems. That means, going and praying to a devata or Krishna, simply I want money for material enjoyment. This is kaitava dharma. This is cheating religion. Krishna never sanctions as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, money for material enjoyment. Krishna never sanctions. And the devatas, they simply are bound by the laws of nature to award according to certain rules, certain regulations. So, they cannot consider

**Key Quote:** "If the leaders and rich men of the society spend 50% of their accumulated wealth mercifully for the misled mass of people and educate them in God Consciousness, the knowledge of Bhagavatam, certainly the age of Kali will be defeated in its attempt to entrap the conditioned souls."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how wealth and power can be used for religious or irreligious purposes and suggests that leaders and rich individuals should dedicate a significant portion of their wealth to educating people in God consciousness to counteract the negative influence of Kali Yuga.

or they do not consider or they cannot consider the merit of the person who is praying for certain benefit. They cannot consider the devatas. So, if somebody is approaching a devata, according to the Vedic descriptions, for getting some wealth, then they will get the wealth if they follow all the rules and regulations. Now, after getting the wealth, how they utilize the wealth, the devata cannot actually regulate. Devata cannot regulate. So, it is up to the person who has got wealth or who has got power or who has got some knowledge, or who has got some resource. How to utilize that resource? The resource can be utilized in a religious way or an irreligious way. Now, Kali Yuga, the influence of Kali is such that the sinful desires are too many and there are too many opportunities for fulfilling the sinful desires in sinful ways because the people are sinfully inclined to enjoy material. So, Srila Prabhupada says, if the leaders and rich men of the society spend 50% of their accumulated wealth mercifully for the misled mass of people and educate them in God Consciousness, the knowledge of Bhagavatam, certainly the age of Kali will be defeated in its attempt to entrap the conditioned souls.

**Key Quote:** "The preaching of Bhagavatam principles will automatically cleanse away the dirt in the heart of the people and make people austere, clean, both inside and outside, merciful to the suffering and truthful in daily behavior."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of disseminating the knowledge of Bhagavatam to cleanse people's hearts and establish the principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness, ultimately leading to peace in society.

There is a solution. The rich people, the powerful people, should spend 50% of their wealth for educating the common people in Krishna Consciousness. Simply through disseminating this Bhagavatam, knowledge given in the Bhagavatam, the attractive pastimes of Krishna and his pure devotees, making people hear that, making people hear Sankirtana, chant Hare Krishna, nice music, nice japa, and distributing prasadam, then people's mind will become cleansed of the dirt accumulated due to the influence of Kali. And then Maya will be defeated. Kali will be defeated and Maya will be defeated. And also Prabhupada says here, false pride or too high an estimation of one's own values of life, undue attachment to women or association with them, simply for the sake of sex pleasure, and intoxication, addiction to intoxication, will divert human civilization from the path of peace. However much people may clamor for peace in the world, people want peace. But simply if you simply desire peace and have big peace conferences and peace talks and peace propagation of peaceful way of living, that's not going to work as long as people's heart is contaminated by desire for sex enjoyment, sinful activities, you cannot have peace in the society at all. The preaching of Bhagavatam principles will automatically cleanse away the dirt in the heart of the people and make people austere, clean, both inside and outside, merciful to the suffering and truthful in daily behavior. These four principles or pillars of religion are automatically established by preaching the Bhagavatam principles. This is the way of correcting the flaws in the human society. This is what Prabhupada is teaching us in this purport. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Kali Yuga began about 5,000 years ago when Krishna appeared at the end of Dwapar Yuga."
**Summary:** This segment introduces the Kali Yuga, its duration, its beginning with Krishna's departure, and its influence of godlessness, which was initially mitigated by Krishna conscious kings.

This chapter is entitled Punishment and Reward of Kali. Kali represents the Kali Yuga, the present age. Time is passing on this earth planet and is measured in terms of the number of years, a particular age called Yuga. It's a very, very big time period. Like Kali Yuga, the present age, lasts 432,000 years or we can say 4,32,000 years. Kali Yuga began about 5,000 years ago when Krishna appeared at the end of Dwapar Yuga. Kali Yuga and Krishna went back to his personal abode after winding up his pastimes. The day Krishna left this earth planet and went back to his personal kingdom, that is when Kali Yuga began. But the influence of the age of Kali, which is to bring in godlessness, but the influence was actually not felt by the people because of the wonderful administration of Parikshit Maharaj and similar Krishna conscious kings.

### Punishment, Cow Protection, Lawlessness, Slaughterhouses

**Key Quote:** "In a civilization where God is conspicuously banished and there is no devotee warrior like Arjuna the associates of the age of Kali take advantage of this lawless kingdom and arrange to kill innocent animals like the cow in secluded slaughterhouses."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Parikshit Maharaj's punishment of Kali, highlighting the importance of cow protection and drawing a parallel between the beating of a cow in seclusion and the modern-day slaughter of cows in slaughterhouses due to a godless society.

So the sixth verse. The meaning of this verse is, you rogue. It is Parikshit Maharaj addressing that Kali Purusha, the personality of Kali, who is beating a common bull in a secluded place. Parikshit is addressing that Kali Purusha. The meaning of this verse is, you rogue. Do you dare beat an innocent cow because Lord Krishna and Arjuna, the carrier of Gandiva bow, are out of sight? Since you are beating the innocent in a secluded place, you are considered a culprit and therefore deserve to be killed. So the king is pointing out the action of this Kali Purusha is a criminal act and therefore he deserves to be killed, death sentence or death penalty, because an innocent cow is beaten in a secluded place, so the cow should be given all kinds of protection against any harm, including even just beating the cow. So in the purport Srila Prabhupada says, "In a civilization where God is conspicuously banished and there is no devotee warrior like Arjuna, the associates of the age of Kali take advantage of this lawless kingdom and arrange to kill innocent animals like the cow in secluded..."

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Our present civilization is more or less a godless civilization as far as the rulers are concerned."
**Summary:** This segment compares the present civilization to the beginning of Kali Yuga, emphasizing the absence of God in governance, the disregard for Dharma Shastras, and the resulting lawless kingdom where innocent animals are killed in secluded slaughterhouses.

Srila Prabhupada is comparing the present day status of the society is somewhat similar to the situation being described which Parikshita encountered the beginning of Kali Yuga. So our present civilization is more or less a godless civilization as far as the rulers are concerned. Those in power, political power or those in governmental authority, they don't conduct the state in terms of the codes given by God, the codes given in our authorized Vedic scriptures. They don't conduct the state in terms of the codes given by God, the codes given in our authorized Vedic scriptures. In short, they don't conduct the governance in accordance with the Dharma Shastras: The Manu Smriti, Parashara Smriti, or Yajna Valkya Smriti. Perfect codes are given, perfect laws are given. They are not man-made laws. They are given by liberated souls. They are not man-made laws. They are given by liberated souls. They are not man-made laws. They are given by liberated souls. So there is no mistake in them. Neither there is any need to amend those laws from time to time. There is no need of any amendment. They are perfect laws. So these present day rulers in this Kali Yuga especially, God is conspicuously banished from their governance. It's a godless state. And the person's ruling are not exactly like Arjuna or Pariksit Maharaj in terms of conducting the state affairs in order to maintain law and order. They don't conduct themselves properly. Then, as Prabhupada says here, the associates of the age of Kali take advantage of this lawless kingdom and arrange to kill innocent animals like the cow in secluded slaughterhouses.

### Animal Murder, Death Penalty, Pious King, Comparison to Child Murder

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Such murderers of animals stand to be condemned to death by the order of a pious king like Maharaj Pariksit."
**Summary:** This segment condemns the killing of animals as murder, punishable by death according to a pious king like Parikshit Maharaj, drawing a comparison to the murder of an innocent child in a secluded place.

Nobody knows how the cow suffers in the slaughterhouse. Formerly the killing was done in the butcher shop if at all animals were to be killed for meat. But now, especially in the modernized states where modern technology is employed, the people eat packed meat and they think it is like packed vegetables or packed biscuits or packed grains. Like that they think. No, it is not that. It is very cruel killing of the animals who suffer so much. Such murderers of animals. See the word Prabhupada uses is murder. That means somebody who is supposed to be protected is being killed unlawfully. Is being killed unlawfully. So such murderers of animals stand to be condemned to death by the order of a pious king like Maharaj Pariksit. Pariksit Maharaj will not tolerate such a killing. He doesn't even tolerate a beating of a cow. What to speak of killing an animal like cow. For a pious king the culprit who kills an animal in a secluded place is punishable by the death penalty exactly like a murderer who kills an innocent child in a secluded place. Prabhupada gives a comparison. If a child is killed it is helpless. Supposing it is killed by some rogue. That is the term used by Prabhupada for this Kali Purusha who is beating an innocent cow in a secluded place. So it is exactly like killing a child. Same way if a child is killed, innocent child is killed in a secluded place, then the murderer is punishable by the death sentence. Exactly like that. Even the one who harms a cow should be actually punished by death penalty.

**Summary:** This segment focuses on Parikshit Maharaj questioning the bull with only one leg, wondering if it is a demigod trying to communicate a message of impending misfortune.

The seventh verse: Tvamva brunala dhavalaha paadai niunah. padacharan vrisharoopena kim kashchid devonah parikhedayan. The meaning is, then he, Maharaj Pariksit, asked the bull, "O who are you? Are you a bull as white as a white lotus? Or are you a demigod? You have lost three of your legs and are moving on one only. Are you some demigod causing us grief in the form of a bull?" So Pariksit Maharaj is next questioning the bull, because the bull was not exactly like an ordinary bull, as white as a white lotus. So very, very beautiful to look at, except that it had lost three legs and it was moving on only one leg. So what was this bull trying to communicate? So he is wondering whether it is simply a bull or is it a devata who has come in the form of a bull to communicate something. "Are you some demigod causing us grief in the form of a bull?" Indicating some misfortune, some bad time is going to come, or is foreboding some danger for such innocent animals.

**Key Quote:** "At least up to the time of Maharaj Pariksit no one could imagine the wretched conditions of the cow and the bull."
**Summary:** This segment highlights the protection given to cows and bulls during Parikshit Maharaj's reign, emphasizing the astonishment at seeing their suffering and connecting it to the duties of a Vaisya as described in the Bhagavad Gita.

So in the purport Srila Prabhupada says, "At least up to the time of Maharaj Pariksit no one could imagine the wretched conditions of the cow and the bull." Maharaj Pariksit's time the cows and bulls were specially protected as much as the citizens, human beings were protected completely by the powerful rulers like the Pandavas, Pariksit Maharaj. They were perfectly giving protection to those deserving protection, the human beings and the cows and the bulls. Maharaj Pariksit therefore was astonished to see such a horrible scene. How dare somebody beat a cow and who has cut off the legs of the bull? Why is the bull standing on one leg? So Pariksit Maharaj inquired whether the bull was not a demigod assuming such a wretched condition to indicate the future of the cow and the bull. Some message is being communicated, that's what Pariksit thought. It's a very, very unusual scene in Pariksit's kingdom where perfect law and order was enforced by the powerful Emperor Pariksit based on the Dharma Shastras. In the Bhagavad Gita Krishna says, krishi go raksha vanijam vaisya karma svabhavajam. A vaisya is supposed to protect cows, engage in agricultural activity and trade and commerce for the upkeep of the society, civilized society. So he is inquiring, Pariksit is inquiring from the bull, "Are you a devata who is trying to give us some indication so that I may take some action, I may correct something?"

See the kings were so very sensitive and they would go around and see what is the condition of the people or the animals even which deserve protection, what is happening in their kingdom, they would go on a tour, sometimes they would go incognito to find out the reality. So like this the explanation is being given in the Bhagavad Gita, the beginning of the age of Kali and the symptoms of Kali Yuga and 12th canto details are given of the symptoms of Kali Yuga and this solution is also given to overcome the defects of Kali Yuga, what is to be done, that is also explained in this chapter and in the Bhagavatam in general. I will stop here, thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains the 8th verse of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on the king's duty to protect citizens and the unprecedented nature of suffering in Parikshit Maharaj's kingdom.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 8th and 9th verses of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madhavagavatam. The 8th verse is as follows: Najatu Kauravendranam Dordanda Parirambhite Bhutale Anupatanti Asmin Vinate Praninam Shuchaha. The meaning of this verse is: Now, for the first time in a kingdom well protected by the arms of the kings of the Kuru dynasty, I see you grieving with tears in your eyes. Up till now, no one on earth has ever shed tears because of royal negligence. Parikshit Maharaj is clearly saying that the rulers were so perfect that those deserving protection never had to worry about being neglected by the king or by the government. The law enforcement by the powerful rulers, nobody had to fear any such upstart who would harm the cows or the bulls. Only the human beings did that. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The protection of the lives of both the human beings and animals is the first and foremost duty of a government." Why is the government there at all? It is to give protection to the life. Human life is very precious. This what repeatedly we have heard. It is to give self protection to the life human life is very precious. This is what repeatedly we have heard.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of cow protection and Brahmanical culture for spiritual advancement, highlighting the value of human life for God realization and the role of cow's milk in developing finer brain tissues.

The scriptures, all the scriptures, they say human life is very, very important, so is the life of the cow and the bull, equally important. Why? Human life, as you have heard, is specially meant for God realization, for making a permanent solution to all problems of material existence by becoming God conscious, very simple. And to help us to become God conscious, there is the Brahmanical culture which has to be, which has to be maintained by the spiritual practice, and then the spiritual practice has to be maintained by the spiritual practice, and then the spiritual practice has to be maintained, it has to be maintained brahmanical culture. And Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is described as namo brahmanya devaya go brahmana hitayaja go brahmana hitayaja. Krishna wants to see that the cows and the brahmanas are especially protected. This is called brahmanical culture because the brahmanas are meant to give direction to the human society to become God-conscious, make spiritual advancement, and get out of this material existence in the human form of life. And for that, the protection for the cow which gives the miracle food, the milk, cow's milk, very, very important for developing the finer brain tissue.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the government's duty to protect animals, particularly cows and bulls, and laments the organized animal killing prevalent in the age of Kali, especially in Western countries.

Issues to understand spiritual subject matter. So when it is said the lives of both the human beings and animals is first and foremost duty for government, animals particularly refers to cows, cows and bulls, go rupture, that's what is said in the Bhagavad-Gita also. A government must not discriminate in such principles. It's not that only human beings are important and the animals not not important. They don't think it is precious life of an of a cow. They don't think it's very precious. If it is useful you may keep it, if it is not useful you can do whatever you want. So that is very, very wrong. Such a policy by the government, the government is no longer a law to protect the animals. So government must give protection to the cows and bulls as much as the government is meant for giving protection to the human beings. It is simply horrible for a pure-hearted soul to see organized animal killing by the state in this age of Kali. Brahma is talking about pure devotees. Pure devotees, they just can't even imagine that organized animal killing is going on in this age of Kali, supported by the government, supported by the government, especially in the western countries. And there are slaughterhouses where millions of cows are killed and the government is having no laws to protect these animals, innocent animals. People have become heartless and the government also is equally heartless in matter of killing such innocent animals and they suffer so much, they suffer like the human being, like the human being because they have developed.

Consciousness, they developed consciousness. Maharaj Pariksit was lamenting for the tears in the eyes of the bull. See, Pariksit Maharaj is so sensitive because he is Krishna conscious, is a pure devotee. So he feels for the bull expressing its suffering condition through tears in the eyes. If a animal is crying it's because it is suffering, it deserves to be protected, deserves to be to be given some relief from suffering by in a helpless condition is appealing for help. So the caretakers, the protectors, just like the Bhagavad Gita it says Vaishyas, they are meant for cow protection, they should give protection. So Maharaj Pariksit was feeling very, very bad about this suffering that the bull is undergoing and he was astonished to see such an unprecedented thing in his good kingdom.

He heard before this the description was there he had the glorification of the devotees of Krishna, the Pandavas, how nicely they were ruling, everybody was happy, there was prosperity. Earlier chapters described that Krishna particularly arranged the battle of Kurukshetra to to change the rule from Duryodhana's rule to Yudhishthira's rule. Krishna always wants devotees to rule Rajarishi. Krishna instructed the devotees to rule Rajarishi. Krishna instructed the devotees to rule Rajarishi the Bhagavad Gita to the Sun God and later on to Arjuna. Why Sun God? Because he is the ruler of the Sun planet and his descendants are coming in the in the dynasty Suryavamsa dynasty of kings and the there are also another set of rulers coming in the Chandra Vamsa the descendants of the moon dynasty Chandra Vamsa. The Supreme Lord himself appeared in Suryavamsa and Chandra Vamsa. He appeared as Lord Rama in Suryavamsa and he appeared as Krishna in the Chandra Vamsa.

Rishi means saintly by their conduct, by their behavior, by their character saintly persons.

**Key Quote:** "protection of bulls and cows and all other animals can be possible only when there is a state ruled by an executive head like Maharaj Pariksit"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of cow protection in state administration, highlighting Parikshit Maharaj's example and explaining the concept of Surabhi cows in the spiritual realm.

Men, there is no cause for you to cry, everything will be good for you. In the purport, Prabhupada says protection of bulls and cows and all other animals can be possible only when there is a state ruled by an executive head like Maharaj Pariksit. So the protection for the bulls and cows as very very important aspect of the state administration is understood by a God conscious king. Maharaj Pariksit addresses the cow as mother for he is a cultured twice-born kshatriya king, you Amba, that's the way the cow is addressed, mother. Amba means mother. So why? Because he is a qualified kshatriya, is a qualified kshatriya, he's undergone the cultural birth, the second birth dvija by being initiated spiritually initiated, that is the meaning. Surabhi is the name of the cows which exist in the spiritual planets and are especially reared by Lord Shri Krishna himself in Krishna's personal about Goloka. Goloka means the place where cows are specially reared by Krishna by protected by Krishna. They are called Surabhi cows. As men are made after the form and features of the Supreme Lord Krishna, so also the cows are made after the form and features of the Surabhi cows and the kingdom. So the cows on this earth planet what we see they are made after the form and features of Surabhi cows in Krishna's personal about. In the material world the human society gives all protection to the human being but there is no law to protect the descendants Surabhi.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the importance of cow protection, emphasizing the nutritional value of milk and the need for strict punishment for cow killers, ultimately linking cow protection to societal peace and well-being.

All right, now these descendants Surabhi, the cows can give all protection to men by supplying the miracle food milk. Many times Prabhupada is pointed out miracle food milk. It is complete nutrition for the human being. It is most important for development of finer brain tissues to understand spiritual subject matter. But Maharaj Pariksit and the Pandavas were fully conscious of the importance of the carven bull and they were prepared to punish the cow killer with all chastisement including death. So the cow and bull needs to be there in such a way that anybody even attempts to harm the cow or the bull immediately they will be killed, death penalty. There has been some times agitation for protection of cows but because there are no pious executive heads and suitable laws the cow and the bull are not given proper protection in our present times. The human should society should recognize the importance of the cow and bull and thus give all protection to these important animals following in the footsteps of Maharaj Pariksit. See the Bhagavatham is the ideal suggesting the ideal way of ruling the state ideal way of conducting oneself. So Krishna will be pleased when the cows are protected and the brahmanas are protected and Krishna will bestow real peace on the carver and the bull and the cow upon human society in such a situation otherwise we cannot expect peace there will always be.

**Key Quote:** "Although Murari heard these divine glories of Krishna from the Lord himself, his heart remained steadfastly fixed on his eternal master Lord Ramachandra."
**Summary:** The story of Lord Chaitanya testing Murari Gupta's devotion to Lord Rama and recognizing him as an incarnation of Hanuman.

When Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu one day appeared in ecstasy as the Varaha Murti, Murari Gupta offered him nice prayers. Murari Gupta gave Zuvar posso kepada Sat-Siat Rao one time. Once Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu glorified Murari Gupta for his unflinching devotion and loyalty to Lord Rama Chandra because Murari Gupta was a great devotee of Lord Rama. In Mahaprakasha form, Lord Chaitanya appeared before Murari Gupta as Lord Ramachandra. Just to test Murari's faith, he repeatedly encouraged Murari Gupta to shift his worship from Lord Rama to Lord Krishna, describing the unparalleled sweetness, supremacy, and all-attractive nature of Shri Krishna, who is the origin of all incarnations and the reservoir of all transcendental qualities and pleasure. Although Murari heard these divine glories of Krishna from the Lord himself, his heart remained steadfastly fixed on his eternal master Lord Ramachandra. Murari, being utterly devoted, could not imagine giving up the service of Lord Rama's lotus feet. That night he was deeply troubled, weeping continuously and praying that death might take him before he was forced to abandon his worship of Lord Ramachandra. He spent the entire night awake, overwhelmed by distress. The next morning Murari approached Lord Chaitanya, fell at his feet, and humbly confessed that though he desired to please the Lord, he could not forsake Lord Ramachandra, for he had sold his head and heart to Lord Rama's service. Torn between obedience to Chaitanya's command and loyalty to Lord Ramachandra, Murari begged for death as his only release. Hearing this pure devotion, Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu became overjoyed. Embracing Murari Gupta, Lord Chaitanya praised his unwavering faith, declaring that such steadfast devotion is a true hallmark of a servant. The Lord revealed that his repeated persuasion was merely a test to demonstrate Murari's deep, unbreakable attachment to Lord Ramachandra.

**Key Quote:** "If a wrong person has got some skill, he can misuse it."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why Dronacharya asked Ekalavya for his thumb as Guru Dakshina, relating it to the idea that unqualified individuals may misuse knowledge or skills, similar to the concept of Shudras not being taught the Vedas.

Why did Dronacharya ask Ekalavya to give his thumb as Guru Dakshina? Is it to show the importance of surrendering to Guru or is it because Ekalavya was violating social order? Actually, Ekalavya was not a proper qualified person to have that skill of shooting arrows. If a wrong person has got some skill, he can misuse it. It is just like it is said in the scriptures itself. Shudras are not taught the Vedas. Why? That's because the Shudras don't have the intelligence to properly utilize the Vedic knowledge and use it for everyone's welfare, good. They may misuse it for some bad purposes or wrong purposes. It is just like somebody is a terrorist, he should not have weapons because he will misuse it like that. So, Ekalavya was not actually qualified to have the skill of shooting arrows. So, by asking him to give his thumb as Guru Dakshina, Dronacharya actually cut down his ability to use that skill, because the thumb is very important in actually shooting using a bow and arrow. So, that way he curtailed his usage for the social good, for the good of everyone else.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the significance of Vaikuntha Ekadashi and passing through Vaikuntha Dwaara, emphasizing that it should remind us to make Vaikuntha our destination after death and to understand our spiritual nature.

It is said that by passing through Vaikuntha Dwaara, one can attain Vaikuntha, where can we find the source of the statement? This is said in one of the Puranas. Now, the significance of Vaikuntha Ekadashi, the day on which this festival is celebrated, especially in Vishnu temples, that one can pass through Vaikuntha Dwaara, that is to remind us that our destination should be Vaikuntha after quitting this body. And to make our destination as Vaikuntha is the correct goal of life. Otherwise, people either they do not have a goal of life in the sense that when we quit this body, which we are forced to do at the time of death, then where do I go? That people do not even know that they are spirit, soul and they are eternal. That itself they do not know. So, this is a particular important point that you understand. Attaining Vaikuntha means you understand I am spirit, soul. I don't die at the time of death. I change body. So, if I prepare myself, I can get a spiritual body and in that spiritual body I can attain Vaikuntha Loka. For eternal life full of bliss and knowledge that is awaiting us. If we want to go there, if we understand the importance of practicing Bhakti in order to go there,

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the need to purify our consciousness from material contamination to attain Vaikuntha, highlighting that material desires prevent us from entering the spiritual world.

So, merely doing a ritual of passing through Vaikuntha Dwaara is not enough. Passing through Vaikuntha Dwaara is to remind ourselves that we should prepare our consciousness by purifying it of all material contamination. So, the Supreme Lord is very eager to take us back to his personal abode called Vaikuntha. And he wants us to qualify. Qualify in what sense? Due to long association with this material nature, our consciousness has become polluted by material desires, by material reactions, by material contamination. So, to purify this is essential. As long as we have material contamination or material desires, we have to keep taking birth in this material world. Because those desires can be fulfilled only in this material world. Material contamination is not permitted in the spiritual world. Spiritual world, everything is spiritual. The Supreme Lord is completely spiritual. His abode is completely spiritual. The devotees are completely spiritually situated. So, everything is spiritual there. Nothing is material. So, therefore, we have to prepare ourselves. And anyway, that is our original position. As spirit soul, we belong to the spiritual world. We have a relationship with the Supreme Lord in his personal abode. And he is our maintainer. He is our protector. He is our well-wisher. He is our everything in the spiritual world. But then if we remain with this material desires or material comforts or material aspirations, then we cannot leave this world and go away.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how to remember Krishna's form, particularly through deity worship and connecting with Krishna's teachings, to prepare for approaching the spiritual kingdom.

So, please remember, this going through Vaikuntha Dwara is to remind us that prepare yourself before death comes. Become Krishna conscious. And be ready to go to the abode of the Supreme Lord Vaikuntha. Next question. In the introduction to Bhagavad Gita As It Is, Srila Prabhupada says, if one remembers the form of Krishna at a time of death, he can approach the spiritual kingdom. What is this form and how to remember? Okay. The form of Krishna, Krishna is present in several different forms. The easiest way to understand form of Krishna is the form of the deity of Krishna, Krishna Vikraha, Archa Vikraha. You go to any temple of Krishna, there is the Krishna deity. Deity, Vikraha. So, that is one form of Krishna, the particular deity in a particular temple. So, remembering that form, how do you remember that form? When you go to the temple, you completely concentrate your attention on the form of Krishna as the deity and get the impression in your heart. And carry that impression with you even after you die. Even after you leave the temple and go away to your home or office and remember that form and pray and hear the glories of Krishna from the Bhagavatam. Learn the instructions of Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. All this you connect with that remembrance of the form of Krishna. Krishna is my supreme well-wisher. Krishna is my maintainer. Krishna is my beloved Lord. Krishna is the ultimate source of everything. Krishna is full of all unlimited good qualities. Like this, thinking of Krishna, talking about Krishna, remembering Krishna's form within the heart and hearing about Krishna, taking Krishna Prasadam, worshipping the deity of Krishna or picture of the deity of Krishna, all this actually prepares us

**Key Quote:** "Maha Vishnu first appears, enters the material energy which is lying in a dormant condition, unmanifest condition."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the process of material creation, starting with Maha Vishnu entering the dormant material energy and leading to the birth of Brahma from Garbhodaka Shaini Vishnu.

In the third canto, when Lord Brahma offers His praise to Vishnu, did He offer the prayers before the material creation or after the creation? Now the material creation it's a long process. It begins with the Supreme Lord incarnating in this material world, in the material energy. The Lord enters as the first Vishnu form from the spiritual world who descends into this material energy. So that is called Karanodaka Shaini Vishnu, also called Maha Vishnu. So Maha Vishnu first appears, enters the material energy which is lying in a dormant condition, unmanifest condition. That means at that time there are no universes. Previous destruction took place and there was only the material energy. So that energy first of all Maha Vishnu enters. Then Maha Vishnu agitates that energy and the energy becomes activated by Maha Vishnu's glance. And then after Maha Vishnu's glance, first of all the agitation produces Mahatatva. And Mahatatva differentiates the elements. And those elements are combined to form varieties of material objects, material planets. And then from there is one expansion of this Maha Vishnu called Padmanabha Vishnu or Garbhodaka Shaini Vishnu. So that Garbhodaka Shaini Vishnu from his navel one lotus flower is born. On that Brahma is created by Vishnu.

**Key Quote:** "Brahma then understands that he is to do the secondary creation. What is secondary creation? The primary creation is the creation of the ingredients for the creation."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Brahma's role in secondary creation, which involves creating bodies for living entities, after Vishnu has already created the elements.

And Brahma after his creation, he doesn't know who he is, he doesn't know where he is, he doesn't know what he is supposed to do. So he began searching out for a source and he begins contemplation. Who am I? Where have I come from? What am I supposed to do? Etc, etc. So then Lord Vishnu actually who is seated in the heart of Brahma, he enlightens Brahma, gives knowledge to Brahma and Brahma then understands that he is to do the secondary creation. What is secondary creation? The primary creation is the creation of the ingredients for the creation. That is all the elements earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence, objects, everything is the elements. That is done by Maha Vishnu through agitation of the material energy. Then Brahma, birth of Brahma is done by Garboda Darsahi Vishnu. Then Brahma is given knowledge and enlightenment by Vishnu. Then Brahma can create the living entities, the bodies, living entities means the bodies, he can give the bodies for the living entities. By bringing forth the different varieties of the species. So that gives the bodies to the living entities or helping them take birth in this material world. So that is the work of creation of Brahma. After Brahma is born and already Vishnu has done the work of creation to the point of generating the elements, then Brahma actually does the further work of creation of generating the living beings with their proper bodies in the different planets that take birth according to their past karma. That is work of Brahma to generate the living entities. So before he can actually generate the living entities, he offers prayers to Vishnu

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Brahma's prayers to Vishnu before creating living entities, expressing sorrow for their inevitable suffering and the cycle of birth and death.

that he may not become entangled. That he feels sorry for the living beings that he has to be responsible for giving them bodies through which they will no doubt get some enjoyment but they will also have to suffer so many miseries. He feels very sorry for them and he also sees their condition is going to be like they are born in when they are born they are ignorant and foolishly they become busy with material enjoyment and they remain in ignorance and after death again and again they keep taking birth but at the time of dissolution of the whole universe they again are helplessly absorbed in the material energy and they remain dormant like that for billions and billions of years and again they come out again they are busy with material enjoyment. So they can remain in this cycle unless they are rescued by a pure devotee or the Lord himself. So therefore the prayers offered by Brahma is after the initial phase of, different phases of the creation are done by the two Vishnus and then Brahma's work has to begin of generating the living beings given the material body that is the work of creation of Brahma and that happened before he has to do that he offers nice prayers to

**Summary:** The speaker addresses the question of how Lord Shiva, being a pure devotee, can be said to not know he was created by Krishna, explaining that Shiva's knowledge is limited when he acts as a devata.

Next question. In Bhagavad Gita 10.8 purport second last it is mentioned the patriarch patriarch Shiva and others let me open that 10.8 yeah are created by me though they do not know that they are created by me because they are deluded kindly explain kindly explain kindly explain how Lord Shiva being a pure devotee cannot know that he was created by the Supreme Lord. Now Krishna is the ultimate source of everyone and everything that is explained in all the scriptures including Bhagavad Gita and the Vedanta Sutra and the Srimad Bhagavatam and everything else. Okay now when Shiva appears at a certain stage of the creation process now Shiva appears either as the son of Brahma or he appears as the generated personality from Garbhodakshayi Vishnu in either case Shiva is not aware that he is part of a process of creation initiated by the Supreme Lord only that he does not know so as a pure devotee Shiva is actually situated in pure devotional service therefore he is always enlightened as a pure devotee but when he plays the role of a devata then his knowledge is limited his powers are limited

his specific duty as the devata is also well defined he has certain limited amount of power which he can exercise as a devata like that so how is it that Lord Shiva being a pure devotee cannot know he is created by the Supreme Lord in his role as a devata he plays the role of a devata because he is a pure devotee to assist the Supreme Lord he is ready to do any seva so one of the services he does is he plays the part of a devata and many different forms of Shiva are there in this material world as devata many forms the Rudra forms there are 11 incarnations or forms of Rudra for different functions different purposes in this material world material world is very complex huge manifestation so the forms of the Rudras are actually forms of Shiva only so that way Shiva is actually playing the part of a devata and as a devata he does not know everything or details about who is Krishna what are the powers of Krishna how Krishna is the source Krishna is the ultimate control he does not know

why are personalities other than Vishnu addressed as Bhagavan in Srimad Bhagavatam Bhagavan the word Bhagavan originally applies only to the Supreme Lord Vishnu and his expansions Krishna Rama Narasimha etc now Bhagavan can also be used for a person who is exceptionally powerful in the material world and therefore Shiva is addressed as Bhagavan sometimes sometimes great devotees are addressed as Bhagavan that is because of their extraordinary qualities extraordinary service they have to render like Narada he is empowered to preach devotional service in the entire universe he travels freely and he tries to preach but most people are not interested in devotional service so he will not always have a opportunity or a favorable situation to preach but he keeps searching for somebody who may be interested in the whole universe he travels and whoever shows interest he preaches to them makes them first class devotees example is Prahlad Maharaj so many examples there in the Bhagavatam so such great personalities as Narada Shiva pure devotee they are also addressed as Bhagavan indicating that they are extraordinarily empowered or very very powerful due to their being confidential servants of the supreme therefore they are also addressed as Bhagavan that means extraordinarily powerful extraordinarily empowered by the supreme

question Lord Kalki will appear at the conjunction of the two yugas what does conjunction mean conjunction means the junction sandhya it's called yuga sandhya just like in the evening after the sun sets still there is some light before it becomes fully dark so before the night begins or before the day ends completely there is one period where the sun is set but it is not fully dark so this short period about 15 minutes or 20 minutes is called sayam sandhya it's called dusk or twilight so that day is coming to an end night is beginning same thing happens in the similar thing happens in the morning when the sun before it rises there is already some light on the horizon eastern horizon so that is the night is ending and the day is beginning but it is not like night is over day has begun no it's not like that there is a overlap period so that overlap period is called conjunction of the day and night or night ending early morning it's night ending and evening it is conjunction of the day and night similarly the dwapar yuga is going to end and kali yuga is going to begin but when dwapar yuga ends there is some symptoms by which we can understand dwapar yuga is coming to a close and kali yuga symptoms start appearing gradually so that certain number of years is called the yuga sandhya or conjunction of the two yugas one is ending other one is beginning that's a conjunction so there is little overlap sometime

**Summary:** The speaker addresses a question about temple renovation, clarifying that Krishna temples are also being renovated and improved, citing examples in Vrindavan and Jagannath Puri.

Next question, we see that Modiji is developing many places like Varanasi, Somnath. In Gujarat, main Dwaraka temple or place of Krishna not being recognized, is it possible for him to be renovated? Is his observation correct? No, this observation is not correct because in Vrindavan, lot of work is happening to improve the dilapidated condition of so many temples and also in Jagannath Puri, so much of renovation and improvement is happening in the Jagannath temple. One of the most important Vaishnava temples in the world. In Vrindavan, Vaishnava Kshetras, lot of work is happening. So, it's not true that only some places, it appears the way you're asking as if only place connected Shiva are being taken up and Krishna's temples are neglected. That's not true. It's not true at all. It's not correct. Even the temples of Krishna being taken up for improvement and renovation in

**Key Quote:** "Nothing is complex in spiritual subject matter. It is just that it has to be properly explained by a self-realized person, just like Prabhupada explains."
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the question of understanding complex spiritual matters, stating that nothing is complex if properly explained by a self-realized person like Prabhupada, and emphasizing the need to prepare one's consciousness and clear misconceptions.

Even Jagannath Puri very, very big work is going on. I was there in Jagannath Puri about two weeks back and saw so much of work is happening. Lot of work is happening. It's going to be totally different in another one or one and a half years. Lot of work is happening. Next question, is it correct to think that the only way to properly understand complex spiritual matters is by giving up this material body and acquiring the spiritual body? Yes. No, actually, nothing is complex in spiritual subject matter. It is just that it has to be properly explained by a self-realized person, just like Prabhupada explains. Everything he explains very, very simple words and very clearly. Nothing which Prabhupada has written is complex or difficult to understand. That is one thing. Second thing is, we have to actually prepare our consciousness to receive this knowledge without any misconceptions about ourself or misconceptions about Krishna. So to clear the heart of these misconceptions is also a part of preparing oneself to properly

**Key Quote:** "The correct way to understand spiritual subject matter is to prepare oneself by purification of the heart. What is this purification? To clear away the misconceptions which we have developed by long association with this material nature."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain how to understand spiritual matters, emphasizing the importance of purifying the heart by clearing away misconceptions through chanting Hare Krishna and understanding Prabhupada's teachings.

If I think I'm the body. If my goal in life is some material sense gratification, many of these things will not make sense to me, even though it is written in a simple way, like Prabhupada and Krishna and Sukhadeva Goswami always explain, you are not the body, you are spirit soul. So somebody who is materialistic will think, what is the spirit soul? I don't agree. I think I am the body. There's nothing beyond the body. Like that, they will not understand. Either they will argue, they will differ in their opinion, or they will think somebody else is in ignorance, or they're having their own concoction. So many wrong ways they can actually interpret something and think it is either think it is very complex, and not bother about understanding what is nicely explained. So, the correct way to understand spiritual subject matter is to prepare oneself by purification of the heart. What is this purification? To clear away the misconceptions which we have developed by long association with this material nature. By long association, we have developed souls. So, purification of the heart. There are so many misconceptions. So, that can all be cleared away, you chant Hare Krishna, you hear the holy name, you understand what Prabhupada is explaining with a sober mind, then it's possible. And gradually you begin to build your foundation, build on a good foundation of understanding. So, that's the correct way. You start with the basic of understanding the basics from the Bhagavad Gita, then you proceed to the Bhagavatam, then to the chaitanya charitamrita. Everything can be understood. And also, Krishna is revealing within the heart for a sincere soul, who has developed the eagerness to know Krishna, to learn about Krishna, to hear about Krishna, develop the taste and attraction for Krishna, hearing about Krishna, Krishna reveals.

Shukadeva Goswami was taught the Bhagavatam by Vyasa Deva. Vyasa Deva composed or compiled the Bhagavatam. Shukadeva Goswami spoke the Bhagavatam to Pariksit Maharaj. Now, in that assembly where Shukadeva Goswami was speaking to Pariksit Maharaj, there were many other saintly persons. So, there was this other saintly person called Suta Goswami. Suta Goswami is the son of one Romaharshana Suta. This Suta Goswami is also called Ugrashrava Suta. He heard the Bhagavatam when Shukadeva Goswami was speaking to Pariksit Maharaj. Suta Goswami was requested by some sages in Naimisharanya, kindly tell us about Krishna. So Suta Goswami said, if you are interested in hearing about Krishna, I shall narrate to you the Srimad Bhagavatam which I heard from Shukadeva Goswami when he was speaking to Pariksit Maharaj. So that Suta Goswami, he's narrating about Krishna. So, that's Suta Goswami. So, this is the reason for repeating the Bhagavatam to the sages of Naimisharanya.

And Sanath Kumara spoke this Bhagavatam what he heard from Sankarsana to one Sankhyayana Muni and this Sankhyayana Muni spoke this Bhagavatam to Parashara.

**Key Quote:** "In the spiritual world, everyone is naturally always blissful, always blissful, the very quality of it, always blissful, always blissful. Being happy is the characteristic of spiritual existence. Whereas the material world, by nature, it is filled with miseries."
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the possibility of sense gratification in the spiritual world, explaining that spiritual senses and bodies exist there, and that the natural state is bliss, contrasting it with the misery-filled material world where happiness is sought through sense gratification.

Is it possible to do sense gratification in the spiritual world? Where does the desire to do sense gratification come from? How is this taken care of in the spiritual world? In the spiritual world, we have our spiritual senses. We have our spiritual body, we have spiritual mind. How can be we doing sense gratification in the spiritual world? How do we be having the mind. Have means the soul has got all these faculties without separate parts, unlike this material body, which is constructed by joining together different parts and interconnecting them in the womb of the mother. So it's a very complex process. But the spiritual spirit soul as a person, the spiritual personality has got all the faculties perfectly working without any separate parts joined together, no separate parts are there. The faculties are all there in the spiritual world. And in the spiritual world, everyone is naturally always blissful, always blissful, the very quality of it, always blissful, always blissful. Being happy is the characteristic of spiritual existence. Whereas the material world, by nature, it is filled with miseries. There is no natural happiness. And one has to seek happiness all the time. And that also is available by some sense contact. Because our nature is to be happy always in the spiritual world, when we come to the material world, we are material world we also want to be always happy, but there is no happiness. So therefore, we seek happiness and only way we can seek happiness is by sense gratification. That means we have to bring the senses in contact with sense objects and that sensation that is produced we think that that is happiness. So that is the defect of material existence.

**Summary:** Lord Krishna appears in his transcendental form, which is beyond our material perception, but he grants us the ability to see him in various forms like Krishna, Rama, Narasimha, and Varaha.

Now, when Krishna Rama appears as the son of his devotees, apparently taking birth like an ordinary human being, it's not at all ordinary. It is not at all material. He doesn't accept a material form. He comes in his original transcendental form, meaning the form in the spiritual world, which is eternal and completely spiritual. But we cannot see him in that form. But then they become visible as Krishna, as Rama, as Narasimha, as Varaha, by giving us the power to see them, because our eyes can only perceive material forms, and that too, not all material forms. Like, if the devatas were to come, and do come to this Earth planet sometimes, we cannot see them with these eyes, because these eyes can't see them. These eyes can only perceive gross form. Devatas have subtle material form, sukshma sharira, just like

How to control senses to focus on spiritual journey in time of crisis? Engaging the senses in devotional service means to engage the senses in devotional service, just like there is an example given in Bhagavad Gita of one Ambarish Maharaj. He was a pure devotee of Krishna, so he engaged all his senses in Krishna's service. As I said, beginning with the tongue, what do you do with the tongue to engage in Krishna's service? We chant Hare Krishna. Ears, we hear the chanting of Hare Krishna. With the tongue we can also taste Krishna Prasadam. With the eyes we can see the beautiful form of Krishna, either the picture of Krishna or the deity of Krishna. With the eyes we can read Bhagavad Gita. And then with the nose we can smell nice fragrant flowers offered to Krishna or incense offered to Krishna. With the sense of touch, you can engage in so many activities with the hands in Krishna's service. You can engage these hands and the sense of touch also. Like that, all the senses, if we engage in Krishna's service, that is the way to control.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is promising that simply by understanding that Lord is not material, yet how he is in the material world."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that Krishna is beyond material energy and understanding His divine birth and activities leads to liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

So this has to be very, very clear to us that Krishna is not of this material energy. Even though He is coming on my tongue, He is not of the material energy. 5000 years back also when Krishna came here, He is not of this material energy. Just because my material eyes could see Him, He is not material. That is the reason in Bhagavad Gita Krishna says, simply by knowing what is the nature of Krishna's janma karma as divine, anybody who knows, means in truth, one understands this, he has no more birth in this material world. So, what we are discussing today, what we are discussing yesterday, exactly same thing. We are trying to understand the janma karma, appearance of the nama on my tongue, and what are the activities of the nama avatara. Once you understand this, there is no more birth and death, old age, disease. Krishna is promising that simply by understanding that Lord is not material, yet how He is in the material world. This is the understanding of the tattva of avatara or incarnation.

**Summary:** This segment quotes Bhaktivinoda Thakur, stressing the importance of understanding the transcendental nature of Krishna's form, name, and paraphernalia before engaging in nama bhajana (chanting).

See, in Chaitanya Siksha Amrita, Bhaktivinoda Thakur says, "Even before entering the field of nama bhajana," that is, nama bhajana is what we are doing, japa, "one should first know for certain that Krishna's form, Krishna's name, Krishna's service, Krishna's servants are all eternally free." That is, they are beyond the grasp of maya, the illusory energy. Krishna, His transcendental abode and His paraphernalia are totally beyond material imagination. Similarly, His throne, His rooms, His gardens, forests, Govardhan Hill and river Yamuna. In fact, everything about Krishna cannot be touched by maya. It is especially important to remember the transcendental nature of the Lord Krishna when we approach His service, of which chanting His holy name is foremost. This understanding is not based on blind belief but on absolute eternal truth. So, Prabhupada.

In this way, one's mind gradually becomes purified as stated by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.

When mind is purified, the senses are also purified. Just see. Instead of using the senses for sense gratification, the awakened devotee employs the senses in the transcendental service of the Lord. This is a process by which dormant love of Krishna, Supreme Personality of Godhead, dormant love for Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears in order to teach us Vedic principles intended to understanding Him. Vedeshya Sarvair Aham Ev Vedyah. We should always know that when Krishna and Lord Chaitanya appeared, they appeared in Shuddha Sattva bodies. Please note that. We should always know that when Krishna and Lord Chaitanya appeared, they appeared in Shuddha Sattva bodies. One should not mistake the body of Krishna or Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to be a material body like ours.

**Summary:** This segment presents a conversation with Srila Prabhupada, explaining that matter is Krishna's energy and can be transformed into spirit, emphasizing the importance of seeing Krishna's personal presence in the deity form.

Conversation with Srila Prabhupada, ultimately everything is spiritual because matter is Krishna's energy. If Krishna is the original cause, therefore the matter can be changed into spirit and spirit can be changed to matter. Just as in the same electrical energy, acting as heater and cooler because the original cause is electricity. Similarly, the original cause is Krishna, so Krishna can change matter into spirit and spirit into matter. This is His power. The rascals and fools, when Krishna appears in His own body, Atma Maya, they think it is just like a material body. But they do not know that to Krishna, there is no distinction of material and spiritual. Never think of the deity as made of stone or wood. Every worshipper must remember that Krishna is personally present. He is simply kindly presenting Himself before us in a way so that we can handle Him. That is His mercy. Otherwise, He is unapproachable. There is no difference between matter and spirit for the Lord, although there is a gulf of difference between the two in the case of conditioned living beings. For the Lord, there is nothing but spiritual existence. Similarly, there is nothing except spiritual existence for the pure devotee of the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "Only liberated soul can cross the coverings of the universe."
**Summary:** The lecture focuses on the four Kumaras, their liberation, yogic powers, and their ability to travel to Vaikuntha due to being free from material contamination.

what is happening as the cause for the darkness spreading everywhere in the universe. So Brahma is describing, first of all he described Vaikuntha. And he has already described that the four Kumaras while wandering carefree, because they were liberated souls and they didn't have any definite desire. The description is there. My four sons, Sanakya, Sanatana, Sanantara and Sanat Kumara who are born from my mind are your predecessors. They are born much before all the demigods. As they travel throughout the material and spiritual skies without any definite desire. So then Brahma is describing as they travel all over the universes, they also travel in the spiritual sky. So they happen to enter the spiritual sky. And because they were freed from all material contamination, they could go there. And they also had the yogic siddhi. It requires yogic siddhi to go to specific places. Otherwise they are restricted to the planet. They are supposed to stay there. Now normally yogic siddhi means they can travel within the universe. But exceptionally advanced yogis like the four Kumaras can even cross the coverings of the universe. So elsewhere it is explained that to cross the coverings of the universe, one has to be fully free from all material contamination, fully purified, and should be a liberated soul. Only a liberated soul can cross the coverings of the universe. Even among the yogis, those yogis who are not liberated, they cannot go beyond the coverings of the universe. They cannot go. So from this description it is very clear that the four Kumaras were liberated souls. And they were liberated souls who were also yogis. Because they were yogis, they could travel freely. If one is not a yogi, one cannot travel. So they were liberated souls. Therefore they could cross the coverings of the universe and they could reach the Vaikuntha planet because they were yogis, yogis and liberated souls. So then Brahma gives the elaborate description of Vaikuntha that we have been hearing in the past several verses. We have been hearing about the Vaikuntha.

**Key Quote:** "So without any material desire means there is spiritual desire."
**Summary:** The discussion shifts to the concept of desirelessness, clarifying that it refers to freedom from material desires, not the absence of all desires, and highlighting the presence of spiritual desires in liberated souls.

So, without any definite desire, Prabhupada explains, means no material desires. No material desires. So to become free from material desire is possible only if one is free from all types of material contamination. Even if there is a small tinge of material contamination, there is material desire. So many times people wonder what is this material contamination? It is nothing but material desire. Whenever it is referred to, material contamination in the heart or consciousness. Consciousness is completely spiritual. So how can consciousness be contaminated? It is the desire which becomes contaminated. Naturally, as spirit souls, it is the desire which becomes contaminated. Because we all have consciousness. That consciousness is the symptom of spirit, symptom of spirit soul, consciousness. The characteristic of consciousness is desire. Consciousness means desire. So a living being cannot be without desire. Therefore, many times Prabhupada explains, if it is said, one has to become desireless, it means that one has to become free from material desires. That's the meaning, desireless. Nispruhaha, many places in the Bhagavad Gita, nispruhaha, nispruhasarvakamebhyo, free from all kinds of material desires. So people who don't know about devotional service or bhakti yoga, they think desirelessness means no desire, become a stone, become like a stone, no material desire, no activity. That is not correct. So they try to become desireless. That is not correct. They try to become desireless, try to become inactive. But that is never possible for a living being, never possible. So without any definite desire means without any material desire. So without any material desire means there is spiritual desire. There are spiritual desires. So the kumaras are travelling with a spiritual desire.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that desire, consciousness, and activity are inherent characteristics of spirit souls, contrasting this with the Mayavadi philosophy that denies these qualities in the Absolute Truth, and clarifying the meaning of 'nirguna'.

At least one spiritual desire, there could be more. It is the characteristic of the living being to be always having desires, always having. That's a characteristic. That is the natural symptom of living. It is like this table. Can it have any desire? Material object, can it have desire? Material substance. Is there anything like that? No. Is there anything like desire? No. So that is characteristic of spirit, soul, desire, consciousness, activity, senses, perception, thinking, feeling, willing, all these are characteristics of spirit, living person. So if we understand this very carefully, it's not difficult to understand the supreme absolute truth or the supreme spirit is also full of desires. Because desire is the characteristic of spirit. He has senses. He has thinking, feeling, willing. He has senses. He has thinking, feeling, willing. He has senses. He has perception. He has feelings. He has intelligence. He has activities. He has qualities, spiritual qualities. See, the whole understanding is completely different if you properly understand what is the spirit. He is the ultimate, the ultimate emotions. He is the ultimate power. He is the ultimate consciousness. So these Mayavadi philosophers, they study so much the Vedas and after all that the conclusion, because they are stuck up with one philosophy, absolute truth is impersonal, that's why they come to a wrong conclusion. Either living being or absolute truth, no desires at all, no senses, no activity and to justify that, they say see scriptures describe absolute truth as nirguna, nirvikara, nirvishesha. But unless they hear the meaning, the explanation of all these descriptions in the scriptures from a proper source, they will not understand. They take the literal meaning. Nirguna means without qualities. Nirguna means without material qualities.

**Key Quote:** "This material world, 15th chapter of Bhagavad Gita is described by Krishna as an inverted reflection of the spiritual world."
**Summary:** The lecture explains the relationship between the material and spiritual worlds, describing the material world as a perverted reflection of the spiritual world, not merely an inverted one, emphasizing the distorted nature of material qualities.

nirakar, without any material form, so there is transcendental form, there is transcendental qualities, there is transcendental senses, transcendental activities, transcendental abode, transcendental paraphernalia, everything is there. This material world, 15th chapter of Bhagavad Gita is described by Krishna as an inverted reflection of the spiritual world, so in the spiritual world, unless there is variety, how can there be a difference? How can there be variety in the material world? But Krishna also explains in the 15th chapter, it's a perverted reflection. Literally, if you take, urdha-moolam-adashakam, inverted reflection, just like this. Just like if you want to see inverted reflection in the mirror, if you are standing on your feet, in the mirror it will appear like you're standing on your head, shirsasana, what is that? Shirsasana. So it's not exactly inverted reflection. See this also requires an acharya to explain, what is this urdha-moolam-adashakam? It's a perverted reflection. There's a difference between perverted reflection and inverted reflection. Perverted reflection is, it's like, to give an example of perverted reflection, if you look in a convex mirror or a concave mirror, your face, let us say, your face will appear either very big or very small. Correct? Have you seen that? Sometimes you would have seen, some of you would have seen at least. So like that, in this material world, even though it's a reflection of the spiritual world, it is not a proper reflection. It's a perverted reflection.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts material and spiritual qualities, emphasizing the importance of studying scriptures under proper guidance to avoid misinformation and to understand the true nature of spirit.

So everything is topsy-turvy, right? There everything is of the spiritual quality, in the spiritual world. Here everything is of the material quality. So material quality and spiritual quality, very clearly Krishna has distinguished in the second chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, by distinguishing the soul from the body or spirit from matter. Very clearly Krishna has given the distinction. In other places in the scriptures also, many, many, many, many places it is there. The descriptions are there. Matter and spirit, very clearly it is there. So perverted reflection means of the material quality as opposed to spiritual quality in the spiritual world. So Prabhupada explains, since there is variety here, and because the material world is a reflection of the spiritual world, there is variety in the spiritual world. But because this reflection is a perverted reflection, we should not think just like there is material variety here, there is material variety in the spiritual world. No. There is spiritual variety. So the nature of spirit, to properly understand, you have to study the scriptures under proper guidance. Otherwise all kinds of interpretation or misinformation, just like these mayavadis, there are so many wrong understandings.

### Kumaras' desire, seeing the Lord, Paramatma, impersonal Brahman, soul and Supersoul

**Summary:** The lecture returns to the Kumaras' eagerness to see the Lord, contrasting their understanding with that of yogis who mistake the Paramatma form for a manifestation of the impersonal Brahman, and highlighting the difference between the soul and the Supersoul.

So it is described that the Kumaras, they had desire, they were eager to see the Lord. They were eager to see the Lord in Vaikuntha. They had already seen the Lord in the heart. In perfection. In perfect Samadhi, a yogi is able to see the form of the Lord in the heart, Paramatma form, Supersoul. But if a yogi is not having proper knowledge about who or what is that form in the heart of the Supersoul, Paramatma, then their conclusion will be, what is that form in the heart? Their conclusion will be, oh, this is the manifestation of the impersonal Brahman, the absolute truth or God. This Paramatma feature is a manifestation of the impersonal Brahman. Similarly, they also conclude that we are not the body. We are spirit soul. We are eternal. We are spiritual by nature. So they conclude that this spiritual nature or spirit soul is also manifestation of impersonal Brahman. Now again, some places in the scriptures, there is description. Absolute truth is Brahman. We are also Brahman. And the qualities of Brahman are given, identical. Nirvikara, nirguna, nirvishesha, nirvikalpa. Whether you apply that to the soul or the Supersoul or the impersonal Brahman, the absolute truth, same qualities. So they equalize the soul with the impersonal Brahman.

with the absolute truth, with God, with Brahman in the spiritual world. So this mistake, devotees never make. Because devotees understand that in this material world, there is an inverted reflection, perverted reflection, the perverted reflection of the spiritual world. So the variety here is material, their variety is spiritual. Here there are living beings, so many millions and billions and trillions of living beings, who have material desires, material form, covering their spirit, covering the spirit, material form, material possessions. In the spiritual world, there also there are millions of living beings. But they are having spiritual form, they are having spiritual desires, they have spiritual activity, they have spiritual senses, their intelligence is spiritual. Their identity is spiritual. Do you understand? You see, how perfect, clear understanding can be there, only when you hear from the perfect source. That's why the perfect source is described in the Bhagavad Gita and all the important scriptures, that you have to hear in the parampara system, from a guru who is coming in parampara, beginning from Krishna. This modern day follows Shankaracharya, we are also in parampara. Which parampara? Shankaracharya parampara. If you ask the question, Shankaracharya parampara, does it begin from Krishna? No.

**Key Quote:** "Unless one hears from the perfect source, which is also described, from a guru in parampara, beginning from Krishna, one will not be able to understand all these descriptions in the scriptures."
**Summary:** The importance of hearing from a perfect source in disciplic succession is reiterated, explaining why some scriptural descriptions are indirect and emphasizing the distinction between Vaikunthaloka and Svargaloka.

So, therefore, unless one hears from the perfect source, which is also described, from a guru in parampara, beginning from Krishna, one will not be able to understand all these descriptions in the scriptures. Yes. So here, in the Bhagavatam, there is a direct and clear description. In some places in the scriptures, the description is not very direct. It is indirect. Now, somebody will say, why indirect description? Why not direct description? Because there are foolish people, who will mistake these descriptions in the Bhagavatam, in the Bhagavata, to be descriptions of something material. So first of all, before anybody touches Bhagavatam, descriptions of the personal features of the Absolute Truth, they should understand the impersonal feature, if there is a possibility that they'll misunderstand the personal descriptions. But we don't have that problem. As devotees who are hearing the descriptions of the personal features from the pure devotee spiritual world, we have no problem, because when Prabhupada describes, he never confuses the description in the Bhagavatam and the description in the Vedas about material world, Vaikunthaloka and Svargaloka. There is no confusion. The two are completely different. So Prabhupada explains that very carefully, the difference between Svarga or any upper planet where there is so much of opulence and the opulence in Vaikuntha. The pleasure of the inhabitants of Vaikunthaloka. A clear distinction is given by Prabhupad.

**Key Quote:** "Absolute truth is impersonal."
**Summary:** The lecture critiques the Mayavada understanding, highlighting their flawed starting point of believing the Absolute Truth is impersonal, and explaining the three features of the Absolute Truth: impersonal, localized, and personal.

So the Mayavada understanding is completely wrong, completely wrong, because they start with a wrong understanding right from the beginning of their study. They always hold on to one axiomatic truth according to them: absolute truth is impersonal. That's the reason for all their philosophy being completely wrong. They can never, never understand as long as they hold on to that point. So such mayavadis, when they come in contact with a pure devotee and are fortunate to be blessed, of course the pure devotees want to bless everyone, but are fortunate to accept the blessings of the pure devotee, then immediately they begin to realize that the absolute truth is impersonal, localized and personal, three features of absolute truth. And that's the localized feature. The absolute truth, a higher understanding of the absolute truth, superior knowledge and the personal feature is the highest understanding, topmost understanding of the absolute truth, complete understanding, perfect understanding. So that is only because of the mercy of pure devotee and we are fortunate souls to have accepted this mercy. Therefore for us it's very clear what is Brahman, what is Paramatma, what

I made you go through the verses 18th chapter beginning with 47th verse or something. I didn't complete that. Till 18.66 you study that. 18.47 to 66. What is that verse? It starts with that verse where it describes by worship of the Lord who is all-pervading and who is the source of all beings one can in performance of one's own duty attain the highest perfection of renunciation. Something like that. By worship of the Lord who is the source of all beings. What is the verse number? 18th chapter 47 or 48 or something like that. What is the verse number? 46.

Bhagavatam right in the beginning and directly Suta Goswami is telling, directly he is telling the three features. So studying these verses of the Bhagavad Gita, 18.46 to 18.66, 21 verses, you have to nicely study. Thoroughly you have to study. Particularly Prabhupada's translation and purport. The word for translation you go through very carefully. Very nicely Prabhupada explains. These three features of the absolute truth are explained in these verses. Again that is very very confidential understanding. Many people read the Bhagavad Gita but they don't know three features of the absolute truth are described in those verses. They don't understand that. See. So here the description is being given that these Kumaras, four Kumaras, they entered Vaikunthapuri. Seven doors are there to enter the personal abode of the, in Vaikunthapuri. There are so many devotees, millions of, billions of devotees. But they were trying to, eager to see the Lord. So they entered his abode. So his abode is guarded by doorman. And his doorman, there is no need to guard because there is no threat. There are no Asuras. There are no ruffians in the spiritual world. Then why this doorman? Why this doorman? That is their seva to the Lord, to guard his door, seva of the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "They thought that this sex impulse is going to bother us."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the names of the doormen and explains why the Kumaras maintain the appearance of five-year-old children: to avoid the disturbance of the sex impulse and facilitate their spiritual practice.

See. Devotees render all kinds of service to the Lord, all kinds of service. So these doorman, they are standing in seven doors, pair of doorman. So that description is also there in other parts of the scriptures, other places in the scriptures, the names of these doorman. The seventh door, Jaya and Vijaya. Those who do Narasimha Homa, you have some mantras, no? Chanda Prachanda Abhyam Namaha. What are the names there? Huh? Bala Prabala Abhyam Namaha. If you know Sanskrit language, the, Prabala Abhyam means Dvitiya, Vachana, two of them, unto them, unto Bala and Prabala, I am offering this, Ganda Pushpa. You see. So there are names of these pairs of doorman. First door, second door, third door, sixth, fourth door, fifth, sixth. None of them stopped these Kumaras. They freely were walking. Now, how do the Kumaras look? That is very important. They look like five-year-old small children. What is the reason? It is explained earlier, I think. Somewhere Prabhupada has explained earlier. I didn't read that explanation here, that they purposely keep themselves in a form, the assembling small children because when they were very serious about self-realization, they realized that this sex impulse that is there in this material world when one grows up and attains adulthood, there is naturally that sex impulse. And one has to actually overcome that sex impulse if one is serious about self-realization or spiritual life. One has to practice Brahmacharya and then follow these Brahmachari principles even after attaining adulthood. Continue to follow the Brahmacharya principles so that one will not become a victim of this sex desire. Now, these Kumaras are very intelligent transcendentalists. They thought that this sex impulse is going to bother us and Brahmacharya principles have to be followed whole life. So, using the yogic siddhi, they maintained the body of five-year-olds. So, when the body is kept like that, there will be no sex impulse at all. Like small children, they will not have any sex impulse, no sex impulse. So, they are freely able to practice spiritual life without any botheration by this

**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the Kumaras' clear goal of self-realization from a young age, explaining that family life is a concession for those who want regulated sex life, and questioning the need for those dedicated to Krishna realization to enter family life.

sex impulse. That means, right in the beginning, they had very clear goal of life. Goal of life was self-realization. And that goal, they were fixed even when they were small children. Even when they were small children, they were fixed on that goal. And very quickly they attained the siddhi. They attained the siddhi very quickly. Because, by birth itself, they were not interested in entering family life, having children, wife, all this they were not interested. So, they refused their father, that they will not be entering family life. So, Brahma, immediate reaction was, he became angry. How can you refuse your father? And that too, he is asking them to help him, to assist him in the process of creation. So, Brahma was very angry. He was very angry, but very soon Brahma realized, oh, they are very advanced spiritually. That's why they are refusing. It's not because, I don't like to enter family life. Don't bother me. Not like that. It's not because they don't like to enter or bother some headache, wife, children, all this. No, not with that understanding. They mature in their understanding. What is family life? So, that's why many times Prabhupada also explains, a devotee should understand, if a devotee, somebody is serious about self-realization, or more importantly, Krishna realization, then he should understand that this family life is a concession, for those who want to enjoy sex life, in a restricted way, regulated way. So, if the goal is, Krishna realization, and one has practiced Brahmacharya, then why enter Guru's Tashrama? No need. No need to enter Guru's Tashrama. To fix in the goal, and you have to pursue that, for which we have joined, this movement. Correct? So, why enter Grihastha life? Guru's Tashrama? Family life? Why enter family life?

**Key Quote:** "They are refusing because, they have fixed in their goal of self-realization."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Brahma's initial anger and subsequent realization that the Kumaras' refusal to enter family life stemmed from their dedication to self-realization, and then shifts to the doorman's perspective and the nature of children.

So, these Kumaras, Brahma realized, they are refusing because, actually momentarily, he became upset. Brahma is very very advanced, himself. Just on the spur of the moment, he became upset. But immediately, he could understand, that they are not refusing because, they don't want botheration, or they don't like to enter family. No. They are refusing because, they have fixed in their goal of self-realization, for which this Naishika Brahmacharya, is very very very, very very conducive. So, then he appreciated that. Very nice. So, now he is describing, they are looking like five-year-olds, but they are the oldest people in the Universe, among the oldest people. And they are liberated, they have done lot of Tapasya, they have studied all the Vedas, they are very very very mature, knowledgeable people. Correct? But, the doorman, the seventh pair of doorman, Jaya and Vijaya, they became upset. Why are these boys, simply roaming around, trying to enter, the Lord's abode? What business they have? Small children, what business they have? They just keep playing, and then, so they stopped. Now, this verse, doesn't describe they stopped. First, the description is, in the 28th verse, what did the, four Kumaras see? They saw two doorman, but that was not, anything new for them, because they had seen already doorman, first gate up to sixth gate, they had seen the doorman. Then, they got the doorman's voice. Why? Prabhupada explains that also. It is a child's nature, to enter any place, without any consideration of permission, or am I allowed to go? No idea of, I should not trespass some places, nothing like that. And children are not duplicitous, that means, they have no particular reason to enter, any particular room, simply they will go. Correct? And it is also told here, by Prabhupada, a child can enter any place, as no one checks him, generally children will not be stopped, when they go around here and there. They generally will not stop.

**Summary:** The lecture describes the Kumaras' reaction to being stopped by the doormen, highlighting their liberation, lack of attraction to material opulence, and eagerness to see the Lord, contrasting this with the doormen's agitated state of mind.

So, if a child is stopped, what happens? They feel very sorry, why are they stopping me? And then sometimes, the child also becomes, angry. And out of anger, or out of, some kind of, feeling sorry, they will start crying, generally children will start crying. But here, the Kumaras, no question of crying, they are mature adults actually, and, their anger, was meant to, punish this doorman, why are you stopping us? And it is also described here, by Prabhupada, that the first six doormen, did not stop. Only the seventh, door, they were stopped. Of course, this 29th verse, doesn't describe they have stopped. In the 30th verse, it is described, 29th verse it says, 28th verse, it says, first of all, the doorman saw, who are these four, small children? So, they raised their eyebrows, as if, what do you want? Like that. And, they were breathing heavily, discontented nostrils. Hmm? Sputha, nirgama bhyam. Like, becoming angry, or becoming upset, or thinking that some unnecessary disturbance, nuisance. They snorted, like this. And, their eyes were anyway reddish. It appeared like, they were, angry. Appeared like that. Their eyes were reddish anyway. With reddish eyes, discontented nostrils, arched eyebrows, they appeared somewhat agitated. Rabhasam dadhano. They appeared agitated. Why are you coming? Simply disturbing, creating nuisance. That kind of, ah, that kind of, disposition they had, towards the Kumaras. And, the next verse will, 30th verse will describe, they stopped. But, the 20, 29th verse, it says, the great sages, had open doors everywhere. They had no idea of ours and mine. They completely liberated. They know, everything belongs to the Supreme Lord. Nothing belongs to anybody. So, with open minds, they tried to enter the seventh door, as they had passed the six doors, which were all made of golden diamonds. Why is it being said, made of golden diamonds, those doors? It's not like the material world. It is completely different. But, the Kumaras are liberated. So, they have no attraction for these gold and extraordinary opulence. They have no such desire or any such special attraction for opulence like that. No. Why? Because, they are very eager to see the Supreme Lord. Very eager to see the Supreme Lord. So, therefore, they were thinking, why these doormen are agitated in the mind? And further, it will be described, they stopped even using the stick. Stop! Where are you going? Like that. So, then we will hear what happened

**Key Quote:** "Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta Purpa."
**Summary:** The speaker reads the translation and purport of S.B. 3.15.30, focusing on the Kumaras' appearance, their age, and the doorkeepers' actions.

Translation: The four boy sages, who had nothing to cover their bodies but the atmosphere, looked only five years old, even though they were the oldest of all living creatures and had realized the truth of the self. But when the porters, who happened to possess a disposition quite unpalatable to the Lord, saw the sages, they blocked their way with their staffs, despising their glories, although the sages did not deserve such treatment at their hands. Purport by Srila Prabhupada: The four sages were the first born sons of Brahma; therefore, all other living entities, including Lord Shiva, are born later and are therefore younger than the four Kumaras. Although they looked like five-year-old boys and traveled naked, the Kumaras were older than all other living creatures and had realized the truth of the self, such that they could not remain negligible and thus became known as the king of all the world. However, the sages were not to be forbidden to enter the kingdom of Vaikuntha, but by chance the doorman objected to their entrance. This is not fitting. The Lord is always anxious to serve sages like the Kumaras, but in spite of knowing this fact, the doorman astonishingly and outrageously prohibited them from entering. Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta Purport.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the Vaikuntha planet, focusing on the palaces where devotees reside and the Kumaras' eagerness to see the Supreme Lord.

So this is a word spoken by whom? Brahma. Brahma is speaking to Devatas. So the description continues: what happened when the sages reached the Vaikuntha planet, they were trying to enter the personal abode of the Supreme Lord, that particular palace. In the Vaikuntha, everyone lives in palaces. Just like when Brahma came to visit Dwaraka, he saw that all the Vishnis, they are living in wonderful palaces. Not Brahma. Sudhama. Brahma also came to Dwaraka, but it is described Sudhama saw so many palaces. So since he had to meet Krishna, he was shown Krishna's palace after he passed through so many security guards, guarding persons. You know that. First he had to pass through some gates to enter the Dwarka township itself. And after that he had to pass through so many palaces of the Vrishnis, Yadus. And then he had to be shown the particular palace in which Krishna was residing. In fact, Krishna doesn't reside in one palace. He resides in 16,108 palaces, because he has those many queens. So like that in the Vaikuntha also, all the devotees live in palatial buildings. But the Kumaras were particularly eager to see the Supreme Lord. They were eager to see the Supreme Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the doorkeepers' agitated state and contrasts it with Krishna's cool glance, referencing the story of Ashwatthama's punishment.

Okay. So when they tried to enter, six gates nobody blocked. The seventh gate, it is already described, with open minds they entered the seventh door out of their own will, just as they had passed through the six other doors, which were open ones, which are made of gold and diamonds. But the two doormen of the seventh door, they first of all raised their eyebrows. Who are you? And they breathe little heavily, discontented nostrils, reddish eyes. They appear deep. His eyes are red, appeared somewhat agitated. These reddish eyes is common for the Lord and the inhabitants of Vaikuntha. But when the Lord glances with his reddish eyes in his transcendental form, it is as cool as a lotus. That glance is as cool as a lotus. This is described in the first canto, the seventh chapter, the son of Drona punished. This is Ashwatthama at the end of the battle of Kurukshetra. He went and beheaded the sleeping sons of Draupadi. So Draupadi was very much heartbroken, naturally. So then Arjuna, he decided to punish this Ashwatthama who had done this unlawful killing. So Arjuna chased. Now Arjuna was accompanied by Krishna, because even the end of the battle, still Krishna was unharmed. He chased the chariot driver of Arjuna. So Krishna was there with Arjuna when Arjuna chased this Ashwatthama. And Arjuna was very angry against this Ashwatthama, because Ashwatthama was a murderer of innocent boys. Hm. Krishna was also looking but with cool eyes. Krishna's eyes are reddish, but he was looking with cool eyes, as cool as a lotus in a beautiful reservoir of water, like that, Krishna's glance is very cool.

**Key Quote:** "Bhagavata pratikula shilau, that which is not pleasing to the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the doorkeepers' unfavorable behavior towards the Kumaras, contrasting it with the concept of 'anukula' (favorable) devotional service.

So, these two doormen at the seventh door, even though reddish eyes, Kumaras could make out they are agitated. And not only they were looking in an agitated way at the Kumaras, but they blocked their way using their staff, as if despising their glories, who are you, simply creating nuisance here, go away, don't enter. In that mood, they stopped, despising their glories. Tejo vihasya bhagavat pratikul shilau, and they are blocking with their staff and despising their glories. Bhagavata was quite unpalatable to the Lord. Bhagavata pratikul shilau, that which is not pleasing to the Lord. Why is this particularly mentioned? Because in Vaikuntha, everyone is serving the Supreme Lord in a favorable way. All are devotees. All are serving Anukula. Rupa Goswami describes Bhakti in Bhakti Rishams Sindhu. What does he say? The definition of pure devotional service, according to Rupa Goswami: Anyabhilashita shunyam, Jnana karmadi anavrta, Anukuliena krishnanu shilanam. Here, it is the opposite. Bhagavata pratikula shilau. Anukula shila, pratikula shila. Pratikula shila is having a nature displeasing to the Lord. Anukula shila. Either Bhagavata Anukula shila or Krishna Anukula shila. That is pleasing to the Lord. A disposition, a behavior, a proper way of interacting in a favorable way to the Lord. That is Bhagavata Anukula. Here it is Bhagavata pratikula shila. A disposition quite unpalatable to the Lord.

### Kumaras, Doorkeepers, Age, Self-Realization, Respect

**Key Quote:** "They were stopping Vriddhan... Vriddhan means, the oldest of all living creatures."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the Kumaras' advanced age and self-realization, highlighting the doorkeepers' inappropriate treatment of them.

And who are they stopping? They were stopping Vriddhan. Vriddhan means the oldest of all living creatures. Most elderly personalities. The four kumaras. Because Prabhupada says in the purport, the four sages, the four kumaras, they were the first born sons of Brahma. So all others, sons of Brahma, are later, after the four kumaras. So they are the oldest, means eldest, elderly, in the sense of elderly. Vriddhan, but Dasha, Ardha, Vayasaha, they appear like five-year-old boys, half of ten is five. Vayasan, Vayasaha, Dasha, Ardha, Vayasaha, five-year-old, they appear like five-year-olds. And they are, even though appearing like five-year-olds, they are Vidita Atma Tattva, they are realized the truth of the Self. They have realized the truth of the Self, the self-realized souls. So such self-realized, eldest of all sons of Brahma, and they are sages, they are Naishitika Brahmacharis. So such great personalities never deserve such treatment at the hands of the doorkeepers. Atad Arhanam Stau Atad Arhanam, that which is not proper, undeserving. So, the two doorkeepers, they should not have stopped the Kumaras, in fact they should have welcomed them or received them with great respect and honour because they are self-realised souls and it is also said they were eager to see the Supreme Lord, they were eager to see the Supreme Lord.

### Kumaras, Age, Renunciation, Brahma Loka, Subtle Body, Effulgence

**Key Quote:** "although they looked like five-year-old boys and traveled naked the Kumaras were older than all other living creatures"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the Kumaras' renunciation, their subtle bodies, and the effulgence associated with residents of higher planets like Brahma Loka.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport the justification for the Kumaras entering that Vaikuntha abode of the Supreme Lord. The four sages were the first born sons of Brahma, therefore all other living entities, including Lord Shiva, are born later and therefore younger than the four Kumaras. Younger means in terms of birth in this material world, Kumaras are the oldest, all others are younger. But the Kumaras, they look like five-year-old boys, they maintain that way. As I explained yesterday, they maintain that type of form and they travel naked. The Sanskrit that is used to describe them: Vata Rasha Naan, covered by the atmosphere or air, that means they are not wearing anything, they are naked, small boys, five-year-old boys, nobody will mind, nobody will say why are you not dressed, five-year-old boys. So they are traveling naked because they are completely renounced. Generally these four Kumaras are not visible to everybody because they are residents of Brahma Loka. So residents of Brahma Loka first of all don't have a gross body, they only have a subtle body and not only that, they have a subtle body in the upper planets, their body has growth, their body has got a glow, an effulgence and that effulgence is so dazzling that even if somebody had the ability to see a subtle form, just like all the residents of Swarga, they have subtle form, they don't have gross form, Swarga and above all subtle form, but even then relatively speaking, they have relatively different degree of bodily effulgence. There are different degrees of bodily effulgence. So more advanced spiritually, more the effulgence.

### Vamanadeva, Effulgence, Krishna, Butter Theft, Mother Yashoda

**Key Quote:** "Krishna when in Gokula, he would go round as a small boy trying to steal butter."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the examples of Vamanadeva and Krishna's butter-stealing pastimes to illustrate how the Supreme Lord sometimes conceals his effulgence.

So there's a description that when Vaman Deva walked into the sacrificial arena of Bali Maharaj, that time Vaman Deva was Supreme Lord. So Supreme Lord's effulgence is the supreme effulgence and that is ultimately Brahma Josa Jyoti, how bright it illuminates the entire spiritual sky and the entire existence. So nobody's effulgence can be brighter than the Supreme Lord's effulgence. But the Supreme Lord when he incarnates, he does not display his effulgence all the time. Most of the time he doesn't display. Krishna when in Gokula, he would go round as a small boy trying to steal butter. So the gopis would try to prevent Krishna from stealing butter by hiding the butter pots. Mother Yashoda would receive complaints, Krishna is stealing butter. So Mother Yashoda first would say, why will my son steal butter? There is plenty of butter in our house. And not only that, plenty of butter, Yashoda thinking that these complaints are becoming too much, she specially was feeding flavored grass to some limited number of cows. Nandamaharaja had 9 lakh cows. So out of that she had selected some cows and those cows she was feeding flavored grass. And that flavored grass means the milk will be having special flavor. That special flavored grass personally she would feed, personally she would milk the cow. And that milk she would boil nicely, make it yogurt. And that yogurt should personally churn and make butter to feed Krishna specially flavored butter, so that Krishna will not go to neighboring houses to steal butter. Because Yashoda has to wonder, why will he go to somebody else's house and eat butter? Maybe their butter is more tasty. So she said, I will feed Krishna. Why? Because Krishna has special flavored butter. So Yashoda used to prepare this kind of butter. So after she started feeding this kind of butter, Krishna very nicely used to eat. Then Yashoda is feeding lovingly this flavored butter. Then complaints are still coming in spite of this. So she will tell the gopis, why don't you hide the pots, keep it in a dark place so that he cannot see.

**Key Quote:** "So then they used to hide it in a dark place. Still Krishna was stealing."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of Krishna's butter-stealing, describing the gopis' attempts to hide the butter and their eventual realization of Krishna's inherent effulgence.

Small boy, you are complaining he is stealing butter. So then they used to hide it in a dark place. Still Krishna was stealing. So next time they came with complaint, they said, actually we are hiding. Yashoda said, I told you to hide. How can he come and take if you are hiding? No, there is, I think he is able to see even if it is in a dark place because you are decorating him with nice jewelry. And those jewelry you have got from precious stones. And the stones naturally give out light. So then Yashoda said, okay, I will remove his special ornament. They said, no, no, no, no, no. Don't remove his ornaments. He looks so beautiful with those wonderful ornaments. Don't remove his ornaments. But then they began to think that why were they telling don't remove the ornaments? Because he looks very beautiful with the ornaments. Secondly, they are telling these two boys, Krishna and Balarama, even if you remove ornaments, he will not come. He will not come. Even if you remove ornaments, no use, because their body, some kind of glow is there in their body. They couldn't understand that Krishna and Balarama have a natural glow because of their Brahman effulgence. They are Brahman, Supreme Brahman. So naturally they have got the effulgence. So sometimes Krishna and Balarama will display little effulgence. That time some of the gopis will see, oh, there is some effulgence coming out of their bodies. So all these are loving pastimes of Krishna and Balarama.

**Key Quote:** "So when Vamande walked into that assembly, he appeared to be dazzling, dazzling, having dazzling effulgence."
**Summary:** The speaker returns to the example of Vamanadeva, describing how his effulgence surpassed that of the assembled sages in Bali Maharaj's sacrificial arena.

Loving pastimes. So Varman Deva similarly. When he appeared as the son of Aditi and Kashyapa, he appeared like their son, but he was not displaying his effulgence. But when he walked into the sacrificial arena of Bali Maharaj, then all the assembled sages, because that sacrificial arena, there were very, very powerful sages who were performing the sacrifice, especially Bali Maharaj had invited very powerful sages to perform the sacrifices after defeating Indra. So these sages were displaying their effulgence, natural effulgence, very, very bright. So when Vamande walked into that assembly, he appeared to be dazzling, having dazzling effulgence, brighter than the effulgence, the effulgence of the most powerful sages assembled there. So everybody thought, who is this Brahmachari with so much Tejas he is walking in? Because the Tejas also depends on how much Tapasya one has performed. More the Tapasya, more the effulgence from their body. So if these two, if this Brahmachari has performed severe austerities, more than what those sages have performed, then their bodily effulgence, this Brahmachari's bodily effulgence will be more. Tejas will be more. So they thought, here is some very, very, very, very powerfully austere Brahmachari. So they all stood up to receive him out of respect for his austerity, Tejas.

**Key Quote:** "So such Paramahamsas, they are offered respect by everyone, including the other Sanyasis who are not Paramahamsas."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the concept of austerity and self-realization, using the example of Shukadeva Goswami and highlighting the position of Paramahamsas like the Kumaras.

Due to austerity, the Tejas. So, these sages, why I mention this is, these sages, they had performed so much austerity. They are completely dedicated for realizing the absolute truth. So what will they do after realizing the absolute truth? No more need to perform any austerity, but they will be absorbed in meditation on the supreme Brahman truth. Just like Shukadeva Goswami. He was Brahman realized, self-realized. So after his birth, he simply walked away, simply walked away from home, not interested in all the rituals and study, studying Vedic literature, going to Gurukul. He has no use for all that. He is liberated. So why will he go and study? Why will he undergo all the samskara? No need. So he walked away from home. What was he doing? Wandering? Aimlessly, apparently aimlessly wandering. Again, he was also nakedly walking around everywhere. He was not dressed. Why not dressed? Not interested. Completely renounced. Otherwise, according to the Ashrama and Varna, they have to dress themselves. That is the very culture. Varna Ashrama Dharma, everybody is dressed according to their position, according to their Varna, Ashrama. So Brahmachari is dressed a particular way. Grahastha is dressed a particular way. Vanaprastha is dressed a particular way. Sanyasi is dressed a particular way. Sanyasi is dressed generally in saffron. Others don't dress in saffron. So the saffron-dressed Sanyasis, they are the topmost among the four Ashramas. And among them, the Paramahamsas, among the Sanyasis also, are the greatest of the Sanyasis even. So such Paramahamsas, they are offered respect by everyone, including the other Sanyasis who are not Paramahamsas. So these four sages are on the level of Paramahamsas: Sanaka Sanatana San Dhanasanat Kumara. And their bodily effulgence is very, very, very, very bright, because they are the most austere, completely absorbed in meditation on Brahman. No other business. They are not interested in dressing themselves, in any formalities, in any activities, material activities, even activities of self-realization. They are already self-realized. So why will they do any activity for attaining self-realization? They don't want to do anything. So they are simply aimlessly going around everywhere.

### Kumaras, Vaikuntha, Doorkeepers, Ignorance, Supreme Lord, Well-wisher

**Key Quote:** "The Lord is always anxious to serve sages like the Kumaras."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the doorkeepers' actions were a chance occurrence, as the Lord is always eager to serve sages like the Kumaras, who are the greatest of all created beings.

Absorbed in thought of Brahman. So when these sages try to enter, what is said here by Prabhupada? Such saints were not to be forbidden to enter the kingdom of Vaikuntha, but by chance the doorman objected to their entrance. This is not fitting. This is not proper. By chance the doorman objected. See the doorman, they are not ignorant people. They are themselves enlightened. That's how they are devotees in Vaikuntha. They are enlightened. So they can make out, even though these Kumaras look like five-year-old boys, naked, wandering naked, there is no possibility the doorman would have thought, why are these small boys simply coming here? No. They couldn't have thought like that because the Kumaras were self-realized. They were having that effulgence of great personalities. They were the oldest personalities. So there is no possibility that the doorman would have, out of ignorance, mistaken them to be small boys. No. That is not possible. Therefore it is said that by chance the doorman objected to their entrance. It should not have happened. By chance it happened. The Lord is always anxious to serve sages like the Kumaras, because the Supreme Lord is Surudam Sarvabhutanam. He is the topmost well-wisher of every living being. Now the Kumaras, they are the greatest among all the created beings. So how much the Lord will be inclined towards them? Can you just imagine? The Lord is the best well-wisher even of the most fallen condition soul. So how much more will he be a well-wisher of the Kumaras? So Prabhupada says, the Lord is always anxious to serve sages like the Kumaras. I explained in earlier class that the devotees in Vaikuntha always want to serve the Lord to please him. And the Lord is looking for opportunity to serve his devotees and please them. This is what is the reciprocation between the Lord and the devotees in the spiritual world. So rightly Prabhupada is telling here, the Lord is always anxious to serve sages like the Kumaras.

**Key Quote:** "the doorman astonishingly and outrageously prohibited them from entering."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights the astonishment and outrage caused by the doorkeepers' actions, emphasizing that it was an extraordinary incident even in Vaikuntha.

And in spite of knowing this fact, the doorman astonishingly and outrageously prohibited them from entering. Astonishing. It is very astonishing. Why? Everybody will think, why are they stopping? It is said here, in the next two words it is said, as other divinities were looking on, they stopped. Everybody else is looking. Why are they stopping? The six doormen, six pairs of doormen, first six doors, never stopped. They knew, these Kumaras are most eligible to enter. They are very eager to see the Lord. So the sixth doorman never stopped. So why this seventh door, these doormen are stopping? Others are looking. Why are they stopping? So astonishingly and outrageously, others would not have approved. Outrageously means shockingly bad behaviour. It is shocking. It is bad behaviour. Somebody deserving, why are they being stopped? Why are these doormen stopping? It is very wrong. It is not befitting. It is not proper behaviour. So astonishingly and outrageously prohibited them, prohibited them from entering. So this incident is an extraordinary incident, even in Vaikuntha. In Vaikuntha everything is extraordinary. Nothing is ordinary. But still, this sort of extraordinary incident is astonishing. It is not in line with something done to please the Lord. By stopping them, the doormen are not pleasing the Supreme Lord Narayana. No. It is not pleasing the Lord. That is what is described here, Bhagavat Pratikulashilav. They are not expected to behave like this. They are pure devotees. Why are they stopping? Why are they doing something which is not pleasing to the Lord? So others are all astonished and others are considering this as outrageous behaviour, not proper behaviour.

Not proper behaviour, because they know. These doormen, they know what is pleasing to the Lord. They know and they are standing there to serve the Lord, in a way to please the Lord. They are standing there for serving the Lord only. And somebody has come very eager to see the Lord, who deserves to be actually welcomed, such persons, who should be welcomed, who are eager to see the Lord, who have no other selfish motive. Why are they being stopped? Astonishingly and outrageously they are being prohibited. So this is something very, very, very, very unprecedented. So it will be described further how the events unfold, which leads to the pastimes of the Supreme Lord, extraordinary pastimes of the Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "A Yogi can expand himself into at most nine or ten forms. But each form, expanded form by the Yogic power will do the same activity."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Krishna's expansions are different from those of a yogi, highlighting the power of Yoga Maya.

This is the power of yoga maya. Yoga maya arranges in such a way that each one will think Krishna is in this palace. They will not know. Prabhupada describes elsewhere that when Krishna used to come out of his palace, in front of every palace there will be one person waiting to take Krishna to the assembly hall every day morning after he finishes morning duties. So, 16,108 palaces Krishna will come out and become one. 16,108 form will become one. One Krishna will go to the assembly hall. But when he comes back, he will divide himself into 16,108 different forms. Not divide, he multiplies actually, he expands. And then each palace he will go. But this is not seen ordinarily. Only when Narada wanted to see how the Lord is living in Dwaraka, Narada knew that Krishna will be actually performing some extraordinary Leela there. That's time. Leela. So Narada Muni went to see Krishna in Dwaraka. That time Krishna gave darshan to Narada. Every palace he saw Krishna is present simultaneously and in each palace he is doing totally different activity. Why is it mentioned that he is doing something extraordinary? Because a Yogi can expand himself into at most nine or ten forms, but each form, expanded form by the Yogic power will do the same activity. Just like in one form the Yogi is lifting his hand, all nine other forms, expanded forms, the same action. It will not be different. No possibility of different actions in different forms simultaneously, not possible.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna He expands Every form is Independent form Like an independent form It is Krishna only But it is like an independent form Separate person"
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain the nature of Krishna's expansions, emphasizing that each form is independent and capable of separate activities, thoughts, and feelings, and how Krishna reciprocates with each devotee individually.

Just like Prabhupada says, television screen. Television screen will just display whatever that particular channel which you have tuned. Whatever they are broadcasting, that only will come. Earlier we had only one channel, Doordarshan. So any TV you go, same thing will be visible, correct? Because originally nothing is there in the TV. Actually some broadcast is happening from some broadcasting station. Like that, this yogi when he expands, the expanded forms don't have any independent movement capacity, thinking capacity, nothing. Krishna, he expands, every form is independent form, like an independent form. It is Krishna only, but it is like an independent form, separate person, separate form, separate thinking, separate willing, separate feeling, separate senses, separate activities, separate opulence, everything separate. But who can make out this? Who can understand this? Unless Krishna reveals, it is not possible to understand, not possible to see or know or understand. It's not possible. In the spiritual world Krishna reciprocates with you. With each devotee personally, individually. So that is inconceivable, even for the devotees. It is inconceivable. So we cannot understand how, because for a neutral observer it will appear like Krishna is one person and there are so many in Gorakumandavan or in Vaikuntha, Narayana is one person and then there are so many other devotees. Dorman is there and some queen is there and some maid servant is there and somebody else is glorifying the Lord, somebody else is preparing some food for the Lord. So many servants are doing for one Lord in one Vaikuntha planet, entire planet, only one person. But actually that one Lord reciprocates with every devotee individually or personally. That is inconceivable. That the mayavadis cannot understand. Ordinary people cannot understand. Neutral observers cannot see.

**Key Quote:** "Even the devotees, they are engaged in Lord's service all the time because all the time the Lord is accepting their service."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the concept of time in the spiritual world and how devotees are constantly engaged in serving the Lord, even though the complexities are inconceivable.

So that's it for this. Not immediately, if you do not understand, you cannot tell that you can understand for yourself. If you never really like whom you like, you do not like, you are right to say so much and we started back this by saying you cannot understand apparently, but not just nearly what one person sees, you do not understand it will be a lot of time of giving a processors that then I do able to see what several of these offended individuals are companion to contribute to mortal knowledge while yet having understand them again and the system is there that we might very much restroom to divine descrição in the. They cannot see. Even the devotees, they are engaged in Lord's service all the time because all the time the Lord is accepting their service. So the concept of time in the spiritual world is very very different. It is described as ever present time in Brahma Samhita. There's a description. Time in the Goloka Vrindavana or even in Vaikuntha is like half a moment does not pass. Always present, present time. This is like now it is let's say 9:16. Every time they will see what's the time? 9:16. If there were to be a clock, there's no clock in Vaikuntha like that. But I'm just telling for a neutral observer it will look like what time is in Vaikuntha? 9:16. Hundred years have passed, what time is in Vaikuntha? 9:16. Hundred years have passed on the earth. So it is ever present time. We can't conceive of this. Yet there is day, there is night, there is so many things. Everything is going on as if there is time which is passing. So it is inconceivable for us. Nobody can understand this. That's why devotees don't break their head and understand all this complexity. They are just satisfied to know that Krishna or Narayana is their object of service and they are very happy rendering it, rendering service, their particular service.

**Key Quote:** "That spiritual advancement is not dependent on position, is not dependent on age, is not dependent on, some material considerations, no."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the story of Ajamila to illustrate that spiritual advancement is not dependent on age or position but on sincere devotional service.

Next question. Shiva is younger than Kumara in terms of birth. Just like Krishna, when he is born as son of Vasudeva, he is so young, no? Compared to Brahma, compared to all the other Devatas. He is the youngest, no? Small, that's how Brahma is coming and seeing, who is this boy? What is he doing? Indra is telling this Vrindavan Nivasis, every year they offer me Yajna. This year they are not offering Yajna because some foolish boy, talkative boy, not foolish boy, talkative boy is telling them, don't offer sacrifice. So they are listening to him? Indra is not able to understand. Who is this boy? So not able to understand. The spiritual advancement, you cannot understand. That spiritual advancement is not dependent on position, is not dependent on age, is not dependent on some material considerations, no. Like Ajamila, he had become so sinful. But he chanted helplessly Narayana's name, calling out his son. He became spiritually advanced. How advanced? That after the Yamarutas released him, I mean Vishnurutas, got him released from the Yamarutas. And Vishnurutas disappeared, Yamarutas went back to Yamloka, to find out from Yamaraja, what happened? Why we are stopped? And then Ajamila, what did he do? He continued with his wife and children? No. Immediately went to Haridwar. I wasted my life. Now I have a second chance. Otherwise I should have been taken to hell for punishment. So now let me very carefully do devotional service. And what is the standard of his service? That within a short time, the same Vishnurutas came to take him back to Godhead, in Vaikuntha aeroplane. So he became spiritually advanced. Sinful man, sinful man suddenly gave up all sinful activities, became very, very, very, very serious about devotional service and performed first class devotional service. Short time became eligible to go back to Godhead. Perfect.

Perfected his devotional service. It began with this helplessly chanting Narayana. That's why Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, chant, but call out for the Lord helplessly. Call out for the Lord helplessly. Then very quickly you become advanced. Just like Ajamila. You will also become advanced. Anybody can become advanced. Even the most sinful man can become advanced that way. So you cannot compare age and say, oh because this person is more elderly, so he is more advanced. No. That is not the criterion for advancement. Neither position. You are now talking of Shiva being expansion or incarnation of the Supreme Lord. Shiva is not a Jeeva. Shiva is in a category by himself. He is a special kind of incarnation of the Lord. Gunavatara. Hmm.

**Key Quote:** "Shiva is not a Jeeva. For Jeeva karma applies. He is not Jeeva. So for him there is no karma. Whatever he does."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Shiva's birth is different from that of a Jeeva and that he is always on the liberated platform, not influenced by karma or the Gunas.

So Shiva is in his position. Kumaras are in their own position, as liberated souls. So everybody has got their own position in the liberated state. Of course in the liberated state. Conditioned state their position is based on their karma. But liberated souls, they have their specific individual position in relationship with Krishna in the spiritual world. That is the constitutional position. You understand? So don't compare Kumaras, oldest, but Shiva is younger, but more advanced. There is no comparison like that. See Shiva, just like Krishna appears to take birth as son of Vasudeva and Devaki. Shiva appears to come out of the anger of Brahma, when Brahma became angry, when Kumaras refused to get married and increase the population, to do the work of Prajapati. They didn't want to be Prajapati. They didn't want to do service of Prajapati. So then Brahma became, immediately what did Brahma do? Became angry. How can you disobey me? And out of the anger came Rudra, Shiva. So apparently Shiva is born later than the Kumaras. Shiva is born out of the anger of Brahma. But Shiva is not a personality, appearing out of some karma, not due to karma. He has nothing to do with karma. He is not a Jeeva. For Jeeva karma applies. He is not Jeeva. So for him there is no karma, whatever he does. He is incarnation of the Lord. So his activities are all liberated platform. He is on the liberated platform always. He is never under the Gunas. He is a master of the, personification of Gunas, Durga Devi. He is the husband of Durga Devi. He is the husband or the Lord of Durga Devi. So he is not, he doesn't come under the influence of the Gunas, Shiva. But he is not equal to Vishnu. He is not equal to Vishnu. He is not Vishnu Tattva. He is in a separate category by himself, eternally so.

**Key Quote:** "For the Leela to take place, it is arranged that Balarama doesn't know that Krishna has expanded and Brahma has stolen. Balarama doesn't know. For the sake of the Leela."
**Summary:** The speaker answers a question about why Balarama didn't know about Krishna's expansions during the Brahma-vimohana-lila, explaining that it was arranged by Yogamaya for the sake of the pastimes.

Krishna expanded himself into Gopal's calf, cows, Krishna cooking. So Brahma was not aware about this. Later Brahma came to know that Krishna himself, who expanded into Gopal, Gopal, cow, cows. So here the question is, Krishna and Brahma didn't come to know. They tend to have no idea. So Brahma also came to know when something happened. What happened? When they were cow herding, the older cows came running down to the calves. Even though it's very unusual, they never do so and they started, you know, licking the body of the calf. And cowherd men who were in charge of those cows, they became very angry at the cows. But when they came down, they are suddenly embracing the cowherd boys. So Balarama saw unusual affection between the cowherd boys and the cowherd men and between the cows and the cows. And then he asked Krishna, what is going on? What is happening? So your question is, how is that Balarama doesn't know? This is called Leela. For the Leela to take place, it is arranged that Balarama doesn't know that Krishna has expanded and Brahma has stolen. Balarama doesn't know, for the sake of the Leela. Like Kaliya, Dhaman Leela, when everybody became anxious, where is Krishna? Some ill omens. And then they all went and Balarama went with them. Then they are all trying to do something to save Krishna. He is in the clutches of Kaliya. Balarama is laughing. He knows nothing will happen to Krishna. So he is telling, don't worry, nothing will happen to Krishna. But they are not able to understand or believe that. They are all anxious for saving Krishna. So Balarama knows. So for the sake of the Leela, Yogamaya reveals something, does not reveal something. So it is all arranged by Yogamaya, which is Krishna's own energy, for the sake of his pastimes. Like these doormen. How is it that they did not recognize the Kumaras? Such great persons and they are thinking, five year old boys, why are you coming here? Can't they make out? They are great sages, great Tapasvi, self realized, oldest, senior most, sages, completely renounced. They can't make out. So it is the arrangement of Yogamaya for the pastimes of the Supreme Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse about the Kumaras becoming angry and sets the stage for discussing anger in the context of devotion and liberation.

When the Kumaras, although by far the fittest persons, were thus forbidden entrance by the two chief doorkeepers of Sri Hari, while other divinities looked on, their eyes suddenly turned red because of anger, due to their great eagerness to see their most beloved master Sri Hari, the personality of Godhead. Please repeat this translation. When the Kumaras, although by far the fittest persons, were thus forbidden entrance by the two chief doorkeepers of Sri Hari, while other divinities looked on, their eyes suddenly turned red because of anger, due to their great eagerness to see their most beloved master Sri Hari, the personality of Godhead, performed by Srila Prabhupada.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, the Vedic sociological conception is that a sanyasi should not be restricted. He is allowed to go anywhere and everywhere he wants, and he has not refused any gift he might demand from a householder."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the role and freedom of a sanyasi in Vedic culture, emphasizing their duty to preach and not be restricted.

According to the Vedic system, a sanyasi, a person in the renounced order of life, is dressed in saffron coloured garments. This saffron dress is practically a passport for the mendicant and sanyasi to go anywhere. The sanyasi's duty is to enlighten people in Krishna consciousness. Those in the renounced order of life have no other business but preaching the glories and supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, the Vedic sociological conception is that a sanyasi should not be restricted. He is allowed to go anywhere and everywhere he wants, and he has not refused any gift he might demand from a householder.

### Krishna, friendship, anger, desire

**Key Quote:** "As Lord Krishna states in the Bhagavad Gita, he is the best friend of all living entities, suhrdam sarva bhutanam."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights Krishna as the best friend and explains the relationship between desire and anger, introducing the concept of anger as the younger brother of desire.

The four Kumaras came to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana. The word suhrtama, best of all friends, is important. As Lord Krishna states in the Bhagavad Gita, he is the best friend of all living entities, suhrdam sarva bhutanam. No one can be a greater well-wishing friend to any living entity than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is so kindly disposed towards everyone, that in spite of our completely forgetting our relationship with the Supreme Lord, he comes himself, sometimes personally as Lord Krishna appeared on this earth, and sometimes as his devotee, as did Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and sometimes he sends his bona fide devotees to reclaim all the fallen souls. Therefore, he is the greatest well-wisher. He is the best well-wishing friend of everyone, and the Kumaras wanted to see him. The doorkeepers should have known that the four sages had no other business, and therefore to restrict them from entering the palace was not apt. In this verse, it is figuratively stated that the younger brother of desire suddenly appeared in person when the sages were forbidden to see their most beloved personality of Godhead. The younger brother of desire is anger.

### anger, liberation, Krishna consciousness, sense gratification

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The difference between the anger of an ordinary person and that of a liberated person is that an ordinary person becomes angry because his sense desires are not being fulfilled, whereas a liberated person like the Kumaras becomes angry when restricted in the discharge of duties for serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between anger in the conditioned and liberated states, emphasizing that liberated individuals become angry when service to Krishna is obstructed, not for personal gratification.

If once desire is not fulfilled, the younger brother anger follows. Here we can mark that even great saintly persons like the Kumaras were also angry, but they were not angry for their personal interests. They were angry because they were forbidden to enter the palace to see the personality of Godhead. Therefore, the theory that in the perfectional stage one should not have anger is not supported in this verse. Anger will continue even in the liberated stage. These four mendicant brothers, the Kumaras, were considered liberated persons, but still they were angry because they were restricted in their service to the Lord. The difference between the anger of an ordinary person and that of a liberated person is that an ordinary person becomes angry because his sense desires are not being fulfilled, whereas a liberated person like the Kumaras becomes angry when restricted in the discharge of duties for serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the previous verse, it has been clearly mentioned that the Kumaras were liberated persons. Vidhita Atma Tattva means one who understands the truth of self-realization. One who does not understand the truth of self-realization is called ignorant. But one who understands the self, the super-self, their interrelation and activities in self-realization is called Vidhita Atma Tattva. Although the Kumaras were already liberated persons, they nevertheless became angry. This point is very important. Becoming liberated does not necessitate losing one's sensual activities. Sense activities continue even in the liberated stage. The difference is, however, that sense activities in liberation are accepted only in connection with Krishna Consciousness, whereas sense activities in the conditioned stage are enacted for personal sense gratification.

**Key Quote:** "Here kamanuja, kama-anuja, the younger brother of desire means if desire is unfulfilled, it is generally followed by anger."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the poetic description of anger as the younger brother of desire, explaining that anger arises when desire is unfulfilled.

and therefore they became angry suddenly they became angry and it is described their anger was very much visible that their eyes were open and they could see the anger and their eyes were suddenly turned red. The Vaikuntha Nivasis, their eyes are naturally red. But generally in the material world we don't see somebody with red eyes except when they become angry or they have some problem with the eye. Otherwise we don't see red eyes, somebody with red eyes. So Prabhupada elaborately explains in the purport this point of anger and very poetic description. kamanujena Sudden appearance of the younger brother of desire in the personality of the Kumaras. So this is a description of anger as something which Anuja means also to follow. Lakshmana is Rama Anuja. So both the meanings are valid. Anuja means younger brother. Anuja. Ja means one who takes birth. Anu means afterwards, following. So younger brother takes birth after the older one is born. Correct? So Anuja means younger brother. And Anuja also means one who follows. One who follows. So here kamanuja, kama-anuja, the younger brother of desire means if desire is unfulfilled, it is generally followed by anger. Anger is younger brother of desire. This is a poetic description. It actually means anger follows desire which is unfulfilled.

**Key Quote:** "Anger in the conditioned state, which is a negative quality, which is detrimental for our spiritual progress, which can result in criminal activities being performed, laws being broken, uncontrolled anger."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the negative quality of anger in the conditioned state with the possibility of anger being a spiritual emotion in the liberated state.

Now if you read the Bhagavad Gita, nowhere it is mentioned, at least as far as I know, that anger exists in the liberated state and that is a pure emotion that is not described in the Bhagavad Gita. Is it there somewhere in the Bhagavad Gita? Even on the purports I didn't see. But in the Bhagavatam there is description. Anger in the conditioned state, which is a negative quality, which is detrimental for our spiritual progress, which can result in criminal activities being performed, laws being broken, uncontrolled anger. Sometimes they say murders happen simply because the person who committed that murder was unable to control his anger. So, and among devotees, what happens if anger is uncontrolled? Especially by neophyte devotees. Uncontrolled anger may lead to Vaishnava Prath. Being committed by the neophyte who becomes angry. So, anger in the conditioned state is very, very negative quality. It's very negative quality. But in the liberated state, anger is one of the many spiritual emotions.

### love, anger, liberated state, kama, prema

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Sometimes Radharani becomes angry with Krishna. That anger is out of love for Krishna. It is out of love for Krishna. So, in that anger also there is love."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that anger can be an expression of love in the liberated state, distinguishing between kama (lust) and prema (love for Krishna).

If you carefully study the twelve kinds of loving relationships, love is expressed indirectly in seven ways. In anger there is love. Raudra, rasa. Twelve kinds of rasa. Five are primary rasas. Seven secondary rasas. Sometimes Radharani becomes angry with Krishna. That anger is out of love for Krishna. It is out of love for Krishna. So, in that anger also there is love. But that love is always in the liberated state. There is no question of love in the conditioned state. In the conditioned state, love is reflected as lust. Prema is reflected as, pervertedly reflected as kama. So, in the Chaitanya Charita Amrita, Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami distinguishes between kama and prema. What is the definition of kama he gives and what is the definition of prema? Atma yendriya, preeti vancha. That's called kama. A strong desire to satisfy my own senses is called kama. Is called lust. And a very strong desire to please Krishna's senses. Krishna yendriya, preeti vancha, prema nama dhare. It is called prema. It is called love. So, prema is the strong desire to please Krishna's senses. So, in prema, in trying to please Krishna, in trying to satisfy Krishna, sometimes, when there is an obstacle, then there could be anger, even in the liberated state. And that's exactly what is happening here. The Kumaras are liberated personalities. They are very angry. They are eager to see their beloved, most beloved master. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Hari. And they are being stopped. Though they are the most qualified persons, fittest persons, to approach and have darshan. So, it is described here, this extraordinary incident, in this section of the Bhagavatam, to help us understand, what is this anger in the liberated state. So, elaborately, Prabhupada describes. First of all, Prabhupada says, according to the Vedic system, a sanyasi, a person in renounced order of life,

**Summary:** The speaker returns to the topic of sanyasis, explaining the significance of saffron robes and their primary duty to preach Krishna consciousness.

which is dressed in saffron-colored garments. This is the Vedic culture, that saffron color indicates the person is in the renounced order. Of course, now, Vedic culture is not so much followed. Somebody wants to go to Ayyappa temple, and has taken some kind of vow, to follow some rules. So, then they wear saffron. Sometimes they wear black. Some of them wear red. Some of them wear saffron. Like that. So, but strictly in the Vedic culture, except sanyasis, nobody dresses in saffron-colored garments. It is reserved for sanyasis. Now, that is because, this saffron dress is practically a passport for the mendicant and sanyasi to go anywhere. He is identified as a sanyasi by his saffron dress, which means that he can go anywhere without any restriction. Mendicant. Do you understand what is mendicant? What is the meaning of the word mendicant? It is an English word. Beggar. One who begs. Now, sanyasis, sometimes, they go begging from householders, simply to get an opportunity to enter the householder's house. And why are they trying to enter? In order to enlighten them in Krishna consciousness. That's why Prabhupada says, those in the renounced order of life have no other business but preaching the glories and supremacy to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Vedic culture, the sanyasis are simply meant to travel and preach. Especially to the householders who become busy with their family life and may forget the prime goal of life, self-realization. To awaken such householders, to enlighten them in Krishna consciousness, a sanyasi travels and preaches.

This chapter was entitled, 'The Pandavas Retired Timely.' So the Pandavas retired and they prepared themselves to go back to Godhead. Now we will hear the description of even the wives of the Pandavas also went back to Godhead, following in the footsteps of their husbands. So the 50th verse: Draupadi Chatad Aagnyaya Patinam Anapekshatam Vasudeve Bhagavati Hekantamatir Apatam. The meaning of this 50th verse is: Draupadi also saw that her husbands, without caring for her, were leaving home. She knew well about Lord Vasudeva and the love of Krishna, the personality of Godhead. Both she and Subhadra became absorbed in thoughts of Krishna and attained the same results as their husbands.

Everyone has to take care of his own plane, and if there is any danger, no other plane can help another in that condition."

**Summary:** The speaker stresses the need for consistent spiritual practice throughout life, not just at the time of death, to avoid rebirth.

Before death comes. It's not that at the time of death I'll start practicing, I'll start preparing. No. At the time of death, if you are not ready to go back to Godhead, we have to accept another body. We have to accept another birth. So therefore it is said here that the example is given of flying an airplane. Now, each one has to fly his or her own plane to go back to Godhead. Of course, this is not literal, but you can literally. It is the process or the method or the way to go back to Godhead should be known to each person before death comes.

Similarly, at the end of life, when one has to go back home, back to Godhead, everyone has to take care of himself without help rendered by another. At the time of quitting the body, there is no question of taking help of another devotee or spiritual master or anybody like that. No. Prabhupada clarifies, "The help is however offered on the ground before flying in space." Similarly, the spiritual master, the father, the mother, the relatives, the husband, and others can all render help during one's lifetime. While we are living in this present body, we should take help, we should take guidance, we should practice, we should live in the association of people who are seriously practicing.

We take help from the spiritual master. We take help from the father, mother, the relatives, all our superiors. There is a verse in the Bhagavatam that says, "Don't accept the position of becoming a father or a mother or a husband or a teacher or a devata or a king if you cannot deliver your dependents from the cycle of birth and death." So there is a responsibility towards a dependent or a subordinate that the superior has to train, educate, and help the subordinate to actually prepare them for going back to Godhead at the end of life. So therefore they are specifically mentioned here by Srila Prabhupada: The spiritual master, the father, the mother, the relatives, the husband, and others can all render help.

But while crossing the sea, one has to take care of himself and utilize the instructions formally received. While actually going back to Godhead, when quitting the body, after quitting the body, one has to utilize those instructions. One has to have had sufficient practice, and that will be also explained what is that practice, what is that we have to do is clearly explained in the later part of this purport. Continue to read the purport by Srila Prabhupada: Draupadi had five husbands, and no one asked Draupadi to come when they were going back to Godhead. The five husbands, the five Pandavas, Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva, none of them asked Draupadi, "Please come with me, let us together go back to Godhead." No. Why? Because Draupadi had to take care of herself without waiting for her great husbands.

**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between temporary material relationships and the eternal spiritual relationship of the soul with Krishna.

So it is very clear, while in this body, while in this material existence, the relationships are between the bodies. It is not between the souls. The material relationships are always between two bodies. So this we have to remember, and when we quit the body, the relations are finished. There is no more relationship. Now the soul, however, has eternal spiritual relationship with Krishna. The individual soul has eternal particular loving relationship with Krishna, and through Krishna, through the relationship with Krishna, the soul is related to other souls also.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the temporary nature of material relationships and highlights Draupadi's self-reliance in her spiritual practice.

So those relationships are spiritual, eternal. They are not temporary. They are not just based on the material body, no. So Draupadi's relationship with her five husbands was as long as the bodies were there. Even in terms of duty of the wife towards the husband or husband towards the wife, it is only as long as the body is there. Once one quits the body, there is no more duty, there is no more relationship, material relationship, I mean material relationship. So therefore Srila Prabhupada said, "Draupadi had to take care of herself without waiting for her great husbands, and because she was already trained, she at once took to concentration upon the lotus feet of Lord Vasudeva Krishna, the personality of God."

Has one got to do? One simply has to concentrate one's attention upon the lotus feet of Krishna, completely on the lotus feet of Krishna. One straight goes back to Godhead, straight away, and it is immediate, immediate. When death comes means we have to quit the body even before the next moment. We cannot even calculate how fast this soul is transferred to the spiritual kingdom, provided at the time of death and we are completely fixed up in concentration of the attention on Krishna's lotus feet.

### qualities of Krishna, responsibility, chivalry, Kshatriya dharma
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/_8Hx3BFK-YU?t=45
**Verse References:** BG 18.43
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "A Kshatriya is courageous in battle. He never retreats from a battle."
**Summary:** The lecture discusses Krishna's quality of accepting responsibility, particularly his display of chivalry as a Kshatriya, referencing the qualities of a Kshatriya as described in the Bhagavad Gita.

In this session we will be discussing the same verses which we were discussing in the previous few sessions. Four sessions we have already completed, discussing these set of verses, 25 to 30 of the 16th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. These are the verses describing the 40 transcendental qualities that are to be found in the Supreme Lord, which Mother Earth is describing to Dharma. So among the qualities of Krishna, one of the qualities described is his responsibility, quality of accepting responsibility. So even in his transcendental pastimes, his different role in his transcendental pastimes, he accepts responsibility and carries out his responsibility very, very wonderfully. So Sri Ramaprabha is describing when he is playing the part of a Kshatriya as the son of Maharaj Vasudeva, he displayed that Kshatriya quality of being chivalrous. So Sri Ramaprabha says, a Kshatriya king has to secure a wife by fighting or kidnapping a princess, sometimes. This sort of behavior for a Kshatriya is praiseworthy in the sense that a Kshatriya must show his power of chivalry to his would-be wife, so that the daughter of a Kshatriya is not taken away from him. The daughter of a Kshatriya can see the valor of her would-be husband. A Kshatriya princess, she wants demonstration before she marries another Kshatriya king. She wants to see his power of chivalry, his bravery. Not that he is dressed up and he is having some wealth, but actually in his heart he is not having that courage to fight. Kshatriya means he should have the courage to fight to the extent that if required he is willing to give up his life, but he will not give up the fight. Yuddhecha api apalayanam. This is described in the Bhagavad Gita by Krishna in the 18th chapter, in the 43rd verse, describing the qualities of a Kshatriya. A Kshatriya is courageous in battle. He never retreats from a battle.

**Key Quote:** "So like that he had to secure so many different wives."
**Summary:** The segment narrates instances from the pastimes of Lord Rama and Lord Krishna where they displayed chivalry and courage to secure their wives, highlighting Rama breaking the bow of Lord Shiva and Krishna rescuing Rukmini.

So, in displaying his courage in battle, Krishna, in order to marry some princess, he actually displayed his courage by actually fighting in some cases. So Srila Prabhupada says even the personality of Godhead Sri Rama displayed such a chivalry, a spirit of chivalry during his marriage. He broke the strongest bow called Haradhanus and achieved the hand of Sita Devi, the mother of all opulence. Lord Rama is a supreme lord, but he appeared as the son of a Kshatriya, as Dasharatha's son. And when Vishwamitra took Lord Ramachandra, he was a small boy, a young prince. Vishwamitra took him to protect his sacrificial arena. Dasharatha initially was hesitant, but when Vishwamitra explained to Dasharatha, your son is no ordinary person. He is a supreme lord incarnated as your son. So don't have any doubts whether your son can give protection to my sacrificial arena. Anyway, Dasharatha agreed and finally sent Rama and Lakshmana. So Rama and Lakshmana were young princes, but they fought against 14,000 rakshasa associates of Ravana who were disturbing the sacrificial arena of Vishwamitra Rishi and other saintly persons. So Rama killed all of them and delivered all the 14,000 rakshasa. So that's only possible for the Supreme Personality of Karthik. But he displayed that, that chivalry. And when Sita Swayamvara, Janaka had declared that whichever king wants to marry my daughter, beautiful daughter, the mother of all opulence, Sita Devi, Lakshmiji, then they have to actually break one very, very, very heavy bow, Haradhanu, bow of Lord Shiva. Three hundred men had to carry it to bring it to the place where the competition was to take place. And single-handedly of course Lord Rama lifted it. Not only lifted it as a heavy bow, but he also broke that strongest bow easily, very effortlessly he broke it. So he actually demonstrated his strength as a powerful Kshatriya. Lord Krishna also he had to fight like a chivalrous Kshatriya to secure a wife. Just like Rukmini, it was scheduled, Rukmini was scheduled to marry someone else, Shishupala, against her wish and against her father's wish also, her elder brother decided to marry Rukmini to Shishupala. And Rukmini wanted to marry Krishna because she is a devotee of Krishna. So she sent a secret letter to Krishna, kindly rescue me. Krishna came to rescue and he had to fight against the army of Shishupala, army of Shishupala, and he fought very bravely and kidnapped Rukmini and brought her safely to Dwaraka.

**Key Quote:** "He is not irresponsible at any time."
**Summary:** This section emphasizes Krishna's full responsibility in all his transcendental pastimes, proving his supremacy through his actions and declarations.

So like that he had to secure so many different wives. A Kshatriya generally marries more than one wife. So Krishna as part of his Leela he married 16,108 princesses. Among them 16,108 princesses were all held captive by one Bhaumasura. So Krishna fought against Bhaumasura and rescued these princesses. So like that he displayed full responsibility in every action of his different transcendental pastimes. He is not irresponsible at any time. And of course he is all perfect. Krishna is the Supreme Lord, is all perfect. But he demonstrates that also. Not simply by way of proclaiming or claiming by words, I am the greatest, or I am the Supreme, or I am the Lord of everything. Krishna declares in Bhagavad Gita I am the Lord of all the planets in the entire creation. So when he declares that he also proves it. When he displayed his universal form he proved it. When he fought against all the demons he proved it. When he accepted the challenge of different Kshatriyas and defeated them he proved his supremacy.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Only fools are ungrateful to their benefactors."
**Summary:** The lecture delves into the quality of knowledge, breaking it down into five subheadings: intelligence, gratefulness, understanding circumstances, perfect knowledge, and self-knowledge, emphasizing the importance of gratitude and the Lord's reciprocation of devotional service.

Then there is one more quality called knowledge. The 14th quality called knowledge. It can be analyzed under five subheadings. So the first one is intelligence. Second one, second subheading of knowledge is gratefulness. Third one is power of understanding the circumstantial environments of place, object and time. And fourth one is perfect knowledge of everything in this world. And the fifth one, the last one, under the five subheadings. The fifth one is knowledge of the self is the most confidential knowledge. We all look like we are some material body, product of matter, and we think that way also. I am this body. But actually we are not a body. We are not material in nature. We are spiritual. We are spirit soul. So this knowledge of the self, the real I, a spirit soul, this knowledge is the most confidential one. It is called Brahmavidya, Atmavidya, Adhyatmavidya. Different names are same. Knowledge of the self. So these five subheadings, Prabhupada explains briefly regarding gratitude. Prabhupada says, Only fools are ungrateful to their benefactors. What does it mean? If I take some benefit from somebody, I should be grateful to that person who is offering me some benefit. That's the least I can do after receiving some benediction. I should at least be grateful to that person. So the Supreme Lord's position is that he does not require any benefit from anyone, because he is completely full in himself. Atma Rama is self-satisfied, because he is the owner of every resource. He is the supreme proprietor of everything and everyone. So what is the need for him? There is no need for him of anything. So there is no question of the Lord being in want. But still when his pure devotees render him service, he feels benefited by their pure devotional service, and therefore he feels grateful to his devotees for their unsophisticated, unconditional service, and tries to reciprocate that service of the devotees by himself

**Key Quote:** "Krishna feels a sense of gratitude for his devotees rendering him service."
**Summary:** The segment continues discussing Krishna's gratitude towards his devotees and his all-knowing nature due to his omnipresence through the Brahma Jyoti.

rendering service to the devotee. Although the devotee does not expect anything in return from the Lord. See how pure devotees serve Krishna out of love for him and they don't want anything in return. Krishna accepts his service and he wants to repay his devotees, and therefore he renders service to him though the devotees don't want any service. Anyway he is the only maintainer of everyone. Still Krishna feels a sense of gratitude for his devotees rendering him service. Now regarding the Lord being all knowing, one of the subheadings of knowledge was that gratefulness and another subheading was perfect knowledge of everything. Perfect knowledge of everything. So regarding that Srila Prabhupada explains here the Vedas say Brahma Brahma Brahma Brahma. That means the Lord is all pervading, present everywhere by the omnipresent rays of his effulgence called Brahma Jyoti. There is a Brahma Jyoti that is effulgence of the Lord that spread everywhere in the entire creation. And because he is present everywhere he is also he knows everything. Simply because he is conscious. He is conscious being. So since he is conscious and he is present everywhere he knows everything. So that is the way it is explained he is all knowing the Srila Prabhupada. So we will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "That is the first incarnation of the Lord before the creation of this entire material cosmic manifestation."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of the Lord's transcendental qualities and explains the concept of Maha Vishnu as the first incarnation before creation, residing in the material energy portion of the spiritual sky.

Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya, Narayanam Namaskritya, Naram Chai Vanarottamam, Devim Saraswatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udhirayet. In this session we continue to discuss from the verses 25 to 30 of the 16th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. These set of verses describe the transcendental qualities, 40 transcendental qualities of the Lord, of which some of them are described in detail in the purport by Srila Prabhupada. So we will conclude. We will conclude with this part 7 of the discussion on these verses. This is the last part, the reminder of the purport that we have not yet discussed. We are going to complete it in this session. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, the last part of the purport, "This material world is a product of the Mahat Tattva, which is a state of the Lord's presence, which is a state of the Lord's dreaming condition in his yoga nidra mystic slumber in the causal ocean." A lot of technical terms in here. Now the Supreme Lord, he incarnates in this material world for the purpose of the material creation, maintenance, destruction, for the sake of... attracting the conditioned souls to go back to Godhead for the sake of giving transcendental knowledge for displaying his transcendental pastimes and so many purposes. So different incarnations of the Lord appear from time to time. But at the beginning of the creation or even before the creation takes place, the Lord, first of all, he incarnates as Maha Vishnu.

**Key Quote:** "So, this material world is created when the Lord lies down on the causal ocean and goes to sleep."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on Maha Vishnu entering the material region, lying down on the causal ocean, and entering Yoga Nidra, which is described as a mystic slumber that initiates the material creation.

That is the first incarnation of the Lord before the creation of this entire material cosmic manifestation. So this Maha Vishnu, he appears in the portion of the spiritual sky which is covered by the material energy. Material energy. The material energy is like a cloud in the brilliantly effulgent spiritual sky. And in that cloud-like region, the Lord enters. Vishnu means one who enters. He enters into that material region covered by the material energy. And he lies down on the causal ocean. And he lies down on the causal ocean. And he lies down on the causal ocean. So right in that causal ocean lies water. ...The causal ocean. And he lies down and he goes to sleep. And his sleeping is not like ours. When we sleep we go into forgetfulness of our wakeful state. But the Lord, he is never forgetful. So his sleeping is caused by our sleep. sleeping is called yoga nidra. Nidra means sleeping. So, Srila Prabhupada describes that yoga nidra as mystic slumber. Slumber means sleeping. So, it's mystical how he goes to sleep. It is his pastime. It's his leela.

**Key Quote:** "And he dreams and in that dreaming state there is the creation of the material world. It is a product of the mahat tattva."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the material world is created from the Lord's dreaming state, which activates the dormant material energy (Mahat Tattva) and initiates the differentiation into various elements.

So, this material world is created when the Lord lies down on the causal ocean and goes to sleep. And the Lord dreams about the material creation. Now, this dreaming of the Lord is not like our dreaming. It is entirely different. That in the dreaming condition also there is the creation, maintenance and destruction of the material universes. So, the creation begins when the Lord enters this material energy region like a cloud in the spiritual sky. And he lies down on the causal ocean. And he dreams. He goes to sleep. Mystic slumber. Yoga nidra. And he dreams and in that dreaming state there is the creation of the material world. It is a product of the mahat tattva. Mahat tattva is the material energy in a dormant condition when it is activated by the glass. The dance of Maha Vishnu. Then that inactive state of material energy transforms into activated condition. And in that activated condition the creation begins. By the mahat tattva differentiating into the different elements.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Still the whole creation appears to be a factual presentation."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how the Lord combines the elements and even though the material world is produced in the Lord's dreaming condition, it is still a factual presentation, highlighting the Lord's complete control and consciousness.

And later on the elements are combined by the Supreme Lord in his form as... Garbodhaka Shai Vishnu or Vishwatma in his Hiranyagarbha incarnation or expansion. Even though this material world is produced in the state of the Lord's dreaming condition. Still the whole creation appears to be a factual presentation. It is a factual presentation of the Lord. That means the Lord's dreaming conditions are also factual manifestations. Hmm. He... There is no difference... Ah... Between his dreaming condition and his wakeful condition. There is no difference. In our case it is entirely different. When we are in the wakeful state we are forgetful of our dreaming state. And when we are in the dreaming condition we are forgetful about our wakeful state. So that is our position. Whereas the Lord... For him he is ever cognizant. Always conscious. Always aware of everything. In every nook and corner of the entire creation. Spiritual world and material world. Because his consciousness is spread everywhere. So he is fully conscious. So therefore the creation of this world is also a factual manifestation of the Lord's dreaming condition. He can therefore bring everything under his transcendental control. You see, his complete control always exists. In the spiritual world, in the material world, in all conditions, in all states of existence.

### Lord's Fullness, Mercy to Demons, Salvation

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Thus whenever and wherever he does appear he does so in his fullness."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the Lord always appears in his fullness, never lacking in power or knowledge, and extends his mercy even to demons by granting them salvation when they are killed by him.

He is complete controller of everything and everyone. Thus whenever and wherever he does appear he does so in his fullness. He is not bereft of any of his powers when he appears even as Vishnu lying down on the causal ocean and going to sleep. He is not bereft of any of his power. He is not forgetful. He does not go into ignorance. He is always completely full with perfect knowledge. So he appears in this world or anywhere in any form of incarnation, personal incarnation, in his fullness. He is always with his knowledge, with his beauty, with his energies, with his paraphernalia, with his associates. He is always full. He is never partial. He is never incomplete. So therefore Srila Prabhupada says further, "The Lord being all that is described above maintains the affairs of the creation. He creates, he maintains. And by his so doing he gives salvation even to his enemies who are killed by him." We say the Lord is all merciful. So he is merciful even to the demons who are against the Lord. Because they are also his part and parcel. They are also his children. Though they are disobedient or they are misled or they are desirous of independent enjoyment or they have got enviousness, whatever be their condition, they are ultimately part and parcel of the Supreme Lord only as much as anyone else is. So Krishna never neglects them. So he, when they create some disturbance for the devotees, then Krishna comes to stop that disturbance and Krishna kills the demons. But his killing is good for the demons because the demons get salvation or mukti or moksha, liberation from material bondage. So it's a favor of the Lord upon the demons when the demons are killed by the Lord personally.

**Summary:** This segment explains that even liberated souls are attracted to Krishna, proving his transcendental nature, and that he is worshiped by the greatest demigods like Brahma and Shiva.

And further, he, the Supreme Lord, is attractive even to the topmost liberated soul. That liberated souls are also attracted to Krishna. They don't have any attraction for anything material. Those are liberated. It's only the conditioned souls who are running after matter and material products. The liberated soul is not interested in any matter or material objects. Even they are attracted by Krishna. When they have no attraction for anything material, still they are attracted to Krishna, which means that Krishna is not at all material personality. He is completely transcendental. Only then can he be attractive to the transcendentalists. Thus, the Supreme Lord is worshipable even by Brahma and Shiva, the greatest of all demigods. That is the position. Shiva virenchi nutam. Bhagavatam's eleventh canto describes this. He is worshiped even by the greatest demigods, Shiva and Brahma. Virenchi means Brahma.

**Key Quote:** "Nobody can actually estimate or count the qualities of the lord, nor can anybody estimate in what quantity he has got those qualities."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by discussing the Lord's creative energy, the countless incarnations, and the plenary expansions in the spiritual world, emphasizing that the Lord's qualities are unfathomable and cannot be estimated.

Now, regarding his creative energy. Even in his incarnation of Purushavatara, he is the lord of the creative energy. This creative energy is working under his direction. And to control the material energy, he is the root cause of innumerable incarnations in all the universes. How many incarnations are there? Countless. We cannot count. To give an example, just the incarnation of Manu. There are five hundred thousand incarnations of Manu in the lifetime of Brahma in one universe. Like this, there are millions of universes. So who can count how many incarnations of the lord appear in the material world? Nobody can count. And as far as the spiritual world is concerned, beyond this material creation, there is no incarnation, but there are plenary expansions of the lord, and they are perfectly carrying out their activities in the spiritual world. So, nobody can actually estimate or count the qualities of the lord, nor can anybody estimate in what quantity he has got those qualities. All of them are unfathomable, inconceivable, cannot be estimated by anyone. So that is the unique position of the supreme lord. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, I must kill this most wretched man because he is violent against other living beings."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verses from Srimad Bhagavatam and their meaning, focusing on the king's duty to protect all living beings and punish those who cause terror.

In this session we will be discussing two verses, the 10th and the 11th verses, of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Both these verses are given together by Srila Prabhupada, so I shall read both of them, the 10th verse and the 11th verse. Yasya Rashtre Prajasarvaha Trasyante Sadhya Asadubihi Tasya Mattasya Nashyanti Keertir Ayur Bhagogatihi Esha Ragnam Parodharmo Hyartanam Aarti Nigraha Ataenam Vadishyami Bhutadruham Asaptamam The meaning of these two verses is as follows: O chaste one, the king's good name, duration of life and good rebirth vanish when all kinds of living beings are terrified by miscreants in his kingdom. It is certainly the prime duty of the king to subdue first the sufferings of those who suffer. Therefore, I must kill this most wretched man because he is violent against other living beings. So Srila Prabhupada writes elaborate purport for these two verses.

**Key Quote:** "Similarly, it is the duty of the government to kill at once all bad social elements such as thieves, decoits and murderers."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing the king's responsibility to protect all citizens, including animals, and to punish those who disturb the peace.

Purport is as follows: When all kinds of living beings are terrified by miscreants in his kingdom, when there is some disturbance caused by wild animals in a village or town, the police or others take action to kill them. Similarly, it is the duty of the government to kill at once all bad social elements such as thieves, decoits and murderers. The same punishment is also due to animal killers because the animals of the state are also called praja. The word praja that is used, citizen. In English we say citizen, praja. Praja means one who has taken birth in the state. Ja means to take birth. So this praja includes both men and animals, especially the cows and bulls. They are reared by human beings, especially for Brahmanical culture. Any living being who takes birth in the state has the primary right to live under the protection of the king. Any living being who takes birth in the state, be it an animal or a human being. The jungle animals are also subject to the king and they also have a right to live. What to speak of, as Prabhupada says, what to speak of the domestic animals like the cows and bulls, even the jungle animals, they cannot be indiscriminately killed by anyone. So, especially the cows and bulls must be protected by the king. Also, as Prabhupada further explains, any living being, if he terrifies other living beings, is a most wretched subject and the king should at once kill such a disturbing element. To maintain peace, to maintain law and order, the king should impose very strict punishment in order to protect the innocent. As the wild animal is killed when it creates disturbances, similarly, any man who unnecessarily kills or terrifies the jungle animals or other animals must be punished at once.

**Key Quote:** "By the law of the Supreme Lord, all living beings in whatever shape they may be are the sons of the Lord, and no one has any right to kill another animal unless it is so ordered by the codes of natural law."
**Summary:** The lecture discusses the concept of divine law regarding the killing of animals, explaining that while some animals may kill for subsistence, humans have the option to subsist on grains, fruits, and milk.

By the law of the Supreme Lord, all living beings in whatever shape they may be are the sons of the Lord, and no one has any right to kill another animal unless it is so ordered by the codes of natural law. What is wrong in killing an animal by a human being? Prabhupada points out that the tiger can kill a lower animal for his subsistence because that is the food for the tiger ordained by the higher laws. But a man cannot kill an animal for his subsistence. That is the law of God who has created the law that a living being subsists by eating another living being. Jeevo Jeevasya Jeevanam This is explained in the earlier chapter, 13th chapter of the first canto of Bhagavatam, that we cannot eat some matter, dead matter, we cannot eat. We have to eat something for our subsistence, something which is like a living being. Thus the vegetarians are also living by eating other living beings. Therefore the law is that one should live only by eating specific living beings as ordained by the law of God.

**Key Quote:** "The Isopanishad directs that one should live by direction of the Lord and not at one's sweet will."
**Summary:** The speaker references the Isopanishad and reinforces the idea that humans should live according to God's directions, arguing against the justification of eating meat based on personal preference and highlighting the karmic consequences for leaders who allow animal slaughter.

And that is explained in the Isopanishad as follows. The Isopanishad directs that one should live by direction of the Lord and not at one's sweet will. People say, my preference to eat meat. You may prefer to eat vegetables, but my preference to eat meat. This is the argument that is given by some people who are non-vegetarians. But Prabhupada says, a man can subsist on varieties of grains, fruits and milk ordained by God. There is no need of animal food for a human being, save and except in particular cases. Let's say there is no availability of food grains or fruits or vegetables or milk. Then under those extreme circumstances one may eat some animal flesh. Otherwise there is no reason to eat animal flesh. The illusion king or executive head, even though sometimes advertised as a great philosopher and learned scholar, will allow slaughterhouses in the state without knowing that torturing poor animals clears the way to hell to such foolish kings or executive heads.

**Key Quote:** "The executive head must always be alert to the safety of the prajas, both man and animal, and inquire whether a particular living being is harassed at any place by another living being."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of executive heads protecting all citizens, including animals, and following scriptural codes for governance, highlighting the negative consequences for those who act irresponsibly.

See, above the laws enforced by a government or a king, there are laws of God operating in this material world. So, their future is very, very dark, those who are animal killers. The executive head must always be alert to the safety of the prajas, both man and animal, and inquire whether a particular living being is harassed at any place by another living being. The harassing living being must be at once caught and put to death as shown by Maharaj Parichar. The king's duty is to give protection and punish the culprits without showing any sentimental compassion or mercy. No. So Srila Prabhupada says, the people's government or government by the people should not allow killing of innocent animals by the sweet will of foolish government men. These government people don't care if animals are killed indiscriminately. And actually, the government should not allow that. If they want proper law and order, if they want peace in the society, they must know the codes of God as mentioned in the revealed scriptures, Dharma Shastra, Manusmriti, Parashara Smriti, Agnya Varkya Smriti. They should know that. Perfect. Correct directions are given in the revealed scriptures for governance, how to rule the kingdom or the state. Maharaj Parikshit quotes here that according to the codes of God, the irresponsible king or state executive jeopardizes his good name, duration of life, power and strength and ultimately his progressive march towards a better life and salvation after death.

**Key Quote:** "This understanding that every living being is spirit-soul, not the body."
**Summary:** The lecture discusses the importance of understanding that every living being is a spirit-soul and how ignorance of this fact and the laws of karma leads to suffering, emphasizing that nature is controlled by God and punishes sinful actions.

See, this is very important. This understanding that every living being is spirit-soul, not the body. And the soul actually is meant for making progress. The actual living being inside the body, the living entity as we say, the particular person inside the body is meant for progressing towards a better life. And that is the opportunity in this material world. Such foolish men do not even believe in the existence of the next life. They don't even know there is a next life. They are so ignorant. Or if they are informed, they think, oh, we don't believe in that. Now this belief system under the situation where they are ignorant people, certain laws that are working, they do not know. Just like foolish people, they do not know their suffering is caused by their own previous sinful activities. That they do not know. Many foolish people are there, ignorant people are there. And all kinds of non-believers, as we say, atheists, agnostics, upstarts, ignorant people, they suffer, but they do not know why they are suffering, especially when they are afflicted by some disease, or they are afflicted by some pain, some natural calamity. They do not know why they were subject to some disaster, natural disaster. They do not know. But, it is not that sometimes there is some natural calamity and we have to simply face it. No. It is not like that. It is completely controlled. Nature is controlled by God. And nature, under God's direction, gives punishment to people who are sinful, and they suffer in proportion to their past sinful activities, violation of the codes of God.

**Key Quote:** "After all, even the so-called great man in this material world is a conditioned soul."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the pious governance of Maharaj Parikshit with the ignorance of modern politicians who disregard scriptural authority and act based on personal sentiments, leading to suffering and a lack of peace and prosperity.

Srila Prabhupada says, politicians, they are ignorant and one such politician has written, I do not believe in any such ceremonies and to submit to them even as a matter of form would be hypocrisy in an attempt to delude ourselves and others. I have no religious sentiment in the matter. Some politician has said that he doesn't believe in life after death. He doesn't believe in the codes of God as given in the authentic scriptures. Such people are totally ignorant unlike Maharaj Pariksit. So, Maharaj Pariksit was pious according to scriptural codes. He was having a solid basis for governance. Whereas, the modern politician goes by his personal belief and sentiments. He just conducts himself and he enforces law based on his personal sentiments, which is very, very dangerous. Because, I may differ from another person. Some other person may differ from somebody else. Is that the way to actually conduct the government? It is totally irrational. It's meaningless. So, Prabhupada says, after all, even the so-called great man in this material world is a conditioned soul. He is bound by his hands and feet by the ropes of material nature, and still he thinks that he can act whimsically. So the conclusion is, during Pariksit Maharaj's time, people were happy, animals were given proper protection, and there was peace and prosperity in the kingdom.

And it was experienced by everyone. And modern day situation is so bad. People are suffering in so many ways, so many ways, except those who are truly God conscious. All others have to suffer in so many ways. So, the conclusion is that we should be God conscious, and we should follow the God given directions, and then, individually and collectively, we can be happy, peaceful, we can live a peaceful life, and we can expect prosperity. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of Patanjali Rishi and his Yoga Sutra, explaining the Ashtanga Yoga system and its focus on meditation on an imagined form for self-realization.

In this session, we continue to discuss from the 19th verse of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is part 4 of the discussion. In the previous three parts, three sessions, we discussed Karma Mimamsa philosophy of Jaimini, and then the atheistic Sankhya philosophy of the atheist Kapila. In part 2 and part 3, we discussed the Kanada Rishi's atomic philosophy. Now we are going to discuss the 4th philosopher, Patanjali Rishi. You have heard his name. He is one who teaches the Yoga Sutra, Ashtanga Yoga system. So, Srila Prabhupada explains, philosophers following the precepts of Patanjali Rishi practice Raja Yoga, Hatha Yoga, Raja Yoga, Ashtanga Yoga. They imagine a form of the absolute truth within many forms; that is their process of self-realization. They imagine some form inside, and they simply want to concentrate completely on that form, and when they are able to absorb their mind completely in meditation on that imagined form, they think they have reached the perfection of self-realization.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Patanjali's philosophy with Vedanta, emphasizing that the ultimate goal of knowledge is to know Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the source of Vedic knowledge.

But it is explained in the Vedanta philosophy by Vyasa Deva, who is actually giving the understanding as coming in Parampara from the Supreme Lord, who is explaining the perfect understanding of the Vedas of the Upanishads. He is presenting the truth, the absolute truth, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna as the ultimate goal of all processes of knowledge. Krishna says this in the Bhagavad Gita, "From all the Vedas, it is the ultimate goal of all the Vedas is to know Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead." And Krishna only is giving the Vedic knowledge in the beginning of creation, and Krishna only is the ultimate controller of all controllers, the supreme master of all of all the living beings, the topmost well-wisher. Everything is explained clearly in the Bhagavad Gita, but still there are some different philosophers who put forward their own theories.

**Key Quote:** "patanjali rishi he is talking about a process of uh meditation so first yama niyama asana pranayama pratyahara dharana dhyana samadhi"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the eight steps of Ashtanga Yoga according to Patanjali, including Yama, Niyama, and the process of meditation, highlighting the restrictions and the need for sense control.

So let us try to understand the defect in their philosophies. Patanjali Rishi, he is talking about a process of meditation. So first, yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, samadhi. There are eight steps, and these eight steps, beginning with yama and niyama, for actually being able to come to the truth of the truth of the truth to the stage of being able to meditate on that imagined form within the heart or within the mind, the Ashtanga Yoga process or the Patanjali's Raja Yoga process says some yama niyama, don'ts and do's. Don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, and do this, do this, do this, do this. So so many restrictions are there. So Krishna also explains in the Bhagavad Gita, sixth chapter, that one has to actually control the mind, and for control of mind, one has to abstain from all types of sense gratification, external gross sense gratification, withdraw the mind from sense objects. So that is this kind of sixth chapter briefly, that is the sixth chapter briefly by Krishna. But Patanjali Rishi has written a very great detailed explanation for all this process, this process of Raja Yoga or Hatha Yoga that one goes to a secluded place. Krishna is also briefly described in 6th chapter, 11th verse, 12th verse, 13th verse, etc. So ultimately, for being able to sit down for meditation, and it takes a long time to meditate and come to the stage of Samadhi, total absorption in the object of meditation. So it's as far as

process and the steps are concerned, that's all right, but they do not know exactly what is that ultimate reality from whom everything is emanating, who is the ultimate goal of all processes of knowledge, whose ultimate reality eternally existing, that they have no idea. They imagine something as the ultimate reality, either something impersonal, Niraka or Nirvishesha, or Shunyavadi. Shunyavada is void, everything is ultimately zero. They say that this material world things are going on, but ultimately everything will be destroyed, and after destruction what remains, they say nothing. These void philosophers, they say only Shunya, nothing is there. So from that Shunya again there will be creation.

**Summary:** The speaker refutes the idea that the world is an illusion, explaining that it is the interaction of the Lord's energy, guided by His will.

And this creation itself, from Shunya, how can there be something coming out? Because shunya is nothing. So they say that is just imaginary, something is existing, is created. So they say this world is unreal, it's illusion, grand illusion, it doesn't exist. We just imagine that it exists, it really exists. It is something that is coming to exist. They say that there is nothing called behaving and that Shunya which comes. Only it is not then it is Form Life Which is created just consequently it is in this 50 Yong that it exists, we imagine it exists, and actually the changes that are taking place are simply the interactions of the illusory energy, which is a partial truth about what is actually happening, the interaction of the modes. But what they fail to understand is that behind this presentation of the material energy or the illusory energy is the Supreme Lord, and it is his energy which is working according to his direction, maya gyakushena prakriti hi suyatesa chara.

Charam. Then in the 14th chapter, Krishna describes Satwam rajasthama iti guna prakriti sambhava nibadhyanti mahabhaho dehe dehinam abhyayam. Material nature consists of eight elements: Bhumirapo nalowayu khammano budhirevaca ahankara itiyamme bhinna prakritir ashtadav me bhinna prakriti, they are my separated energy. This is the material energy, and that material energy is first of all manifest as the eight elements. Now, apart from these eight elements, when material nature is activated, there is the energy is manifest, material energy is manifest also as the three gunas, the three modes of material nature. Continuously those modes are working, interacting, and producing changes in the configuration of these eight elements.

**Key Quote:** "But Patanjali doesn't describe clearly this object of meditation as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna, as Vishnu, who is the eternal, transcendental person, that he does not describe."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Patanjali's system with the Vedic understanding of meditating on Vishnu as Paramatma within the heart, emphasizing that Patanjali's system lacks a clear understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

This is the perfect explanation given in the Bhagavad Gita and the Vedanta philosophy. Perfect explanation. But these people study some portion, take some observation, and come to some conclusion of their own according to their own theoretical philosophy that they present. So, Patanjali's, this Raja Yoga system, imaginary form for meditating within the heart. This is, they don't know that actually the Bhagavatam and the authentic Vedic literature describe meditation on Vishnu who is seated on the heart as Paramatma, who is actually an expansion of Kshirodakshayi Vishnu, the maintainer Vishnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Eternal Lord who has a transcendental form. And Lord Kapila, the Incarnate One, the incarnation of the Supreme Lord, describes in the third canto of the Bhagavatam in the Sankhya philosophy meditation on Vishnu within the heart who is Paramatma, Paramatma. He is seated in everyone's heart. Sarvas cha chaham hrithi sannivishto matta smritir jnanam apom nam cha. Bhagavad Gita also it is explained by Krishna. Krishna only, Krishna only means Krishna's expansion of expansion of expansion. He is seated in everyone's heart. But Patanjali doesn't describe clearly this object of meditation as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna, as Vishnu, who is the eternal, transcendental person, that he does not describe.

**Summary:** The speaker connects Patanjali's concept of an imaginary form with the Mayavadi philosophy, which considers the material world to be an illusion, and clarifies that reality lies behind the constant changes.

Imaginary form, something imaginary. So, this imaginary form is also taught by the Mayavadi philosophers. Mayavadi philosophers, they also talk of imaginary form. So, this imaginary form is based on the wrong understanding that this material world itself is illusion, is false. The material world has got an illusory aspect that everything is a presentation of the interactions of the three gunas as reality, but it is not reality. Because it is constantly changing, it is not reality. Reality is what remains or what is behind the change. That is the material energy itself which is working as per the direction of the Supreme Lord Krishna according to his will. So, that is reality. That reality is missed out by all these Mayavadis and the philosophers who follow Patanjali's yoga sutra etc.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the difficulty of attaining truth without the guidance of a self-realized spiritual master in parampara, highlighting the limitations of speculation and logic.

They miss out this reality. So, it is not easy to arrive at the truth. While we are in the grip of illusion, while we have this material body, while we are in ignorance, unless we take help of a self-realized bona fide spiritual master coming in parampara who is himself situated in transcendence and who can properly explain everything and enlighten us beyond matter, know our self as spiritual reality, as spirit soul, and Supreme Lord as a Supreme Spirit and the totality, some total understanding of everything in existence, at least the material existence itself as a part of the manifestation of the Lord's energies. So, all this requires superior guidance. Without that guidance, nobody can speculate or analyze or reason, logic, argument will not work. They have got their limitations. I will stop here.

Punishment we can understand because Kali Purusha was the root cause of all kinds of irreligiosities. But why would Kali Purusha be rewarded by Parikshit Maharaj?

**Key Quote:** "Earlier it was described Dharma which in Satya Yuga was standing on four legs, four pillars austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness."
**Summary:** The lecture details the decline of Dharma through the Yugas, from four legs in Satya Yuga to one in Kali Yuga, emphasizing that true Dharma comes from God and the Parampara system.

Earlier it was described Dharma, which in Satya Yuga was standing on four legs, four pillars: austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness. So in Satya Yuga, four pillars of religion perfectly intact, and then by the time Satya Yuga progressed and came to Treta Yuga, one leg was destroyed, tapasya, austerity. Then from Treta Yuga to Dwapar Yuga the second leg was destroyed, that is cleanliness. Then from Treta Yuga to Dwapar Yuga the second leg was destroyed, that is cleanliness. Then from Treta Yuga to Dwapar Yuga the second leg was destroyed, that is cleanliness. Then from Treta Yuga to Dwapar Yuga the second leg was destroyed, that is cleanliness. Then from Treta Yuga to Dwapar Yuga the second leg was destroyed, that is cleanliness. Then from Treta Yuga to Dwapar Yuga the second leg was destroyed, that is cleanliness. Then from Treta Yuga to Dwapar Yuga the second leg was destroyed, that is cleanliness. Then from Treta Yuga to Dwapar Yuga the second leg was destroyed, that is cleanliness. Then from Treta Yuga to Dwapar Yuga the second leg was destroyed, that is cleanliness. Then from Treta Yuga to Dwapar Yuga the second leg was destroyed, that is cleanliness. Now, beginning of Kali Yuga, only that fourth leg, only one leg, the fourth leg, that is truthfulness, is remaining, and somehow still some Dharma is there at the beginning Kali Yuga, but this Kali Purusha, quarrel personified, flourishing by deceit, by unwritten, by lying propensity, lying propaganda, is trying to destroy that leg, that leg of truthfulness of Dharma. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, the principles of religion do not stand on some dogmas or man-made formulas, but they stand on four primary regulative observances, namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness. Earlier we had discussed religion, Dharma means the codes given by God, nobody can manufacture Dharma, real Dharma, it is what is given by God in the beginning of creation and coming down in human society as a result of that, it is not possible to do that, it is impossible to get that.

through maturity, through the param para system, bona fide Param para system. So there are no man-made religion switchers, real religions, man my religion means that is a cheating religion or somebody is very strong belief in some system of not real religion. So real religion means there are four primary regulative observances, what are they? Austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness. The mass of people, Srila Prabhupada says, must be taught to practice these principles from childhood. Austerity means what are the meaning of these four principles in reality? Austerity means to accept voluntarily things which may be not very comfortable for the body but are conducive for spiritual realization.

Fasting twice or four times a day is not good for the body, it is not good for the body, it is not good for the mind, but at least a month is a sort of austerity which may be voluntarily accepted for spiritual realization only and not for any other purposes, political or otherwise. We know one great freedom fighter in this country used to go on fast to put pressure on the government to yield to some of their demands, that is not good for the body. The real austerity that one should take up fasting is done austerity means only for the sake of spiritual realization. Fasting which are meant for not for self-realization but for some other purposes are condemned in the Bhagavad-Gita in the 17th chapter, fifth and sixth verses. Fasting in the mode of passion, fasting in the mode of ignorance, that is condemned in the Bhagavad-Gita, it is not going to result in any spiritual benefit and materially even if it is in some way beneficial ultimately is the cause of material entanglement. Already we are entangled so we should not do something by which you get more entangled.

**Key Quote:** "Similarly cleanliness is necessary both for the mind and the body simply bodily cleanliness may help to some extent people know about bodily cleanliness external cleanliness but more important is cleansing the mind"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of both bodily and mental cleanliness, stating that mental cleanliness is achieved through glorifying the Supreme Lord.

that is not very wise, that's not very intelligent. Similarly, cleanliness is necessary both for the mind and the body. Simply bodily cleanliness may help to some extent, people know about bodily cleanliness, external cleanliness, but more important is cleansing the mind. Bodily cleanses is good but it's not enough, it's not sufficient. Cleanliness of the mind is absolutely essential for a human being and how is it possible to clean the mind? It is affected by glorifying the Supreme Lord, by glorifying the Supreme Lord. No one can cleanse the accumulated mental without glorifying the Supreme Lord. Chanting Hare Krishna primarily cleanses our mind primary. A godless civilization cannot cleanse the mind because it is no idea of God. Modern civilization is a godless civilization. People say, oh we are very nice people, we like to follow some principles without any reference to God or scriptures. They say why do you bring in God, just be good to everyone, don't harm anyone, don't hurt anybody, be nice to everyone, this is not going to work.

**Summary:** The lecture criticizes a godless civilization and uses the example of cow slaughter to illustrate the lack of mercy and the consequences of ignoring God's laws.

for some people cutting the throat of a cow it doesn't matter as long as you're nice to all other fellow human beings because they believe cows don't have soul. Now just because some ignorant person is believing cows don't have soul because of that it doesn't matter if you are nice to all other fellow human beings that somebody can kill that poor animal and it suffered so much like the human being suffer. If I cut your throat how will you feel? Same way the cow also feels and the cow is the most useful animal in the human society, the most useful animal. Even the cow dung and cow urine are useful for human beings and such an animal they go and kill just because it stops giving milk or just because they like to eat cow flesh. So this is very very very very simple and it is punishable very severely by the laws of God, now nobody can escape that.

**Key Quote:** "Everyone is anxious for peace of mind but how can they get this peace of mind without cleansing the mind"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the lack of peace of mind in Kali Yuga due to the decline of austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness, contrasting it with the peace of Sathya Yuga.

So Srila Prabhupada is telling here, a godless civilization cannot have no life cleansing of the mind because they no idea of God and people whose mind is not clean cannot have any good qualifications however much materially they may be equipped. In this age of Kali people are mostly dissatisfied. So everyone is anxious for peace of mind but how can they get this peace of mind without cleansing the mind? So Srila Prabhupada says this peace of mind was complete in the Sathya Yuga, Sathya age because of the existence of the above mentioned attributes of the human beings. Everyone was austere, everyone was clean internally and externally, everyone was having mercy and everyone was truthful. So in Sathya Yuga total peace of mind complete. Gradually these attributes have diminished in Trita Yuga to three-fourths, in Dwapar Yuga to half and in Kali Yuga to one-fourth which is also gradually diminishing on.

**Summary:** The lecture uses the analogy of airline tickets and online fraud to illustrate the increasing untruthfulness in Kali Yuga and its impact on Dharma.

there in the beginning of Kali Yuga just like in Kali Yuga I'll give a simple example just before the advent of this truth and the look at the technique which I have shown you already in the Meenakshi some truthfulness left you take that piece of paper and go to the airline company in the airport and then they say yes please welcome you are most welcome to board the flight and they treat you very nicely. But now with this untruthfulness increasing what is happening? They have so many fraud people issuing tickets and unless you go through a proper website there are so many fake websites and they have what is called as phishing software where they will siphon off your money from your bank account or they will issue your a form false ticket when you pay money and that ticket the airline won't have issued at all and when you go with that false ticket they will say there is no such booking in our website no such booking see. So untruthfulness, untruthfulness, so much of untruthfulness. So because of that that last leg truthfulness of Dharma is diminishing.

**Key Quote:** "By too much lying propaganda truthfulness is spoilt"
**Summary:** The speaker explains how pride spoils austerity, affection spoils cleanliness, intoxication spoils mercy, and lying propaganda spoils truthfulness.

Then Srila Prabhupada explains as was told in a previous purport in a previous verse by pride either artificial or real the resultant action of austerity is spoiled. Tapasya is not meant for showing off to others that I am a very austere person I am very very devoted to fasting it's not meant for showing off to others they becoming proud it is meant for spiritual advancement. By too much affection for female association cleanliness is point the mind becomes unclean by too much of sex indulgence by too much of sense enjoyment the mind becomes polluted there'll never be peace always anxiety. Then too much addiction to intoxication mercy spoilt people become indifferent to other suffering and they become intoxicated either they get intoxicated by liquor or they get intoxicated by drinking too much of tea or drinking or smoking cigarette different or taking some drugs they become totally heartless that mercy is lost in human society and by too much lying propaganda truthfulness is point.

**Summary:** The lecture concludes by emphasizing the prevalence of lying propaganda and the importance of reviving Bhagavata Dharma to save civilization by following the four principles for spiritual realization.

there is so much of lying propaganda now being being promoted there's like sometimes even I don't say all some rare case of course parents teach their children tell lies example when there's traveling with the child in a railway train they don't buy a ticket for the child even though they're supposed to buy a ticket and they teach the child to tell lies when questioned about which standard are you studying in the ticket checking authority ask the child which standard are you studying it may be studying in and let's say eight standard but will be told you tell you're studying in fourth standard. So like this lying propaganda is increasing now it's increasing in different places different purposes and truthfulness is point. So the revival of bhagavata dharma can save civilization from falling prey to evils of all description. Bhagavata dharma means to follow these principles for principles for spiritual realization. I'll stop here.

**Key Quote:** "When Krishna was present as an incarnation all good was performed because of his auspicious footprints."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verses to be discussed and explains the meaning of verse 26, focusing on how Krishna's presence diminished the burden of the earth and brought auspiciousness.

In this session we will be discussing from verses 26, 27 and 28 of the 17th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 26th verse: The meaning of this 26th verse is, "The burden of the earth was certainly diminished by the personality of Godhead and by others as well. When he was present, as an incarnation, all good was performed because of his auspicious footprints." These are words spoken by Parikshit Maharaj in response to Dharma's reply. Parikshit asked Dharma, "Who or what is the cause of your suffering?" And Dharma did not give a direct reply. He gave a very philosophical reply. So then Parikshit immediately replied, and he recognized this bull is no ordinary bull. It is the personality of religious principles. And he also understood the cow was mother earth in the shape of a cow. So now he's talking about how the burden of the earth, which was due to so many demoniac persons posing as kings at the time of Krishna's advent, just before Krishna's advent, that was definitely reduced by Krishna appearing and killing so many demons. When Krishna was present as an incarnation all good was performed because of his auspicious footprints, merely Krishna setting foot on the surface of the earth, by that there was all auspiciousness for everyone in the entire world.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Unfortunately in the age of Kali the lower class men without training occupied a post of a ruler by strength of popular votes is called the democratic system."
**Summary:** The speaker explains verse 27, describing how Mother Earth laments the future rule by unqualified leaders in Kali Yuga, drawing a parallel to contemporary democratic systems and their shortcomings.

Then in the 27th verse it is said here, the meaning of this 27th verse is, "Now she, that is mother earth, the chaste one, being unfortunately forsaken by the personality of Godhead, laments her future with tears in her eyes, for now she is being ruled and enjoyed by lower class men who pose as rulers." Krishna came and the demons posing as rulers were completely destroyed and Krishna installed the most righteous Yudhishtira Maharaj as the emperor of the world. The Pandavas were ruling, but Kali Purusha is entering, Kali Yuga is beginning, and in Kali Yuga the earth will be ruled by lower class men who pose as Kshatriyas but don't have Kshatriya qualities, and because the people and the animals, innocent people and innocent animals, will be exploited by these rulers, mother earth is having tears in her eyes, she's lamenting. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "The Kshatriya who is qualified to protect the sufferers is meant to rule the state. Untrained lower-class men or men without ambition to protect the sufferers cannot be placed on the seat of an administrator. Unqualified person should not be sitting on the seat of the administrator." Unfortunately in the age of Kali, the lower class men without training occupied a post of a ruler by strength of popular votes is called the democratic system. Votes, who gets a maximum votes, majority works properly as it said in Latin, by majority vote a person comes to power and instead of protecting the sufferers these untrained people, unqualified people create a situation quite intolerable for everyone. Such rulers illegally gratify themselves at the cost of all comforts with citizens. They collect taxes, don't use it for the citizens welfare, entirely they become themselves very rich, they misuse the tax collected in this way and they throw some crumbs for the people in the name of welfare activity, they don't do real welfare for the people and thus the chaste mother earth cries to see the pitiable condition of her sons, both men and animals, innocent men and women are not allowed to live in the country, unqualified untrained lower-class men are ruling in the name of countries and

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that irreligiosity does not mean abandoning religious principles, and that following religious principles leads to good qualities.

different countries, they divided the whole earth and then almost all the rulers are untruthful, they are unqualified, they don't have mercy on, they don't have any credit of austerity, they're not truthful. So such people if they are at the helm of affairs you can only imagine so much of problem, difficulty for the people and the innocent animals. That is the future of the world in the age of Kali when irreligiosity prevails most prominently. Now here irreligiosity should not be taken as a threat. I am saying that this does not mean that they should accept. Don't realize their right step is the right step. It is done not summary, one step by one step by step every benefit system of religion as ever means is the our life and that's selfish ours of someone doing something wrong. We have our food, we have money, we given that anybody who follows it properly they will become decorated with all good qualities automatically.

**Key Quote:** "Prabhupada says why are you not following the commandment of Bible you claim to be a Christian but you don't follow the commandment."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the hypocrisy of not following religious commandments, particularly regarding animal killing, citing examples from Christianity and Buddhism.

Simply following the, just like in Christianity Prabhupada points out, "Thou shall not kill" is the first commandment, if I am not wrong, at least one of the ten commandments. I know I think it is the first commandment that now they are interpreting, "Thou shall not murder," meaning that applies only to not killing humans, so animals they have, they think they have a license to kill even when they claim to be so called Christians. So Prabhupada says, "Why are you not following the commandment of Bible? You claim to be a Christian but you don't follow the commandment." This is true even in other religious systems also, it's not just in Christianity, even in Hinduism so much animal killing is going on in the name of sacrifice. So Lord Buddha came, Lord Buddha is incarnation of Vishnu to stop this animal killing in the name of sacrifice, but today Buddhists themselves they are not anymore following the Ahimsa principle taught by Buddha. They claim to be Buddhists but they eat meat, they are meat eaters. Formerly when Buddha invented and taught Ahimsa all those following Buddhism were pure vegetarians.

**Summary:** The speaker notes the decline in vegetarianism among various religious groups and suggests that teaching Srimad Bhagavatam is the solution to corruption and other problems.

Even now the a portion, a small section of the Buddhists they are pure vegetarians, even Christians you find, even Muslims you find pure vegetarians, those who strictly follow their religious tradition, the teachings of the saints or the Lord, but majority of the so called Christians or Muslims or Buddhists or Hindus even now they are not non-vegetarians, so this means they don't follow the commandments. So in the absence of a suitable king Prabhupada says, "Teaching the Srimad Bhagavatam will clear the hazy atmosphere of corruption, bribery, blackmail etc." The only solution is people have to be educated in Bhagavata Dharma.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains verse 28, emphasizing that while the age of Kali is full of sinful activities, leaders and devotees should not be passive in the face of it.

28th verse: iti dharmam maheem chaiva santvayitva maharatha nishatam adade khadgam kalaye adharma hetave. The meaning of this verse is, "Maharaj Pariksit who could fight one thousand enemies single handedly, maharatha, thus pacified the personality of religion and the earth, then he took up his sharp sword to kill the personality of Kali who is the cause of all irreligion." So Srila Prabhupada explains, "As described above the personality of Kali is he who deliberately commits all kinds of sinful acts which are forbidden in the revealed scriptures. There is no license to kill animals, there is no license to kill animals innocent animals no way, but they are doing that in the name deliberately committing sinful activities even though it is forbidden in the scriptures. This age of Kali will certainly be full of all activities of Kali but this does not mean that the leaders of society the executive heads the learned and intelligent men or above all the devotees of the Lord should sit down tightly and become callous to the reactions of the age of Kali."

**Key Quote:** "The administrators should not simply pass resolutions for anti-corruption steps but they must be ready with sharp swords to kill the persons creating corruption."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of taking precautions against rain to illustrate the need for executive action against the activities of Kali, advocating for strict measures against corruption and intoxication, concluding with a thank you.

Sometimes people say what can we do? We are following, we don't kill animals, we don't harm people, but we cannot do anything about others indulging in animal killing or others harming innocent people, we cannot do anything. So it's not that I cannot control somebody else therefore I don't do anything, that's not correct. So Prabhupada gives a nice example here, "In the rainy season certainly there will be profuse rainfalls but that does not mean that men should not take means to protect themselves from the rains." Very nice example, you cannot stop the rain but you can take precaution for protecting yourself against the rain. Similarly it is the duty of the executive heads of state and others to take all necessary actions against the activities of Kali or the persons influenced by the age of Kali and Maharaj Parikshit is the ideal executive head of state for at once he was ready to kill the personality of Kali with his sharp sword because Kali was harming an innocent cow and an innocent bull so he was ready to kill Kali Purusha. The administrators should not simply pass resolutions for anti-corruption steps but they must be ready with sharp swords to kill the persons creating corruption from the angle of vision of the recognized shastras. See this is the practical action to be taken. The administrators cannot prevent corrupt activities by allowing wine shops. I have an example Prabhupada is giving, they must at once close all shops of intoxicating drugs and wine and force punishment even by death for those who indulge in habits of intoxication of all description as long as people are indulging in intoxication they cannot have any good behavior, good principles, they cannot be truthful, it is not possible. So government has to stop, totally stop. So Maharaj Parikshit the Maharatha is exhibiting the proper method of curbing down Kali Purusha. So I will just say I will stop here thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of SB 1.17.29, focusing on Kali Purusha's surrender to Parikshit Maharaj out of fear.

In this session, we will be discussing two verses, the 29th and the 30th verses of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Shreemad Bhagavatam. The 29th verse: Tam Jighamsum Abhipretya Vihaya Drupalanchanam Tadpada Moolam Shirasa Samagatbhaya Vikvalaha. The meaning of this verse is, when the personality of Kali understood that the king was willing to kill him, he at once abandoned the dress and, under pressure of fear, completely surrendered to him, bowing his head. So, what is Kali Purusha's reaction to Parikshit Maharaj being ready to kill Kali Purusha because Kali Purusha was harming an innocent cow and a bull? So, Kali Purusha understood that he cannot face the king, the emperor Parikshit, and he at once gave up the dress of a king. He is actually not a king, he is dressed as a king for external show, and he completely surrendered to Parikshit Maharaj. That was the only way he could have saved his life, otherwise Parikshit would have killed him.

**Key Quote:** "A Kshatriya never surrenders. He accepts the challenge of a rival Kshatriya and he fights either to die or to win."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the qualities of a true Kshatriya, emphasizing courage, sacrifice, and the willingness to fight rather than surrender, contrasting this with the behavior of imposters.

So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, the personality of Kali is artificial. The royal dress is suitable for a king or a Kshatriya, but when a lower-class man artificially dresses himself as a king, his real identity is disclosed by the challenge of a bona fide Kshatriya like Maharaj Pariksit. So, they don't have the courage, they don't have the mentality to sacrifice their life for a higher cause. That is the meaning of a lower-class person. You see, no qualification, no training, no proper understanding of what is the duty of a ruler, simply wants to enjoy power, enjoy some money, enjoy some facilities, exploit people, you know, send people because they are a little weak, they cannot find their home, they can't retaliate, so exploit them. This is not a Kshatriya. So, when a real Kshatriya encounters such an imposter ruler, immediately the real Kshatriya will kill him if he does not give up his false position. A real Kshatriya never surrenders. This is the term, this is the real quality of a Kshatriya. A Kshatriya never surrenders. He accepts the challenge of a rival Kshatriya, and he fights either to die or to win. All such battles between Kshatriyas, real Kshatriyas, is decisive, just like in the battle of Kurukshetra. Duryodhana challenged the Pandavas, if you want your kingdom, you fight and take it. So, when the battle happened, then Pandavas completely destroyed all the Kauravas. 100 sons of Dhritarashtra were all killed, because that is the way of a Kshatriya.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the lack of true Kshatriyas in Kali Yuga and how this contributed to foreign rule in India, highlighting the importance of Kshatriya spirit and unity.

That is the Kshatriya spirit, because Duryodhana was challenging him. Surrender is unknown to a real Kshatriya. In the age of Kali, there are so many pretenders dressed in posts like administrators or executive heads, but the real identity is disclosed when they are challenged by a real Kshatriya. See, in the Kali Yuga, the difficulty is there are no real Kshatriyas. Even in our own country, India, as long as there were Rajputs, Marathas, the real Kshatriyas, different names in different parts of the country, in Rajasthan they were called Rajputs, in Maharashtra they were called Marathas. But when the real Kshatriya spirit was there, they could face the powerful Mughal army, powerful British rulers, they could fight the Kshatriyas. They could fight the Kshatriyas. They could fight the Kshatriyas. They could fight the ׵ they could face and defeat them. But when the number of such real Kshatriyas reduced against the might of the British army, English army, or even the Mughal army, against their might. Then, lack of unity, means a lack of unity. Even in pumping the muisicle, the Gilda's, the Gote, Thulük малень acidic agar rate came. And the reason it was so, was the lack real Kshatriyas that was the cause of the foreign rule in this country otherwise

**Summary:** The speaker explains why Parikshit Maharaj spared Kali Purusha, emphasizing Parikshit's compassion and adherence to Kshatriya dharma, referencing SB 1.17.30.

the Kshatriyas would rule perfectly. Therefore, when the artificially dressed personality of Kali saw that to fight Maharaj Pariksit was beyond his ability, he bowed down his head like a subordinate and gave up his royal dress. Kali Purusha, because he wanted to save his life, he simply surrendered, and this surrender is the reason why Pariksit Maharaj pardoned this Kali Purusha and even rewarded him because he submitted to Pariksit Maharaj. You will hear that the 30th verse, the meaning of this 30th verse is, Maharaj Pariksit was qualified to accept surrender and worthy of being sung in history, did not kill the poor surrendered and fallen Kali, but smiled compassionately, for he was kind to the poor hearted Kali Purusha. Maharaj Pariksit showed compassion.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Bhishma's surrender to Krishna in the Mahabharata to illustrate the Kshatriya code of conduct of not killing a surrendered person.

because he is having that quality as a trained Kshatriya. As a trained Kshatriya, he's got that quality of compassion for the poor. In the purport, Shrila Prabhupada explains, even an ordinary Kshatriya does not kill a surrendered person. This is Kshatriya code of conduct and Kshatriya's behavior, nature. Even anybody surrenders, that's the just like Bhishma Deva in the example in Mahabharata, when Bhishma was attacking Arjuna and Arjuna's life was in danger, Krishna was Arjuna's father's chariot driver. Krishna wanted to protect Arjuna at all costs. So, when he saw Arjuna's life is in danger, Krishna broke his promise in order to protect Arjuna. What did Krishna do? Krishna himself took a wheel of a chariot and went to attack Bhishma. If Krishna goes to attack Bhishma, what is hope for Bhishma to survive? But Bhishma, being a devotee of Krishna, he simply surrendered to Krishna, my dear lord, what better way for me to quit this body than by dying at your hands? So, Bhishma was a devotee, so he knew being killed by Krishna is no ordinary killing, it is actually a transcendental act of the lord. One immediately becomes liberated and purified. So, Bhishma knew this, so he surrendered. The moment Bhishma surrendered, Krishna did not attack Bhishma.

Maharaj Pariksit certainly would pardon and show compassion to a surrendered soul, even if that surrendered soul was somebody who was a miscreant. So, Pariksit Maharaj is smiling. Why was he smiling? Because the artificially dressed Kali had disclosed his identity as a lower class man. You see, when he gave up the dress, and Kali Purusha gave up the dress, he revealed to Maharaj Pariksit, yes, I am not a qualified Kshatriya, I am dressed like a Kshatriya, but I don't have the qualification. I don't have the courage to face another rival Kshatriya. I don't have the courage. I simply want to pose to exploit innocent people, to harm innocent people. But actually, I don't have the qualification, I don't have the courage. So, he admitted in front of Pariksit Maharaj. And Pariksit was thinking how ironic it is that although no one was saved from his sharp sword when he desired to kill, the poor lower class Kali was spared by his timely surrender. Kali Purusha surrendered just before Pariksit Maharaj was about to kill him. So, Kali Purusha was spared because that's a code of conduct for a Kshatriya. And it's ironical because Kali is meant for spreading irreligion. Kali is meant for spreading irreligion. Therefore, this entire Bhagavatam is important that Kali was spared by Maharaj.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the influence of Kali Yuga in spreading irreligion and emphasizes that Kali's salvation was due to the will of providence, the higher arrangement of the Supreme Lord.

And therefore, we are facing the influence of Kali Yuga is to spread irreligion, is to make people irreligious by its influence. Maharaj Pariksit's glory and kindness are therefore sung in history. He was an ideal Kshatriya, and he is always glorified as the kind and principled Kshatriya who ruled the world. He was a kind and compassionate emperor, fully worthy of accepting surrender even from his enemy. What to speak of others, even from the enemy, Parikshit Maharaj as an ideal Kshatriya will accept surrender, because he is fully qualified to accept his surrender. He will never exploit if somebody surrenders. Thus, the personality of Kali was saved by the will of providence. This is a term that is used many times in the scriptures, will of providence. Will of providence means it's the higher arrangement of the Supreme Lord who in the background is always there, always active in the material world, acting through the material nature, not directly, but ultimately the will of the Supreme Lord prevails.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the mentality of people in Kali Yuga who prioritize material happiness over religious principles, even denying the existence of hell, and how Krishna gives them a chance through material nature.

Because in the age of Kali, there are people who want to enjoy material happiness through unfair means, through following, breaking religious principles. At any cost they want to enjoy, even at the cost of breaking religious principles. And people openly say, I don't care for hell. You'll be punished. You'll have to go to hell if you commit grievous sinful activities. They say we don't care, or we don't believe there is something called hell. Just because somebody doesn't believe it, does it mean that they are not going to suffer? So, this is the situation in Kali Yuga. So, Krishna gives them a chance. In the material world, through the material nature, Krishna gives such people a chance.

**Key Quote:** "But you cannot remain in my kingdom, for you are the friend of irreligion."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of Srimad Bhagavatam 1.17.31, where King Parikshit pardons Kali Purusha upon surrender but prohibits him from residing in his kingdom due to his association with irreligion.

In this session, we will be discussing from two verses, 31st and 32nd verses of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavata. The 31st verse is as follows: Rajavacha, after the Kali Purusha surrendered to Parikshit Maharaj, when he is about to be killed, he surrendered. And what did Parikshit say? He definitely pardoned Kali Purusha, did not kill him. But what did he say? Na te gudakesha yaso dharanam baddhanjalervai bhayam astikinchit na vartitavyam bhavata katanchana kshetremadiyetvam adarmabandhuhu. This is Parikshit's reply to Kali Purusha, the action of Kali Purusha. The translation of this 31st verse: The king thus said, it's King Parikshit. We have inherited the fame of Arjuna. Therefore, since you have surrendered yourself with folded hands, you need not fear for your life. But you cannot remain in my kingdom, for you are the friend of irreligion. Adarmabandhu.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's explanation that while a surrendered soul may be spared, those who violate fundamental religious principles should not be allowed to reside in a welfare state and negatively influence others.

Hmm. So, Shri La Prabhupada explains, "The personality of Kali, who is the friend of all kinds of irreligiosities, may be excused if he surrenders. But in all circumstances, he cannot be allowed to live as a citizen in any part of a welfare state. Those who are violators of the fundamental principles of religion..." Fundamental principles of religion are not based on whether somebody is Hindu or Christian or Muslim. No. It is independent of that. To practice austerity, cleanliness, truthfulness, and mercy is there in all religious systems, bona fide religious systems. Hmm. So, they have to follow that. If they become irreligious by breaking these principles, then they will not be allowed to live as a proper citizen in the kingdom or in the welfare state, being ruled by a proper administrator. Hmm. So, the principle of excusing or rather sparing the life of a surrendered soul is there. Hmm. But he cannot be allowed to live and influence the innocent people in a wrong way.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna arranged for all these remaining demons to be killed to bring down the burden of the earth."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna orchestrated the battle of Kurukshetra to eliminate remaining demons and alleviate the burden on the earth, using the Pandavas as instruments.

The Pandavas were entrusted representatives of the personality of God and Lord Krishna, who practically brought into being the battle of Kurukshetra. It is Krishna who arranged the battle of Kurukshetra, because before the battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna was engaged in killing so many demons. But in spite of killing, Krishna killing so many demons, Krishna began killing right on the lap of his mother as a small ten day old infant. Poorthana came to kill Krishna, but Krishna delivered her. And after that so many demons came: Pakasura, Denukasura, Aghasura, Trinavarta, so many demons came, Shakatasura, so many demons. Krishna killed, killed, killed. Of course Krishna's killing is delivering them, liberating them, purifying them, but still Krishna had to deal with these demons. And Krishna went on killing, killing, killing. But the number of demons were so many, those who escaped, Krishna brought them all together on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. And through this battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna arranged for all these remaining demons to be killed, to bring down the burden of the earth. So he arranged. And Pandavas, even though Yudhishthira said, "I am not interested in ruling a kingdom and enjoying royal power." No. Even though it was his rightful claim, but he said, "If Duryodhana wants to rule, let him rule. I don't want to unnecessarily fight and I be the cause of so much killing happening in the battle." But Krishna wanted this battle. Why? To clear away the earth of the burden of these demons. So through the battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna arranged the remaining demons to be killed.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna wanted an ideal king like Maharaj Yudhishthira and his descendants like Maharaj Pariksit to rule the world."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Krishna's desire for ideal rulers who follow the principles of Bhagavad Gita and protect citizens from material bondage by promoting God consciousness.

So Krishna did not have any personal interest, not that he wanted to rule or he wanted to enjoy, nothing. So Krishna, what did Krishna want? Through the battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna wanted an ideal king like Maharaj Yudhishthira and his descendants like Maharaj Pariksit to rule the world. Krishna wanted that. Krishna always wants that. It is explained in the Bhagavad Gita by Srila Prabhupada. Krishna first instructed the Bhagavad Gita to this sun god Vivaswan. Why? Because Krishna wants the rulers to rule over the citizens according to the principles of Bhagavad Gita. So the first duty of a ruler is to protect the citizens against material bondage to lust by preaching Krishna consciousness, God consciousness, making them God conscious, and thereby human life becomes successful for everyone. Everyone can live peacefully by following the religious principles, God conscious principles, and everyone is able to make spiritual progress to ultimately attain the perfection of human life simply by following the principles of Bhagavad Gita.

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The friends of irreligiosity should be banished from the state, and that will save the state from corruption."
**Summary:** The speaker connects allowing irreligiosity to flourish with corruption in the state, using the analogy of smoking to illustrate how bad influences can victimize innocent people, emphasizing Krishna consciousness as the solution.

Because Pariksit, Yudhishthira, all of them are representatives of Krishna, they cannot allow the friend of irreligiosity to flourish in their kingdom at the cost of the good fame of the Pandavas. Pandavas are well known as ideal rulers, perfect followers of Dharma, pure devotees of Krishna, and they ruled perfectly. So their good fame cannot be spoiled by Pariksit allowing this Kali Purusha who surrendered to live in his kingdom and spread irreligion. So Prabhupada says that is the way of wiping out corruption in the state. The friends of irreligiosity should be banished from the state, and that will save the state from corruption, the bad influence. There are so many innocent people in this world. It's like Prabhupada says, "By birth, does somebody have a cigarette in his mouth by birth? Where did he get this habit of smoking?" By bad influence of other people who are smoking. It's only by bad influence. Similarly, the wrong influence actually victimizes innocent people to fall prey to bad habits, and once they become habituated to some, it is very difficult for them to give up later on, even if they want to, except by Krishna Consciousness, they cannot give up.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces and translates Srimad Bhagavatam 1.17.32, explaining that allowing Kali (irreligion) to thrive leads to the spread of negative qualities like greed and falsehood.

32nd verse: Tvam Vartamanam Naradeva Deheshu Anupravrttoyam Adharma Pugaha Lobho Anrutam Chauriyam Anaryam Jestha Chamaya Kalahascha Dambhaha. The meaning of this 32nd verse is, if the personality of Kali, irreligion, is allowed to act as a man god or an executive head, certainly irreligious principles like greed, falsehood, robbery, incivility, deceit... Okay, Kali Purusha surrendered, so his life was spared, but he cannot be allowed to live. Why? If he lives, all these bad qualities will spread among the people in the kingdom of Pariksit: greed, falsehood, robbery, treachery, misfortune, that I am great without actually having the real qualities.

**Key Quote:** "These four principles are the fundamental principles of God consciousness, no matter which religious system somebody may follow."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness are fundamental to all genuine religious systems and are essential for God consciousness.

Srila Prabhupada says, "The principles of religion, namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness, as we have already discussed, may be followed by the follower of any faith. As regard religious principles, nobody can say Hindus. No. There is no such thing as Bhagavatam is meant for Hindus. These four principles are the fundamental principles of God consciousness, no matter which religious system somebody may follow, which bona fide religious system they may follow. The same principles are given in all scriptures. So Prabhupada says, there is no need to turn from Hindu to Mohammedan to Christian or some other faith and thus become a renegade and not follow the principles of religion." Renegade means a separatist or a rebel. No need. So it is not that people in the name of, "I don't believe or don't accept some particular religious system." No. You cannot live in a civilized society and spread irreligion among the innocent people and thereby corrupt the atmosphere, pure atmosphere of the state. The Bhagavatam religion urges following the principles of religion. Bhagavata Dharma is the dominant of people's belief system.

**Key Quote:** "God is one, though different names he may be referred to in different bonafide religious systems, but God is one."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Srila Prabhupada's preaching of Bhagavata Dharma, emphasizing the importance of chanting the names of God and highlighting the unity of God across different religions.

Like Srila Prabhupada traveled all over the world and preached the Bhagavata Dharma of simply chanting the names of God. Srila Prabhupada said, "If you have objection to chanting name of Krishna, you may chant the name of God as revealed in your bona fide religious system, but chanting the name of God is the principle of Bhagavata Dharma." So you chant. When Prabhupada pointed out that in the Islam religion, they say Allah is the name of God as revealed in their scripture. So he is supreme, and they glorify him in so many ways in the Quran. In the Bible, Father in heaven, the name, the name of the supreme Lord is glorified in the Bible. So God is one, though different names he may be referred to in different bonafide religious systems, but God is one. Supreme means only one person. Nobody is equal to him. Nobody is above him. So that principle he is explaining, sticking to dogmas and formulas without attaining the real principles.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "A secular state may be impartial to any type of faith, but the state cannot be indifferent to the principles of religion."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by explaining that while a secular state may be impartial to different faiths, it cannot ignore fundamental religious principles like austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness, as breaking these principles leads to corruption.

A secular state may be impartial to any type of faith, but the state cannot be indifferent to the principles of religion as above mentioned. Secular state means the state will allow people to follow either Christianity or Islam or whatever, but they cannot break the fundamental principles like austerity, cleanliness, mercy, truthfulness. They cannot break that. They are punishable if they break these principles, irrespective of what their belief system is. In the age of Kali, the executive heads of state will be indifferent to such religious principles, and therefore under their patronage, the opponents of religious principles will follow, and so there will be no meaning to propaganda, crying to stop corruption in the state. People want to root out corruption, and they are harassed by this corruption, but the corruption is the natural consequence of people breaking the fundamental religious principles. You see, there is a connection. If people don't practice austerity, somebody may think, "Oh, he doesn't believe in doing tapasya, the form of fasting, so it's okay, let him not follow." No. That will result in the person becoming afflicted by greed, by falsehood, by cheating, so many bad qualities the person will develop. So therefore, to protect people, the enforcement, the law enforcing authority should enforce that everyone should follow, irrespective of their religious affiliation, the four fundamental pillars of dharma: austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Parikshit Maharaj encountering Kali Purusha and explains why Kali was not allowed to remain in the kingdom, emphasizing the importance of truth, religion, and sacrifice in a place like Brahmavarta.

These are words spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Shri Gautama Shetty Parijkshit Maharaj. For your refresh memory, while Parikshit was touring the kingdom, he came across this Kali Purusha trying to beat a bull and a cow. The bull was standing just on one leg, somehow hobbling along, the cow had tears in her eyes and she seemed to be unprotected, and this Kali Purusha was actually a low-class person dressed as a king, but his activity, his action, was harming the cow and the bull. So immediately Parikshit took out a sword to kill this Kali Purusha, but Kali Purusha actually, he completely surrendered to the king when he saw Kali Purusha. There was no way he could escape. So since Kalipurusha surrendered, Pariksit did not want to kill him, but he said you cannot remain in my kingdom because you are the friend of irreligion, atharma bandhu. So, he is addressing in this verse why is a personality like Kalipurusha not allowed to live in the kingdom of Pariksit Maharaj. So, the Kingdom of Pariksit Maharaj is a place where experts perform sacrifices according to truth and religion and morality, filial routine and morality, affinity and morality. So, all these principles for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality. Such a place is called Brahmavarta. It is not only one place, but it is wherever, any place on the surface of this globe, where the Supreme Lord is worshipped according to the principles of the authorized scriptures.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of performing sacrifices according to scriptural directions, highlighting that the methods of sacrifice vary in different ages (yugas).

And that is explained in the purport by Srila Prabhupada. Agneshwara, or the Supreme Personality, is the beneficiary of all kinds of sacrificial ceremonies. This is a statement of the Bhagavad Gita. The Supreme Lord is called Yajneshwara. Yajneshwara. He is the enjoyer, the beneficiary, the object of all sacrifices, which are performed according to the scriptural directions, which are authorized by the standard scriptures, which are not manufactured by some person of this world, no. So, Srila Prabhupada says, such sacrificial ceremonies are performed according to the scriptural directions, are prescribed differently in the scriptures for different ages. Now the shastras are recommending different types of sacrifice for different yugas in this earth planet.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the characteristics of Satya Yuga, where people were spiritually inclined and focused on meditation, and contrasts it with the current age.

Different yugas, the conditions are different, the living conditions are different. In Satya yuga, most people are situated in the mode of goodness. They are all spiritually inclined, they are very much religious minded, they follow the scriptural directions. So for that age the method of sacrifice was? God. Absolutely correct. The performance of meditation on the Supreme Lord within the heart. Vishnu seated in the heart is Paramatma, meditation on Paramatma. And that was feasible in that age in Satyayuga. There was a long duration of life for people and people were very, very sober, peaceful. They were satisfied with all the necessities being met with by the arrangement of the Supreme Lord through the material nature. So even now if you go to the Himalayas, of course it is rare. But there are people who are living in certain secluded places, remote places in the Himalayas where there is plenty of fruits available, nice water for bathing, drinking, everything, pure water. And there are caves for living under the water, and they are there as a place of shelter. And then their mind is completely controlled, so they are able to direct their mind, focus their mind on meditation on this Supreme Lord in the heart as directed by the shastras. So the Bhagavatam says, kriteyadhyayato vishnum. Kriteyadhyayato vishnum. Kriteyadhyayato vishnum.

**Key Quote:** "Kalavata Hari Kirtanath the method is a performance of Sankirtan Yajna"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the recommended methods of sacrifice for Treta Yuga (fire sacrifice), Dwapar Yuga (temple worship), and Kali Yuga (Sankirtan Yajna).

That is the recommendation and in the second age, Treta Yuga, the duration of life reduces and there is some irreligiosity because with time there is a degradation in the consciousness of the people of the human beings. So vice is introduced, irreligion is introduced in Treta Yuga and gradually the religious principles reduce by one-fourth in Treta Yuga. So the method is performance of five-fold fire sacrifice. Treta Ayaam Yajato Makhaihi, people are recommended to perform fire sacrifices as again given in the authorized Vedic scriptures and there are varieties of sacrifices for varieties of people, different purposes. But ultimately all such sacrifices are aimed at satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead only. And in Dwapar Yuga it is temple worship, Dwapare Parijari Ayaam, temple worship of the Lord in different Deity forms, installed Deity forms. So that is the method in Dwapar Yuga and Kali Yuga, Kalavata Hari Kirtanath, the method is a performance of Sankirtan Yajna. So Aarshala Prabhupada says, in other words sacrifice means to accept the supremacy of the Lord and thereby perform acts by which the Lord may be satisfied in all respects, religion means to please the Supreme Lord by the recommended method as given in the scriptures because scriptures

He is the Supreme Personality, he is the Supreme Controller, he is Supreme Maintainer, he is Supreme well wisher, he is Supreme Lord. Every perspective you see he is the Supreme. Now let us noodle it. Nobody is equal to him, nobody is greater than him, so therefore he is meant to be obeyed by all, not that somebody believes that everyone is god or supreme or that somebody else believes there is no god or somebody else believes such and such a person is god. It's not like that. God means one and only one supreme personality and all bona fide religions accept this particular, or all bona fide religions teach and propagate and also have got documented in their scriptures that there is one supreme lord who is the lord of all, everyone without exception, but he is

That is the highest perfection of religion, but the atheists do not believe in the existence of God and did not perform any sacrifice for the satisfaction of the Lord. So this is demonic mentality. Divine nature and demonic nature is always there everywhere at all times and the number of demons proportionately may be less or more in different yugas, but there are people of demonic nature and they deny God or they try to compete with God, they are atheists, whereas theists, they are not atheists in the human form and they have no religion and then the atheists will be involved in doing some very useful things, they want to satisfy God and also they want to satisfy the Supreme Lord, they want to perform actions for satisfying the Supreme Lord, no matter which religious system they follow which is a bona fide religious system, they are always divine natured and they want to perform actions for satisfying the Supreme Lord, so that is the basic principle.

### demigod worship, Vedic scriptures, Supreme Lord

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "So, all these different types of worship are in a nutshell explained here by Srila Prabhupada."
**Summary:** This segment introduces the concept of demigod worship within the Vedic tradition, contrasting it with the worship of the Supreme Lord and explaining the different perspectives on God.

In this session, we will be discussing from the thirty-fourth verse of the seventeenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Yasmin Harir Bhagavan Igyamana Igyatma Murtir Yajatam Shamtanoti Kaman Amoghan Sthira Jangamanam Antar Bahirvayur Ivaisha Atma. The meaning of this verse is, in all sacrificial ceremonies, although sometimes a demigod is worshipped, the Supreme Lord, Personality of Godhead, is worshipped because He is the Supersoul of everyone and exists both inside and outside like the air. Thus, it is He only who awards all welfare to the worshipper. This is a very important verse because a certain secret is revealed about the nature of God. Because people sometimes get confused, especially in the Hindu religion as they call it. The Vedas don't describe anywhere that our religious system is called a Hindu religious system, but it has come into practice to label our system as the Hindu religious system. Basically, the followers of the Vedas, the Vedic scriptures, among them there are some who worship God. They worship God as one Supreme person, like the Vaishnavas. And there are impersonalists who worship God as the Supreme Brahman, impersonal Brahman. They don't exactly describe what is God or who is God. They basically say God is without form, without any qualities, without any attributes, Nirmisesha, Nirvikara, Nirmikalpa, like that. They go on describing in a negative way and ultimately they don't say what is God. And then there are some people who worship a representation of God, which is the Supreme Lord, the Supreme Beholder. And there are some who worship God as a material representation. In the scriptures, they are called devatas, or as Prabhupada says, demigods. Demigods means almost like God but not equal to God. So, demigods are worshipped like Indra, Chandra, Varuna, or Ganesha, or Shiva, or Durga in so many forms. Durga is worshipped in so many forms, Shiva is worshipped in so many forms, the other devatas are worshipped and represented by sometimes even the elements like fire, or even bodies of water, worshipping the river, or worshipping a tree, or worshipping the ocean, worshipping fire, worshipping the sun, worshipping the moon, etc.

**Key Quote:** "Yet the rewards of all such sacrifices are awarded to the worshipper by the Supreme Lord only."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the purpose of worshipping demigods for specific material benefits and mentions the various demigods and forms of the Supreme Lord that are worshipped.

So, all these different types of worship are in a nutshell explained here by Srila Prabhupada. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "It is even sometimes seen that demigods like Indra and Chandra worshipped and offered sacrificial awards." In the scriptures, there is a recommendation that somebody may worship a particular devata for a particular purpose, for a particular material benefit. And the sacrifices offered in the name of such devata, Indraya Swaha or Agnaya Swaha, like that, different demigods. There are so many demigods. Actually, according to our authentic Vedic scriptures, there are 33 crore devatas, though most people do not worship or do not know about 33 crore devatas. But some prominent ones are worshipped. Especially nowadays, you can even see temples dedicated for worship of deities of Shiva, Durga, Ganesha, Kartikeya. And, of course, the Vaishnavas worship Krishna, Rama, Narsimha, Varaha, Vamana. So many different temples for these deities. And even sacrifices, fire sacrifices for pleasing Narsimha, Narsimha Homa, or for pleasing Krishna as Krishna Yagna, or Ramathar Ka Homa, like that. So many different types of worship of different forms of the Supreme Lord: Krishna, Rama, Narsimha, Varaha. Authorized. And then the forms of the demigods.

### Paramatma, Supreme Lord, demigod worship

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Because it is the Supreme Lord who is situated in the heart of everyone, including the Devatas."
**Summary:** This segment explains that the Supreme Lord, as Paramatma, resides in the hearts of all beings, including the demigods, and ultimately awards the results of all sacrifices.

Like Indra, Chandra, Varuna, Vayu. So Srila Prabhupada says, "Yet the rewards of all such sacrifices are awarded to the worshipper by the Supreme Lord only." If somebody follows the Vedic directions and worships either a deity of Ganesha or performs a sacrifice for pleasing Ganesha, Gana Homa, they say, Ganapati Homa, in any case, the ultimate reward is given only by the Supreme Lord Krishna. How is that? Because it is the Supreme Lord who is situated in the heart of everyone, including the Devatas. And he is everywhere present in the heart of everyone. He has entered into everything. Vishnu means one who enters into everything after his creation takes place. The Supreme Lord expands as Paramatma and enters into the heart of all living entities and even enters into every atom. Material atom. Andantarastha paramanu chayantarastham. He enters the created universe. He enters every planet. He enters the heart of every created being. He enters into every material atom, Paramanu. Anda means the universal shell. Vishwatma. So, like that, the Supreme Lord as Paramatma is present in everyone's heart, everywhere, even the Devata's heart. Indra, Chandra, Varuna, Vayu, everyone's heart. The Supreme Lord is present as Paramatma. And it is this Lord who is present in the heart of everyone, who is also present as the maintainer Vishnu, who is also present as Maha Vishnu, the origin of this creation itself, the creator, maintainer and destroyer of all the universes, and present in the spiritual world as Narayana, as Krishna. So, that Supreme Lord is present in everyone's heart, is present everywhere, is in the spiritual world, is in the material world. So, he actually is the only one who can avoid the results of all such bona fide sacrifices. He is the one who maintains everyone. He is the one who accepts the sacrifices if it is offered according to the Vedic directions. So, when somebody offers a sacrifice to Indra, it is through Indra that they are actually offering to the Supreme Lord.

### Bhagavad Gita, sacrifice, Supreme Lord

**Verse References:** BG 9.23
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "That whatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kunti is really meant for me alone."
**Summary:** This segment uses verses from the Bhagavad Gita to clarify that all sacrifices are ultimately meant for the Supreme Lord, even when offered to demigods, although often done without true understanding.

Through Indra. So, in the Bhagavad Gita this is clarified. Bhagavad Gita is the final scripture which clarifies all such apparent confusions or contradictions in the directions given in the original Vedas. Bhagavad Gita clarifies this. In Bhagavad Gita it is said, "Whatever a man may sacrifice to other gods"—gods here mean demigods—"O son of Kunti, is really meant for me alone." Me, Krishna is speaking. It is meant for Krishna only, but it is offered without true understanding. Yajante avidhi purvakam. They are not following the proper method of offering the sacrifice, because sacrifice means to ultimately please the Yajneshwara, the Supreme Lord of all sacrifices. That is the Supreme Lord Vishnu. Vishnu. Yajna vai Vishnu. Yajna means Vishnu. So, there is only one Supreme Lord. He is one without a second. Ekameva advitiya. This is the statement of the Vedas. One only. Supreme Lord is one only. There is no other God other than the Supreme Lord himself.

**Key Quote:** "But Krishna is above this material creation, and he is the lord of everyone."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the Supreme Lord's transcendence over the material creation and His position as the Lord of all, including the demigods, clarifying the correct understanding of demigod worship in relation to Krishna.

Thus, the Supreme Lord is eternally transcendental to the material creation. This is a very important point. There is this material creation consisting of different planets, different personalities, and different powers, different heads of the rulers, head of the particular living entities in a particular planet, the chief of the planet, planetary systems. Indra is the king of heaven, and then there is Indraloka. Then there is Chandra, the moon god, the predominant deity of the moon planet. The sun god, Suryadeva, predominant deity of the sun planet. Like that there are so many planets, so many personalities. But Krishna is above this material creation, and he is the lord of everyone. He is seated in everyone's heart. Suryadeva's heart, Chandra Deva's heart, Ganesha's heart, and Shiva's heart, Parvati or Durga Devi's heart. He is seated in the heart of everyone. He is the lord of everyone. He is above everybody. So Prabhupada says the demigods are indirect qualitative representation of supreme lord. So a learned devotee or a learned scholar in the Vedas knows who is who. He knows what is the position of the devatas and what is the position of supreme lord Krishna. So the really learned people they worship only Krishna, but others may worship Indra, Chandra, Varuna, etc. as a representative of Krishna, accepting on behalf of Krishna and passing on to Krishna the supreme lord. So this is the correct understanding about the recommendations for worship of Indra, Chandra, Ganesha, Shiva, etc. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami describes the encounter between Parikshit Maharaj and Kali Purusha, focusing on Kali's fear, surrender, and Parikshit's decree that Kali cannot reside in his kingdom due to its strict adherence to religious principles; this segment repeats the same information multiple times.

So Shukadev Goswami is telling, the personality of Kali thus being ordered by Maharaj Parikshit began to tremble in fear, seeing the king before him like Yamaraj ready to kill him, Kali spoke to the king as follows. So Kali Purusha, as I mentioned in the previous session, he was afraid of Parikshit because Parikshit was ready to kill him. For his nefarious act of unnecessarily harming the cow and the bull, so he surrendered and his life was saved, but what did he do after surrendering, what did he say, because Parikshit said you cannot stay, even though I have spared your life, you cannot stay in my kingdom, where religious principles are strictly followed according to scriptures.

### Kali Yuga, irreligion, sinful activities

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Parikṣit Mahārāja gave permission to Kali to reside in a place where there is gambling, drinking, prostitution and animal slaughter were performed."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam describing the places where Kali, the personification of irreligion, is allowed to reside: gambling, drinking, prostitution, and animal slaughter.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 38th verse of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Sūta uvāca abhyartitas tadātasmai sthānāni kalaye dadau tyūtaṁ pānam sthriya-sūnā yatra adharmas chatur vidhahā. Sūta Goswami said, Mahārāja Parikṣit, thus being petitioned by the personality of Kali, gave him permission to reside in places where gambling, drinking, prostitution, and animal slaughter were performed. This is a very, very, very important verse in the entire Bhagavatam, I would say, because this describes the four places where Kali was given permission to reside by Parikṣit Mahārāja, where life was spared. And who is Kali? Kali is the one who spreads irreligion. He spreads evil influence. He influences people in an evil way to commit sinful activities even though they may not be sinful otherwise. So what are those four places? Parikṣit Mahārāja gave permission to Kali to reside in a place where there is gambling, drinking, prostitution, and animal slaughter were performed. Parikṣit Mahārāja gave permission to Kali to reside in a place where there is gambling, drinking, prostitution, and animal slaughter were performed.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "religious principles there are four religious principles on which religion is based dharma is based"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the four places where Kali resides, explaining the meaning of each term and how they lead to irreligion and sinful activities, contrasting them with the four pillars of dharma: austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness.

So what are those four places where there is gambling going on? Deutam. And Pāäter is the place where there is intoxication—consumption of intoxicating drinks or even smoking in integents like tobacco—and prostitution, Sthriya, illicit connection with women, prostitution, illicit sex, and animal slaughter, Suna, animal killing for the sake of eating the animal flesh. So these four places were the places designated by Pariksit Maharaj for Kali Purusha to reside after his life was spent, which means that in Kali Yuga, wherever these four activities are going on is a place where Kali breeds all kinds of irreligiosity, means breaking the principles of Dharma and thereby committing various types of sinful activities and becoming implicated in sinful reactions to some of the activities that are going on in Kali Yuga. So if at all there is any suffering, it is only because of sin, and sin means to break the principles of Dharma, and this Dharma is given by the Supreme Lord, and where is it explained over? Is it described in the authentic scriptures again given by God? And anybody who violates, they are actually punished, and Kali Purusha particularly in this Age, the influence of the prevailing atmosphere is an evil, one of a kind influence, Kali Kalmasa. It is described in the Kali Santra Upanishad especially to overcome the bad influence, the evil influence in Kali Yuga of committing sinful activities or becoming implicated in different types of sinful activities or becoming victim of these four sinful activities: gambling, consuming intoxication, prostitution, and animal slaughter, animal killing. So these four sinful activities particularly are the places designated for Kali, and therefore Prabhupada writes a very elaborate purport. We will try to discuss this purport in this session and one more session because it's a long purport. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says the basic principles of irreligiosity such as pride, prostitution, intoxication, and falsehood counteract the four principles of religion, namely austerity, cleanliness

mercy, and truthfulness. See, already it was explained, dharma stands on four pillars, religious principles. There are four religious principles on which religion is based, dharma is based. Now, this is nothing to do with which religious system somebody may subscribe to. That means, ah, the religious principles are four fundamental principles of four, it is meant for all humanity all over the world irrespective of their belief system, irrespective of their tradition, irrespective of their caste, or irrespective of their inclinations to work, irrespective of their karma, four fundamentalities principle: austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness. Austerity is destroyed by pride, cleanliness is destroyed by prostitution, mercy is destroyed by intoxication, and truthfulness destroyed by falsehood, cheating, lying, propaganda. So the personality of Kali was given permission to live in four places particularly mentioned by the king, namely the place of gambling, the place of prostitution, the place of drinking, and the place of animal slaughter.

### gambling, cheating, prostitution, Varna Sankara population, lust

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "gambling destroys truthfulness because it is cheating it is falsity is falsehood then prostitution destroys cleanliness so illicit sex is the cause of Varna Sankara population"
**Summary:** The speaker delves deeper into the consequences of gambling and prostitution, explaining how gambling is a form of cheating and how prostitution leads to Varna Sankara population, which results in the breaking of religious principles and criminal-mindedness.

So you can understand gambling means cheating. Krishna explains this in the Bhagavad Gita: deutam chalayatam asmi, among all processes of cheating, gambling stands supreme because gambling is nothing but cheating. See, people get indulge in gambling with the idea that without much effort, by some small investment of a real real small fraction of money, I can own a huge amount of money which is enough for my living the entire life. It's exactly what is the basic principle of gambling. This like there are many different ways people indulge in gambling. Let's say they buy a lottery ticket, they may pay five rupees, but the first prize for the lottery ticket will be, I don't know how much nowadays, but earlier I have known that people would say I can win 1 crore rupees or I can win 80 lakhs just spend 5 rupees and then if you win the lottery the first prize you get 1 crore rupees. So where is 5 rupees and where is 1 crore rupees? So this basically cheating is basically cheating. So this gambling destroys truthfulness because it is cheating, it is falsity, it is falsehood. Then prostitution destroys cleanliness. So illicit sex is the cause of Varna Sankara population, Varna Sankara population, and such Varna Sankara population results in all kinds of breaking of religious principles, breaking of religious principles, and they are criminal minded. It pollutes the mind. This Varna Sankara population, the mind is polluted, they are criminal minded even without any external blood influence, by birth itself they are criminal minded because they are conceived in lust.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "animal slaughter killing animals destroys the quality of mercy only hard-hearted people cruel people people who are merciless they indulge in animal killing simply for the sake of satisfying their tongue by eating animal flesh."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how intoxication destroys austerity and how animal slaughter destroys the quality of mercy, emphasizing that meat-eaters are necessarily cruel and hard-hearted.

And this is a big science. It is explained in the Bhagavatam elsewhere how to conceive good children and when is it that two people, man and woman, combining sexually produce a criminal mentality, a child with criminal mentality. So prostitution is the cause for that illicit sex for description as a cause of destroying cleanliness, and the place of drinking is intoxication where intoxication enlarging it actually destroys austerity. Somebody becomes inebriated, somebody becomes delirious, then there is no possibility of them executing austerity of tapasya. So tapasya is destroyed by intoxication, and animal slaughter, killing animals, destroys the quality of mercy. Only hard-hearted people, cruel people, people who are merciless, they indulge in animal killing simply for the sake of satisfying their tongue by eating animal flesh. So they are heartless, they're cruel, and their quality, inherent quality of compassion in a human being, is destroyed by animal killing. So meat eaters, animal flesh eaters, are necessarily very, very, very, very, very cruel people. They are cruel people. Sometimes I've heard the argument that even though somebody is a meat-eater, they are very nice, kind. Where is their kindness if the very eating, which is a very basic necessity for survival itself, is based on the principle of cruelty towards animals, where is kindness? Oh, we are kind to human beings and we don't care for animals. How can you be kind to one section of the created beings of God, creation of God, and be totally indifferent or cruel or merciless towards another section of the creation? Everybody has a right to live, so you have no right to kill anyone, let alone animals, you have right to kill no one. So that is the basic principle of living according to religious principles. So when the very fundamental distinct act of eating such a concept and so on the eating food is based on killing, so they can never be pardoned, they can never be considered as kind people, they can never be considered as nice people, never, never, never. So all meat eaters

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (1.17.38) about Maharaj Pariksit allowing Kali to reside in places of gambling, drinking, prostitution, and animal slaughter.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udhirayam. In this session, we will be discussing from the 38th verse of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is a fresh session which is continuing from the previous session. Previous session we discussed part 1 of this 38th verse, now we will discuss part 2 and in the next session we will discuss part 3 because there is a very big purport here written by Srila Prabhupada. So I will just read this verse once again, 38th verse of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, Suta Vacha Abhyarthitas Tadatasmai Sthanani Kalaye Dadau Deutam Panam Striya Suna Yatra Adharma Chatur Vidhah. The meaning of this verse is, Suta Goswami said, Maharaj Pariksit, thus being petitioned by the personality of Kali, gave him permission to reside in places where gambling, drinking, prostitution and animal slaughter were performed. So Maharaj Pariksit gave Kali Purusha four places, Deutam Panam Striya Suna, Deutam means gambling, Panam means drinking, Pras and Striya means prostitution and Suna means animal slaughter.

**Key Quote:** "Drinking against the principles of scriptures, association with women outside marriage, killing animals against the injunction of scriptures are all adharma or all irreligious."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the basic principles of irreligiosity and how they counteract the principles of religion, referencing Srila Prabhupada's purport and Srila Jiva Goswami's commentary, focusing on drinking, illicit relations, and animal slaughter.

So we discussed in the previous session that the basic principles of irreligiosity, they counteract the four principles of religion. And we discussed how counteraction happens in the previous session. Now, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport further, the personality of Kali was given permission to live in four places particularly mentioned by the king. Namely, the place of gambling, the place of prostitution, the place of drinking, and the place of animal slaughter. Four specific places were given for Kali Purusha by Maharaj Pariksit. So, now something about what is Dharma and what is Adharma as regards these four activities are specifically explained by Srila Prabhupada, with reference to Srila Jeeva Goswami's commentary on this verse in his writings. Srila Jeeva Goswami is one of the six Goswamis, the direct disciples of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the next part of the purport, Srila Jeeva Goswami directs the drunken people and the unmarried woman with the five principles of the scriptures that drinking against the principles of scriptures, such as the Sautramaaniyagna, association with woman outside of marriage, killing animals against the injunctions of scriptures, are irreligious. Irreligious means Adharma. Three things are specifically mentioned. Drinking against the principles of scriptures, association with women outside marriage, killing animals against the injunction of scriptures are all adharma or all irreligious.

**Key Quote:** "The Vedic injunction for the pravartas the ordinary people those engaged in material enjoyment is to gradually regulate their activities towards the path of liberation"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the different scriptural injunctions for 'pravrittas' (those engaged in material enjoyment) and 'nivrttas' (those liberated from material bondage), emphasizing that the aim of the Vedas is to free everyone from material bondage and help them progress back to Godhead.

Now we have to carefully understand what does it mean that these acts are irreligious only if they are against the scriptures and what do scriptures allow in terms of drinking, illicit connection with women and or rather association with women and killing animals. What do scriptures allow? scriptures say so Prabhupada first of all clarifies in the Vedas two different types of injunctions are there for the pravrittas and for the nivrittas so dharma or scriptural injunctions are there differently explained for two different categories of persons who are the pravrittas pravrittas are those who are engaged in material enjoyment and nivrittas are those who are liberated for from material bondage so pravrittas who are regular ordinary people they are somehow in ignorance and they are engaged in material enjoyment so what is the scriptural injunctions of practicing Dharma for the normal people ordinary people the pravartas those engaged in material enjoyment and what are those scriptural injunctions specifically meant for nivrittas or those liberated from material bondage there are different injunctions so Srila Prabhupada further says the Vedic injunction for the pravartas the ordinary people those engaged in material enjoyment is to gradually regulate their activities towards the path of liberation so the injunctions in this scriptural injunctions are the same as the pravartas scriptures are meant to regulate the activities of the ordinary common people so that these common people progress towards liberation not that they follow the scriptures and they remain in bondage no the aim of the Vedas whether it is for the pravartas or nivrittas is ultimately to free them from material bondage and to help them progress after becoming liberated to go back to Godhead we should not forget this merely attaining liberation from material bondage is not enough there is a further progress to be made after liberation to go back to Godhead where we all belong

**Key Quote:** "For those who are in the lowest stage of ignorance and who indulge in wine women and flesh there are scriptural rules how to regulate their activities"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on how scriptures provide regulations for those in the lowest stage of ignorance (tamasic people) who indulge in wine, women, and flesh, such as drinking after Sautramani Yagna, associating with women only through marriage, and eating animal flesh after sacrifice.

therefore Srila Prabhupada further says for those who are in the lowest stage of ignorance and who indulge in wine women and flesh there are scriptural rules how to regulate their activities in this connection how to regulate their drinking how to regulate their association with women how to regulate them in the matter of eating flesh so for drinking liquor for the pravrittas there is a injunction that they may drink liquor after performing Sautramani Yagna the pravrittas may associate with women only through marriage and the pravrittas may eat animal flesh and drink liquor after performing Sautramani Yagna after offering a goat in sacrifice so we should always remember that these recommendations in the Vedas for the pravrittas is meant for pravrittas only and not for everyone you it's not meant for everyone so these pravrittas for whom such allowance is given are those in the lowest stage of ignorance they are tamasic people they are situated in tamoguna so it is not meant for those who are not in tamoguna it's not meant for those in rajoguna or sattvaguna no so when the people who are thumbsick they indulge in drinking liquor or eating flesh animal flesh or they indulge in associating with women they may do so according to the injunctions of the scriptures by following the sacrifice meant for offering a goat to Kali or by offering some liquor to again Kali in Sautramani yajna or they may associate with women after getting married to them according to the Vedic injunctions so for such thumbsick people under Vedic regulation which is meant for thumbsick people pravrittas there is no consideration of sin I'm sorry there's no consideration of being punished by being sent to hell if they kill a goat and offer it in sacrifice to Kali or they offer wine in a Sautramani yajna and then partake of the remnants of such offering or they indulge in sex with a woman after being duly married to that woman

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing that scriptural allowances for certain classes of people (tamasic) should not be considered universally applicable, and such activities are adharma for sattvic and rajasic people, stressing the importance of careful discrimination and understanding the context of scriptural injunctions.

so do not pray to Lord Shiva for anything else but only to improve one's health in hell so these injunctions in the scriptures are only for thumbsick people it is not meant for every one so Shruthi Prabhupada says one man's food may be poisoned for others similarly what is recommended for those in the mode of ignorance may be poisoned for those in the mode of goodness Srila Jiva Goswami Prabhupada says that recommendations in the scriptures for certain class of men are never to be considered adharma or irreligious for them but in general for people who are not in the tamasic stage all such activities are never to be encouraged and they are factually adharma for sattvic people and rajasic people the recommendations like soutramani yajna etc are actually not to be followed for them all sorts of recommendations like that are not to be followed for them all sorts of meat-eating and all sorts of drinking liquor are prohibited so therefore one has to be very careful that simply because the shastras allow for a certain class of people some animal sacrifice or offering of wine in some yagna and then partaking the remnants doesn't mean everyone can do it no so this clarification Srila Prabhupada is giving in the purport to this particular verse the 38th verse which says that Kali Purusha was given four places and one has to be careful and the later verses and purports will clarify this more I

**Key Quote:** "Following in the footsteps of Maharaj Pariksit it is the duty of all executive heads of states to see that the principles of religion namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness are established in the state and that the principles of irreligion namely pride, illicit female association of prostitution, intoxication and falsity are checked by all means."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of discussion, verse 38 of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, and explains Prabhupada's perspective on the duties of the state in upholding religious principles and curbing irreligious activities, particularly in the age of Kali.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we continue to discuss from the 38th verse of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This session will be part 3 of the discussion on the 38th verse. Previous two sessions, we discussed different aspects of these four sinful activities: Deutam Panam Striya Suna, gambling, drinking liquor, illicit connection with women, and animal slaughter, animal killing for the sake of eating the animal flesh. These four sinful activities we discussed in the previous two sessions. Prabhupada now is in the last part of this purport; he is describing what is the duty of the executioner. The duty of the executioner is to protect the executive heads of state to actually counteract this evil influence of Kali so that there is religiosity, which is Dharma, is protected in the state. So Prabhupada says, following in the footsteps of Maharaj Pariksit, it is the duty of all executive heads of states to see that the principles of religion, namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness, tapasyaucham, dayasatyam, are established in the state and that the principles of irreligion, namely pride, illicit female association of prostitution, intoxication and falsity, are checked by all means.

**Key Quote:** "These are universal factual principles of Dharma which is applicable for the entire human society, entire human society irrespective of what somebody's belief system may be or some traditional affiliation to some community or caste or whatever."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the four pillars of Dharma (austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness) as universal principles, and discusses how Maharaj Pariksit dealt with Kali Purusha by allocating specific places for sinful activities to prevent their influence on religious citizens.

So the four principles of religion, Dharma, to uphold Dharma, Dharma stands on four pillars. That means there has to be austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. Then only there is Dharma. Dharma is not based on some sentimental following of some so called religious principles. No. There is no such thing which each person may think according to me this is Dharma, according to somebody else something else is Dharma, no. These are universal factual principles of Dharma which is applicable for the entire human society, entire human society irrespective of what somebody's belief system may be or some traditional affiliation to some community or caste or whatever. Okay. Or religion, so called religion maybe irrespective of that. So Akshaya La Prabhupada says to make the best use of a bad bargain, the personality of Kali may be transferred to places of gambling, drinking, prostitution and slaughterhouses if there are any places like that. So Kali Purusha has entered the kingdom of Pariksit. But Pariksit doesn't want to enter the kingdom of Pariksit. But Pariksit doesn't want Kali Purusha to influence the citizens of his kingdom who are strictly following the religious principles. He didn't want Kali to influence him to become irreligious.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses how to deal with individuals addicted to sinful habits, emphasizing regulation through scripture and discouraging government endorsement of such activities, advocating for the eradication of gambling, drinking, prostitution, and falsity.

So he gave Kali Purusha four places. Now Kali Purusha actually to be indicated that Kali Purusha has entered the kingdom of Pariksit. That in the next words that he saw in Pariksit Maharaj's kingdom because he was ruling very strictly. There were no places where these activities were going on. The people were protected against the influence of his sinful acts. So Śrīla Prabhupāda says if there are some people who are addicted to such habits, for them what is the way out of you know these sinful activities. So Prabhupāda says those who are addicted to these irreligious habits may be regulated by the injunctions of the scripture. As I mentioned in the previous session, part two, same words discussion of part 2 the previous session that in the Shastras there is a concession given for Tamsic people that they may be regulated in drinking liquor or eating meat or indulging in sex with women by Shastric injunctions, so injunctions of the scriptures meant for Tamsic people, but in no circumstances should such people who are addicted to these habits be encouraged by the government or the state or the king, never should there be any freedom given to indulge in unrestrictedly, so proper says in other words the state should never encourage any of these activities, they should categorically stop all sorts of gambling, drinking, prostitution

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the second recommendation: compulsory marriage at specific ages to prevent illicit relationships, advocating for marriage in cases of intimate connection and the abolishment of divorce laws.

scriptures then the second recommendation here is that there must be compulsory marriage of young boys and girls attaining 24 years of age and 16 years of age respectively that means boys when they reach 24 years of age they should compulsorily get married and girls when they reach 16 years of age they should get compulsory married why is this recommendation of compulsory marriage because it's very natural for young boys and girls to mix with each other but they should not mix without being properly married that is the danger of mixing free mixing so Prabhupada says there is no harm in co-education in the schools and colleges provided the boys and girls are duly married and in case there is any intimate connection between a male and female and male and female student they should be married properly without illicit relation that means mixing between a boy and a girl is only allowed if they are married otherwise it should not be allowed so that mixing without being married is called illicit connection it is actually sinful mixing without being married only a married couple boy and girl or man and woman can actually mix with each other otherwise no and Prabhupada also says the the divorce act is encouraging prostitution and this should be abolished formerly in the Vedic culture there was nothing like divorce in the entire Vedic scripture there is no mention of divorce so there should be no government encouragement or government license for divorce so that is the divorce act has to be abolished.

**Summary:** The speaker presents the third recommendation: citizens should donate up to 50% of their income to create a spiritual atmosphere, and the state should encourage preaching the principles of Bhagavatam through five methods.

So that is the divorce act has to be abolished. That is what Prabhupada's recommendation is to avoid illicit connection with women. The third recommendation Srila Prabhupada gives is the citizens of the state must give in charity up to 50% of their income for the purpose of creating a spiritual atmosphere in the state or in human society both individually and collectively. You see that people's earning money they earn should be utilized properly so that there is a good atmosphere in the spiritual atmosphere is created in the state or the human society. Why because unless there is a proper atmosphere. It is difficult to encourage people to practice some basic principles what are recommended in the in the Bhagavatam also they should preach the principles of Bhagavatam the state should encourage preaching the principles of Bhagavatam by five different methods principles of Bhagavatam can be preached by the first one karma yoga or doing everything for the satisfaction of the Lord please explain the third chapter of Bhagavad Gita karma yoga means whatever work one does wonder does it as sacrifice to Vishnu sacrifice to the supreme law that's called yajna so karma yoga means performing all work as sacrifice second one is regular hearing of the Srimad Bhagavatam from authorized persons or realized souls Bhagavad Shravan third one is chanting of the glories of the Lord congregation Lee at home or at places of worship Sankirtan yajna specifically Kirtan yajna means the one who is doing all the work for the satisfaction of the Lord kirtana hari kirtana chanting of the glories of the Lord congregation Lee all gathered together people gathered together at home or in places of worship and they perform this kirtana hari kirtana and fourth recommendation is rendering all kinds of service to the bhagavata's engaged in preaching Srimad Bhagavatam those who preach Srimad Bhagavatam exclusively dedicating their lives for such preaching such bhagavata's should be should be actually given all kinds of service serve the bhagavata's bhagavata's seva and the fifth recommendation is residing in a place where the atmosphere is saturated with God consciousness these five recommendations for preaching the

In this session we are discussing from the 39th verse of the 17th chapter of the 1st canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. The meaning of this 39th verse is The personality of Kali asked for something more and because of his begging King Pariksit gave him permission to live where there is goal. Because wherever there is goal there is also falsity, intoxication, lust, envy and enmity. So, if you remember the previous verse Kali was given four places by Maharaj Pariksit where gambling goes on, where drinking liquor is indulged in, where there is illicit connection with women, prostitution and where there is animal slaughter.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Kali Purusha's nature as a friend of irreligion (Adharma) and how Parikshit Maharaj allowed him to reside where gold is accumulated, as it fosters falsity, intoxication, lust, envy, and enmity.

Kali Purusha is described as Adharmabandhu, friend of Adharma, irreligion. So, wherever Kali Purusha resides, he will spread Adharma. And Parikshit Mahana did not want his citizens to get corrupted, to get influenced by Adharma, Adharma influence of Kali. So, therefore, Kali asked the king, you have practically cheated me. You didn't give me any place. So, then Parikshit Maharaj, because Kali had surrendered, he gave him a fifth place. That place where gold is accumulated for non-devotional purposes. So, Prabhupada says in the purport further, Maharaj Parikshit thus gave Kali permission to go. He gave Kali permission to live in a place where there is gold, because wherever there is gold, there are all the above mentioned four things and over and above them there is enmity also. What are the four defects of accumulating gold for any purpose other than devotional service? There will be falsity, Andhritam, Madham, intoxication, Kamam, lust.

**Summary:** The speaker transitions to a discussion of government policy, arguing that a gold standard currency is inherently based on falsity because the value of currency notes issued is not equivalent to the gold reserves held by the government.

encourages five things, falsity, intoxication, prostitution, envy and enmity. Even a gold standard exchange in currency is bad. Now Prabhupada is talking about the government policy. Gold standard currency is based on falsehood because the currency is not on a par with the reserve gold. Now, that is the system most countries have including India that they have currency notes issued by the government. Now, what is the value of that currency note, the piece of paper? Now, they say, the government says that this paper has got a value because it is valuable because it is based on the reserve gold that is kept stored in the government safe deposit vaults. But, the reality is the government issues currency notes not exactly based on the value of the gold stored in their vaults. They issue much more currency notes than the gold there. So, Prabhupada says the basic principle is falsity.

**Key Quote:** "The basic principle is falsity because currency notes are issued in value beyond that of the actual reserve gold."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of currency notes exceeding the value of reserve gold to illustrate how gold encourages falsity, and how this artificial inflation of currency leads to the prostitution of the state economy.

How gold encourages falsity is a good example here, right here. The basic principle is falsity because currency notes are issued in value beyond that of the actual reserve gold. For example, if let us say the government has gold worth 100 crores. The government has gold worth let us say 100 million rupees just to give you an example. If the total currency notes in circulation, printed currency notes is more than 100 million rupees, then that is a falsity and that is what exactly is happening. So, Prabhupada says currency notes are issued in value beyond that of the actual reserve gold. So, there is falsity right here by the government itself. See, the government should themselves not be practicing falsity and they should regulate the citizens to avoid falsity. Now, here government itself is not practicing falsity. Government itself is practicing falsity when they issue currency notes beyond the value of the reserve gold. So, what happens if they issue such currency? This artificial inflation of currency that means they are giving issuing more notes than what they should be issuing. This is called artificial inflation. By the authorities encourages prostitution of the state economy. The state economy is completely spoiled. It is ruined. The state economy is ruined.

**Key Quote:** "The price of commodities becomes artificially inflated because of bad money or artificial currency notes."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how the economy is ruined by artificial inflation, where the supply of currency notes exceeds the value of available goods, leading to increased prices and scarcity.

What happens? How is the economy ruined? Prabhupada says the price of commodities becomes artificially inflated because of bad money or artificial currency notes. See, people have more currency notes in their hand than the actual reserve gold. And the value of the goods that are available. These currency notes are just a medium of exchange. So, if I have currency notes worth let us say 10,000 rupees. If these 10,000 rupees can purchase some goods worth what they say is worth 10,000, but if the equation is not commensurate with actual total value of the goods then there is inflation, artificial inflation in the price of the commodities. The price of the commodities will go up because the supply of the goods will not correspond with the supply of the currency notes. There will be more currency notes in supply and the goods will be less. So, what happens? People's buying power will exhaust all the goods and people will have money but there will be no goods. So, the price of the commodities will naturally go up when there is scarcity. Bad money drives away good money. So, this is what is called as bad money.

### gold coins, currency, government policy, falsity, economy

**Key Quote:** "Instead of paper currency, actual gold coin should be used for exchange."
**Summary:** The speaker suggests using gold coins as currency instead of paper notes to prevent the misuse of gold and eliminate falsity in the economy, also suggesting regulation of gold ornaments for women by quantity.

The currency notes issued in excess of the value of the stored gold. So, Prabhupada says instead of paper currency, actual gold coin should be used for exchange. Whatever the government has got the reserve gold, they should make gold coins and that should be the currency. That should be the medium of exchange and this will stop the prostitution of gold. Gold will not be misused anymore. Gold ornaments for women may be allowed by control not by quality but by quantity. What about women using gold ornaments? That was always there in the Vedic culture. So, now how can government avoid people accumulating too much gold in the form of gold ornaments for women? So, government has to regulate by quantity the gold that people possess. Otherwise, if they possess too much of gold, that will simply lead to lust, envy, enmity, etc. So, by restricting the quantity of gold people can have, this will discourage lust, envy and enmity. When there is actual gold currency in the form of coins, the influence of gold in producing falsity will automatically cease. It will automatically stop. Nobody can cheat. If there are gold coins for currency, then nobody can cheat. Neither the government nor the people can cheat.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the practicality of Prabhupada's recommendations, noting that Vedic culture used gold coins, which prevented artificial inflation, a problem prevalent in countries with paper currency.

Now, simply because they are issuing paper currency not in equality with the value of reserve gold. So, therefore, there is artificial inflation. So, Prabhupada's recommendations are very practical and that is why you find in the Vedic culture they had only gold coins. They did not have currency notes in those times because of which there was no artificial inflation at all. Now, you can see in every country where they have currency notes, they have so much of inflation. So much of inflation. The value of the currency notes which is promised by the government is not in on par with the value of the commodities or the goods that people require to purchase with the money that they have. And that is why there is so much of inflation, inflation, inflation.

The four places where the four sinful activities: gambling, drinking, prostitution, animal slaughter. These four places and the fifth place is where gold is accumulated.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's purport, explaining how the accumulation of wealth for sense gratification in Kali Yuga leads to an increase in falsity, intoxication, animal slaughter, and prostitution.

For non-devotional purposes. So, in the purport Srila Prabhupada says, "Thus the age of Kali began with gold standardization and therefore falsity, intoxication, animal slaughter and prostitution are rampant all over the world and the saner section is eager to drive out corruption." You see, because in Kali Yuga there is so much of wealth accumulated for sense gratification. Therefore, there is in Kali Yuga so much of falsity, intoxication, animal slaughter and prostitution.

**Summary:** The speaker defines and explains each of the four sinful activities: gambling, intoxication, animal slaughter, and prostitution, emphasizing that sex should only be for producing good progeny according to religious principles, otherwise it leads to a corrupted population.

Falsity is basically different forms of cheating by gambling. So, this is what we are talking about, by gambling. Intoxication, all descriptions of intoxicants, tobacco, whether they are consuming tobacco as gutka or they are smoking tobacco or they are distilling tobacco, whatever ways they want to indulge in intoxication. Animal slaughter. Killing of animals for flesh, meat eating. So many millions and billions of animals are killed. So much animal slaughter is going on. And prostitution. Prostitution is any sexual contact with women outside of the religious principles. Religious principles allow sex only for the sake of producing good progeny. Dharma aviriddha bhuteshu kamo smi bharatar shabha. In the Bhagavad Gita it is very clear. Sex life is meant for producing Krishna conscious children, good population. Otherwise, if the religious principles are not followed, then the result of illicit sex is Varna Sankara population. The population generated by illicit connection with women becomes corrupted, becomes criminal minded.

So, we can see how the number of people who are not following the religious principles is increasing as Kali Yuga progresses and there is so much of indulgence in intoxication, meat eating, gambling, illicit sex, so much. And there are sober people who want to drive away corruption, but Prabhupada says the counteracting process for these four sinful activities is already suggested by Prabhupada in the purport to 38th verse and the 39th verse. So 38th verse Prabhupada suggested two compulsory days of fasting observing the Kali Shivrata and then a compulsory marriage for those who want to associate with a member of the opposite sex, then citizens of state must give in charity up to 50 percent of their income for the propagation of Bhagavata Dharma and the five ways in which Bhagavata Dharma should be propagated in the state.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces verse 41, emphasizing that those who desire progressive well-being, especially leaders like kings, religionists, public leaders, brahmanas, and sannyasis, should avoid the four irreligious principles: gambling, illicit sex, intoxication, and meat-eating.

the evil influence of Kali in this Kali Yuga and Prabhupada says everyone can take advantage of these suggestions. Then in the 41st verse: athei taani na seveta, bubhusuhu purushakva chit pierisupati grassha vashi 깁 ebeIm vishe shato dhamash exporta, saitala kuru prasadhi agni ko pashalaye dosa ajari , Bmake하면 sathyanakas keikamishwaram vamsikamah nitopatmanai vipuhya 365OSADVOMU kamup branches, abdev vai kasi makir abdevfakas hijjyari uasali pingamat jag jahan karmok oli baisamikana guru who. The meaning of this 41st verse is: therefore whoever desires progressive well-being especially kings, religionists, public leaders, brahmanas and sannyasis should never come in contact with the above mentioned four irreligious principles. So Bhagavatam recommends specially four or five categories of persons. Kings means the rulers, the executive heads of the government, religionists those who preach religious principles, priests and propagators of religion. Public leaders, all descriptions of public leaders, brahmanas and sannyasis in the Vedic culture the brahmanas are proper explains that in the purport I will read the purport we will understand who are being mentioned as brahmanas and sannyasis. These categories of persons in the society should never come in contact with the four religious principles: gambling, illicit sex, intoxication and meat eating. They should never come in touch with these four.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, clarifying the roles of brahmanas and sannyasis in the varnashrama system, highlighting that brahmanas are spiritual teachers for other castes, and sannyasis are spiritual masters for all.

They should be completely free from these four sinful habits. So in the purport Srila Prabhupada says the brahmanas are the religious preceptors for all other castes. In the varnashrama system there are four social divisions: brahmana, kshatriya, vaishya, shudra. So of these four divisions the division of brahmanas, they are the spiritualists, the spiritual teachers for the kshatriyas, vaishyas and shudras. And the sannyasis are spiritual masters for all castes and orders of society. Sannyasis are among the brahmanas those who are in the renounced order, those who are renunciants. They are completely detached from all material connections. So sannyasis are the spiritual masters even of the brahmanas. So sannyasis are spiritual masters for everyone. So brahmanas and sannyasis are clarified who are meant by brahmanas and sannyasis. So also are the king and the public leaders who are responsible for the material welfare of all people.

**Key Quote:** "So also are the king and the public leaders who are responsible for the material welfare of all people."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the responsibilities of kings and public leaders for the material welfare of the people, emphasizing the importance of truthfulness for brahmanas and avoiding illicit connections with women for sannyasis.

The king, the king means the executive head of state. Of course now there is no monarchy in most countries but in place of the king there is the president or the prime minister or the governor whatever be the designation, the executive head of state in the government. So they should be responsible for the material welfare of the people. Okay. So, particularly Prabhupada says not only material welfare, it is said here by Prabhupada the progressive religionists and those who are responsible human beings or those who want to do not want to spoil their valuable human lives should refrain from all principles of irreligiosity especially elicit connection with women. Among the four sinful activities elicit connection with women is particularly to be refrained by the sannyasis. And, a Brahmana especially he should be truthful. So, if a Brahmana is not truthful, all his claims as a brahmana at once becomes null and void so brahmana should be truthful under all circumstances never should a brahmana tell lies and a sanyasi should particularly avoid illicit connection with women the sanyasi is illicit having illicit connection with women immediately all his claims for as a sanyasi at once becomes false.

**Summary:** The speaker further emphasizes the importance of avoiding illicit connections with women for sannyasis and truthfulness for brahmanas, and how drinking and smoking disqualify public leaders from effectively serving the people.

So these are injunctions in the vedic literature particularly of course it doesn't mean others can have illicit connection with women no but particularly the sanyasi should never have any forget about illicit sex sanyasi should have no connection with any women at all of any kind and brahmana should not tell lies under any circumstances should never tell lies similarly if the king and the public leader unnecessarily proud or habituated to drinking and smoking certainly they become disqualified to discharge public welfare activities see the public leader in order to influence the people whom they are governing in a positive way they should themselves have a good character that good character means they should not be habituated to drinking or smoking.

**Key Quote:** "Truthfulness is the basic principle of all religions"
**Summary:** The speaker highlights truthfulness as a basic principle of all religions and emphasizes that leaders, both spiritual and material, must be tested by their character and qualifications before being accepted.

If they have such habits then they are disqualified to be in the position of public leader. Now proper says truthfulness is the basic principle of all religions any religious system somebody may follow somebody may claim I'm christian somebody else may claim I'm muslim somebody else may claim I'm hindu whatever be your release affiliation truthfulness is the basic principle everybody has to practice that practice truthfulness. So prabhupada says the four leaders of the human society namely the sannyasis the brahmanas the king and the public leader must be tested crucially by their character and qualification character character is very important what are their qualities by which they are holding that position in society as a brahmana as a king or public leader or as a sannyasi so before one can be accepted as a spiritual or material master of society he must be tested by the above mentioned criteria of character.

So material masters are the public leaders and the spiritual master is one who is guiding in spiritual affairs the society the members of the society so both of them should be actually qualified before they occupy the position of a spiritual leader or a material leader such public leaders may be less qualified in terms of academic qualifications but it is necessary primarily that they be free from the contamination of four disqualifications namely gambling drinking prostitution and will slaughter that means in the society people in general should avoid these four sinful activities gambling drinking prostitution animal slaughter and particularly the profession of wit으s and the spiritual leaders the material leaders and the spiritual leaders should totally avoid these four activities sinful activities then only there will be no corruption in the state and people will be able to live peacefully happily and nicely in such a state but if these four activities are indulged in indulged in by the leaders, then this state is completely corrupt state.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the verse's relevance to modern times, emphasizing that Parikshit Maharaj cheated Kali by designating specific places and that gold can be used for good or bad.

by encouraging activities. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport what does this mean for present day people we who are living in this Kali Yuga after about five thousand years have passed. What does it mean for us? So Prabhupada says in the purport by designating particular places for the personality of Kali Maharaj Parikshit practically cheated Kali. In the presence of Kali Dharma in the shape of the bull and the earth in the shape of a cow he could actually estimate the general condition of his kingdom and therefore he could take at once proper steps to re-establish the legs of the bull namely austerity, cleanliness and mercy. And for the general benefit of the people of the world he saw that the gold stock might be employed for stabilization. This is a very very important point. He took the steps to re-establish the proper steps to re-establish the legs of the Dharma namely austerity, cleanliness and mercy and he also employed the gold stock that was kept, with all being used for Krishnan service for devotional service he used it for would have been beautiful oro blessing . So this is a very important question. sacral bestowal in the first time. That moment another step in his life the first 不斷保 dij唰анич impostor.

Gold is certainly a generator of falsity, intoxication, prostitution, enmity and violence. But, under the guidance of a proper king or public leader or a Brahmin or Sanyasi, the same gold can be properly utilized to reestablish the lost legs of the bull, the personality of religion. By itself, wealth or gold is not bad. The improper or proper utilization, that matters. How you use that gold is important. If you use it properly, you can use it to maintain or restore the lost legs of Dharma. Or, people may misuse it and further degradation sets in and the Dharma

Bhagavatam says, in Kali Yuga, other types of Yajna are not practical. In the Bhagavad Gita and all the scriptures it is said, work should be done as Yajna so that people don't become entangled in this material world. So, there are varieties of Yajna that one may perform, but in Kali Yuga, the most practical and feasible type of Yajna is Sankirtan Yajna. So therefore, Parikshit Maharaj, like his grandfather, Arjuna, he employed all the illicit gold kept for propensities of Kali. Illicit gold means gold that has been accumulated for sense enjoyment that he utilized in Sankirtan Yajna.

And that is a recommendation of the Bhagavatam. As we have suggested before, Prabhupada gave instructions in a previous purport that I read in detail, the 38th verse purport. It is very big. We covered it in three sessions, three parts. And there, one of the recommendations Prabhupada had given that once accumulated wealth may be divided into three parts for distribution. Namely, 50% for the service of the Lord. Lord means the Supreme Lord Krishna. 25% for the family members. And 25% for personal necessities. So, dividing one's wealth. This for whom? Particularly for people who have lot of excess wealth than what is bare minimum required for keeping body and soul together. There are those who live by the principle that, I will only take as much wealth as is necessary for the minimum, bare minimum necessities for maintaining this body while in the material world because my main business will be simply to engage in Krishna consciousness. For such people, there is no need of any such business division to be made because they don't have that for dividing like this but for those who are having excess wealth than what is minimum necessary there is a a way of dividing the wealth into three parts what is that 50% for service of Krishna 25% for the family members

and 25% for personal necessities now Prabhupada says why 50% for the service of the Lord spending 50% of the service of the Lord or for propagation of spiritual knowledge in society by way of the Sankirtan Yagna is the maximum display of human mercy this is actually a necessity for the human beings in the human society why because people of the world meaning the human being population of human beings are generally in darkness regarding spiritual knowledge especially in regard to the devotional service of the Lord and therefore to propagate the systematic transcendental knowledge of devotional service is the greatest mercy that one can show in this world there's a need especially in Kali Yuga people are in ignorance darkness of ignorance so they do not know when they do not know how to utilize their excess wealth then what is bare minimum required then default will be use it for sense gratification people become sinful and dharma is destroyed then everything is spoiled the human mission is completely lost whereas if 50% of the excess wealth is spent for propagating Sankirtan Yajna then it is the best use of the available excess wealth and also it is the maximum display of mercy on the human society so nobody will go astray from the path of Dharma everybody will utilize this human form of life for its real purpose and everybody will be able to go back to Godhead get out of this material existence so that no more there is any repetition of birth and death I'll stop

In this session, we will be discussing the last three verses of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, namely 43, 44, and 45.

### Naimisharanya, Suta Goswami, Romaharshana Suta, Sacrifice

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The prolonged sacrificial ceremonies undertaken by the sages of Naimisharanya were begun shortly after the demise of Maharaj Pariksit."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the context of the verses, discussing the sacrifice at Naimisharanya, the role of Suta Goswami, and the timing of the events in relation to Maharaj Pariksit's reign.

So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The prolonged sacrificial ceremonies undertaken by the sages of Naimisharanya were begun shortly after the demise of Maharaj Pariksit." You see, there is a very important point: the discussion that is going on, which is being narrated here between Suta Goswami and the sages of Naimisharanya, that they began a thousand year sacrifice towards the end of Dwapar Yuga and beginning of Kali Yuga, that period of time. So, when did it happen? "The prolonged ceremonies undertaken by the sages of Naimisharanya were begun shortly after the demise of Maharaj Pariksit," after the demise of Maharaj Pariksit. So, the question will arise, why is Suta Goswami speaking in the present tense in this verse? He is telling, "Maharaj Pariksit is now ruling the world with great success." Why is he talking in the present tense? So, that will be explained by Srila Prabhupada. "The sacrifice was to continue for one thousand years. And it is understood that in the beginning, some of the contemporaries of Baladev, the elder brother of Lord Krishna, also visited the sacrificial place." There is a description in the Bhagavatam elsewhere that this thousand year sacrifice was begun by the father of Suta Goswami. And this Suta Goswami referred to in the beginning of this Bhagavatam, who is answering the questions by the Sayyiduna Misharanya, is called Ugrashrava Suta. But this thousand year sacrifice was begun by the Sayyiduna Misharanya under the guidance of Ugrashrava Suta's father, whose name was Romaharshana Suta.

**Key Quote:** "So, he was reciting the Puranas when Lord Balaram visited the place, and Romaharshana Suta did not show proper respect to Balaram."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Romaharshana Suta's disrespect towards Lord Balaram and the subsequent punishment.

So, Romaharshana Suta was actually, he was reciting the Puranas, because he was the disciple of Vyasa Deva, who was expert in the Puranic literature, the fifth Veda, Puranic literature. So, he was reciting the Puranas when Lord Balaram visited the place, and Romaharshana Suta did not show proper respect to Balaram. And therefore, Balaram actually wanted to teach a lesson to this Romaharshana Suta. And therefore, Balaram actually... Balaram actually took a blade of grass and he just touched it to the throat of Romaharshana Suta. Immediately, Romaharshana Suta, he died on the spot. That means, he was punished for his act of not showing respect to Lord Balaram, who is a supreme personality, if you call it.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Romaharshana Suta's pride and his mistaken belief in his superiority over Lord Balaram due to his brahminical status.

Lord Balaram 줄 جansenp record esteems physical potentialITY Quindi Balaramat cero een tr CD 이렇게 kTehnik divine arti Bharata hai. But he thought himself superior to Lord Balaram, because he was a Brahmana, he was a learned Personality. And he thought Balaram is a Ksatriya. Beau Balaram was playing the role of a Ksatriya. He was playing a position of the Ksatriya, but when Balaram came, everyone in the Assembly stood up, but when Balaram came, everyone in the assembly stood up, respect him all the great saintly persons all the qualified brahmanas everyone stood up and this Roma Arjuna Sutta thought I don't have the stand-up I don't have to show respect so this was a great mistake on the part of Roma Arjuna Sutta he had become proud of his position that seat of respect that was offered to him by the sage Rana Misharanya he became very proud and he did not show proper respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshipable and to be shown respect by everyone in the entire creation the Supreme Lord is worshipped even by Brahma and Shiva the topmost personalities in this entire creation whole universe so who is Roma Arjuna Sutta in comparison with Brahma Shiva and all the great Rajarishis Brahmarshis and Devarishis in front of them Roma Arjuna Sutta is an insignificant person so this insignificant person is puffed up proud that he did not show proper respect to Balaram the Supreme Personality of Godhead

### Purification, Ugrashrava Suta, Sacrifice, Present Tense

**Key Quote:** "And Balaram actually purified him Balaram delivered him of his sinful tendency of his sinful behavior and then Roma Arjuna Sutta's son Ugrasava Sutta was actually instructed by Balaram to take over the father's position in order to continue the sacrifice"
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Balaram purified Romaharshana Suta and instructed his son, Ugrashrava Suta, to continue the sacrifice, then addresses the question of why the present tense is used in the verse.

So this was certainly to be corrected, and Balaram actually purified him. Balaram delivered him of his sinful tendency, of his sinful behavior, and then Roma Arjuna Sutta's son, Ugrasava Sutta, was actually instructed by Balaram to take over the father's position in order to continue the sacrifice and continue to recite the Puranas to the assembled sages of Naimisharanya. So, why is the present tense used? Prabhupada explains here, "According to some authorities, the present tense is also used to indicate the nearest margin of time from the past." What does this mean? In that sense, the present tense is applied to the reign of Maharaj Pariksit here for a continuous fact. Also, present tense can be used. That means the sacrifice was begun when Maharaj Pariksit was ruling, but the sacrifice continued beyond Pariksit's life.

**Key Quote:** "Another reason why present tense is used is the principles of Maharaj Pariksit can still be continued and human society can still be improved if there is determination by the authorities."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain the use of the present tense, connecting it to the enduring principles of Maharaj Pariksit's administration and his efforts to control Kali.

time it continued. So, the sacrifices are continuing. It began when Pariksit was ruling, or even before Pariksit began to rule, and it continues. So, therefore, the present tense has been used. Also, another reason why present tense is used is the principles of Maharaj P surpassed the темперatr can still be continued and human society can still be improved if there is determination by the authorities. We can still purge out from the state all activities of immorality introduced by the personality of Kali if we are determined to take action like Maharaj Pariksit. So, Pariksit's example is being explained. He allotted some place for Kali, but in fact, Kali could not find such places in the world at all because Maharaj Pariksit was strictly vigilant to see that there were no places for gambling, drinking, prostitution, and animal slaughter.

**Key Quote:** "Modern administrators want to banish corruption from the state, but fools are the ones who want to banish corruption from the state, but fools are the ones who want to banish corruption from the state, but fools as they are, they do not know how to do it."
**Summary:** The speaker criticizes modern administrators for their ineffective attempts to combat corruption, highlighting their contradictory policies that promote sinful activities.

Modern administrators want to banish corruption from the state, but fools are the ones who want to banish corruption from the state, but fools as they are, they do not know how to do it. They want to issue licenses for gambling houses, wine and other intoxicating drug houses, brothels, hotel, prostitution, and cinema houses and falsity in every dealing even in their own, and they want at the same time to drive out corruption from the state. So, why present-day so much of all this corruption and increase in sinful activities? That is because the modern administrators, they do not know how to eradicate corruption. Simply for some economic consideration, they see that if love, friendship, and friendship are there, then it is the right thing to do. But to make such an argument for the sake of people's trust, they don't consider it right or wrong. They consider it right for the sake of the public. Because they think that if you are going to do something, then you are going to be treated rudely and they don't consider you a money-maker. If you are going actually bringing in Kali Purusha, the evil influence of Kali into the human society and

### Corruption, God Consciousness, Dharma, Austerity, Cleanliness, Mercy, Truthfulness

**Key Quote:** "Prabhupada says you cannot drive out corruption simply by some vigilance department or some anti-corruption ministry etc. By legislation you cannot drive out alone."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that corruption cannot be eradicated through legislation alone, but requires a society based on the principles of Dharma: austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness.

there is large scale increase of sinful activities. People become completely corrupted. So, Prabhupada says you cannot drive out corruption simply by some vigilance department or some anti-corruption ministry etc. By legislation you cannot drive out alone. Legislation alone is not going to work. You cannot issue licenses for intoxicants, being sold widely at the same time try to drive out corruption. No. So, Prabhupada says this is like they want the kingdom of God without God consciousness. God consciousness means no sinful activities against the principles of Dharma. No sinful activity should be allowed. How can it be done? It is not possible. It is not possible. It is not possible. It is not possible. How can it be possible to adjust to contradictory matters? If we want to drive out corruption from the state, we must first of all organize society to accept the principles of religion namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. And to make the conditions favorable for these four pillars of Dharma, we must close all places of gambling, drinking, prostitution and falsity.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Pariksit, the son of Abhimanyu, is so experienced that by dint of his expert administration, he has been able to do so many things. He has been able to do so many things. He has been able to do so many things. He has been able to do so many things. He has been able to do so many things. and patronage, it has been possible for you to perform a sacrifice such as this."
**Summary:** The speaker reads and explains verse 45, highlighting Maharaj Pariksit's expert administration and its role in enabling the sages to perform the sacrifice, and concludes the session.

These are some of the practical lessons from the pages of Srimad Bhagavatam. So, the 45th verse is a short verse. I will just read that. Ittham bhutanubhavoyam abhimanyo suto nripah yasya palayatakshonim yuyam satraya dikshitaha. Maharaj Pariksit, the son of Abhimanyu, is so experienced that by dint of his expert administration and patronage, it has been possible for you to perform a sacrifice such as this. So, Suta Goswami is telling, Pariksit's administration is perfect, was perfect. Now, it's in the past tense because the Bhagavatam recitation began after Pariksit's, this second time Bhagavatam recitation began after Pariksit's, this second time began after Pariksit's, this second time the first time it was recited when Pariksit was cursed that we explained in the next chapter in more detail so the Suta Goswami ro sorry uh Ugrashrava Suta heard this Bhagavatam from Shukadeva Goswami when Pariksit heard and now he's reciting this Bhagavatam the way he heard it in the past and therefore Ugrashrava Suta speaking is that this sacrifice thousand year sacrifice was begun when Pariksit Maharaj is ruling and it has been possible to perform this sacrifice because of the wonderful administration of Maharaj Pariksit so I'll stop here thank you
