**Key Quote:** "Krishna has not sent us here. We have come here."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that we come to the material world due to our desire to enjoy independently of Krishna and to lord over others.

Here in classes we used to learn that if we follow regulative principles, we will go back to Krishna and never come back. But we all come from Krishna only. Why did Krishna send us here? Krishna has not sent us here. We have come here. Why have we come here? Two reasons. One is our desire to enjoy independent of Krishna. The second desire we have is to lord over everyone and everything.

**Key Quote:** "Here everyone is trying to be the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the spiritual world, where Krishna is the undisputed Lord, with the material world, where everyone seeks to be a lord in their own domain, influenced by their karma.

In the spiritual world our pleasure, our enjoyment, our happiness is always in association with Krishna. And in the spiritual world everyone is subordinate to Krishna. Krishna is the only Lord. Ekala, Ishvara, Krishna are Sabha, Vrithya. That's a reality. That's a fact in the spiritual world. But somebody thinks why should Krishna be the Lord? Why I can't be the Lord? Or why I can't take Krishna's position? Then for such people the material world is created by Krishna. Here everyone is trying to be the Lord. And according to our karma, we have different lordship positions. From Brahma up to the most insignificant ant, everyone is Lord in their own field. In Hindi there is a saying, Har kutta apna gali mein share. Of course that's told in a lighter way. I don't mean that, but what I'm saying is everyone wants to be the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "Even Brahma doesn't have the power to lord over everyone like Krishna lords over."
**Summary:** The speaker uses Brahma as an example of someone with significant power in the material world, but who is still subject to the laws of material nature and not truly independent.

So according to their karma, they can lord over some people. Brahma has got the power, authority over the entire universe. But even this universe is one insignificant universe among millions of universes. So even Brahma doesn't have the power to lord over everyone like Krishna lords over. Krishna is the Lord. But in his own sphere Brahma thinks I am the Lord. I am the Lord of everyone. His purview is this entire universe which consists of millions of planets. Each planet has millions of living beings. Yes, Brahma is in a very, very, very, very big position. But still Brahma also, even though he is the Lord, he is also subject to the laws of material nature. He is not a free person. If he makes a mistake, he is accountable for the mistake. He is punished. He is punishable.

**Key Quote:** "Brahma has got a fantastic long life span. The longest life span anybody can ever have."
**Summary:** The speaker details the immense lifespan of Brahma, emphasizing that even he is subject to time and death, and uses the analogy of a 50-year-old person to illustrate Brahma's perspective.

And even Brahma has to die one day. Brahma has got a fantastic long life span. The longest life span anybody can ever have. The duration of the whole universe, universal time. Brahma's life span is this kind in Bhagavad Gita: Sahasra yuga pariyantam har yad brahmano idhu. One thousand yuga cycles. Mahayuga. Satya, Treta, Dwapara, Kali. Four yugas rotating cyclically. One such cycle of yugas passing is called Mahayuga. And thousand Mahayugas. One thousand Mahayugas is twelve hours of Brahma's time scale. So Brahma lives hundred years like that. We calculate Brahma's life span is 311 trillion years according to our calculation. 311 trillion years. But even that long life span, Brahma thinks I have only hundred years to live. And Brahma's already 50 years is over. 50 years of Brahma is over. Half his life span is over. It is like how would a 50 year old person feel in this material world? Half my life span is over approximately. Say we live about hundred years. So half our life span is over, no? When I am 50 years old. Correct? That's why Brahma thinks.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Actually we are spirit soul. We are no death."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that we are eternal spirit souls, but our identification with the body leads to illusion and the experience of material existence, influenced by the three gunas.

Each person thinks about his or her life according to the body they are having. Actually we are spirit soul. We are no death. There is nothing like life span for the spirit soul. They are eternal beings. But why do we think in terms of body? That's called material existence. That's called illusion. So we come here not because Krishna sends us here. We come here because we wanted to lord over everyone and everything. So we are given this material world. And we wanted to independently enjoy. So that independent enjoyment is only in the material world. And also under illusion. There is no independence. We are strictly under the stringent laws of the material nature. We are under the three gunas. These three gunas are influencing us. Every action. Sattva guna, raja guna, tamma guna. Combination of that is influencing each one of us.

**Key Quote:** "We are completely under control. But we think we are free."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that we are under the control of the three gunas, despite thinking we are independent, and that all material bodies, including Brahma's, are subject to death.

So we are under the stringent control of these three gunas. But we think we are independent. Because the gunas influence is not perceived by us. Nobody perceives the influence of the gunas. Nobody perceives. Except devotees, pure devotees who know what these gunas are. And they can recognize the gunas. Nobody knows what these gunas are. So we are completely under control. But we think we are free. We are independent. And we think we are going to live eternally in this body. But the fact is we are eternal, but not in this body. Any body that anybody inhabits, including Brahma, that body has got a limited duration of life span. So they have to die. They have to die.

## AAQ: Is it offensive to consider Shiva as a demigod? | HH Stoka Krishna Swami
**Speaker:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami

### hierarchy of Devas, Shiva's position

**Key Quote:** "So now if we consider Shiva as a demigod, Devata, subordinate to Vishnu or Krishna, will it become an offence? No."
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the question of whether considering Shiva as subordinate to Vishnu or Krishna is offensive, stating that it is not.

Does portraying Lord Krishna the Supreme alter the essence of Hinduism? Because during my childhood, grandparents used to say, Lord Shiva is the Deva of all Devas, therefore his name is Mahadeva. So now if we consider Shiva as a demigod, Devata, subordinate to Vishnu or Krishna, will it become an offense? No.

### hierarchy of Devas, Brahma, Shiva, Chiraloka Pala

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "But greater than Brahma is Shiva because Shiva is not a Jeeva."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the hierarchy among Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, highlighting their roles as permanent governors and emphasizing Shiva's superiority over Brahma because Shiva is not a Jeeva (living entity).

When Shiva is described as Mahadeva or the Deva of all Devas, you should understand that there is a hierarchy among Devas. Among all the Devas, four personalities have that special position. First one is Brahma. Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are called Chiraloka Pala. They are the permanent governors of this universe. That means their position does not change throughout the duration of the whole universe. All other personalities who are holding positions of power, all other Devatas, their duration is of a limited time. Maximum is one Manvantara, 71 Mahayugas, that's it. After that they have to quit their position. Whereas Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, throughout the duration of the whole universe, they don't change their position. Among the three, Brahma is actually a Jeeva, a living entity. But Brahma is immune to all the changes that take place in the universe during the life span of Brahma himself. So he is unaffected by anything that happens. But greater than Brahma is Shiva because Shiva is not a Jeeva. Shiva is not a living entity. Brahma has to die. Shiva has no death. Shiva doesn't have a material body. That's why he doesn't have to die. Death means what? Quitting the material body is called death. Soul has no death. None of us have death. So even Brahma doesn't have death as soul. But when you say Brahma also has to die means he has to leave his body as Brahma. That Brahma's body. He has to leave that. He has to quit that. But Shiva, he doesn't have a material body. He never accepts a material body.

### Shiva's transcendental birth, Shiva not a Jeeva, Comparison to Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So Shiva's birth is like Krishna's birth."
**Summary:** The speaker compares Shiva's birth to Krishna's, describing both as transcendental, and reiterates that Shiva is not a Jeeva, unlike Brahma and other Devatas.

So Shiva's birth is like Krishna's birth. Krishna is born as a son of Vasudeva and Devaki. But Krishna's birth is transcendental. Shiva's birth also is transcendental in this material world. He comes to this material world for the purpose of doing his, playing his part in this whole material arrangement. He is the lord of destruction. He is the husband of Durga Devi. He is the master of the Tamoguna. Director of Tamoguna. Like that. He has got many many positions. Many many powers. Many many responsibilities. But he is one person who doesn't have a material body. Okay. And Shiva in that position as Shiva he is always superior to Brahma and all the other people below Brahma. Among the Devatas, Brahma is the topmost. But Shiva is above Brahma. Because Shiva is not at all a Jeeva. All the other Devatas are Jeevas. But Brahma is also a Jeeva. But Shiva is not a Jeeva.

### Vishnu's superiority, Limited power of Shiva, Unlimited power of Vishnu

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Vishnu never comes in contact with material energy."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Vishnu is superior to Shiva because Vishnu never comes into contact with material energy, and emphasizes that only Vishnu possesses unlimited power among the Devatas.

Now Vishnu is above Shiva. Because Shiva, even though he doesn't have a material body, he comes in contact with material energy. Vishnu, like Shiva, he does not accept a material body. So he has also no death. He doesn't want to quit any body. But Vishnu never comes in contact with material life. He never comes in contact with material energy. He never touches material energy. So Vishnu is superior even to Shiva. There is one difference between Vishnu and Shiva. Another difference is Shiva's power is limited. Though it is much much greater than Brahma's power. Brahma's power is more than all other Devata's power. Every Devata has got gradation of power. So everybody in this material world except for Vishnu, everyone's power is limited. Though the different extent of powers they have, limited. But Vishnu has unlimited power. Only Vishnu has unlimited power. Among the Devata's, only Vishnu has unlimited power.

**Key Quote:** "She is the energy through which this material world is created, maintained and destroyed."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces Durga Devi as Vishnu Maya, the energy through which the material world is created, maintained, and destroyed, and mentions that the Devi Purana describes her glories.

What about Durga Devi? Durga Devi is not a Jeeva. She is not a living entity. She is not even in the category of Devata's. She is not in the category of Devata's. She is the personal energy of Krishna or Vishnu. She is called Vishnu Maya. Vishnu Maya. She is the energy through which this material world is created, maintained and destroyed. So in the Devi Purana it is described Durga Devi's glories are described. She is the maintainer. She is the creator. She is the destroyer of the entire material universe. She is greater than even Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Brahma only creates. Vishnu only maintains. Shiva only destroys. She is the creator, maintainer and destroyer of entire universe. She is greater than Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.

**Key Quote:** "Durga is not independent in creating, maintaining and destroying. She is always subordinate to Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that Durga Devi acts as an agency executing Krishna's will through Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, who direct creation, maintenance, and destruction, respectively.

But what people don't understand is She is definitely the creator, maintainer and destroyer of this material world. But she is the agency through which according to Krishna's will, creation, maintenance and destruction takes place. She is the agency. And that agency works for creating, maintaining and destroying according to the will of Krishna. Krishna's will is executed by three personalities called Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Brahma creates according to the will of Krishna through the agency of Durga. Vishnu maintains according to the will of Krishna. Krishna means he himself. According to his own will. Vishnu maintains according to his own will through the agency of Durga. And Shiva destroys according to the will of Krishna through the agency of Durga. So Durga is not independent in creating, maintaining and destroying. She is always subordinate to Krishna. She simply carries out Krishna's will. But the exact direction for doing it comes through Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. So Brahma directs the creation. Vishnu directs the maintenance. Shiva directs the destruction. They are directors. They are directors of Durga

### Three Gunas, Material Nature, Subtle Elements
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/Irt9Qww7vZ4?t=510
**Verse References:** BG 14, BG 7
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Energy is manifest as the three gunas."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the three gunas (Satva, Rajas, Tamas) as the energy of material nature, contrasting them with the eight material elements (five gross and three subtle) described in the Bhagavad Gita.

is present in the form of these three gunas. In the Bhagavad Gita, in the 14th chapter, Krishna describes. No. The verse would describe the three gunas. Satvam rajasthama iti guna praktisambhavaha. Material nature consists of three gunas. In the 7th chapter, Krishna describes material nature consists of eight elements. Eight elements. Ashta dhatu. Bhumirapo nalo vayu kham mano buddhi revaca ahankara. Eight elements. These eight elements are inert matter. But where is material energy? Where is energy? Energy is manifest as the three gunas. Satvam rajasthama iti guna praktisambhavaha. This is the confidential knowledge revealed by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. Generally people who are conversant with little something about the Vedic scriptures, they know all material things are made of pancha bhuta. Five elements. Most people know about this. Our body also. Pancha bhuta. Earth, water, fire, air, sky. Correct? But many people don't know there are three other elements which are called subtle elements. Sukshma. They are subtle elements. Mind, intelligence, ego. These are three subtle elements. They are making up our subtle body. We got a gross body made up of all these organs and senses and all the parts of the body, everything. But there is inside one subtle body. Mind, intelligence and ego. Subtle body. But those are also three elements of matter only. They are also matter. There is no life in mind, intelligence, ego. Real life is coming from the soul. What about then these three gunas? These three gunas is what prakriti is made of. Which is the energy called material energy. Energy means some force is there. That force is actually making all the changes to happen in this material creation.

### Force of the Gunas, Control by Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Krishna's will, Body bound by Gunas

**Key Quote:** "Those gunas are directed by Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva according to the will of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how the three gunas drive changes in the material creation, directed by Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva according to Krishna's will, and how the body, influenced by the gunas, binds living entities to the material world.

Just like you sow a seed. It grows up into a big tree. How those changes are taking place? Seasons are changing. Planets are rotating in the orbit. Okay. Whatever changes happening in our body, in the outside world, any changes that are happening, that's the force of the gunas. Those gunas are directed by Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva according to the will of Krishna. So Krishna is the topmost personality. Simply as to will, let there be creation. Brahma will do the necessary execution of that will through Durga Devi. Through the Rajoguna. Rajoguna of Durga Devi. Satyoguna is used by Vishnu for maintenance. Through Satyoguna, maintenance happens. And Tamoguna is used for destruction by Shiva. Through Tamoguna, agency of Tamoguna, Shiva destroys. He is the director of Tamoguna. Director of destruction. Vishnu is the director of Satyoguna. He is the director of maintenance. Like that. So, Durga's position is she is nothing to do with actually anything in this material world except she is simply facilitating creation, maintenance, destruction. She keeps all the living entities bound up in the material world. Through the Gunas. We are bound up by the Gunas. That is through the Gunas this body is actually working. And this body is tying us down to this material world.

### Body as limitation, Control of Maya/Durga, Durga as jail superintendent, Krishna as controller

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Durga Devi is not independent in controlling anybody. She controls exactly according to the laws. Those laws are laws of God."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a jail superintendent (Durga Devi) enforcing the laws of a higher authority (Krishna) to illustrate how Durga Devi controls the material world according to Krishna's laws, emphasizing that Krishna is the ultimate controller.

Because the body we cannot do whatever we want to do. The body is limiting us. Just like a bird has got a body to fly, it can fly. We don't have a body to fly, we cannot fly. In this body I can't fly. I require the help of an aeroplane to fly. But a bird can just fly. Right? So, everybody is bound up by the body. That body is an effect of the interaction of the three Gunas. Anyway, this is a very big subject. So, basically we are all actually under the control of Maya or Durga through this body. Everybody has got a body. Including Brahma. Brahma has got a body also. So, Brahma is also under the control of Durga Devi. How? Through his body. Anybody who has got a material body is under control. But Durga Devi is not independent in controlling anybody. She controls exactly according to the laws. Those laws are laws of God. Laws of Krishna. Called laws of Karma. Krishna is the controller. The real controller is Krishna. Not Durga. Durga on behalf of Krishna is like the jail superintendent. Is keeping all the prisoners inside the prison. Controlling the prison. But under higher authority. They say authority, state authority. Who should be imprisoned? Who should be released? When they should be released? What should be the conditions in the prison? Rigorous imprisonment. Somebody's simple imprisonment. All that is regulated by the higher authority. But the jail superintendent even though the most powerful person in the jail. But still is carrying out simply the orders of the higher authority. Enforcing the higher authority's orders. That is Durga Devi's position. She is the jail superintendent of this jail called the material world.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "So whatever be the relationship that is later, first of all, we have to cleanse our heart."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that everyone has a relationship with Krishna, but to understand it, one must cleanse their heart through chanting Hare Krishna, leading to a loving relationship that can manifest in various forms like friendship, servitude, or familial affection.

Yeah, scriptures explain that all of us have a relationship with Krishna. Sit down. All of us have a relationship with Krishna, but before we understand our relationship with Krishna, we have to cleanse our heart of so many dirty things that are there which are making us forget Krishna. We have to cleanse our heart. So, for cleansing, the best process is chanting Hare Krishna. You chant Hare Krishna, you cleanse your heart. Then, after cleansing the heart, you will understand who is Krishna, who you are, and then the relationship also, you will understand. So that relationship is based on love. So, similarly, friendship with Krishna, you can have friendly relation with Krishna, you can serve Krishna as a servant. You can serve Krishna as one's own son, like mother Yashoda, Devaki, Vasudeva. They are all serving Krishna as their son, or Krishna can be served as one's beloved.

## Daily Evening Bhagavatam Discourse | HH Stoka Krishna Swami | Rath Yatra | 01-07-2022
**Speaker:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami

### Lord Jagannath, Indra Dhyumna, Neelamadhava, Darubrahman
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/dOA9Bi8lmlo?t=51
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "On top of Neela hill, you should construct a temple. There I will manifest as Darubrahman. The absolute truth manifested in a wooden form."
**Summary:** The story begins with King Indra Dhyumna's desire to see Lord Vishnu, the discovery of Neelamadhava, and the eventual instruction to build a temple where the Lord would manifest as Darubrahman.

Today is the day of the Rathayatra of Lord Jagannath, Baldev, and Subhadra. The story of Lord Jagannath is given in the Skanda Purana. I will try to narrate that story very briefly. There was a king by the name Indra Dhyumna, who was a great devotee of Vishnu. Indra Dhyumna became very eager to meet Lord Vishnu face to face. Once a Brahmana came to the palace of King Indra Dhyumna and told him about an incarnation of Lord Vishnu named Neelamadhava. The king then sent different brahmanas out to search for the deity of Lord Neelamadhava. They all returned unsuccessful except for one priest by name Vidyapati. Vidyapati travelled for a long time, after which he came to an area inhabited by non-Aryans called Shabaras. He stayed at the house of a local chief whose name was Vishwavasu. When he arrived, Vishwavasu was not there, but Vishwavasu's daughter Lalitha was at home. Vidyapati stayed there for some time, and eventually married Lalitha, the daughter of the Shabara chief, Vishwavasu. Vidyapati noticed some peculiar behavior of his host. Vishwavasu would go out every day around noon and would return to the house scented with fragrance of sandalwood, camphor, and musk. Vidyapati asked his wife about this and she informed him that her father went to worship him. Lalitha had been told by her father not to tell anyone about Neelamadhava, but that was in advance of her order. She was to be told by her father. Lalitha else had to announced any decision. By this, Linda had been pinched from mud Meela made clear her duty to his husband. विद्यापती रिपीटेडली रिक्वेस्टेड तो सी नीलमाधवा। फाइनली विश्वावसु ललितास फादर बाउन्ड विद्यापतीस आईस आन्ड टुक हिम तो सी नीलमाधवा। विद्यापती सीक्रत्ली कैरिट सम्मस्टर्ड सीट्स इन इस क्लॉथ आणि ड्रॉप्ट देम अन्द पाथ आज ही वस वाकिंग। वाल ही रीच्ट नीलमाधवा द ब्लाइंटफोल्ड वस रिमोव्ड आणि विद्यापती सो नीलमाधवा। Vishwavasu went out to collect some forest flowers to worship Neelamadhava, and Vidyapati stayed near the Deity. During this time, a crow fell off the branch of a tree into a nearby lake and drowned. It immediately took a four-armed Vaikuntha form and started back to the spiritual world. Vidyapati then climbed up onto the tree and was about to jump into the lake. A voice from the sky said, "Since you have seen Neelamadhava, you should inform King Indra." Vishwavasu returned and started his daily worship of Neelamadhava. Suddenly the Lord spoke to him and said, "I have accepted many days the simple forest flowers and roots offered to me by you. Now I desire the royal worship offered to me in devotion by King Indra Dhyumna." Vishwavasu felt cheated by his son-in-law. Therefore, he bound him up and kept him in his house. After repeatedly being requested by his daughter, he let him go. The Brahmana, with these words, said, "The Brahmana, Vidyapati, then went to King Indra Dhyumna and told him about his discovery. By following the mustard seeds which had grown into small plants, they were able to follow the path to Neelamadhava. When they reached the spot, they could not find him. King Indra Dhyumna had the village besieged and arrested Vishwavasu. Suddenly a voice from the sky told, "Release the Shabara. On top of Neela hill, you should construct a temple. There I will manifest as Darubrahman, the absolute truth manifested in a wooden form."

### Temple construction, King Indra Dhyumna, Lord Brahma, Sri Kshetra

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Lord Brahma told him that Sri Kshetra is manifested by the Supreme Lord's internal potency and that the Supreme Lord manifests Himself."
**Summary:** King Indra Dhyumna builds the temple, travels to Brahmaloka to invite Lord Brahma to consecrate it, and faces a dispute over the temple's construction before Brahma establishes the importance of Sri Kshetra.

You will not see me as Neelamadhava. King Indra Dhyumna constructed a temple. He wanted Lord Brahma to consecrate the temple, so he travelled to Brahmaloka and waited there for him. During this time, the temple became covered by sand. While Indra Dhyumna was gone, first Suradeva and then Galamadhava became king of the area. King Galamadhava uncovered the temple from the sand. Shortly afterwards, King Indra Dhyumna returned from Brahma's abode. Indra Dhyumna claimed that he had built the temple, and Galamadhava also claimed the same thing. There was an old crow in the nearby banyan tree who was constantly singing the glories of Lord Rama. The crow had seen the construction of the temple and said that Indra Dhyumna had built the temple and that Gala Madhava had just uncovered it. Because he had not told the truth, Gala Madhava was ordered by Brahma to live outside the temple compound on the western side of Indra Dhyumna Sarovara lake. Indra Dhyumna then asked Lord Brahma to consecrate the temple and the surrounding area which was called Sri Kshetra. He gave the highest type of liberation. Lord Brahma told him that Sri Kshetra is manifested by the Supreme Lord's internal potency and that the Supreme Lord manifests Himself. Therefore, he could not install the Lord here. Lord Jagannath and his abode are eternally situated in the material world. He said he would install the flag on the temple that anyone who sees this flag and offers prostrated obeisances would easily be liberated.

**Key Quote:** "Lord Jagannath came to him in a dream and told him that I shall come floating from the sea in my wooden form as Daru Brahman."
**Summary:** King Indra Dhyumna's frustration leads to a dream where Lord Jagannath promises to appear as Daru Brahman, leading to the discovery of the wood and the involvement of Vishwavasu and the establishment of Narasimha Deva.

After a while, King Indra Dhyumna became a monk. King Indra Dhyumna became frustrated with not seeing Neela Madhava. He decided to lay on a bed of Kusha grass and to fast until death. Lord Jagannath came to him in a dream and told him that, "I shall come floating from the sea in my wooden form as Daru Brahman." The king went to the seashore and saw a huge piece of wood which had the marks of a conch, club, disk, and lotus on it. Many men and elephants tried to move Daru Brahman, but they could not move him. That night, Lord Jagannath spoke to Indra Dhyumna in a dream and told him to bring Vishwavasu who used to serve Neela Madhava and bring a golden chariot in front of Daru Brahman. The king did this and Daru Brahman easily was placed on the chariot. Lord Brahma then performed a sacrifice and established a deity of Narasimha Deva on the raised platform of the sacrificial arena. It is said that the deity of Narasimha in the present temple compound that is on the western side of the Mukti Mandapa is the original Narasimha deity. King Indra Dhyumna had the best sculptors come to carve the deity of Lord Jagannath from Daru Brahman. As soon as they started, their chisels broke to pieces. Vishwakarma, the architect of the demigods, assumed a form of an old brahmana and came to Indra Dhyumna. He offered to carve the deities

**Summary:** Vishwakarma appears as an old brahmana to carve the deities, but the king opens the doors prematurely, revealing the unfinished forms, which Lord Jagannath explains as part of his pastime, establishing the roles of different lineages in his service.

behind closed doors for 21 days. The old sculptor then took Daru Brahman into the temple and the doors were closed. After 14 days passed, the king could not hear any sounds of the artist's tools and he became fully anxious. The king then personally opened the door of the temple by force. The king did not see the sculptor, but instead he saw the three forms of Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Lord Balarama. Their fingers and toes were unfinished. Thinking himself a great offender, the king decided to give up his life. He then laid on a bed of kushagras and began to fast. Lord Jagannath appeared to him in a dream. Lord Jagannath told the king, "I am eternally situated here in Nilachala in the form of Lord Jagannath as Daru Brahman. I have no material hands and feet, but with my transcendental senses I accept all the items offered by my devotees. The fact that you broke your promise is a part of the pastime for me to manifest in the form of Jagannath. Those devotees whose eyes are smeared with the salve of love will always see me as Shamasundara holding a flute." The king then prayed to Lord Jagannath that those in the family of the sculptor who manifested his form will continue to assist in constructing the three karts, the three rathas. He also told the king that the descendants of Vishwavasu who served him as Neelamadhava should generation after generation serve the Lord. They shall be called Daitas. The descendants of Vidyavati born from his brahmana wife should perform the deity worship. The descendants born from his shabara wife Lalitha should cook the Lord's food. King Indrajumna then requested Lord Jagannath that the doors of the temple should be closed only three hours a day. The king also requested that he would not have any descendants so that no one in the future would claim the temple of Lord Jagannath as their own property. This is the story

of the appearance of Lord Jagannath. Now there is also a description of Jagannath being the ecstatic form of Lord Krishna himself. Once during a solar eclipse Krishna, Balaram, Subhadra, and other residents of Dwarka went to bathe in a holy pond at Kurukshetra. Knowing that Krishna would be there Srimati Radharani, Krishna's parents Nanda Nishoda, and other residents of Vrindavan who were burning in the fire of separation from the Lord went to meet him. Inside one of the many tents the pilgrims had set up at Kurukshetra Rohini, Lord Balaram's mother, narrated Krishna's Vrindavan pastimes to the queens of Dwarka and other Dwarka Nivasis. The residents of Dwarka are said to be in the mood of opulence or Aishwarya and they worship Krishna as the Supreme Lord. But the residents of Vrindavan are in the mood of sweetness, Madhurya and they have a confidential relationship with Krishna that surpasses awe and reverence because it is based on friendship and love. Rohini's narration was thus extremely confidential so she posted Subhadra at the door to prevent anyone from entering. Krishna and Balaram came to the door and stood on Subhadra's left and right sides. While listening to Rohini's narration of Krishna's intimate Vrindavan pastimes Krishna and Balaram became ecstatic and their internal feelings were exhibited externally. Their eyes became dilated. Their limbs became retracted. Seeing these transformations in Krishna and Balaram Subhadra also became ecstatic and assumed a similar form. Thus, by hearing about Krishna's pastimes in Vrindavan Krishna and Balaram with Subhadra in between displayed their ecstatic forms of Jagannath, Baladeva, and Subhadra.

**Summary:** Narada's prayer leads to Krishna's appearance as Jagannath in Jagannath Puri, emphasizing the Lord's role as Patitapavana and the potential for liberation through seeing the deity.

When the sage Narada saw Krishna transformed as Jagannath he prayed to the Lord to appear like this again. Although the Lord is not obliged to anyone he reciprocates with his devotees to fulfil their desires. Thus, just as Krishna appeared as Neela Madhava to satisfy Vishwavasu he appeared in the Deity form as Jagannath and resides in Jagannath Puri to satisfy the desire of Narada Muni. This special form of Krishna is also known as Patitapavana, the saviour of the fallen, and anyone who takes his audience with proper consciousness is awarded spiritual liberation. It is said in the Narada Purana in that great abode known as Purushottam Kshetra which is rarely achieved among all the three worlds the Keshava Deity who was fashioned by the Supreme Lord himself is situated. If men simply see that Deity

they are easily able to go to the Lord's abode. There is also a narration in the Krishna book about the origin of Jagannath Rathayatra. Once upon a time while Lord Krishna and Balarama were living peacefully in their great city of Dwaraka there was the rare occasion of a full solar eclipse such as takes place at the end of every Kalpa or day of Brahma. By astronomical calculation people were informed about this great eclipse prior to its taking place. Therefore everyone both men and women decided to assemble at the holy place in Kurukshetra known as Samantapanjaka. After arriving in Kurukshetra the members of the Yadu dynasty took their baths ceremoniously with self-control as enjoined in the Shastras and they observed fasting for the whole period of the eclipse in order to nullify the reactions of their sinful activities. The ceremonial functions performed by the members of the Yadu dynasty externally resemble the ritualistic ceremonies performed by the Karmis. When a Karmi performs some ritualistic ceremonies ambition is self-gratification, good position, good wife, good house, good children, or good wealth. But the ambition of the members of the Yadu dynasty was different. Their ambition was to offer Krishna perpetual devotion with faith.

**Key Quote:** "As soon as Krishna became visible to them they took him inside their hearts through their eyes and embraced him to their full satisfaction."
**Summary:** The arrival of Nanda Maharaj and the residents of Vrindavan, especially the gopis, at Kurukshetra is described, highlighting the gopis' intense love for Krishna and the ecstasy they experience upon seeing him after a long separation.

All the members of the Yadu dynasty were great devotees of Krishna. When Nanda Maharaj and other residents of Vrindavan had heard that Krishna would be present in Kurukshetra because of the solar eclipse and that all the members of the Yadu dynasty would also be there they had immediately prepared to go there. King Nanda accompanied by his cowherd men had loaded all their necessary paraphernalia and bullock carts and all of their Vrindavan residents had come to Kurukshetra to see their beloved sons Lord Balaram and Lord Krishna. When the cowherd men of Vrindavan arrived in Kurukshetra all the Yadu dynasty members were most pleased. As soon as they saw the residents of Vrindavan they stood up to welcome them and appeared to have regained their life. All the Yadus and Vrindavan residents had been very eager to meet each other and when they actually came forward and met they embraced one another to their heart's satisfaction and remained in embrace for a considerable time. As far as the gopis of Vrindavan were concerned from the very beginning of their lives they did not know anything beyond Krishna. Krishna and Balaram were their life and soul. The gopis were so attached to Krishna that they could not even tolerate not seeing him momentarily when their eyelids blinked and impeded their vision. They condemned Brahma the creator of the body because he foolishly made eyelids which blinked and checked their seeing Krishna. Because they had been separated from Krishna for so many years the gopis having come along with Nanda Maharaj and Mother Yashoda felt intense ecstasy upon seeing Krishna. No one can imagine how eager the gopis were to see Krishna again. As soon as Krishna became visible to them they took him inside their hearts through their eyes and embraced him to their full satisfaction. Even though they were embracing Krishna only mentally they became so ecstatic and overwhelmed with joy that for the time being

they completely forgot themselves. The ecstatic trance they achieved simply by mentally embracing Krishna is impossible to achieve even for great yogis constantly engaged in meditation on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Krishna could understand that the gopis were wrapped in ecstasy by embracing him in their minds and therefore since he is present in everyone's heart he reciprocated the embracing from within. Krishna was sitting with Mother Yashoda and his other mothers Devaki and Rohini but when the mothers engaged in talking he took the opportunity and went to a secluded place to meet the gopis. As soon as he approached the gopis the Lord smiled and after embracing them and inquiring about their welfare he began to encourage them saying, "My dear friends you know that Lord Balaram and I left Rundhavan just to please our relatives and family members. Thus we were long engaged in fighting with our enemies and were obliged to forget you who were so much attached to me in love and affection. I can understand that I have been ungrateful to you but still I know that you are faithful to me. May I inquire if you have been thinking of us although we had to leave you behind? My dear gopis do you not dislike remembering me considering me to have been ungrateful to you? Do you take my misbehavior with you very seriously? Fortunately you have developed loving affection for me which is the only way to achieve the transcendental position of association with me." Lord Krishna concluded by saying, "Unalloyed devotional service and affection for me are the cause of supreme liberation."

**Summary:** The gopis express their desire for Krishna to remain in their hearts, highlighting their preference for the Vrindavan atmosphere, and the lecture connects this to Lord Chaitanya's Rathayatra festival as a means of bringing Krishna back to Vrindavan.

The gopis responded to Krishna by saying, "My dear Krishna we therefore request that you remain within our hearts as the rising sun that will be your greatest benediction." The gopis are always liberated souls because they are always in Krishna consciousness. They only pretended to be entangled in the household affairs in Vrindavan. Because of their separation from Krishna he might have asked them to return with him to Dwarka but the inhabitants of Vrindavan the gopis were not interested in the idea of going with Krishna to Dwarka. They wanted to remain in Vrindavan and thus feel the presence of Krishna in every step of their lives. This transcendental emotional existence of the gopis is the basic principle of Lord Chaitanya's teachings. The Rathayatra festival observed by Lord Chaitanya is the emotional process of taking Krishna back to Vrindavan. Srimati Radharani refused to go with Krishna to Dwarka to enjoy his company in the atmosphere of royal opulence for she wanted to enjoy his company in the original Vrindavan atmosphere. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

### Yudhishthira's rule, religious principles, ideal king

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Primarily because Yudhishthira was a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The lecture begins with an introduction to the tenth chapter of the first canto, focusing on Yudhishthira's rule and his adherence to religious principles as an ideal king.

In this session we will be discussing from the first verse of the tenth chapter of the first canto. This is a new chapter. The chapter is entitled Departure of Lord Krishna for Dwaraka. The first verse. The meaning of this first verse is as follows: Shravana Kamuni asked, "After killing his enemies who desire to usurp his rightful inheritance, how did the greatest of all religious men, Maharaj Yudhishthira, assisted by his brothers, rule his subjects? Surely he could not freely enjoy his kingdom with unrestricted consciousness." The previous chapter described that Yudhishthira Maharaj executed the royal power after assuming the throne of Hastinapura, becoming the emperor of the world. He ruled strictly according to the codes and religious principles given in the Dharma Shastra, approved by his uncle Dhritarashtra, and confirmed by Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So now the question is being raised by Savanaka Rishi: How did he rule his subjects, assisted by his brothers? So in the Mahabharata there is an elaborate description, and briefly it is described in this chapter, how Yudhishthira was the ideal king.

**Key Quote:** "Ultimately it is the Supreme Lord who is the maintainer of everyone in the material world and the spiritual world."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Krishna's role as the maintainer of the universe and how scarcity arises from mismanagement rather than a lack of resources provided by Krishna.

Primarily because Yudhishthira was a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord. The very conception is that the king is the representative of the Supreme Lord. Ultimately it is the Supreme Lord who is the maintainer of everyone in the material world and the spiritual world. So when Krishna is the maintainer, nobody should have any scarcity because Krishna is unlimitedly opulent, and he provides for everyone. But in human society there is scarcity sometimes only because of mismanagement. Misuse, abuse, these are the reasons why there is apparently some scarcity.

**Key Quote:** "So therefore, Krishna provides in plenty."
**Summary:** The speaker uses examples of a mango tree and a jackfruit tree to illustrate how Krishna provides abundantly in nature.

Otherwise, by the arrangement of the Supreme Lord, there is plenty, there is plenty. It is like you consider a small seed of any particular fruit. Now you sow that seed, you get a huge tree, and that tree keeps on giving fruits for several decades. I know of a mango tree near our temple in Mysore, where the gentleman whose house that tree is presently standing, he says it gives 20,000 mangoes in the season. And that tree, mango tree, one mango tree was planted by his great-grandfather, as he has heard from his parents and grandparents. So this is Krishna's creation. A jackfruit tree, the jackfruit itself is so big. One jackfruit, even one family cannot eat. And a jackfruit tree gives so many fruits in the season. So we have known, people who have jackfruit tree, who are not commercially minded, they give away jackfruits to temples, to neighbors, to relatives, and still they are not able to exhaust. How much can a person eat? We have limited capacity to eat. So therefore, Krishna provides in plenty. Krishna provides in plenty.

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Krishna provides in plenty."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of the Food Corporation of India to further illustrate the abundance provided by Krishna, while also highlighting how mismanagement can lead to perceived scarcity.

Another example I can give, practical example, the Food Corporation of India is meant to store food grains for preventing any famine or any calamity, that there will be no food grains. The stored food grains will be released by the government. Now the godowns of the Food Corporation of India are over-flooded with grains. So much so that, there was a report in the newspaper, the wagons, the railway wagons which bring the food grains after the harvest, after the government procures from the farmers, the wagons bring to the godowns of the Food Corporation of India, and because the godowns are full, the wagons are not emptied. And the wagons are lying in the yard, railway yard, and the grains are getting spoiled, because there is no place to store them. So if this is the quantity of food grains that is there in stock, and everywhere the shops are selling grains, there are plenty of grains. There are plenty of grains. So, there is no scarcity, because Krishna is providing everybody. But then, due to sinful activities, due to mismanagement, due to abuse, misuse of the natural resources,

**Key Quote:** "Yudhishthira is one who strictly follows all the religious principles."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes Yudhishthira's strict adherence to religious principles and contrasts his divine nature with Duryodhana's demoniac nature.

sometimes there is scarcity. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj, he was perfectly ruling according to, strictly according to religious principles. Now, here, one word is used, dharma-bhritam-varishthah. He is one of those who strictly follow religious principles. He is the greatest among them. Yudhishthira Maharaj. And when he was ruling, then there is no question of any scarcity, any difficulty, any problem for the people. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "Maharaj Yudhishthira was the greatest of all men of religion. Thus, he was not at all inclined to fight with his cousins for the sake of enjoying the kingdom." This is a very important point. Yudhishthira never wanted to fight with his cousins for the sake of, with Duryodhana and party, for the sake of enjoying the kingdom. Then why did he fight at all in the battle of Kurukshetra? He fought for the right cause because the kingdom of Hastinapura was his rightful inheritance, and his cousins wanted to usurp it for themselves. See, the clear contrast between Yudhishthira and Duryodhana. Yudhishthira is one who strictly follows all the religious principles. Duryodhana is demoniac minded, demoniac nature.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna clearly says the difference between divine nature and demoniac nature."
**Summary:** The speaker references the Bhagavad Gita to explain the difference between divine and demoniac natures, highlighting that Yudhishthira fought for justice under Krishna's guidance.

So, in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna clearly says the difference between divine nature and demoniac nature. He says, Krishna says, divine nature, people, they follow the injunctions of the scriptures and the spiritual authorities. This is divine nature. And those of demoniac or asuric nature, they do not follow the regulated principles as laid down in the scriptures, but they act according to their own whimsical, physical mind. This is the clear distinction between divine nature and demoniac nature. So, Duryodhana was demoniac nature and Yudhishthira was divine nature. So, because Yudhishthira was divine nature, he strictly followed all the regulations of the scriptures. So, therefore, there was no scarcity at all. It will be described in the later verses how the citizens under the rule of Yudhishthira Maharaj enjoyed everything in plenty. So, the fight on the battlefield of Kurukshetra between the Pandavas and Kauravas was justified on the basis of Yudhishthira because Yudhishthira fought for the sake of justice, and Yudhishthira fought for the right cause

under the guidance of Lord Krishna. He fought under the guidance of Lord Krishna. In fact, Yudhishthira Maharaj tried to negotiate things for peace. But Duryodhana would not give even five villages for the five brothers, Pandava brothers, which was a rightful claim. The whole kingdom was a rightful claim. But when the Pandavas reduced their request to five villages to avoid the war, the battle, but Duryodhana would not give. So, obstinacy of Duryodhana. He was, Duryodhana was overconfident. Oh, we are going to win the battle. We are very powerful. He was making all sorts of material calculations. Foolish Duryodhana never understood Krishna is on the side of the Pandavas because Pandavas are devotees. And Duryodhana being demoniac-natured, he will never understand what is Krishna's plan. And everything goes according to Krishna's plan. Nothing goes according to anybody else's wishes or plans. No. Everything goes on according to the plan of Krishna. So, it is the plan of Krishna that the demoniac-natured Duryodhana and his party should be completely vanquished, and the thoroughly righteous religious principled Yudhishthira should be enthroned as the emperor of the world. This was Krishna's plan, and this was to be executed.

**Summary:** The lecture concludes by highlighting the guaranteed victory of the Pandavas due to Krishna's presence and emphasizing Yudhishthira's sense of responsibility even after winning the battle.

So, it was all arranged by Krishna. Therefore, the Pandavas were guaranteed victory actually, even before the battle started. As I mentioned earlier also, the last verse of the Bhagavad Gita in the 18th chapter says, Yatra Yogeshwara Krishna Yatra Partho Dhanurdharaha Tatra Shri Vijayobhutir Dhruvanitir Matirmama. Even before the battle begins, Sanjaya predicts that victory belongs to the Pandavas because Krishna and Arjuna are on the side of the Pandavas. So, therefore, here it is explained Yudhishthira Maharaj he won the battle but he could not enjoy the results of victory he could not enjoy the results of victory with unrestricted consciousness. That's what is mentioned here. Saunaka Rishi is telling, "Surely he could not enjoy freely his kingdom with unrestricted consciousness." He was always conscious of his responsibility and duty. As was explained in the previous chapter, the duty of the king is to care for the citizens for their spiritual upliftment. So, how did he rule? Saunaka Rishi wanted to know how did he rule? He wanted to hear the glories of the rule of King Yudhishthira, and that will be explained in the next few verses. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "The living being's constitutional position is one of serving a superior."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport on the living being's constitutional position as a servant, forced to serve the illusory energy in pursuit of sense gratification.

Satsangana Muktadussangohatum Notsahate Budhaha This verse further explains the feeling of separation especially the Pandavas felt when Krishna left Hastinapura and returned to Dwaraka. The Pandavas were very, very intimately associated with Krishna. So the general principle is first explained and then the specific feeling of the Pandavas is explained because they were intimately connected with Krishna. So Srila Prabhupada explains this point how somebody is attached to Krishna then what is the position of such a person. The living being's constitutional position is one of serving a superior. This is the purport Srila Prabhupada is writing. The living being's constitutional position is one of serving a superior. He is obliged to serve by force the dictates of illusory energy in different phases of sense gratification. What is our life in this world? It is one of sense gratification. We are always seeking satisfaction of our senses. Now in doing so we are forced by the illusory energy to serve maya. We are forced by maya to serve maya. That we don't realize. That we don't understand because of the influence of illusion only. So therefore the statement by Prabhupada in the beginning of the purport is that it is our constitutional position. The way we are made.

**Key Quote:** "And there is no hope of release from such bondage generally."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the futility of trying to satisfy the senses, emphasizing how this pursuit leads to entanglement in the laws of karma and material bondage.

We have to serve a superior. We cannot be master. We are always servant. Nobody likes to hear this. Nobody wants to be a servant. Everyone wants to be master. But our position is we are servant. And if we don't agree to render service we are forced to render service by the illusory energy. But the real fact of the matter is that the conditioned soul, the ordinary living beings in this world are never tired in serving their senses. Because they are running after sense enjoyment. to become tired of serving the senses even if somebody may feel tired serving their own senses the illusory energy perpetually forces him to do so without being satisfied now these are some of the very important truths that Prabhupada is revealing in this purport please hear very attentively and think about this contemplate on this that the Maya's force is so powerful that there is no respite for us we to keep on serving our senses with the false hope that this particular act of serving the senses is a false hope that this particular act of serving the senses will satisfy me but the reality is I never get satisfied on the other hand my the senses demand more and more and more and more and foolishly a person may go on trying and trying and trying to satisfy the senses it never happens now as a result of this attempt at satisfying the senses the conditioned soul becomes entangled you understand what is entanglement material bondage we have bound up completely bound up through the stringent laws of karma we will be bound through the laws of karma And there is no hope of release from such bondage generally.

**Key Quote:** "Only way such an entangled soul can get release from this entanglement or bondage is by association with pure devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that association with pure devotees awakens transcendental consciousness, allowing one to understand their true position as a servant of Krishna rather than the perverted senses.

Now the only way such an entangled soul can get release from this entanglement or bondage is by association with pure devotees. Only way. What happens when somebody is in the association of pure devotees? As it is said here, By association with pure devotees, one is gradually promoted to transcendental consciousness, spiritual consciousness, Krishna consciousness. Thus, when a person comes to the spiritual consciousness, Then, such a person can understand that his eternal position is to render service to Krishna, and not render service to the perverted senses. These senses of ours are actually not our real senses. Our real senses are within. These senses are a covering for the real senses, the spiritual senses. So, these material senses which are covering our spiritual senses, they demand satisfaction, and foolishly, we go on trying to satisfy. But, we don't realize, except when we come in touch with pure devotees, and our transcendental consciousness is awakened, and then we are able to understand, I am simply serving lust, anger, greed, enviousness. All these material desires, I am simply serving them. Kama, krodha, loba, moha, madha, vatsarya. We are simply servant of all these different perverted desires.

**Key Quote:** "Material society, friendship, and love are all different phases of lust. Kama, lust, is the greatest enemy of the soul, of every conditioned soul."
**Summary:** The speaker identifies lust as the greatest enemy and explains how material attachments lead to threefold miseries, emphasizing that hearing Krishna Katha in the association of devotees can diminish material desires.

Simply serving them. So, Prabhupada explains further, Material society, friendship, and love are all different phases of lust. Kama, lust, is the greatest enemy of the soul, of every conditioned soul. The greatest enemy is lust, kama. Viddhi, enam, iya, vairinam. In the Bhagavad Gita, third chapter, it is described by Krishna. It is the greatest enemy of all of us, who are in this material world. It is lust. And, it is further explained, Home, country, family, society, wealth, all are causes of bondage in the material world. And, the concomitant factors of such bondage is the three-fold miseries of life. Tapatraya. Three kinds of miseries. Miseries due to our own body and mind, miseries due to other living beings, and miseries due to forces of nature. We have to keep on suffering. Different miseries at different times, due to the bondage. Now, if somebody is associated with pure devotees, and hears Krishna Katha submissively, then the attachment for material enjoyment becomes slackened. That which is a burning desire in the heart, that burning desire begins to get extinguished.

**Summary:** The speaker describes how attraction to Krishna increases through association with devotees and hearing Krishna Katha, leading to progress in Krishna consciousness and highlighting the Pandavas' intense feelings of separation from Krishna.

When you are associated with pure devotees, and hear Krishna Katha from them. Then, gradually, the attraction for hearing more and more about Krishna, that increases, it increases and becomes prominent. Now, as the attraction for Krishna increases, one keeps on making progress more and more in Krishna consciousness. And, the attraction keeps on increasing more and more. Now, it is said here that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Hari, is so transcendentally attractive, that even those who are self-satisfied by self-realization, even those who are liberated completely from all material bondage, they also, become devotees of Lord Hari. This is the power of attraction. Supreme Lord Hari, is attractive to everyone, including liberated souls, and those who are self-satisfied due to self-realization. Everyone is attracted to Krishna. That is the power of Krishna. So, under these circumstances, we can easily understand, the Pandavas who were constant companions of Krishna, how they would have felt when Krishna left Hastinapura and went to Dwaraka. So, we can't imagine, the kind of feeling of separation felt by the Pandavas especially,

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the power of attachment to Krishna, describing how pure devotees can forget material attachments through remembrance of Krishna and highlighting Krishna's special affection for His devotees.

when Krishna left for Dwaraka. But, Prabhupada concludes by telling that, because of continuous personal contact, the Pandavas were feeling intense separation when Krishna left. We can't imagine how much separation they would have felt. Now, the nature of the attachment for Krishna, which the pure devotees have, is described as so very attractive. Krishna is so very attractive for pure devotees, that simply the remembrance of Krishna's name, form, or qualities, or pastimes, or paraphernalia, simply remembering that, makes the devotee, completely forget about all other material forms, material names, material qualities, material activities. Everything material, completely is forgotten by the devotee. So, mukta dusanga, a pure devotee is always free from the contaminating association of the material world. Even though the devotee may be the material world. So, it is always possible, by developing that attraction for Krishna, and, awakening that intimate attachment, that simply remembering Krishna is enough, to, again experience that same feeling, especially in the physical absence of Krishna. This is very important. I'll stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna. Only the devotees can play the part of the Lord's relatives, and the Lord is always absolute. He is not particularly partial to His relatives, and He is neglectful about other people, indifferent to other people. No. He is always equal to everybody, but His devotees, He has got some special affection. So, I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "But that is not the case with attachment to Krishna, attraction for Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the superficial and temporary nature of material feelings with the eternal and spiritual nature of attachment to Krishna, highlighting how material suffering fades with time while love for Krishna is everlasting.

What happened to all those? Those who were attached to Krishna when Krishna left Hastinapura. That is being described here. They felt so much of separation. They were constantly looking at Krishna without blinking their eyes, constantly staring at him. And they don't know what to do, how to even continue their normal activities in the absence of Krishna. So, within the core of their heart they were feeling that, we are going to miss Krishna. It's not a superficial feeling. Unlike material feelings, it's all superficial. Because we know, our experience says in this material world, however much somebody will be afflicted by some pain, or suffering, they can be pacified. Or they tend to forget that in course of time. Sometimes they say time is the best healer of some pain of suffering or loss or bereavement, somebody suffers. With time they forget that. But that is not the case with attachment to Krishna, attraction for Krishna.

That we have to understand. Attraction or attachment for Krishna is an eternal thing. It is a spiritual feeling, spiritual attraction. It is not material. Krishna is not a material personality. Krishna is not having any material relationship with anyone. It's only spiritual relationship, spiritual attraction. So, therefore it is different. And the purport Srila Prabhupada explains, Krishna is naturally attractive for all living beings because he is the chief eternal amongst all eternals. He is the chief. Krishna is the chief among all the eternal conscious beings, living beings. Krishna is the chief, the topmost and the supreme. He alone is the maintainer of the many eternals.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that submissively hearing the Bhagavatam from pure devotees awakens one's eternal relationship with Krishna.

Please, hear carefully. There were hundreds of ladies in the palace of Hastinapura. All of them were affectionate to Krishna. How did they become affectionate to Krishna? All of them were relatives also. When they saw Krishna was going away from the palace for his native place, they were very anxious for him. And, as usual, tears began to roll down their cheeks because there was so much attraction. So, they were very anxious for Krishna. They had so much affection for him, Krishna. They thought at the same time that tears at the time of Krishna's departure might be a cause of misfortune for Krishna. Therefore, they wanted to check them. But that was very difficult for them because the tears could not be checked.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the descriptions of love for Krishna with material relationships, emphasizing the temporary, superficial, and conditional nature of material attachments, which ultimately bewilder the soul.

Now, it is explained here that because it was difficult to stop their tears from flowing from their eyes, so they simply smeared their tears in their eyes and their hearts were throbbing with that intense feeling of separation from Krishna. Now, these descriptions are significant because we can compare this with the kind of material relationships and attachments we have in this world, which is completely temporary. It is superficial. It is conditional. It will exist only as long as the body exists. And it is bewildering for the soul. All such material relationships are just bewilderment for the soul, for the conditioned soul. So, there is no real value for that attachment or that relationship or some feelings. There is no value. These material feelings, material relationships, material attachments, no value other than simply make us bewildered, that's all. Entangle us in this material world.

**Key Quote:** "Whereas, Krishna is a transcendental personality. He is the transcendental personality."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Krishna's transcendental nature and the eternal relationship we have with Him, explaining that even those who didn't have direct contact with Krishna developed intense affection through hearing and discussing His qualities and activities.

Whereas, Krishna is a transcendental personality. He is the transcendental personality. We are all spiritual beings. We have an eternal relationship with him. And in that eternal relationship, we are intimately attached and connected very intensely with Krishna. Now, Prabhupada says, the ladies who were the wives and daughters-in-law of those who died in the battlefield never came in direct contact with Krishna. That was the culture those days. Women, they don't directly contact men except their own husband or their father like that, other than them. Other men, they will not directly contact. So, how is it that without direct contact with Krishna, they had so much of attachment for Krishna? How is it possible? That is explained here by Srila Prabhupada. All of them heard of Krishna and his great activities. And thus, they thought of him. They talked about him. They discussed about his name, fame, qualities, activities, past times, etc. And in that way, they developed affection for him. Like the people who are in direct contact with Krishna. To the same degree, they developed intense feeling of love for Krishna. Just like those who are in direct touch with Krishna developed that feeling.

So, it is said here. Therefore, directly or indirectly, anyone who thinks of Krishna, anyone who talks about Krishna, anyone who worships Krishna becomes attached to Krishna. This is a fact. So, don't practice bhakti as some mechanical thing, as some mechanical activity. Just like when we chant Hare Krishna on a daily basis. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Don't do it so mechanically. It comes in the way of our progress in developing, re-establishing our relationship with Krishna. It comes in the way. So, Krishna is absolute. There is no difference between his name, form, quality, past times, etc. No difference. That's the meaning of absolute. So, therefore, simply by hearing about Krishna, simply by talking of Krishna, about Krishna, simply by reading about Krishna in the Bhagavatam, simply by thinking of Krishna, simply by remembering his past times, we can revive our relationship of Krishna. Our relationship with Krishna is revived that way. It's a very, very powerful technique. And the best method that is recommended in this age.

### description of Krishna's departure, royal customs, shyness of women

**Key Quote:** "Shyness is a particular extra-natural beauty of the fair sex, and it commands respect from the opposite sex."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Krishna's departure from Hastinapura, the royal send-off he received, and introduces the concept of shyness as a virtue in women, setting the stage for Prabhupada's explanation.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 15th verse of the 10th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. वीना पणव गोमुखाह धुन्धुरी आनक घंटाध्या नेदुर धुन्धुभयस्तथा. The meaning of this verse is, while the Lord was departing from the palace of Hastinapura, different types of drums like the mridanga, dhol, nagra, dhundhuri and dhundubhi, and flutes of different types, the veena, gomukha, and bheri, all sounded together to show him honour. So, as the title of the chapter suggests, this is the description of the departure of Lord Krishna for Dwaraka from Hastinapura. So, when the Lord was departing from the palace of Hastinapura, he was given a very nice send-off. So, it is a royal custom in the palace that all these wonderful instruments are played like a band to show him honour. He is the supreme Lord. Not only that, he was visiting as a guest of Yudhishthira Maharaj. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj was seeing off the Lord, Lord Krishna. He was very pleased to arrange this band for showing the honour to Krishna. The next verse, 16th verse. So, the meaning of this 16th verse. Out of a loving desire to see the Lord, the royal ladies of the Kurus got up on top of the palace, and smiling with affection and shyness, they showered flowers upon the Lord. So, Krishna was seen off by all the residents of the palace, and the other citizens also, when he was leaving Hastinapura to return to Dwaraka. So, particularly mention is made here in this verse of the royal ladies of the palace of Hastinapura. They got up on top of the palace, because in those days there was no free mixing of men and women. A very highly cultured society was present then. And these ladies, to see the Lord, they went on top of the palace, and from there, while smiling with affection and shyness, these ladies showered flowers upon the Lord. So, this particular quality of the ladies, shyness, particularly this shyness, is explained by Prabhupada very nicely in the purport. So, let us hear Prabhupada. What does he say about the shyness?

### shyness of women, Vedic culture, respect, material vs. spiritual beauty

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "A sweeper woman commanded the respect of many respectable gentlemen simply by manifesting a lady's shyness."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Prabhupada's explanation of shyness as a natural beauty in women that commands respect, contrasting it with the lack of respect for immodesty, and emphasizing the historical presence of this cultural value in India.

Prabhupada says, "Shyness is a particular extra-natural beauty of the fair sex, and it commands respect from the opposite sex." Women naturally have got this shyness, and it is a quality that deserves to be respected by the men. So, it is said here by Srila Prabhupada further, "This custom was observed even during the days of the Mahabharata." It is more than 5000 years ago. "Only the less intelligent persons not well-versed in the history of the world say that observance of separation of female from male is an introduction of the Mohammedan period in India." This is not correct. That the separation of female from males, some people say that it is an introduction of the Mughal or Mohammedan period in India. That is not correct. As is evident from this record in the Srimad Bhagavatam and the Mahabharata, it is very clear that even in the days 5000 years back, there was this separation of the men and women. There was no free mixing. And it is a very important point to be noted. So, Srila Prabhupada says, "This incident from the Mahabharata period proves definitely that the ladies of the palace observed strict parda, restricted association with men. And instead of coming down in the open air where Lord Krishna and others were assembled, the ladies of the palace went up on top of the palace and from there paid their respects to Lord Krishna by showers of flowers." So, they showed their respect. They maintained the distance. At the same time, the respect that was being given was very evident by their action, showering flowers upon the Lord. It is definitely stated here in this verse that the ladies were smiling there on the top of the palace, checked by shyness. Both are mentioned. Prema vrida smitekshanaha. Now, prema is out of affection and love. Vrida is glancing with shyness. So, Prabhupada particularly comments about this shyness, that this shyness is a gift of nature to the fair sex, and it enhances their beauty and prestige, even if they are of a less important family, or even if they are less attractive. It's a very important point. Women generally are more attractive than men, but in case, in some instances, women are not so attractive, but still shyness enhances their beauty, and even their prestige. So, this, Srila Prabhupada explains further, "We have practical experience of this fact." And what is that experience that Prabhupada is narrating here? "A sweeper woman commanded the respect of many respectable gentlemen simply by manifesting a lady's shyness." Prabhupada is talking of his times, say about 80 years back. The sweeper woman, who is not very, not a high class lady, but still, because of her shyness, she was commanding the respect of even big gentlemen in the society. On the other hand, Prabhupada comments, "Half naked ladies in the street do not command any respect, but a shy sweeper's wife commands respect from all." So, shyness is such an important quality for a woman.

### illusion, material vs. spiritual beauty, detachment, Vedic wisdom

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The real beauty is within and the real beauty belongs to the soul, not to the body."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that material beauty is an illusion, as the body is made of temporary elements, and that true beauty lies within the spirit soul, urging listeners to not be attracted by false, external beauty.

And it is very, very important. Human civilization as conceived of by the sages of India is to help one free himself from the clutches of illusion. Everyone here in this material world, men, women of whichever class, whichever standard, are all in the clutches of maya, illusion, as conditioned souls. But, the sages are instructing us to lead a particular lifestyle to become free from these clutches of the illusory energy. The material beauty of a woman is an illusion because actually the body is made of earth, water, fire, air, etc. But because there is association of the living spark with matter, this material body appears to be beautiful. Kindly note this carefully, that a woman appears attractive only because the material body is actually in contact with the living spark, the life due to the spirit soul within the body. And Prabhupada gives an example to illustrate this. No one is attracted by an earthen doll even if it is the most perfectly prepared doll to attract the attention of others. You have seen mannequins in stores which sell, let's say, some garments. They dress up a doll of a woman very nicely. Now, everyone knows this doll is actually lifeless and nobody is attracted to such a doll. So, therefore, the dead body has no beauty because no one will accept the dead body of a so-called beautiful woman. Therefore, the conclusion is that the spirit spark is beautiful and because of the soul's beauty, one is attracted by the beauty of the outward body. So, the real beauty is within and the real beauty belongs to the soul, not to the body. Therefore, the lesson to be learnt is the Vedic wisdom forbids us to be attracted by false beauty. Don't be attracted by material beauty. Don't be attracted by external beauty.

### restricted mixing of men and women, maya, shyness, ephemeral beauty, spiritual progress

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The sages of the Vedic civilization, they say that the woman is considered to be like fire and the man is considered to be butter."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the Vedic restriction on mixing of men and women to avoid being trapped by illusion, highlighting shyness as a natural check on unrestricted mixing, and reminding listeners that bodily beauty is fleeting and not the true essence of attraction.

The real beauty is within. But because we are now in the darkness of ignorance, the Vedic civilization allows very restricted mixing of men and women. This restriction is necessary so that we don't become trapped by maya. This is a trap for both men and women. It's not only for men. It's for both. So, the sages of the Vedic civilization, they say that the woman is considered to be like fire and the man is considered to be butter. Butter must melt in the association of fire. Therefore, they may be brought together only when it is necessary. Men and women are brought together only when absolutely essential. And shyness is a check to the unrestricted mixing. A woman's shyness stops this unrestricted mixing of men and women and thereby saves people from becoming trapped by the illusory presentation of maya as something external, as beautiful and attractive. The real beauty is inside, within, of the spirit, not of the body. So, don't be attracted by bodily beauty. And we all know this bodily beauty is highly flickering. It is very, very short-lived. Like somebody, even if however beautiful they are, when they don't take bath, they are not dressed very nicely, neatly, or they are completely fatigued, or they become old, they have wrinkles, or they get injury on their face, then where is the beauty? Beauty is all gone. So, this is ephemeral beauty. This is not real beauty. And to not get trapped by this ephemeral beauty or false beauty, there is restriction in mixing of men and women. And also, this restriction is automatically there when women utilize the characteristic quality of theirs called shyness, and by which the restricted, unrestricted mixing is prevented, and thereby, we don't become trapped by maya. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the use of natural gifts in the past with the mass production of artificial goods in modern industrial society.

So Krishna is leaving the palace of Hastinapura. He is proceeding to Dwaraka. So many different residents of the palace and other citizens have come to see off Krishna. So Arjuna, the intimate friend of Krishna, he is seeing off Krishna. How is he seeing off? He is described here as the great warrior and conqueror of sleep, Gudakeshah, and I would say they have had such a marriage with Krishna, which is why others have written and are grateful here. So this is also about the life of Krishna. And then he says here, were used in the luxurious royal ceremonies. In those days, of course, they are all nature's gifts and are produced by the hills, oceans, etc., by the order of the Lord. When man does not waste his valuable time in producing unwanted things in the name of necessities, is a contrast between the civilization that was prevailing 5000 years back and nowadays. In the name of necessity, so many unwanted things are produced in factories, mass produced, and people are busy improving upon this mass production, artificial things, not exactly nature's gift. So contrast this, the nature's gifts that were utilized about 5000 years back, and what we are producing in the name of advancement of civilization. So Prabhupada says, by so-called development of industrial enterprises, they are now using parts of, describe it in a different way, they don't use metal in manufacturing, they are using some metal like brass, copper, copper, copper in the past, they were called Doch

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the decline in the quality of materials used in everyday life and the rise of slums as a consequence of modern civilization.

as like copper copper copper copper copper copper copper copperita but for不過 instead of metals like gold, silver, brass and copper some material, plastic like material, gatta parcha. Of course, this is not so commonly understood nowadays, but during Prabhupada's time, it is said gatta parcha they used to use because that is cheaper and it is accessible to more people. So, all the metal wear has vanished or gradually vanishing or affordable only by rich people. Now, they don't even have brass and copper vessels. Forget about silver and gold. And nowadays, they have just some stainless steel which is iron, and that also is becoming expensive and they have instead all kinds of plastic wear, exactly what Prabhupada is telling here, which are worthless. And Prabhupada also says they are using margarine instead of purified butter. Nobody can afford pure butter or pure ghee which is not even easily available because only the adulterated substitutes are available. That is what is described as margarine. And they even say that pure ghee does not have trans fat. I was reading in one of the descriptions in encyclopedia that margarine has trans fat. Purified ghee has no trans fat. So, purified ghee, pure ghee is a healthy alternative to margarine. So, they can neither afford pure ghee nor is margarine the substitute for ghee very healthy. So, this is the civilization we are living in now and Prabhupada also says one-fourth of the city population has no shelter. This is what they call advancement of civilization. What have they done? They have displaced people from the city. They have displaced people from peacefully living in villages in prosperity to cities and in cities when they come seeking a job or trying to find some employment in factories or all kinds of horrible places then they don't have proper shelter. They don't have shelter. They stay in slums. The slum phenomena is typical of so called advanced civilization. The slum phenomena is typical of so called advanced civilization in modern cities. The slum phenomena is typical of so called advanced civilization in modern cities.

### Village Life, Quality of Life, Modern Cities, Degradation

**Key Quote:** "People should learn to live by nature's gifts."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the simple, healthy life in villages with the congested and degraded quality of life in modern cities, emphasizing the importance of fresh food and natural resources.

In the former times there was no slums at all. Doesn't mean there were no poor people. Poor people used to live in villages in nice cottages built with whatever wood and other leaves, etc. was available very easily. And they would live in a farm as laborers. Plenty of open space, fresh air, nice water. They grow grains and they eat first class food. Even the poorest man. For that matter if you can go to Vrindavan even today. You see those poor people staying in some cottages in the outskirts of the towns and in the villages. and in the villages they prepare always fresh food, they never eat stale food, they prepare fresh food. Even the poorest person will have little wheat flour which they will mix and make a dough and nicely bake a roti, hot fresh roti. The housewife will prepare and serve hot hot to her husband, the poor husband. The poorest of the poor also eat hot chapatis nicely made on fire and they would have also prepared some simple subji. Subji is plenty available. Whatever they can grow or whatever they can purchase for. I heard there used to be vegetables available in season 10 paisa a kilo. I'm telling this about 20 years back. Even today in Vrindavan in the season time vegetables are just one to one rupee a kilo, that's all. The vegetables which are grown in season, off season they are expensive, but nobody eats off season. The traditional people don't eat off season vegetables, they eat only seasonal vegetables which is good for the health and also available in plenty. It grows very easily, the soil is very fertile in Vrindavan. So this is the gift of nature, not eating some artificial things like margarine, cooking in some plastic ware and without a proper shelter in the city or living in congested spaces like birds nest. So many of these so-called high-rise skyscraper buildings people live in very, very, very congested space. So it is, it is the quality of life has degraded. This cannot be denied and this is the reason why we are living in the middle of the world. These are the

**Key Quote:** "The basic principle of economic development is centered on land and cows."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Prabhupada's view that economic development should be based on land and cows, emphasizing the importance of regulated rainfall and pleasing Krishna for a prosperous life.

This is what Srila Prabhupada is pointing out. People should learn to live by nature's gifts. And how is it that the nature's gifts are becoming so very scarce? So, Prabhupada explains elsewhere, the basic principle of economic development is centered on land and cows. The necessities of human society are food grains, fruits, milk, minerals, clothing, wood, etc. And these are supplied. How are these supplied? Prabhupada explains during the regime of Maharaja Yudhishthira, all over the world there were regulated rainfalls. Very, very important point. Rainfalls are not in the control of human beings. They are regulated by the heavenly king Indradeva, and he is a servant of the supreme lord Krishna. So, when the king and the citizens obey the supreme lord Krishna, then under the king's administration, there will be regulated rainfalls all over the planet earth. And these rains are the causes of varieties of production on the land. Plenty of grains, plenty of vegetables, plenty of fruits. Not only do regulated rains help ample production of grains and fruits, but when they combine with astronomical influences, there is ample production of valuable stones and jewels and pearls. See, this is also dependent on nature. You cannot manufacture valuable stones, precious stones like diamond and rubies and pearls. You cannot manufacture that. That is produced by nature under certain favorable conditions. And that is explained here by Prabhupada. Regulated rainfall combined with astronomical influences result in production of, ample production of valuable stones and pearls. So, if there is enough milk, enough grains, enough fruits, enough cotton, enough silk, people can lead a happy and healthy and prosperous life peacefully and actually cultivate Krishna consciousness.

**Key Quote:** "But nature will produce plenty when we please the Supreme Lord by engaging in devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by advocating a return to nature, dependence on natural produce, and engaging in devotional service to please Krishna, leading to a harmonious and prosperous life.

Rather than work like donkeys for getting some very little artificial produce by paying huge amounts of money, which doesn't anyway have value. What kind of civilization is this? So, Prabhupada is suggesting that we return to land and cows and lead a Krishna conscious life. So, then there will be plenty of supply by the order of the Supreme Lord by material nature. We cannot order nature to produce, but nature will produce because nature is controlled by Krishna. And nature will produce plenty when we please the Supreme Lord by engaging in devotional service and living a harmonious life in harmony with nature. Not exploiting nature, killing poor animals, poisoning the soil by putting all kinds of chemicals into the soil. No, that's not the way. So, human beings should actually depend on the production of material nature by following Dharma and by shifting from dependence on factories and artificial production, Anartha, to natural produce of land and crops and cows and regulated rainfall and plenty of all these supplies by nature under the order of the Supreme Lord. So, this is the advice we get from Srila Prabhupada in this particular purport. So, I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "when Krishna was leaving the palace of Hastinapura there were brahmanas who were glorifying Krishna by chanting Vedic hymns and offering benediction to Krishna"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 19th verse of the 10th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on the apparent contradiction of offering benedictions to Krishna, who is the Absolute.

In this session, we will be discussing the 19th verse of the 10th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Ashu yantashisha satyah tatra tatra dvijeritah na anuroopa anuroopascha nirgunasya gunatmanah. The meaning of this verse is: It was being heard here and there that the benedictions being paid to Krishna were neither befitting nor unbefitting because they were all for the absolute who was now playing the part of a human being. A very important observation being made is that when Krishna was leaving the palace of Hastinapura, there were brahmanas who were glorifying Krishna by chanting Vedic hymns and offering benediction to Krishna. Now, it is described in this verse that the benedictions that were being offered to Krishna were neither befitting nor unbefitting, so something like a contradiction, it appears as a contradictory statement here.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna was playing the part of a human being though he is not a human being. He is the Supreme Lord always under all circumstances but he is playing the part of a human being."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the verse, highlighting that Krishna was playing the role of a human being as a guest of Yudhishthira, making the benedictions fitting in that context.

So Prabhupada explains this in the purport very nicely. Why is it being said it was neither befitting nor unbefitting? So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport: At places there were sounds of Vedic benediction at the personality of God is Shri Krishna. The benedictions were fitting in the sense that the Lord was playing the part of a human being as if a cousin of Maharaj Yudhishthira. Krishna appeared as the son of Vasudeva who was the brother of Kuntidevi and Kuntidevi's son was Yudhishthira. So Yudhishthira and Krishna were cousins in terms of relationship, but here it is said because Krishna was playing the part of a human being, though he is not a human being. He is the Supreme Lord always under all circumstances, but he is playing the part of a human being. Therefore, the benedictions were fitting because Yudhishthira is the elder brother of Krishna. So the elder brother arranges to offer benedictions by the qualified brahmanas and the benediction it is accepted which will be offered through chanting of various hymns to the important guest. Krishna has come to the Hastinapura palace as the guest of Yudhishthira.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is described as nirguna, nirguna means absolute, without any material qualities. So he is not a human being, he has no material relationship with anybody."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why the benedictions were also unbefitting, because Krishna is absolute (nirguna) and doesn't need material benefits, and that He creates the material world for our sake.

So in that sense, there it is befitting because Krishna was playing the part of a human being, but they were unbefitting because the Lord is absolute, material qualities, material relativities. Now Krishna is described as nirguna, nirguna means absolute, without any material qualities. So he is not a human being, he has no material relationship with anybody. So therefore this benediction is not suited for Krishna, it is only for people of this world who have some kind of material relationships and they want some benedictions because they may utilize those benedictions for their material benefit. Lacking those material benefits, they may desire some benedictions which will help them to get some material benefits. But Krishna is not in need of any material benefit. Krishna has nothing to do with this entire material creation as far as his activities are concerned or his existence is concerned. Then why does he create? He creates for our sake.

**Key Quote:** "And we are foolish to desire material enjoyment while we are entitled to sublime spiritual pleasure in his association."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how humans foolishly seek material happiness instead of spiritual bliss in connection with Krishna, who creates the material world because we insist on trying to enjoy it.

Why does he create? And we are foolish to desire material enjoyment while we are entitled to sublime spiritual pleasure in his association. So foolishly we have turned away from Krishna, foolishly we seek happiness in material pursuits and Krishna because we are his part and parcel, we are his own children. So because we insist, we are adamant, Krishna creates this material world and places us in this material atmosphere, so we can try to enjoy it materially and try to be happy in this way. But intelligent people realize we can never be happy in this material world by pursuit of material pleasures. We can never be happy. We can never be happy, so intelligent persons try to find out the real source of happiness and that is available only in connection with Krishna, unlimited spiritual bliss. Krishna is a reservoir of that and in our relationship with Krishna, spiritual relationship, not material relationship, we can have

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is full of transcendental qualities when it said nirguna doesn't mean that the Absolute Truth Krishna is the absolute personality of God. It doesn't mean when he describes Nirguna that he has no qualities at all."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that 'nirguna' doesn't mean Krishna has no qualities, but rather that He has no material qualities, only transcendental ones, and that the spiritual world is free from the contradictions found in the material world.

unlimited spiritual bliss. So it is said here Krishna is nirguna and there are no material qualities in him, that's why nirguna, no material qualities, but Krishna is full of transcendental qualities. When it's said nirguna, it doesn't mean that the Absolute Truth, Krishna is the absolute truth. This absolute personality of God. It doesn't mean when he describes Nirguna that he has no qualities at all. He has no material qualities, but he is full of transcendental qualities. That's because he is a transcendental personality. So he is transcendental qualities, full of transcendental qualities. In the transcendental world there is nothing contradictory, whereas in the relative world, the world we are staying, it's called relative world. And the transcendental world, the spiritual world where Krishna resides with his pure devotees, that is called the spiritual world, the transcendental world, the absolute world. There are no relativities and there is nothing contradictory. But in this relative world everything has got its opposite. For example, in this world white is the opposite of conception of black. But in the transcendental world there is no distinction between white and black.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of beauty standards to illustrate the difference between the material and spiritual worlds, and reiterates that benedictions are meant for conditioned souls, not the liberated Lord.

How do you understand this? In the spiritual world there are very, very, very beautiful personalities, equally beautiful, even though some of them are of white complexion and some of them are of black. Not exactly black, dark blue. Но у каждой Ist karş ConfédлALL halod, these negative qualities are considered very beautiful. In the material world, dark complexion people are considered not so beautiful, whereas fair complexion people are considered very beautiful. This is the main contradiction. world the conception of beauty in the material world in the spiritual world both are very beautiful both are beautiful fair complexion people devotees and dark complexion devotees both both are beautiful so the conception of the material world is different and the reality of the spiritual world is different therefore the sounds of benedictions uttered by the learned brahmanas here and there appear to be contradictory in relation with the absolute person when we try to apply this brahmanas offering benedictions as arranged by Yudhishthira Maharaj to Krishna who is departing you then it is contradictory Krishna doesn't require any benediction he has nothing to do with benedictions all the Vedic statements or Vedic chanting which is meant for offering benedictions chanted by brahmanas are meant for conditioned

**Summary:** The speaker explains that when Vedic hymns and benedictions are offered to Krishna with devotion, they become transcendental and lose their contradictory nature, ultimately glorifying Krishna.

souls, they are not meant for the 100% liberated beings and the supreme Lord, eternally liberated Lord, not meant for him. So in that sense, not befitting, it is that doesn't bifit the Lord, but Prabhupad says here very important point that when such Vedic hymns are apply to the absolute person they look upon them and these hymns are applied to the absolute person they look upon them and they give hope to the clapping of their hands and lose all contradiction and become transcendental. So the same glorification, same sorry, same benedictions when they are offered to Krishna, when they are offered to Krishna in devotion, then they are no longer contradictory, they becomes transcendental. So the Vedas contain glorification of Krishna throughout. Hari Sarvatra Giyate, ultimately the Vedas are glorifying Krishna only and everyone and everything in relationship with Krishna, spiritual relationship, so that is the content of the Vedas ultimately from one perspective if you analyze from an absolute perspective the Vedas are nothing but glorification of Krishna complete whole complete truth absolute truth so when the very hymns are chanted to glorify Krishna then there is no more any contradiction you cannot say it is contradictory it is irrelevant it is unbefitting you cannot say that

Whereas, in the mundane world, a thief is punished and never praised. In our material dealings, somebody who steals is never praised, is always condemned and is punished if he is caught stealing. So, why this difference? So, Prabhupada explains, since Krishna is the absolute personality of Godhead, everything is applicable to him and still in spite of all contradictions, he is the Godhead. He is supreme personality of Godhead. So, on the one hand, he is described as a thief, on the other hand, he is worshipped as Makhan Chaur.

So, how can these two things go together? That is because when applied to the Supreme Lord, nothing is contradictory when applied to the Supreme Lord. Because, we should remember, in Vrindavan, Krishna is, why is he stealing? He does not come to the Supreme Lord. Now, Vrindavan is a little different from Vrindavan. If one did not stay there for long, in these many days, to look and use aא sí recovery, who has spent the past, doing elderly, all through such a period of time. What is the result?

**Key Quote:** "This world is compared to a forest fire Caused by the cohesion of bamboo bushes In the forest"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the analogy of the forest fire caused by bamboo, relating it to the nature of the material world.

So the description is now being given that Krishna was pleased when Yudhishthira was re-established in his own kingdom. It was his rightful claim, but he was denied by Duryodhana and party. So after the battle of Kurukshetra, which had exhausted the Kuru dynasty, the Kuru dynasty had been exhausted by the bamboo fire of anger. So Prabhupada explains in the purport: This world is compared to a forest fire caused by the cohesion of bamboo bushes. In the forest, when there is rubbing of dry bamboo, especially in summer, then the spark ignites the dry wood and the fire of the bamboo bush, and it spreads very quickly. It is typically called a forest fire. It spreads very quickly, and a whole forest can be devoured. All the dry bamboo will be completely devoured by the forest fire. Such a forest fire takes place automatically, for bamboo cohesion occurs without external cause.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of anger and the desire to control material nature, leading to conflict and exhaustion.

Nobody goes and sets fire to a bamboo bush. The bamboo in the forest, it happens without external cause. The natural reason for the fire is the nature of the material world. Similarly, in the material world, the wrath—wrath means anger—anger of those who want to lord it over material nature interacts, and the fire of the wild takes place, exhausting the unwanted population. In the material world, there are so many people who want to lord over material nature or lord over the world. There is competition for supremacy, though the supremacy is actually belonging only to one person, the Supreme Lord Krishna. Krishna is the Lord, Krishna is the master, Krishna is the controller, Krishna is the provider, Krishna is the maintainer, Krishna is the well-wisher. But these foolish people, under the influence of illusion, wrongly think, "I am the lord of all I survey." They think we are independent, they are Lords, they have power, or if they don't have enough power, I will amass power by my strength, by my influence, by my intelligence, by my diplomacy, political diplomacy. I will amass power and then rule over the whole world. This is the ambition of materialistic people.

But when two such people, both materialistic, foolishly want to lord over, then there is the war that takes place between them. One will fight against the other, and in this way, the war exhausts the unwanted population. Natural calamities in this world are actually due to the fight between such foolish, blind, materialistic lords. And then the war is one natural calamity. Like that, there are so many different natural calamities which exhaust the unwanted population. Such fires or wars take place, and the Lord has nothing to do with them.

**Key Quote:** "Foolish people without understanding the real purpose of this creation they think that there is no god in control this is demonic mentality"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the purpose of creation, contrasting it with the demonic mentality of denying God's control, and highlighting Krishna's desire for people to follow the path of self-realization.

The Lord has given us the laws, and if we abide by the laws, we will be able to understand the purpose of this creation, and we can live here. As long as we live here, we can execute the purpose and prepare ourselves to go back to Godhead. But foolish people, without understanding the real purpose of this creation, they think that there is no God in control. This is demonic mentality. In the 16th chapter of the Bhagavad-Gita, that is described, the demoniac thing: there is no God in control. If at all there is any God, I am that God: ishwaroham ahambhogi siddhoham balavansukhi. This is demonic mentality, blind to reality. This is demonic nature. But Krishna, still, even though there are foolish people and they falsely declared themselves to be the Lords, Krishna nevertheless is in control, because the Lord wants to maintain the creation. He desires the mass of people to follow the right path of self-realization, which enables the living being up to his necessary needs, beings to enter into the kingdom of God. Krishna has given us the right path to follow.

**Key Quote:** "People don't follow the right path of self-realization. They neglect or they violate the laws of God and thereby the Lord has to intervene"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that suffering arises from neglecting religious principles and that Krishna intervenes to re-establish Dharma, emphasizing the importance of following the path of self-realization.

yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata. dharmasya glāni means people don't follow the right path of self-realization. They neglect or they violate the laws of God, and thereby the Lord has to intervene when there is dharmasya glāni, tadātmānamsrujāmyaham. So, when Krishna comes or he sends his representative, paritrāṇāya sādhunāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtāṁ dharmasam sthāpanārthāṁ dharma, he establishes the real religious principles, re-establishes, because that was established in the beginning of creation, and time to time there is deterioration in following, in following the religious principles. Kālā, influence of Kālā. The people desiring to lord over material nature. So the deterioration in practice of Dharma, and the Lord corrects it from time to time because Lord is the well-wisher of everyone. He doesn't want anyone to suffer. Our suffering is only because we don't follow the religious principles. It's the only cause of our suffering in this material. Otherwise, the Lord has provided everything. Everything is re-established. That is our mission here, which is to realize is perfectly controlled by the Lord. We simply have to follow the religious principles, and everything will be alright. And as Prabhupada says here, when people follow the right path

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the material world is not our permanent home and warns against being misled by atheists and materialists who deny the existence of the kingdom of God.

of self-realization as given by God, then the living beings can enter into the kingdom of God. This place is not meant for our permanent residence. No. We are meant to understand we belong to Krishna. We belong to Krishna's personal abode, and we are meant to prepare ourselves to enter into the kingdom of God after following the right path of self-realization. The Lord wants the suffering human beings to come back, welcome back to home, back to him, and he wants to stop the suffering, threefold material pangs. The people who are suffering, He wants to stop their suffering, and he wants these suffering beings, human beings, to come back to his personal abode. So foolish people don't even know about the kingdom of God, and they are misled by atheists and agnostics and materialists who say, "Oh, this is all mythology, kingdom of God, this is all mythology." They have given a term to spoil the faith, to make people more materialistic and demoniac like themselves. So one should not be misled by such propaganda by the godless atheists. The whole plan of creation is made in that way

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the importance of following God's laws to end suffering, explaining that Maya, Krishna's agent, inflicts suffering on those who violate these laws.

which way that people can follow the religious principles as given by God, not self-manufactured religious system. That is another mistake that sometimes people do. "You, I follow my own religious principles." No, you cannot have your own religious principles. It's not going to help you. It's not going to work. Everything is going on according to the laws of God, the laws of God. So you have to follow the laws of God. Everyone has to follow the laws of God. That is the proper way to actually end our suffering. One who does not come to his senses suffers in the material world by pangs inflicted by the illusory energy of the Lord. Anybody who deviates, there is a system that Maya, the agent of Krishna in this material world, she will inflict suffering upon those who violate the laws of God and the laws of God.

**Key Quote:** "These threefold miseries are inflicted upon those who don't follow the religious principles given by God."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Durga Devi and the threefold miseries, emphasizing that these miseries are inflicted upon those who don't follow religious principles, and that the Lord wants his representatives to guide people back to Godhead.

Durga Devi, she has got ten hands, and each of the ten hands she is having one, one weapon, ten weapons she has. She is riding on a lion, and one particular weapon she has got is called trishu, trident. That trishu, you can see one picture, she is killing one demon with a trident. The trident represents, the three prongs of the trident represents the threefold miseries: Adi Daivika Klesha, Adhyatmika Klesha, Adi Bhautika Klesha, miseries due to our own body and mind, miseries due to other living beings, and miseries due to higher forces of nature. So these threefold miseries are inflicted upon those who don't follow the religious principles given by God. So coming to the point, the Lord therefore wants his bona fide representative to rule the world, so that people may follow the exact religious principles and prepare themselves to go back to Godhead under the guidance of God, the representative of Krishna like Yudhishthira Maharaj. So Krishna wanted to establish Yudhishthira Maharaj, so that the citizens can follow under the guidance of Yudhishthira Maharaj, the real religious principles and prepare themselves to go back to Godhead. That is the whole program of this material creation.

**Key Quote:** "This talk was more attractive than the hymns of the Vedas."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse describing the ladies of Hastinapura discussing Krishna's transcendental qualities, which was more attractive than Vedic hymns.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 20th verse of the 10th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. अन्योण्यमि आसीत संजल्पा उत्तमश्लोक चेतुसाम् कव्रवेंद्रपुरस्त्रीनाम् सर्वशुति मनोहरह। The meaning of this verse is: absorbed in the thought of the transcendental qualities of the Lord, who is glorified in select poetry, the ladies on the roofs of all the houses of Hastinapura began to talk of Him. This talk was more attractive than the hymns of the Vedas. This is a very interesting verse in this particular chapter, which describes the departure of Lord Krishna for Dwarka from Hastinapura. So the ladies who were the relatives of the kings and the royalty in the palace of Hastinapura, they went on top of the roof of the houses, and they began to talk of Krishna because they were always absorbed in the thought of the transcendental qualities of the Lord. The word is used: उत्तमश्लोक चेतुसाम् uttamasloka. Krishna's another name is Uttama Shloka, meaning he is glorified in select poetry by great poets, by great devotees. In all the Vedas, he is glorified by select poetry, choicest poetry. So they began to talk of him, of Krishna. And this talk is described here in this verse, was more attractive than the hymns of the Vedas.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Vedas, Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Puranas glorify Hari, and the Bhagavatam exclusively glorifies Krishna.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport: In the Bhagavad Gita, it is said that in all the Vedic literatures, the goal is the Personality of Godhead, Krishna. What does Bhagavad Gita say? Vedascha sarvair ahameva vedyo. By all the Vedas am I to be known. Krishna says this in the Bhagavad Gita. And Srila Prabhupada says further, factually the glories of the Lord are depicted in such literature as the Vedas, Ramayana and Mahabharata. This is also mentioned in the scriptures: Vede Ramayane chaiva purane bharate tatha. Aadavantecha madhyecha hari sarvatra giyate. The meaning of this verse is, in the Vedic literature, including the Ramayana, Puranas and Mahabharata, from the very beginning, Aadav, to the end, Antecha, as well as within the middle, Madhyecha, only Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is explained, is glorified. And in the Bhagavatam, they are specifically mentioned in respect to the Supreme Lord. Bhagavata is Krishna Katha. It is exclusive glorification of Krishna from the beginning till the end, throughout the Bhagavatam.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Devotee is always absorbed in thought of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotees are always absorbed in thoughts of Krishna, and their discussions revolve around Krishna.

Therefore, while the ladies on the tops of the houses in the capital of the kings of the kingdom, the Kuru dynasty, were talking about the Lord, their talk was more pleasing than the Vedic hymns. It's generally seen that when ladies gather, they have a tendency to talk amongst themselves about some subject. Now, the subject they choose depends on the level of their consciousness. Anybody, for that matter. Like Srila Prabhupada explains, when businessmen gather in one place, what will their subject matter be? If they are seriously absorbed in business, then their talk will be about business only. Similarly, if scholars of some particular subject, they gather in one place, they will discuss about that subject matter only. They will talk about that subject matter only. So like that, these ladies, they were not just talking about some ordinary topics. No. They were talking about Lord Krishna. Why? Because they were absorbed in thinking about the transcendental qualities of Krishna, which means that they are all devotees of Krishna. So this is one characteristic of a devotee. A devotee is always absorbed in thought of Krishna. So Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, if you really are serious about devotional service, about bhakti, you want to become Krishna's devotee, then you simply think of Krishna always. Think of Krishna always. Conversely, devotees of Krishna always think of Krishna. They are always thinking of Krishna. So therefore, when they talk, the subject matter for their talking is only Krishna and nothing else. So Srila Prabhupada explains that why is it said that the talk of these ladies about Krishna was more attractive than the hymns of the Vedas? So Srila Prabhupada explains,

**Key Quote:** "The language is immaterial, but the subject matter is important."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that anything sung in praise of the Lord is Shruti Mantra, and the subject matter is more important than the language, citing examples of Narottam Dasa Thakur and Purandara Dasa.

anything sung in the praise of the Lord is Shruti Mantra. Shruti means the Vedas, the original Vedas. There are songs of Thakur Narottam Dasa, one of the Acharyas in the Gaudiya Sampradaya, composed in simple Bengali language. Narottam Dasa Thakur is a great Acharya. He was a contemporary of Srila Jeeva Goswami, who was one of the chief disciples of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. So he learnt this Bhagavatam under Srila Jeeva Goswami, and then he has written so many songs in simple Bengali language, explaining the same subject matter, so that it is easily understandable by common people. He was preaching in Bengal, so it is written in Bengali language. Now, another Acharya, Thakur Vishwanath Chakravarthi, who is a very learned Acharya of the same Sampradaya, Vishwanath Chakravarthi Thakur has approved the songs by Thakur Narottam Dasa to be as good as Vedic mantras, even though they are written in simple Bengali language, but the subject matter is simply describing Krishna. So therefore they are as good as Vedic mantras. And Prabhupada says, this is so because of the subject matter. The language is immaterial, but the subject matter is important. Of course, the original Vedas are always in Sanskrit language, but even if something is written in simple Bengali, or for that matter in Karnataka, Purandara Dasa has written lakhs and lakhs of songs in simple Kannada language, but the subject matter is the subject matter of Krishna, the subject matter of the Vedas. So the subject matter is important,

**Key Quote:** "By absorbing their mind in thoughts and actions of the Supreme Lord, they develop the consciousness of Vedic wisdom by the grace of the Supreme Lord Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that by absorbing their minds in Krishna, the ladies develop Vedic wisdom through Krishna's grace, and Krishna enlightens devotees from within.

the language is immaterial. So it is said here, the ladies who are all absorbed in the thought and actions of the Lord, develop the consciousness of Vedic wisdom by the grace of the Lord. Now in the next few verses, there will be description of what were they, what was their subject of discussion? What were they talking? So it's all full of Vedic wisdom. Their talk is full of Vedic wisdom. So Srila Prabhupada explains, therefore, although such ladies might not have been very learned scholars in Sanskrit or otherwise, these ladies, they are just householders. They are not particularly meant to study the Vedas, go to Gurukul, in the Vedic culture at least. But that does not mean they are totally ignorant about Krishna, or they are totally ignorant about the Vedic conclusions. No. By absorbing their mind in thoughts and actions of the Supreme Lord, they develop the consciousness of Vedic wisdom. How? By the grace of the Supreme Lord Krishna. And how are they able to get that grace of the Supreme Lord? Because Krishna is seated on the heart of every one of us, every living being. So if somebody is absorbed in the thought of Krishna, Krishna enlightens such a devotee from within. TESHAM SATATA YUKTANAM BHAJATAM PRITI PURVAKAM DADAMI BUDDHI YOGAM TAM YENAMA MUPAYANTITE TESHAM EVANUKAM PARTHAM AHAM AGNYANAJAM TAMAHA NASHAYAMI ATMABHAVASTO GYANADIPENABHASVATAM Krishna enlightens from within the heart of his devotees. Therefore, Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, the most confidential instruction, become my devotee, then Krishna will enlighten. There is no need of specifically attempting to study the Vedas, which are very difficult, because the Vedic language is not easy. Even for Sanskrit scholars, Vedic language is not easily understood in the proper perspective. So therefore, Krishna says, you simply become my devotee. Think of me. Discuss about me. And then I will enlighten you from within your heart. All the Vedic conclusions will be revealed by Krishna in the heart of the devotee.

**Key Quote:** "The discussions or the descriptions in the Puranas, Itihasas, about the personal feature of the Lord are more attractive and pleasing to hear than the descriptions in the Upanishads."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why the ladies' talks were more attractive than Vedic hymns, because the Puranas describe the personal feature of the Lord in detail, which is more attractive than the impersonal descriptions in the Upanishads.

Whatever they spoke, these ladies of Hastinapura, was more attractive than the Vedic hymns. Why? Why is it like that? Prabhupada says, the Vedic hymns in the Upanishads are sometimes indirectly directed to the Supreme Lord. The Upanishads are actually the philosophical portions of the Vedas which describe the Absolute Truth. And the Absolute Truth is described both impersonal and personal. So the impersonal descriptions are very prominent in the Upanishads portions of the Vedas. Whereas, the personal aspect of the Absolute Truth, that is the Personality of Godhead, Krishna, Rama, Narsimha, Varaha, all the incarnations are more nicely described in detail in the Puranas, Itihasas, like Ramayana, entirely about Lord Rama. Mahabharata, about Krishna and many other incarnations. Bhagavatam, fully about Krishna and his incarnations. So the Puranas are describing the personal feature of the Absolute Truth. Therefore, the discussions or the descriptions in the Puranas, Itihasas, about the personal feature of the Lord are more attractive and pleasing to hear than the descriptions in the Upanishads. Therefore, it is said the ladies' talks were more attractive than the Vedic hymns.

**Key Quote:** "instead of trying to study the Vedas and then try to understand what is the Absolute Truth, one should simply engage in devotional service by which automatically one becomes enlightened in the Vedic wisdom"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that engaging in devotional service, such as chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa or worshipping Kṛṣṇa, leads to enlightenment and purification, ultimately reconnecting one with Kṛṣṇa.

of the tenth chapter of the first canto of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. savai-kilāyaṁ puruṣa-pūrātaṇo ya eka āsīd aviśeṣa ātmani agre guṇebhyo jagad ātmanīśvare nimīlita ātman nishi-sūpta-śaktiṣu. The meaning of this verse is, they said, the ladies of Sīnāpura who are standing on top of the palace, "Here he is, the original personality of Godhead as we definitely remember him. He alone existed before the manifested creation of the modes of nature, and in him only, because he is the Supreme Lord, all living beings merge as if sleeping at night, their energy is suspended." The ladies of the royal palace of Sīnāpura, they are talking amongst themselves about Kṛṣṇa, and the level of their knowledge is so very advanced that Bhāgavatam presents this as the philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, their talks. That is because, as was explained earlier, a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, simply because the devotee is engaged in devotional service, which is as simple as chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, worshipping Kṛṣṇa, or just having darshan of Kṛṣṇa's deity, one becomes enlightened from within by the grace of the Supreme Lord who is seated in everyone's heart as Paramātmā. So, these ladies, they are able to discuss at this level, advanced level of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, simply because they are enlightened from within by Kṛṣṇa Himself. So, therefore, it is said, instead of trying to study the Vedas and then try to understand what is the Absolute Truth, one should simply engage in devotional service, by which automatically one becomes enlightened in the Vedic wisdom, and one also becomes purified in the heart of all material contamination, one makes advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and ultimately one becomes reconnected with Kṛṣṇa in their original relationship with Kṛṣṇa. So, bhakti is the only way to achieve ultimate perfection in our self-realization, in our spiritual development.

**Key Quote:** "at the end of Brahma's life all the planets and universe are completely destroyed and in both the periods the material energy called the Mahat Tattva and the marginal energy called the Jeeva Tattva merge in the person of the Supreme Lord"
**Summary:** The speaker describes the cyclical nature of creation, maintenance, and destruction in the material world, contrasting it with the eternal existence of the spiritual world, Krishna's personal abode.

So, the magnetism has definitely been learnt from my Angara, which is known as отсurgency, because through non-figure rests and water fish GMT, whoever is clothed in water in the, and when it is not visible, it's called unmanifested. So, this manifested cosmic manifestation, cosmos, has two kinds of dissolution, two kinds of destruction. At the end of Brahma's day, which is four billion three hundred and twenty million years, the quanda, our calculation, that is just the day of Brahma. When Brahma, the one particular, the Lord of one particular universe goes to sleep, there is one annihilation, it's called a partial destruction. At the end of Brahma's life, which takes place at the end of Brahma's 100 years, Brahma's 100 years, and what is that calculation? According to our calculation, 8 billion 640 million years into 30 into 12 into 100, that comes to some 311 trillion years, there is complete annihilation of the entire universe, complete annihilation. As I said, Brahma's end of the day, only partial destruction of the middle and lower planetary systems. At the end of Brahma's life, all the planets and universe are completely destroyed. And in both the periods, the material energy called the Mahat Tattva and the marginal energy called the Jeeva Tattva merge in the person of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is present as Garbhodakashai Vishnu or Padmanabha Vishnu. In him, both the material energy and the living entities actually rest during the periods when there is dissolution of this universe. The living beings remain asleep within the body of the Lord until there is another creation of the material world, and that is the way of the creation, maintenance, and annihilation of the material manifestation. So, this material world means there is creation, maintenance, destruction, creation, maintenance, destruction. This cyclically goes on perpetually. And what about the spiritual world, Krishna's personal abode, Vaikunthaloka, Goloka Vrindavana? Never destroyed, never created.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Lord existed before the creation and exists in various eternal forms, while our material forms are temporary and subject to destruction.

eternally existing. So, throughout the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna is telling, "There is another world apart from this world you are living in. In that world, there is no destruction." So, Krishna is telling, "Come to that world." That is Krishna's personal abode. Krishna says, "Come to that world," he is inviting all of us. So, Sri La Pravapa explains further, "The material creation is directed by the interaction of the three modes of material nature set in action by the Lord, and therefore it is said here that the Lord existed before the modes of material nature was set in motion." So, before this creation, Lord existed as Krishna in his various forms. All the forms, Lord Krishna, Rama, Narasimha, Vraha, Narayana, Vishnu, they always exist in that particular eternal form, whereas we, we have got a form now and after that creation, but this form is not going to last, it is going to be destroyed end of this life or in the end of the universe, at the end of this manifestation when the dissolution takes place, this will be destroyed. So, ahh, it is competency.

### Mahavishnu, creation of universes, Brahma's lifespan, God's greatness

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Mahavishnu breathes out universes in very, very, very tiny seed-like form, but each of them develops into huge, gigantic universe with millions of planets."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Mahavishnu lying on the causal ocean, breathing out universes in seed form, and explains the vast timescale of Brahma's lifespan in relation to Mahavishnu's breathing cycle.

Informed in the Shruti Mantra, in the Vedas, original Vedas, that only Vishnu, the Supreme Lord, existed before the creation and there was no Brahma, no Shiva, no demigods. Vishnu means the Mahavishnu who is lying on the causal ocean. There is one causal ocean, Karana Jala. And there, one form of Vishnu, the first form of Vishnu, Mahavishnu, he is lying there and he is breathing and by his breathing, the universes are coming out of his body in the form of seeds. And these seed-like universes, very, very tiny, they develop gradually into huge universe. And within that universe, there will be universe. There will be innumerable planets in each and every universe. Now, how do they develop? Prabhupada gives a very nice example. Just like a very, very, very small banyan seed, seed of a banyan tree, very tiny, it's like a pinhead, it's very, very small. That, when planted in a fertile ground, it will develop into huge universe. A huge banyan tree that can spread over hundreds of square kilometers. That tiny seed. So, like that, Mahavishnu breathes out universes in very, very, very tiny seed-like form. But each of them develops into huge, gigantic universe with millions of planets. Each planet, millions of living entities. So, this Mahavishnu is described in the Brahma Samhita as a plenary portion of Krishna. In the Brahma Samhita it is said, "Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the original personality of Godhead, Govinda, whose plenary portion is Mahavishnu. All the Brahmas, the heads of the universes, live only for the period of his exhaling after universes are generated from the pores of his transcendental body." So, Krishna expands as Mahavishnu. That Mahavishnu breathes out universes in seed-like form. And they'll remain only as long as, after his breathing out, for some time, he is not inhaling. So, he, after he exhales, little time, then he inhales. So, that tiny duration between his exhalation and inhalation, that is the duration of the life of Brahma. Jeevan tiloma vilaja jagadanda natha. That is lifetime of Brahma. For us, how long is that period? 311 trillion years. The lifespan of Brahma, according to our calculation. So, the interval between the exhalation, outgoing breath of Mahavishnu, and the inhaling, the incoming breath, is 311 trillion years. This is not even the complete breathing cycle of Mahavishnu. 311 trillion years. It is the intervening time between his exhalation and inhalation.

### Krishna as the original person, authoritative knowledge, spiritual identity, devotional service

**Key Quote:** "an authoritative source is the only means of knowing about transcendental subject matter definitely. There is no other alternative."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing that Krishna is the original person, that knowledge of transcendental subjects comes from authoritative sources, and that our true identity is spiritual, discoverable through devotional service.

So, try to understand how great is God. Just this alone can help you understand. So, that Krishna, what the ladies are telling, is actually the Mahavishnu. Krishna is the original person. He expands into different incarnations, different forms of incarnations, and they are all Him only. So, Mahavishnu, who is actually the origin of this universe, who breathes in and breathes out, creation and annihilation takes place. So, that Mahavishnu is none other than Krishna only. Therefore, they are saying, "Here is the original personality of Godhead. He alone existed before the manifested creation of the modes of nature." Therefore, they are saying that. The ladies talking about this Vedic truth must have heard it from authoritative source. Otherwise, how can they exactly describe this accurately? So, an authoritative source is the only means of knowing about transcendental subject matter definitely. There is no other alternative. Who can ever figure out this? That how is this creation taking place? The way it is described here, how can somebody figure out? Except by hearing from the proper authority or proper source. So, therefore, the scriptures say, hear from the Vedas. Hear from the original source, from Krishna, from the Acharyas, who receive this knowledge from Krishna in parampara. There is no other way of knowing this. Now, the merging of the living entities in the body of Mahavishnu or Garbhodakshaya Vishnu, does not mean the living being is the only being. Does not mean the living being is the only being. The living being as spirit soul is eternally existent. But the body is annihilated. So, the real identity of the living being is spiritual. And that is, we are ultimately devotees of Krishna. And to discover or awaken or come to know about our real identity, we have to engage in devotional service. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "The personality of Godhead, again desiring to give names and forms to his parts and parcels, the living entities, place them under the guidance of material nature."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (1.10.22) and explains its meaning, focusing on Krishna's role in creation and the placement of living entities under material nature's guidance.

In this session we will be discussing from the 22nd verse of the 10th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is a continuation of the talk of the ladies of Hastinapura about Krishna. Sa eva bhuyo nija virya choditam Svajivamayam prakritim sisrikshatim Anama roopatmani roopanamani Viditsamano anusasara shastrakrit. The meaning of this verse is: The personality of Godhead, again desiring to give names and forms to his parts and parcels, the living entities, place them under the guidance of material nature. By his own potency, material nature is empowered to recreate. So in the talk they are describing how this creation takes place by the intervention of

**Key Quote:** "We cannot be separated from the Lord completely. The relationship or the link in terms of relationship always exists eternally."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing the inseparable and eternal relationship between living entities and Krishna, contrasting it with temporary material relationships.

Hmm. So in the Purport, Shila Prabhupada explains, "The living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord." Each one of us, every living being is a part and parcel. Part means, you can understand, a very, very tiny portion of the Lord, supreme whole. Parcel means inseparable part. Inseparable part. We cannot be separated from the Lord completely. The relationship or the link in terms of relationship always exists eternally. Unlike the relationships in this world, which are based on the body, when the body is annihilated there is no meaning to the relationship at all. Whereas, our relationship with Krishna is spirit soul to the supreme spirit. And since the spirit soul is eternal, supreme spirit Krishna is eternal. If then there is no meaning to the relationship. Hegopgga abhyasa maran incredible. Yu.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna is our supreme father that he describes in the Bhagavad-gita aham bija pradapita so he has placed us under this material energy for our rectification of our rebellious attitude"
**Summary:** The speaker distinguishes between eternally liberated (Nithya Mukta) and eternally conditioned (Nithya Baddha) souls, explaining that conditioned souls are placed in the material world to rectify their rebellious attitude towards Krishna.

two varieties: Nithya Mukta and Nithya Baddha. Nithya Mukta are eternally liberated souls. Nithya Mukta, eternally liberated, and they are eternally engaged in reciprocation of transcendental loving service with the Lord in his eternal abode beyond the manifested mundane creation, beyond this material world, which is sometimes manifest, sometimes unmanifest, sometimes existing as this world after the creation, and after dissolution it doesn't exist as this world, it will be in a dormant state. Whereas Krishna's abode is eternally existing and there there are eternally liberated souls engaged in devotional service, in loving devotional service and in the spiritual service of the Lord. And so this reciprocation with Krishna, but the Nithya Baddha or eternally conditioned souls are entrusted to his external energy, Maya. All of us in this material world, we are called Nithya Baddha, eternally conditioned, and we are placed in the Material Energy why? For rectification of their rebellious attitude toward the Supreme Father. Krishna is our supreme father, that he describes in the Bhagavad-Gita, aham bija pradapita. So he has placed us under this material energy for our rectification of our rebellious attitude.

**Key Quote:** "All of us in this material world are eternally forgetful of the relation with the lord as parts and parcels"
**Summary:** The speaker describes the forgetfulness of conditioned souls regarding their relationship with Krishna, their bewilderment by Maya, and their futile attempts to find lasting happiness in the material world.

What is this rebellious attitude that is described by Prabhupada as nitya badhas? That is, all of us in this material world are eternally forgetful of the relation with the Lord as parts and parcels. Any of the only the souls of this world, you ask, do you remember Krishna? No, nobody remembers Krishna. They forget who is who they are, they forget who is Krishna, they forget definitely eternal relationship with Krishna. This is the condition, our condition is like this: forgetfulness of Krishna, forgetfulness of our eternal relationship. You and we are bewildered by the illusory energy, Maya. Maya means this illusory energy and we think that we are product of this material energy or matter. We are products of matter. We think in terms of this body. This body is made up of matter. We think in terms of this body, material body only, and that way we are busy making plans in this material world for becoming happy. In this spiritual condition we are naturally always happy in relationship with Krishna, but in the material world we are not always happy. We have to seek happiness and for seeking happiness we have to make so many plans. It is not natural for us to be always happy, no, not in the material.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "At the end of the millennium all the living entities merge into my nature and again when the time of creation is ripe I begin creation by the agency of my external energy"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the cyclical nature of creation, maintenance, and destruction, referencing the Bhagavad Gita and emphasizing the role of Krishna's external energy.

Now in forgetfulness, when we are making plans to become happy thinking we are products of matter, all our plans are completely destroyed at the end of a certain period. That is mentioned in the previous words, know that there is always two kinds of destruction, end of Brahma's day, end of Brahma's life. So that is explained in the Bhagavad Gita in a brief manner. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, "At the end of the millennium all the living entities merge into my nature and again when the time of creation is ripe I begin creation by the agency of my external energy." So as I explained in a previous session, creation, maintenance, destruction is going on. So after creation the living entities are getting bodies and after dissolution they remain unmanifest without a material body in the body of Mahavishnu or the body of Garbhodakshaya Vishnu for some time, for a length of time without a body, without a material body. So periodically this happens again and again. The living entities are created and they merge into Krishna's nature at the end of Brahma's day or Brahma's life. The word bhuvaya used in this words indicates again and again, that is to say the process of creation, maintenance and annihilation is going on perpetually by the external energy of the Lord, by this material energy.

is going on again and again and again, but we should always remember material energy is not the cause of the creation or destruction or maintenance, it is the supreme lord Krishna who is the cause. Krishna is the cause of the creation, maintenance and destruction. The living entities who are constitutionally the parts and parts of the Lord are forgetful of the sweet relationship with Krishna and they are given a chance to get rid of the clutches of this material and usury energy. Why? Krishna creates to give us a chance to become free from this cycle of birth and death, from the clutches of maya.

of Krishna. What has Krishna done? He has given us the revealed scriptures, the vedic literature. So vedic literatures are guiding directions for the conditioned souls so that they can become free from the repetition of birth and death, they can become free from this material body. That's the purpose of this creation and that is explained in the vedic literature and in the Bhagavad-Gita. This is all explained in very brief in the Bhagavad-Gita. It is given in great detail. Bhagavad-Gita, what does Krishna say? The created world and the material energy are under my control. Again and again this material world is created and this is done through the agency of the external energy. Krishna is not directly involved but under his control material energy is again and again creating, maintaining and destroying. Actually we don't have any material name or form as spirit soul in our original position in our relationship with Krishna, but just because we want to enjoy materially therefore to satisfy that desire for material enjoyment there is this arrangement that we are given a material body, a material form, material name, material qualities simply for the sake of satisfying our desire for material enjoyment, but side by side in the human form of life we are given a chance to understand what is our revealed what is our real position.

**Key Quote:** "People who are materialistic are mad after false name and form this material body"
**Summary:** The speaker criticizes materialistic people who are absorbed in false names and forms, emphasizing the importance of realizing one's spiritual identity to escape the cycle of birth and death.

they are busy with materialism and they always are remaining forgetful of Krishna, about their own self, real self. They perpetually keep taking birth, they keep dying again and again and again. So people who are materialistic, Prabhupada describes here, are mad after false name and form. This material body, there is a material form and the corresponding material name and the different qualities and characteristics. Under certain conditions this form of the body is thought of as real, factual, and bewildered by the misuse of the material energy people are completely absorbed just in this material body. It's such a waste of time and it is loss of a valuable opportunity to realize who we actually are because until we realize we are spirit soul, we have a spiritual form, we have a spiritual identity, we are spiritually eternally connected with Krishna, until then we cannot get out of this perpetual cycle of birth and death.

in which there is always suffering. Even though there is some so-called happiness, with great endeavor we may get some happiness, but real happiness is spiritual, it's not material. The scriptures supply the clue for understanding our real position, but people are reluctant to take the lessons from the scriptures. So this is the reason why we are living in this material world. So Bhagavad Gita says, for example, Krishna has presented the Bhagavad Gita, spoken the Bhagavad Gita. It says that one should actually understand one's identity as spirit soul and work for realizing this position as spirit soul and thereby become enlightened in Krishna's consciousness and get out of this material existence to live eternal life full of bliss and

**Key Quote:** "Here is the same Supreme Personality of Godhead whose transcendental form is experienced by the great devotees who are completely cleansed of material consciousness by dint of rigid devotional service and full control of life and the senses."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (1.10.23) and explains that the ladies of Hastinapura, though not highly educated, are discussing Krishna, emphasizing the potential for awakening Krishna consciousness in everyone.

In this session we will be discussing from the 23rd verse of the 10th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Savaayam Yat Padam Atra Surayo Jitendriya Nirjitam Atarishvanaha Pashyanti Bhakti Utkalitat Amalatmana Nanvesha Sattvam Parimastum Arhati. The meaning of this verse is: Here is the same Supreme Personality of Godhead whose transcendental form is experienced by the great devotees who are completely cleansed of material consciousness by dint of rigid devotional service and full control of life and the senses, and that is the only way to purify existence. These are words spoken by the ladies of Hastinapura. They are discussing amongst themselves about the personality of Godhead Krishna. This is when Krishna is about to leave Hastinapura for travelling back to Dwaraka. So these ladies, they are not any great women. They are not that great, they are not very well educated. See, they have absolutely no knowledge of Krishna. They have no wisdom in Krishna and they have no knowledge of the great Godhead Krishna. Can't they even understand or understand what Krishna is about? They are not aware of him, they are aware of the great Godhead Krishna who is about to leave Hastinapura. So, what is Krishna? What is Krishna's personality? What is the nature of Krishna? What is Krishna's identity, what does he mean by that? What is Krishna's personality?

**Key Quote:** "So we can also adopt the same method of awakening our own Krishna consciousness."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights the purpose of Srimad Bhagavatam as a means to awaken Krishna consciousness, emphasizing its accessibility through translations and commentaries.

And of course, that hearing also results in purification of the heart in awakening their dormant Krishna consciousness, which is natural for everyone, every living being, every person. It is natural. So we can also adopt the same method of awakening our own Krishna consciousness. It is with this perspective that Srimad Bhagavatam has been spoken by Shukadeva Goswami, has been recorded by Srila Vyasadeva, has been translated and commented by all the Acharyas. And it is with this purpose only Srila Vyasadeva has been recorded. And the same way that absolute truth, Insatana Bhagavad explains to us in very simple easily understandable language, the Srimad Bhagavatam, which is in Sanskrit language, he is giving us in simple English. So they are describing who can actually experience the transcendental form of Krishna. Krishna, the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna, the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the sentirable energy that accelerates death and prosperity of people.

**Key Quote:** "Bhaktia only by dint of pure devotional service. We can know Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on how to perceive Krishna, emphasizing the need for cleansing material consciousness through devotional service and sense control, referencing the Bhagavad Gita.

a transcendental person, is the transcendental person and that form, transcendental form cannot be seen with ordinary eyes. Krishna is seated in our heart but we look into our heart we cannot see Krishna in our present condition. So how can we see Krishna? That is possible if we cleanse our material consciousness by two things mentioned here. We perform rigid devotional service and we are able to gain full control of life and the senses. Only then we can actually see Krishna within our own eyes. We can see Krishna within our own heart and not only that they are telling that this method of cleansing the heart is the only way to purify our existence, present state of existence, material existence. The only way. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport that it is stated in the Bhagavad Gita that the Lord can be known in his real nature by dint of pure devotional service only. Bhaktiamam abhijanati yavanyas chasmi tatvatah. Krishna says in the 18th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita Bhaktia only by dint of pure devotional service. We can know Krishna. Bhaktiamam abhijanati. We can know him.

Yavan yas yaha chasmi tatvatah. Tatvatah means the real nature of Krishna. Not mistaking him to be a ordinary covered boy or just another king in Dwaraka or just another prince in Mathura. No. As the supreme personality of Godhead, he is the supreme personality of Godhead. Since, him is truly an superb person. It is pipes need sumitra instructions. I tell you that sometimes since Putin dethroned the no details which make the holy God to Buddha , it is well ours here. History has been studying hier s re the ideas being a life.

**Summary:** The speaker provides practical examples of daily devotional activities like chanting, worship, and hearing Krishna's glories, explaining how these practices purify the mind from material contamination accumulated over lifetimes.

In the Bhagavad Gita also the same thing is explained. By rigid devotional service. Practice. Constant practice. Every day we have to chant and hear Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Every day. Every day we have to worship Krishna. Every day we have to take food offered to Krishna as prasadam. Every day we have to sing Krishna's glories. We have to hear the Srimad Bhagavatam or read the Bhagavatam or recollect the pastimes of Krishna which we may have heard earlier. This is required every day. Srimad Bhagavatam sevaya. Nitya means every day. Regularly. Constantly. Always. This way the mind can become purified of all material dust. This material dust we have accumulated over long association with material nature in past so many millions of years, of lifetimes. We have been around in this material world changing bodies again and again and again and again and again. This is called repetition of birth and death. Samsara. We perform some activities in this life, and those activities result in some reactions, good or bad.

**Key Quote:** "Until then our material existence continues life after life after life after life after life."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts material activities with devotional service, highlighting that only through contact with a pure devotee and acceptance of devotional service can one break free from the cycle of birth and death, emphasizing the human form's potential for understanding one's relationship with Krishna.

And then to undergo those reactions we get another body and in the next life again we perform some more material activities and this repeats till we come in contact with a pure devotee of Krishna like Srila Prabhupada and after that we accept the process of rigid devotional self. This is the service. Until then our material existence continues life after life after life after life after life. You can see everywhere around you what are people engaged in. They are simply engaged in material activities whether good or bad. So they have no chance of purifying their body, mind. So they remain in ignorance, darkness of ignorance. And only in the human form of life do we have the developed intelligence to understand this. Who am I? Who is Krishna? What is my relationship with Krishna? What am I entitled to? As spirit soul I am entitled to eternal happiness in association with Krishna. That is explained by Srila Prabhupada. So Srila Prabhupada explains further in this purport. Jita Indriya means one who has full control over the senses. Jita Indriya. One who has conquered his senses. Normally we are dictated by our senses. Our senses demand and we try to fulfill those demands.

**Key Quote:** "The reality is that these senses if they are controlled and engaged in devotional service only then can we become really happy."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of 'Jita Indriya' (sense control) and contrasts it with 'Ajita Indriya' (uncontrolled senses), arguing that true happiness comes from engaging the senses in devotional service rather than suppressing them, using the example of Vishwamitra Muni to illustrate the failure of artificial sense control methods.

With the hope that I will be able to fulfill those demands, I will become happy if I satisfy my senses. This is ignorance actually. The reality is that these senses if they are controlled and engaged in devotional service only then can we become really happy, experience real happiness. If we are Jita Indriya. Those who are simply trying to satisfy the demands of the senses they are called Ajita Indriya. Ajita Indriya. Most people they are just having these uncontrolled senses and their life is only simply satisfying the demands of the senses all the time, all the time. And the center of all these senses is the mind so it's the mind which is driving the senses and the senses are driving our organs of action and is simply engaged in different activities with the single aim of satisfying the senses and the mind with a hope that we can become happy but it is explained here that sense control is not possible by stopping all activities of the senses and it is even explained here for Srila Prabhupada the artificial means of the yogic processes to make the senses inactive has proved to be abject failure trying to stop the senses by even the hatha yoga or the ashtanga yoga process is not a guaranteed method of controlling the senses the example is given of Vishwamitra Muni a very famous example he controlled his senses by yogic trance but when he happened to meet Menaka an absurd trauma he became a victim of sex and artificial way of controlling the senses failed what is this artificial way you try to suppress the senses we say no no no no to demands of the senses but the devotee simply engages all the senses and that is exactly what is bhakti rishikeshya sevannam bhakti ruchyate engage the senses to fulfill himself the eyes and seeing the beautiful form of Krishna, engage the tongue in tasting wonderful Krishna Prasadam, engage the ears in hearing nice Krishna Katha or nice Krishna Bhajans, like that and your senses automatically become controlled and when they are purified you can see Krishna. I'll stop here. Thank you very

**Key Quote:** "That's Krishna's mission and that's the mission of all Krishna's devotees also so it is Krishna only who is the supreme personality of God it who creates maintains and unleads the material world and he remains unaffected"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining Krishna's role as the creator, maintainer, and destroyer, emphasizing his transcendental nature and the mission to liberate conditioned souls.

In this session we will be discussing from the 24th verse of the 10th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Savaayam Sakhi Anugeeta Sakkatho Vedeshu Guhyejucha Guhyavadibhihi Ya Eka Eesho Jagad Atma Leelaya Srijati Avati Atti Natatra Sajjate. The meaning of this verse is: O dear friends, here is that very personality of Godhead whose attractive and confidential pastimes are described in the confidential parts of Vedic literature by his great devotees. It is he only who creates, maintains, and annihilates the material world and yet remains unaffected. These are words spoken by the ladies of Ashthinapura. They know the transcendental nature of Krishna's personality. They are not mistaking him to be another ordinary King. Even though he is playing the role of the King of Dwaraka, it is actually his eternal Leela in the spiritual world which he is displaying in the material world to attract us, the conditioned souls who are trapped here. He wants us to get out of this material existence, put an end to all our suffering. That's Krishna's mission and that's the mission of all Krishna's devotees also. So it is Krishna only, who is the supreme personality of Godhead, who creates, maintains, and unleashes the material world, and he remains unaffected. That cannot be said of the Devatas or anybody else who is engaged in different activities in this material world.

**Key Quote:** "So if you really want to hear the most attractive personal feature of the absolute truth then you have to hear the most confidential part of the Vedic literature which describes those confidentialities of the Vedas and the personal features of the Vedas confidential pastimes and they are described only by great devotees they discard only by great devotees"
**Summary:** This segment discusses the different aspects of the Vedas, contrasting the impersonal Brahman feature with the personal Bhagavan feature, and highlighting that the most confidential pastimes of Krishna are revealed by great devotees.

You can see that in the material world everyone else becomes bound up by their material actions, whereas Krishna remains completely transcendental under all circumstances. And here it's also said that Krishna's pastimes are confidential, confidential parts of the Vedic literature by his great devotees. So ordinarily the Vedas describe the absolute truth in terms of the impersonal feature and the localized feature, the Brahman feature and the Paramahatma feature. The descriptions of the Bhagawan feature, the personal feature, is very rarely found in the original Vedas. It is there in the original Vedas, but it is not so much described. The bulk of the Vedas consists of the descriptions of the interactions to the three gunas, trai guna vishaya Veda, and the conclusion of the Vedas given as Vedanta philosophy describes mostly the impersonal feature or the Brahman feature of the absolute truth. So if you really want to hear the most attractive personal feature of the absolute truth, Krishna Murti, Krishna Rama, Narsimha, Brahma, Narayana, all of these activities of the personality of Godhead in his various incarnations, and especially his activities in his form, original form as Krishna, then you have to hear the most confidential part of the Vedic literature which describes those confidentialities of the Vedas and the personal features of the Vedas, confidential pastimes, and they are described only by great devotees.

**Key Quote:** "Srimad Bhagavatam especially the confidential parts of his activities are described by the confidential devotee Sukhadeva Goswami so Bhagavatam is special literature"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of Srimad Bhagavatam as a special literature containing confidential knowledge of Krishna's activities, narrated by Sukhadeva Goswami.

They are described only by great devotees. So in the purport from the process as stated in the Bhagavad Gita, all the Vedic literature is glorified greatness of Lord Sri Krishna, her Esvrat Rageet a, everywhere in all the Vedic literature they are simply glorifying the greatness of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna. Here it is confirmed in the Bhagavatam also, the Vedas are expanded by many branches and sub-branches by great devotees and empowered incarnations of the Lord like Vyasa, Narada, Sukhadeva Goswami, the Kumaras, Kapila, Prahlada, Janaka, Bali, and Yamaraj. All of these personalities are Mahajanas, Mahatmas, pure devotees, great personalities, but in the Srimad Bhagavatam especially the confidential parts of his activities are described by the confidential devotee Sukhadeva Goswami. So Bhagavatam is special literature. There are so many Vedic literatures, but among all of them, Nigamakalpatarorgalitamphalam, the most confidential pastimes described in the Bhagavatam are very special and they are described by confidential devotee Sukhadeva Goswami. In the Vedanta sutras or the Upanishads there is only a hint of the confidential parts of his pastimes.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna the personality of Godhead is completely a spiritual personality no tinge of any materiality in his personality he looks like an ordinary person but he is not an ordinary person"
**Summary:** This segment explains the transcendental nature of Krishna, emphasizing that he is a completely spiritual personality, and that his activities (Leela) may appear ordinary but are actually expressions of divine love.

In such Vedic literatures as the Upanishads, the Lord has explained to us that the Lord has expressively been distinguished from the mundane conception of his existence. The Upanishads are describing the transcendental nature of the absolute truth completely separated from the material nature. In the Bhagavad Gita, in the second chapter elaborately it is explained in the second chapter that the soul is not, the soul itself is non-material, the spirit, and so is Krishna. The personality of Godhead is completely a spiritual personality, no tinge of any materiality in his personality. He looks like an ordinary person, but he is not an ordinary person. He looks like a limited person, but he is unlimited personality. He looks like he is incapable when he's chastised by mother Yashoda and he becomes afraid of her punishment. It appears like if a child is afraid of the mother then that child is not any great personality, but Krishna is performing his Leela in his activities in relationship of love with mother Yashoda. This we can understand if we hear the Bhagavatam from Sukhadeva Goswami or from a representative of Sukhadeva Goswami like Srila Prabhupada.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is fully present in that sound Krishna so when you say Krishna Krishna appears in the form the sound and he purifies you if you touch him by your consciousness your consciousness becomes completely surcharged with devotion"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's spiritual qualities, highlighting that his name is non-different from him and that chanting it purifies one's consciousness, leading to attraction to Krishna.

Or from a representative of Sukhadeva Goswami like Srila Prabhupada. They know the confidential nature of such activities of Krishna. So the nature of Krishna's personality has to be understood carefully from the right source. So further Srila Prabhupada says, his identity being fully spiritual, his form, name, quality, and paraphernalia have been elaborately distinguished from matter. They are not material. This form is not material. Our form is completely material. His name is not a material name. That means there are no material qualities when we designate this object as a table. It is entitled actually, is nominated as the author of a census, which means it has been talked about in materialist literature all the way to the recent decades when it is designation of the object itself, it is not the object itself. The name table or the sound table is not the object table, whereas Krishna, when you say Krishna, it's not a name which is indicating Krishna. The name Krishna is Krishna, is the person Krishna. So Krishna is fully present in that sound Krishna. So when you say Krishna, Krishna appears in the form, the sound, and he purifies you. If you touch him by your consciousness, your consciousness becomes completely surcharged with devotion, with bhakti, with love for Krishna. So that is name of Krishna, Krishna namah. His qualities, all his qualities are spiritual, transcendental. That means if Krishna is attractive, that attractive feature of his personality is a transcendental feature. That means once we become attracted to Krishna, nothing else in this material world will be attractive to us. All other attractions will pale into insignificance.

**Key Quote:** "This verse explains krishna is all attractive means he attracts everyone and how does he do so by his unlimited attractive qualities he is a reservoir of all wonderful qualities and each person is attracted by one particular quality of krishna"
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by discussing the all-attractive nature of Krishna, explaining that he possesses unlimited qualities that attract different individuals, and that uncovering one's heart leads to attraction to Krishna through bhakti.

When we get attracted by Krishna. This is very nicely explained by Sri Chaitanya Maha Prabhu in the 61 meanings of the Atmarama verse of the Bhagavatam. There is one verse in the Bhagavatam which describes the all attractive feature of Krishna's personality. This verse explains Krishna is all attractive, means he attracts everyone, and how does he do so? By his unlimited attractive qualities. He is a reservoir of all wonderful qualities and each person is attracted by one particular quality of Krishna because that is their nature. Somebody is attracted by Krishna's beauty, somebody is attracted by Krishna's wealth, somebody is attracted by Krishna's kindness, somebody is attracted by Krishna's love. Of course love is a general thing, everybody is attracted by Krishna's love because everyone has a loving relationship with Krishna, but different qualities of Krishna attract different persons and how many qualities that Krishna possess? Unlimited qualities. The sum total of all qualities which are possessed by anybody or all the people, those are the reservoir of qualities in Krishna. All good qualities Krishna possesses and he attracts. So right now our condition is that we are covered, so we are unable to experience that attraction of Krishna. So when we uncover our heart immediately we get attracted to Krishna. That is actually the process of bhakti. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna incarnates in every yuga to show his mercy towards the faithful devotees, to protect them and to destroy all these animal-like kings and administrators."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (1.10.25) and explains that Krishna incarnates in every yuga to protect devotees and destroy evil, attracting conditioned souls back to Godhead.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 25th verse of the 10th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam: Yadahi Adharmena Tamodhiyo Nripa Jeevanti Tatreshahi Satvatah Kila Dhatte Bhagam Satyam Ritam Dayam Yasho Bhavaya Rupani Dadhat Yuge Yuge. The meaning of this verse is: Whenever there are kings and administrators living like animals in the lowest modes of existence, the Lord in his transcendental form manifests his supreme power, the truth positive, shows special mercy to the faithful, performs wonderful activities, and manifests various transcendental forms as is necessary in different periods and ages. So this is the understanding of the pure devotees, that Krishna incarnates in every yuga to show his mercy towards the faithful devotees, to protect them, and to destroy all these animal-like kings and administrators in the lowest modes of existence, and to also, most importantly, perform his wonderful activities to attract the conditioned souls to go back to Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "This world we think it belongs to us but actually it belongs to Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that everything belongs to Krishna and we are entitled to only what we need to execute our prescribed duties, emphasizing the concept of divine ownership.

To go back to his personal abode with him, live with him eternally, a life of bliss and knowledge and eternal life. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, as mentioned above, the cosmic creation is the property of the Supreme Lord. This world, we think it belongs to us, but actually it belongs to Krishna. This is the basic philosophy of the Isha Upanishad. The first to punish it among all the punishments, Isha Upanishad, there it is explained, every one of us is a part of the Supreme Lord, and we are all part of the Supreme Lord. Everything is the property of the Supreme being: Isha vasya idam sarvam yatkincha jagattyam jagat. So therefore, no one should encroach upon the property of the Supreme Lord: tena tyaktena bunjitha maa grudakasya svidhanam. One should accept only what is kindly awarded by him. Therefore, the earth or any other planet or universe is the absolute property of the Supreme Lord Krishna. The living beings are certainly his parts and parcels or sons, and thus every one of them has a right to live at the mercy of the Lord to execute his prescribed work. It belongs to Krishna does not mean we are not entitled to any portion of any resource in this world. It doesn't mean that. We have an entitlement as his son, as his child, as his amsha, but we have a right to only a tiny portion which is our actual requirement for executing the prescribed duties.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The authority given to a king to rule over the citizens or for that matter a government to rule over the people is for the sake of executing the will of the Lord that everybody gets their due share to execute their prescribed duty."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the role of kings and administrators as representatives of the Lord, contrasting ideal leadership with the degradation caused by ignorance and self-interest.

No one therefore can encroach upon the right of another individual man or animal without being so sanctioned by the Lord. The Lord's sanction is required if we have to encroach upon others. We cannot encroach, and if we do so unlawfully, we are punishable by the laws of Krishna, called the laws of material nature, the laws of God. The king or the administrator is a representative of the Lord to look after the management of the Lord's will. The authority given to a king to rule over the citizens, or for that matter a government to rule over the people, is for the sake of executing the will of the Lord, that everybody gets their due share to execute their prescribed duty. The king therefore must be a recognized person like Maharaj Yudhishtira or Maharaj Pariksit. Such kings have full responsibility and knowledge from authorities about the administration of the world. They were responsible kings, they were the ideal kings. They ensured that everybody had their quota. There was no scarcity of any material resource. So everybody was happy, everybody was living peacefully, and they were executing their duties very nicely, and everything was very nice in this world. But at times, due to the influence of the ignorance mode of material nature, tamo guna, the lowest of the material modes, kings and administrators come into power without knowledge and responsibility. And such foolish administrators live like animals for the sake of their own personal interest. Irresponsible kings, irresponsible government heads. They live a lavish life. They think they have captured power by dint of their own prowess, and they exploit the resources of material nature.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the negative consequences of irresponsible leadership, including anarchy, corruption, and suffering, especially prevalent in Kali Yuga.

Subtitles by the Amara.org community. They exploit people. They exploit the wealth which they gather as taxes. And they enjoy and lead a luxurious life without any sense of responsibility. The result is that the whole atmosphere becomes surcharged with anarchy and vicious elements. Naturally such kings cannot rule properly when they don't have the sense of responsibility, when they don't have the proper knowledge, don't have proper understanding. Then in ignorance, darkness of ignorance, they are not able to rule properly. Nepotism, bribery, cheating, aggression, and therefore famine, epidemic, war, and similar other disturbing features become prominent in human society. We see this, especially in this age. As Kali Yuga progresses, we will see more of this. Because the people are unable to understand what kind of ruler will actually be the ideal administrator. They elect somebody who promises some sense enjoyment. Because foolish people think, my only need is to satisfy my senses. They don't understand the responsibility in the human form of life is to engage in activities of self-realization and thereby make an all-around solution to all problems in this world. That people do not know. So they elect the wrong type of leader, and as a result, they suffer due to ignorance. And gradually the situation becomes goes from bad to worse.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "All these symptoms indicate the time of an incarnation of the Lord to reestablish the principles of religion and to vanquish the maladministrators."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the persecution of devotees and the rise of irreligion signal the time for the Lord's incarnation to restore Dharma, referencing the Bhagavad Gita.

That's what happens. And as regards the devotees of the Lord, or the faithful, they are persecuted by such leaders who are in the mode of ignorance. All these symptoms indicate the time of an incarnation of the Lord to reestablish the principles of religion and to vanquish the maladministrators. This is also confirmed in the Bhagavad Gita: yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata... abhyuttānam adharmasya. When irreligion becomes too prominent and people neglect the real religious principles, the codes of God, then yadātmānamsrujāmyaham, Krishna says, I appear then as an incarnation. The Lord then appears in his transcendental form without any tinge of material qualities. Whichever the form, Narsimha, Varaha, or Krishna, Rama, all are transcendental forms of the Lord. No tinge of material quality. There is no material quality at all. Completely spiritual qualities. He descends just to keep the state of his creation in normal condition. And it becomes abnormal. Krishna restores normalcy.

**Key Quote:** "The normal condition is that the Lord has provided each and every planet with all the needs of the native living beings."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how Krishna provides for all beings and created the material world to fulfill material desires while also offering a path to liberation through following the scriptures.

The normal condition is that the Lord has provided each and every planet with all the needs of the native living beings. If we are meant to stay on the earth planet, Krishna has provided on this earth planet everything necessary for our living comfortably and mainly for executing our prescribed duties to prepare ourselves to get out of material entanglement and go back to Godhead. They can live happily and execute their predestined occupations and attain salvation at the end, following the rules and regulations mentioned in the revealed scriptures. Everything is given by Krishna. The shastras are giving us the knowledge, information about who we are, what are our duties, what are our necessities, what is the way of securing those necessities, how should we perform our duties, and how we can prepare ourselves to attain salvation or liberation at the end of this life, especially human beings. The material world is created to satisfy the whims of the Nityabhadra or everlasting conditioned souls. We are called eternally conditioned because we cannot trace the beginning of our material existence. But nevertheless, Krishna has created this world in such a way that we can try to satisfy our material desires. At the same time, when we follow the shastras, we can also prepare ourselves to attain ultimate liberation. Both are both the purposes are there in creating this world. Actually, because we have material desires for sense enjoyment, Krishna has created this world, otherwise there would be no need of creating this world if we didn't have material desires.

**Key Quote:** "When people become intoxicated with the power of material science to exploit the resources unlawfully without the sanction of the Lord and that also only for sense gratification, there is necessity of the Lord's incarnation to chastise the rebellious and to protect the faithful."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that the Lord incarnates to punish those intoxicated by material power and exploiting resources unlawfully, while protecting the faithful and re-establishing Dharma.

When people become intoxicated with the power of material science to exploit the resources unlawfully without the sanction of the Lord, and that also only for sense gratification, there is necessity of the Lord's incarnation to chastise the rebellious and to protect the faithful. So here Prabhupada is explaining when does the Lord incarnate? When people become too much intoxicated by some material power. They go on exploiting, and a stage comes when they become intoxicated with the power, we can do whatever we like, we have amassed so much of wealth, we have so much of technology, we can do whatever we want, but actually the stringent laws of nature are always working, and these foolish people cannot understand how the laws are working. So the Lord incarnates at such times, so when He descends, He exhibits His superhuman acts just to prove His supreme right, and materialists like Ravana, Hiranyakashipu, and Kamsa are sufficiently punished. The Lord punishes all these miscreants, and He protects His devotees and re-establishes Dharma. So this happens periodically that is what is being explained in this verse. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

### Krishna's Appearance vs. Birth, Internal Potency, Transcendental Activities

**Verse References:** BG 4.09
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Lord appears in a particular family or place by his inconceivable potency."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the difference between Krishna's appearance and the birth of conditioned souls, emphasizing that Krishna appears through his internal potency and his activities are transcendental.

In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, in the Bhagavad Gita, the personality of Godhead, Sri Krishna, has expressively given a description of his transcendental appearance, disappearance, and activities. Particularly in the fourth chapter, Krishna describes that even though he is unborn, he definitely does appear in this material world by his internal potency. All of us in this material world, we appear or we take birth by the force of the external energy, the illusory energy of Krishna. But Krishna appears by his internal potency, spiritual potency. So there is a very, very, very big difference between the two. There is a big difference between Krishna's appearance and our taking birth. There is a big difference. And therefore, his birth is specifically called appearance. And his, Krishna does not die. So it's called disappearance. When Krishna is out. When Krishna is out of our vision, then it is described as disappearance, and both of them are transcendental, and even his activities are completely transcendental, completely spiritual. Janma Karma Chame Divyam Evam Yo Vetthi Tatvatah. This is described by Krishna in the fourth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. That is being cited by Srila Prabhupada. He will show us this story in this purport. Further, Srila Prabhupada says, The Lord appears in a particular family or place by his inconceivable potency. That is his internal potency, his spiritual potency, his personal potency. And it is inconceivable how that internal energy is working. How that internal energy is working. He does not take his birth as a conditioned soul, quits his body and acts as another body.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna never accepts any material body. Krishna never comes in contact with the material energy."
**Summary:** This segment contrasts the nature of a conditioned soul, bound by material energy, with Krishna, who never comes into contact with it and whose form is eternal and unchanging.

Conditioned soul, this has been used a few times earlier. Conditioned means completely under the control of the conditions of this material world, imposed by the external energy. And we are all spirit soul, but our spiritual nature is covered by this conditioning of the material nature. So we take birth after we quit one body. We are forced to accept another material. Krishna never accepts any material body. Krishna never comes in contact with the material energy. This is the mystery, how he appears to take birth like another human being, but he is not taking birth. Ajop is an avyayatma. His transcendental form never deteriorates. Our form, this form, it is constant. It is constantly changing. It is constantly changing. Krishna's form never changes. Krishna is always in his transcendental form, eternally. The same supreme personality of Godhead without any change in position, without any change in his qualities, without any change in his opulences. He always is the supreme lord, always is the owner, enjoyer, controller of all the opulences in existence.

### Sun Analogy, Krishna's Appearance and Disappearance, Liberation through Understanding Krishna

**Verse References:** BG 4.09
**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "His birth is like the appearance and disappearance of the sun."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of the sun's rising and setting, the speaker explains that Krishna's appearance and disappearance are not like ordinary births and deaths, and understanding this truth leads to liberation.

So that unique position of Krishna is unchanged. Therefore it is said here, he does not take his birth like a conditioned soul. His birth is like the appearance and disappearance of the sun. Srila Prabhupada is giving one example. The sun, which we can relate with, because we have experience of seeing the sun rise and set every single day. The sun arises from the eastern horizon, but that does not mean that the eastern horizon is the parent of the sun. Is it that the sun is being generated out of the eastern horizon? No. The sun exists. Even before it appears on the eastern horizon, the sun is existing. In its position, relative to our vision, the sun becomes visible in the eastern horizon at a certain time. And about 12 hours later, the sun sets on the western horizon. The sun is existent in every part of the solar system. But he becomes visible at a scheduled time. And so also becomes invisible at another scheduled time. Sunrise, sunset. Becomes visible at sunrise. And the sun becomes invisible at sunset. So this is a very good example to help us understand. Similarly, the Lord appears in this universe like the sun and again leaves our sight at another time. He exists at all times at every place. Krishna is present everywhere. And always He is present. But by His causeless mercy, when He appears before us, we take it for granted that He has taken His birth. janma karma chame divyam. Anyone who can understand this truth in terms of the statements of revealed scriptures certainly becomes liberated just after quitting the present body. That is told by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti.

### Liberation, Spiritual Knowledge, Importance of Hearing Krishna's Glories

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "But simply by knowing in truth about the Lord's transcendental births and activities, one can get liberation at once."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the path to liberation, contrasting the difficult path of many lifetimes with the immediate liberation attainable by understanding Krishna's transcendental nature and activities through scriptures like the Srimad Bhagavatam and Bhagavad Gita.

When quitting the body, the present body, one who understands the truth in terms of the statements of the shastras, the revealed scriptures, such a person does not take his birth again in this material world. Instead, returns to Krishna loka, Krishna's personal abode in the spiritual world. So liberation is obtainable after many births and after great endeavor in patience and perseverance in knowledge and renunciation. Generally, liberation is not easy. The scriptures describe liberation is after many, many, many births, millions of lifetimes. And that also, after great endeavor, what is that endeavor? In cultivating spiritual knowledge and developing material detachment. These two are very important factors for liberation. But simply by knowing in truth about the Lord's transcendental births and activities, one can get liberation at once. Therefore, the importance of hearing the glories of Krishna's appearance and activities from the Srimad Bhagavatam, from the Bhagavad Gita. Of course, Bhagavatam contains much more details about Krishna's appearance and activities in his various incarnations, especially in his incarnation as Krishna. This is what is explained in the Bhagavad Gita,

### Ignorance and Atheism, Transcendental Arrangements, Fortunate Souls in Krishna's Company

**Key Quote:** "It is simply by knowing the transcendental nature of birth and activities of Lord Krishna, one can get liberation easily."
**Summary:** The speaker warns against the ignorance of atheists who see Krishna as an ordinary human, emphasizes the transcendental arrangements of Krishna's birth, and highlights the immense fortune of those who directly associated with Krishna during his earthly pastimes, concluding with the glorification of the Yadu dynasty and Mathura by the ladies of Hastinapur.

so far whatever Prabhupada has said. But those who are in the darkness of ignorance conclude that the Lord's birth and activities in the material world are similar to those of ordinary living beings, atheists and materialistic persons. They think Krishna is just another human being, which is completely wrong. Such imperfect conclusions cannot give anyone liberation. So they are unable to get liberation by coming to such wrong conclusions. His birth, therefore, in the family of King Yadu as the son of King Vasudeva and his transfer into the family of Nanda Maharaj in the land of Mathura are all transcendental arrangements made by the internal potency of the Lord. The internal potency is working to make this happen. The fortunes of the Yadu dynasty and that of the inhabitants of the land of Mathura cannot be materially estimated. How very, very fortunate they are. It is simply by knowing the transcendental nature of birth and activities of Lord Krishna, one can get liberation easily. We can just imagine what is in store for those who actually enjoyed the company of the Lord in person as a family member or as a neighbor. Krishna appeared and there were so many fortunate souls who were accompanying Krishna in his Leela in Mathura, in the Yadu dynasty, in Vrindavan. Very, very, very fortunate. So there is no doubt about their great fortune and therefore the ladies of Hastinapur are glorifying the Yadu dynasty and the land of Mathura. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "So, when Krishna descends, Krishna brings with him his transcendental abode."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Dwaraka's glories surpass even the heavenly planets because Krishna resides there, bringing his transcendental abode and associates with him.

The meaning of this verse is, undoubtedly, it is wonderful that Dwaraka has defeated the glories of the heavenly planets and has enhanced the celebrity of the earth. The inhabitants of Dwaraka are always seeing the soul of all living beings, Krishna, in his loving feature. He glances at them and favors them with sweet smiles. So, this is another description by the ladies of Hastinapura about the good fortune of the residents of Dwaraka, that they are always able to see Krishna, because Krishna lives in Dwaraka, resides in Dwaraka. And, glories of Dwaraka are many, many times greater than the glories of the heavenly planets. For somebody who is a resident of the earth, heavenly planets are many times superior. But, for residents of Dwaraka, even though they are on the earth planet, Dwaraka is not like any other place on the earth, ordinary place on the earth. No, it is a very special place, because Krishna has descended. So, when Krishna descends, Krishna brings with him his transcendental abode. This is the special thing about Krishna's appearance on this world. He brings with him his transcendental abode. His personal associates of the spiritual world come with him. His opulences are about Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Indra summoned samvarthaka clouds to pour down devastating rainfall in Vrindavan so this is the power of Indra he has the power to summon different clouds to pour rain in different parts of this earth planet or even the other planets"
**Summary:** The speaker describes the heavenly planets and their inhabitants, the demigods, highlighting Indra's power and contrasting this knowledge with modern misconceptions perpetuated by scientists.

Very special that is being described here. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, the heavenly planets are inhabited by demigods like Indra, Chandra, Varuna, and Vayu, and the pious souls reach there after performance of many virtuous acts on earth. So modern day people in general do not know what is heavenly planets. For galoka, they know there are many different planets which we see in the night sky, but they do not know the living conditions because they are misinformed by the so-called scientists that there is no gonna taste anything here is only like scientists no life on other planets. That's totally wrong. There is life on every planet in the entire universe, and there are different grades of living beings with different kinds of bodies suitable for living in each of the planets. So the heavenly planets are inhabited by devatas, Indra, Chandra, Varuna. So Indra, what is his power? What is his position? Please understand, he controls the rainfall on all the planets in the entire universe. So he is not a small person. He's not another comparable person to somebody on this earth planet. No, he is in a very, very, very powerful position. In one of the pastimes of Krishna described in the tenth canto of the Bhagavatam, it is mentioned that Indra summoned samvarthaka clouds to pour down devastating rainfall in Vrindavan. So this is the power of Indra. He has the power to summon different clouds to pour rain in different parts of this earth planet or even the other planets. So there is a, there are a set of clouds called samvarthaka clouds. They are summoned

**Key Quote:** "From the revealed scriptures we understand the duration of life on the heavenly planets is 10,000 years by our calculation."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of revealed scriptures for understanding the heavenly planets, including their time scales, enhanced facilities, and the beauty of their inhabitants.

by Indra to pour down devastating rainfall. At the end of Brahma's day, the middle and lower planetary systems are submerged by the waters of devastation. These are all unknown to people of the modern age who are not taking information from the revealed scriptures. They limit their knowledge to whatever they study in schools and colleges and whatever little research of the so-called scientists and other philosophers reveals to them. Their limit and knowledge is very, very poor. Poor fund of knowledge is, Prabhupada says. But from the scriptures, revealed scriptures, we get so much of knowledge about the heavenly planets, about the still higher planetary systems, Brahma loka, and even the spiritual world. That is special thing about the revealed scriptures. Now, to reach these heavenly planets, you cannot force yourself by trying to manufacture one space capsule or some space vehicle. What is that? Lunar Explorer, Mars Explorer. No, you cannot go to those, maybe the planets which presented as revealed scriptures planets by those vehicles. It is only possible to reach there after performance of pious activities as described in the scriptures. There is a qualification required to go. Modern scientists agree that the timing arrangement in the higher planetary system is different from that of the imaginands which is human oriented natural population called long that of the seasoning planets or why COBs are nototer personality system. Modern scientists agree that the timing arrangement in the higher planetary systems is different. The earth time is related. So therefore, from the revealed scriptures, we understand the duration of life on the heavenly planets is 10,000 years by our calculation. 10,000 years by our calculation. That's the duration of life of the inhabitants of the heavenly planets. How is that? Six months on earth is equal to one day on the heavenly planets and similar duration is the night. So if you consider one day and night on the heavenly planets, it amounts to one complete solar year on the earth. Facilities of enjoyment are also similarly enhanced and the beauty of the inhabitants is there legendary. There are many, many times more beautiful inhabitants of the heavenly planets than the inhabitants of this earth planet and they have much, much greater facilities for their material enjoyment. Common men on the earth are very much fond of reaching the heavenly planets, of course this

### Dwaraka, Vrindavan, Mathura, Krishna's Leela, Holy Places

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "These places are perpetually sanctified because whenever the Lord descends on earth, he displays his transcendental activities, particularly in these three places."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Dwaraka, Vrindavan, and Mathura are more important than the heavenly planets because Krishna performed his pastimes there, making them perpetually holy.

Considering all this, the heavenly planets are more celebrated than the earth. Definitely heavenly planets are much, much superior to the earth planet. But the celebrity of earth has defeated that of the heavenly planets because of Dvārakā where Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa reigned as king. This is a description of the standard of living of the inhabitants of Dvārakā when Kṛṣṇa was ruling 5000 years back. When Kṛṣṇa appeared. That is described in 10th canto. Very nice description is there. Detailed description. So when Kṛṣṇa appeared, three places namely Vṛndāvana, Mathura and Dvārakā are more important than the famous planets within the sky. Because they spread Democratic, nor do dairy. So Kṛṣṇa was born in Mathura, He was transferred to Vṛndāvana and after some 12 years or so in Vṛndāvana, He went back to Mathura and from Mathura he went to Dvārakā. So all these three places where Krishna performed his leela, his pastimes, are very, very, very special. They are more important than the most famous planets of this entire universe. These places are perpetually sanctified because whenever the Lord descends on earth, he displays his transcendental activities, particularly in these three places. Krishna chooses where he wants to perform his leela when he appears on this earth. These are the three places.

### Devotees, Krishna's Association, Eternal Position, Spiritual World

**Verse References:** BG 4.9
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Our actual position is in relationship with Krishna, in his association."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how devotees can still relish Krishna's pastimes and emphasizes the importance of our eternal position in relationship with Krishna, leading to the spiritual world.

They are perpetually the holy lands of the Lord, and the inhabitants still take advantage of the holy places, even though the Lord is now out of their sight. Even now there are devotees in Dwarka, in Mathura, in Vrindavan, who are relishing the Lord's pastimes by remembering his leelas, by meditating on his transcendental form, by hearing his glories from bona fide devotees like that. The Lord is the soul of all living beings, and he desires always to have, to be a part of the living beings in their swaroopa, in their constitutional position to participate in transcendental life, in his association. What is our actual position? It's not the position we have now, or not the positions we aspire in our ordinary material life. No, that's not our actual position. Our actual position is in relationship with Krishna, in his association. It is a spiritual position, free from all the shackles of the world. It is a spiritual position, free from all the shackles of the world. Free from all these material defects, material inebriaties, material insufficiencies. So we have got what is called as our eternal position in relationship with Krishna called svaroopa, that's our original position, and in that position we are with Krishna transcendental pastimes and experiencing the highest bliss, eternal life full of knowledge, his attractive features are sweet, very, very, very nice and his sweet smiles go deep into the heart of everyone and once it is so done, the living being is admitted into the kingdom of God. Just one glance of Krishna with his sweet smile on anyone will attract that person to actually go to the kingdom of Krishna in the spiritual world.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the heavenly planets, from which one returns after exhausting pious credits, with the abode of the Lord, from which one never returns.

And having gone there, Bhagavad Gita says one never returns to this material world ever again. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad Gita. The heavenly planets may be very famous for offering better facilities of material enjoyment, but we learn that in the Bhagavad Gita, it is said, if one goes to the heavenly planets, one comes back to this earth planet after exhausting this pious credits. But once having gone to

### Krishna's devotees, purification, tapasya
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/atipl2O96aE?t=52
**Verse References:** SB 1.10.28
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Lot of tapasya they have done to get that position."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse and explains that the intimate devotees of Krishna, like the wives and gopis, attained their position through vows, sacrifices, and worship, emphasizing the importance of purification.

In this session, we will be discussing the 28th verse of the 10th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavad Gita. The meaning of this verse is: O friends, just think of his wives whose hands he had to bear to marry her. How they must have undergone vows, baths, fire sacrifices, and perfect worship of the Lord of the universe to constantly relish now the nectar from his lips by kissing. The damsels of Raja Bhoomi would often faint just by expecting such favors. So among the inhabitants of Dwara, particularly the ladies of Hastinapur, are glorifying the wives of Krishna and the gopis of Vrindavan. They are very intimately associated with Krishna. They are the intimate devotees of Krishna. And they are being described here that they do not get that position simply by desiring to have that position. They must have undergone vows, baths, fire sacrifices, and perfect worship of Krishna, who is the Lord of the universe. Lot of tapasya they have done to get that position.

### purification, devotional service, karma vs bhakti

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "There is a lot of difference between bhakti and karma. Bhakti is completely spiritual. Karma is material."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's purport is discussed, highlighting the need to purify material qualities through religious rituals to render transcendental service to Krishna, differentiating between material karma and spiritual bhakti.

That's what is being described here. Now, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport: Religious rites prescribed in the scriptures are meant to purify the mundane qualities of the conditioned souls. Mundane qualities means material qualities. And these material qualities are to be purified. Because we are spirit soul, we are spiritual by nature, we have spiritual qualities which are covered by material body, by material mind, covered with material qualities. So the religious rituals described in the scriptures are meant to purify the mundane qualities of the conditioned souls by these material qualities. And what will happen if we get purified? We are gradually promoted to the stage of rendering transcendental service to the Supreme Lord Krishna. So this purification is necessary for elevating us gradually to the stage of being able to serve Krishna, to be able to recognize and render devotional service to Krishna. So devotional service is not an ordinary activity, and not everybody can take to devotional service simply by desiring or deciding to do so. No. There is a lot of difference between bhakti and karma. Bhakti is completely spiritual. Karma is material. Karma may be performed by any human being, but bhakti is only for those who are purified by the right process described in the scriptures, the religious rituals for purification. And only then one can actually begin devotional service to Krishna.

### Swarupa, liberation, loving service
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/atipl2O96aE?t=320
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Liberation means renovation of this stage of Swarupa."
**Summary:** The concept of Swarupa (factual identity) is explained as the highest perfection and liberation, emphasizing the importance of establishing a loving relationship with Krishna through five phases of loving service.

Further, Srila Prabhupada says, "Attainment of this stage of pure spiritual life is the highest perfection." And this stage is called Swarupa. This was mentioned in the previous verse also by Prabhupada. Swarupa. What is Swarupa? The factual identity of the living being. Each one of us, we have got a spiritual identity. The spiritual identity is called Swarupa. It's our original position in our relationship with Krishna in the spiritual world, in his association. It is a perfection, the highest perfection to be attained. Liberation means renovation of this stage of Swarupa. This is what Bhagavatam describes. Sometimes people think liberation means going to the heavenly planets. Sometimes they think liberation means merging into some void. Sometimes they think liberation means getting some mystic powers. But that is not liberation, even though they may be desired by somebody who is suffering in this material world. As freedom from suffering through these methods is possible to some extent, but ultimately, real liberation is not just freedom from suffering. Of course, those who are really liberated are free from all suffering. But beyond that, they are established in their Swarupa, in their loving relationship with Krishna. In that, they are free from suffering. And in that perfect stage of Swarupa, the living being is established in five phases of loving service. This is described in detail in the Bhakti Samrita Sindhu, which describes what is Bhakti? What is the kind of relationship in Bhakti? What are the different kinds of relationships? What is the relationship between the two? Five kinds of relationships, depending on the five kinds of service that one renders to Krishna: Shanta, Das, Chesav, Kya, Vatsalya, Madhurya.

### Krishna's perfection, devotee's love, Madhurya Rasa, Swakhiya, Parakhiya
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/atipl2O96aE?t=475

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna however in spite of being full in himself he becomes a master a friend a son or a husband to fulfill the intense love of the devotee concern"
**Summary:** Krishna's self-sufficiency and his willingness to reciprocate the love of his devotees are discussed, along with the different relationships (Madhurya Rasa) and the distinction between Swakhiya (married queens) and Parakhiya (unmarried gopis) relationships with Krishna.

Of these five, the stage of Madhurya Rasa, or the humor of conjugal love, is one of the five, and it is the topmost. The Lord is always perfect in himself. Thus, he is perfect in himself. There is no hankering for himself. It is not that Krishna wants some enjoyment in association with the gopis or the queens, the most beautiful personalities, because he is lacking in any way. No, Krishna is never lacking. Krishna is always full in himself. Purna, he is completely full in himself. He is the most beautiful personality. He is the greatest, and he's independent because he's full. He's independent, so he is not hankering as we, the souls of this material world, are always incomplete, imperfect. Therefore, we have a hankering. We want, so we are lacking, therefore we want. Krishna is never lacking, never eternally. He is full, perfect, completely full. Krishna, however, in spite of being full in himself, he becomes a master, a friend, a son, or a husband to fulfill the intense love of the devotee. It is a devotee's loving service to Krishna that Krishna agrees to become the master of the loving servant, the husband of the loving wife, the son of the loving mother or loving father, the friend of another loving friend. So Krishna agrees out of his causeless mercy, out of his kindness. So in this particular description of this verse, two classes of devotees of the Lord are mentioned in the stage of conjugal love: the Queens and the Gopis in Vrindavan, the Queens in Dwaraka and Gopis in Vrindavan, two classes of devotees who are situated in Madhuriya-rasa relationship. One is called Swakhiya, and other is called Parakhiya. This is very important to understand. Both of them are in conjugal love with Krishna, but there is a difference. The Queens at Dwaraka were Swakhiya relationship, or duly married wives of Dwaraka. That means there is a relationship because of being married.

### Gopis, Queens, penances, Swaroopa, transcendental loving service

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "All those things are not end in themselves, but they are means to attain the highest stage of Swaroopa."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the penances undertaken by the gopis and queens to attain their positions, emphasizing that rituals and knowledge are means to achieve Swaroopa and render transcendental loving service to the Lord.

Krishna married 16,108 princesses, and they became, after marriage, his Queens in Dwaraka. Whereas the damsels of Vraja, the Gopis, young Gopis, the young friends of Lord, were his friends in Vrindavan when he was unmarried, when he was a boy. The Lord stayed at Vrindavan till the age of 16, and his friendly relations with the neighboring girls were in terms of Parakhiya. Parakhiya means it is not a relationship of conjugal love. Conjugal love means love between opposite genders, male and female. So this relationship is not due to marriage. Now these girls in Vrindavan, the Gopis, young Gopis, as well as the Queens, underwent severe penances by taking vows, bathing, and offering sacrifices in the fire as prescribed in the scriptures. How did they reach that position of becoming the beloved of Krishna, as the queen or as the Gopis? It is by undergoing severe penances that is being described in this verse. Now, the rights as they are not an end in themselves, what is described in this Shastra as the tapasya or some rata or some yagna, some dana or some yagna. All those things are not end in themselves, but they are means to attain the highest stage of Swaroopa, including the descriptions of different pious activities, different types of cultivation of knowledge, transcendental knowledge, or even perfect knowledge. Perfection in mystic powers, getting siddhis. So, jnana, karma, and siddhi, all these are not end in themselves. The ultimate perfection of these attainments is to reach the highest stage of Swaroopa, to render constitutional transcendentalism.

**Key Quote:** "And it is a transcendental position. It is not a material position."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing that the loving exchanges with Krishna are transcendental, not material, and highlights the involvement of figures like Shukadeva Goswami and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in these topics, reinforcing the spiritual nature of the subject.

To render transcendental loving service to the Lord. That is the goal. So, we should understand carefully that the kissing of the Lord, either by his wives or the gopis, is not a material act or a material quality. No. If it is material, then it is not a material act. Then Shukadeva Goswami would never have even cared to mention it in the 10th canto of the Bhagavad Gita, because Shukadeva Goswami is a very, very strict brahmachari, and he is completely free from all material desires. So, he has no interest in any material activities. He is only interested in spiritual activities. Therefore, Shukadeva Goswami elaborately described Krishna's pastimes. And even Chaitanya Mahaprabhu participated in this subject matter, even though he was a very strict sannyasi. So, therefore, we should understand this stage is attained only after severe penances of many, many, many lifetimes, and it is a transcendental position. It is not a material position.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 29th verse of the 10th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. या वीर्य शुल्केन रुता स्वयंबरे प्रमत्य चैद्य प्रमुखान्ही शुष्मिनहा प्रद्युम्न साम्भांब सुतादयो अपरा याश्चाहृता भव्म वधे सहस्रशः The meaning of this verse is: the children of these ladies are प्रद्युम्न साम्भांब अम्ब etc. Ladies like Rukmini, Satyabhama, and Jambavati were forcibly taken away by him from their Swayamvara ceremonies after he defeated many powerful kings headed by Shishupala, and other ladies were also forcibly taken away by him after he killed Bhomasura and thousands of his assistants. All of these ladies are glorious. So the ladies of Hastinapura are glorifying the children of Krishna when he was in Dwarka.

married to so many queens, and even the queens, they are very glorious because Krishna had to fight against very powerful Kshatriyas in order to take them away in Swayamvara ceremony. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "Exceptionally qualified daughters of powerful kings were allowed to make a choice of their own bridegrooms in open competition, and such ceremonies were called Swayamvara or selection of the bridegroom." In the Vedic culture, generally the parents of the girl who is to be married will make the selection of the boy. The girls are not given a free hand in selecting their own. The boy whom they want to marry, they can select on their own. But an exception is when the qualified daughter of a powerful king is to be married, then she will marry the most competent or chivalrous Kshatriya by selecting one who is victorious in a competition. Just like even Lord Ramachandra, he married

the most powerful Kshatriya in Swayamvara ceremony. Janaka Maharaj had organized that the very, very heavy and big bow that had to be strung after lifting it, and nobody was able to do that except Lord Ramachandra. So therefore, Sita was married to Lord Ramachandra. Similarly, Draupadi also, she was married in the Swayamvara ceremony to Arjuna and later on to all the Pandavas, like that even Krishna. He defeated Shishupala and others when Lord Ramachandra were to be smoothed out. Rukmini had actually requested Krishna to actually take her away from being married to Shishupala. It was not exactly a swayamvara, but Krishna had to fight against Shishupala and other kings to take away Rukmini.

**Summary:** Discussion of the Kshatriya spirit, emphasizing the importance of chivalry and sporting competition over personal gain.

So, like this, this selection of bridegroom for exceptionally qualified daughters of powerful kings. Because this swayamvara was an open competition between the rival and valiant princes, such princes were invited by the father of the princes, and usually there were regular fights between the invited princely order in a sporting spirit. So, generally Kshatriyas, they like to fight when challenged or when there is a competition, and it is not done so much in an inimical spirit, not out of enmity, much out of a sporting spirit, much in a sporting spirit. But it so happened. So, sometimes the belligerent princes were killed in such marriage fighting, and the victorious princes offered the trophy princes for whom so many princes died. The Kshatriyas are ready to lay down their lives. They don't hesitate. For them, that chivalrous spirit is more important than marriage. So, they are ready to lay down their lives for the sake of protecting their own life.

Rukmini's father, Bhishmaka, he wanted to marry Rukmini to Lord Krishna, who was the king of Dwaraka. But, her eldest brother, that is the eldest son of Bhishmaka, his name was Rukmini. He wanted that Rukmini be given away to King Shishupala, who happened to be a cousin of Krishna. Shishupala was a cousin of Krishna. He was also the son of a very powerful ruler, Dhamma Gosha.

which is his, the unlimited power, which only belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna, he is never without his powers, he is always the same personality with all his powers, with all his opulences, with all his energies, with all his strength, knowledge, everything, complete, 100% complete. So, unlike the living entities, who bewildered by the material influence, lose their strength or power or knowledge or their opulence or wealth, and the living entities are totally helpless under the clutches of maya, that is not the position of the Supreme Lord, even though he may appear to be a son of another Kshatriya like Vasudeva, but he is not a person of this world, he is not a jiva, he is not a living entity like a spirit soul, he is a Supreme Personality, he is a Supreme Soul, he is always with all his powers. So, there is nothing surprising or astonishing in the descriptions which are given in the shastras about his prowess,

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, only by the manipulation of certain material laws, do they gain some power and try to become the lord of some province or country."
**Summary:** Explaining how even powerful figures like devatas are ultimately controlled by material nature, which is directed by Krishna.

by which he defeats. There are very, very, very powerful demons or powerful kings or powerful personalities or powerful devatas. After all, these devatas or kings or demons, they are under the complete control of material nature. In this material world, they are completely controlled by material nature. This way they only reach salvation and законs or the forthcoming designs of the eternal divine form. Therefore, only by the manipulation of certain material laws, do they gain some power and try to become the lord of some province or country, or state, or official entity, major name of some sovereign authority, or a city, or a status or some millimeters to which it belongs, some states or some planet even or even some planetary systems, but that is only when they are allowed to lord over by the material energy which is directed by Krishna, which belongs to Krishna.

**Summary:** Reiterating Krishna's supremacy and clarifying that Krishna's actions, including fighting, are motivated by the protection of his devotees, not personal need.

So directly or indirectly, everyone is subordinate to Krishna. Everyone, all the created beings, all the living entities who are tiny parts of the Supreme Lord, whether a demon or a devata or a human being or any creature. So Krishna defeats everyone, and in this way, Krishna actually displayed his prowess, and he actually gave shelter to the devotees. All these are devotees. Why should Krishna do this fighting? Not because he is in need of any queen or any woman, no, it is because they are devotees of Krishna.

### Yudhishtira, enlightenment, responsibility, leadership

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Yudhishtira after being enlightened by what was spoken by Bhishma Deva and Lord Sri Krishna the infallible engaged himself in matters of perfect knowledge because all his misgivings were eradicated thus he ruled over the earth and seas and was followed by his younger brothers"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains Srimad Bhagavatam 1.10.3, focusing on Yudhishtira's enlightenment after the Kurukshetra war and his subsequent righteous rule.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 3rd verse of the 10th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Nishamya Bhishmoktam Athachyutoktam Pravritta Vijnana Vidhuta Vibhramaha Shashasa Gaam Indra Iwajitashrayaha Paridhyu Paantam Anujanu Vartitaha. The meaning of this verse is, Maharaj Yudhishtira, after being enlightened by what was spoken by Bhishma Deva and Lord Sri Krishna, the infallible, engaged himself in matters of perfect knowledge because all his misgivings were eradicated. Thus, he ruled over the earth and seas and was followed by his younger brothers. So this verse, Sruti Goswami is describing that just after the battle of Kurukshetra, when Yudhishtira saw that such a huge massacre had taken place, 640 million Kshatriyas were killed in that battle, it is a world war. So Yudhishtira Maharaj thought, "For me to be enthroned as the emperor, so many people had to be killed." He was very much mortified. He was aggrieved by the mass killing. So then he was enlightened by Bhishma Deva and also the Supreme Lord Krishna, and when his misgivings were all gone, then he engaged himself in matters of perfect knowledge. He properly understood what is his responsibility, how he has to rule the kingdom, how he has to guide the citizens. He ruled over the earth and the seas and was followed by his younger brothers. He had four younger brothers. All of them were righteous like him, and all of them followed his footsteps in perfectly assisting him in ruling the entire world.

### primogeniture, religious leadership, Krishna consciousness, proprietorship

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Everything belongs to Krishna"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's purport, discussing the historical context of Yudhishtira's rule, the concept of Krishna as the supreme proprietor, and the ideal mood of a devotee-king.

So Srila Prabhupada explains elaborately in this purport, "The modern English law of primogeniture, or the law of inheritance by the first born, was also prevalent in those days when Maharaj Yudhishtira ruled the earth and the seas." In those days, the king of Hastinapura, which is now part of New Delhi, was the emperor of the world, including the seas, up to the time of Maharaj Pariksit, the grandson of Maharaj Yudhishtira. There was only one king, there was one flag, there was one religion until the time of Maharaj Pariksit at least, as we have information from the records, historical records in the Puranas and the Tehasas. Maharaj Yudhishtira's younger brothers were acting as his ministers and commanders of state, and there was full cooperation between the perfectly religious brothers of the king. There was full cooperation, so there was no fight for supremacy because primarily they are devotees. They accept Krishna as the supreme lord, supreme controller, and if Yudhishtira is sitting on the throne, he is sitting as the representative of Krishna. He is ruling exactly according to the directions given in the shastras by Krishna himself, and therefore there is no question of any one person enjoying. As was mentioned in the first verse, Yudhishtira Maharaj could not have enjoyed freely with unrestricted consciousness, "Oh, this kingdom I have won, now I can enjoy all the power and the wealth and the resources, natural resources." No, that was not his mood. That is never the mood of a devotee. That is never the mood of a religious or righteous person. One should accept only what is necessary for his own subsistence, understanding that everything belongs to Krishna. So nobody can claim proprietorship over what is actually rightfully belonging to the supreme personality of Godhead, who is referred to as Isavasya in the Isha Upanishad, the first of the Upanishads. That Upanishad explains everything belongs to God, everything belongs to Krishna. So Yudhishtira Maharaj never thought, "Oh, this whole kingdom is mine, I can enjoy." No, everything belongs to Krishna. As a representative of Krishna, I should rule according to the codes of direction given in Dharmashastras by Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Yudhishtira was the ideal king or representative of Lord Krishna to rule over the kingdom of earth and was comparable to King Indra the representative ruler of the heavenly planets"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the origin of Vedic knowledge through Brahma and the Parampara system, comparing Yudhishtira to King Indra as a righteous ruler representing the divine will.

Scriptures are ultimately given by God, given by Krishna. Nobody sits and manufactures scriptures, as foolishly sometimes people think that Krishna is God. No, it is given by God at the beginning of creation: Tene Brahma Hrudaya Adikavaye Muhyantiya Tsuraya. In the beginning of creation, the first born creature, Lord Brahma, was instructed in the Vedic knowledge. He was impregnated with Vedic knowledge through the medium of his heart because in the beginning there was only Brahma. So Krishna directly impregnated Vedic knowledge into the heart of Brahma, and Brahma disseminated that knowledge to his sons and disciples, and that way the knowledge is coming down in Parampara. Maharaj Yudhishtira was the ideal king or representative of Lord Krishna to rule over the kingdom of earth and was comparable to King Indra, the representative ruler of the heavenly planets. Just as the Devas, just as the Devatas have Indra as their king who rules exactly according to the principles of the Shastra, same way Yudhishtira was ruling the kingdom of the earth as the representative of Lord Sri Krishna. Prabhupada explains the demigods like Indra, Chandra, Surya, Varuna, and Vayu are representative kings of different planets to the universe. They are their own planets, and they are rulers, but they don't rule whimsically, and they don't try to enjoy some material power or material wealth. No, similarly Maharaj Yudhishtira was also one of them.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Yudhishtira was not a typically unenlightened political leader of modern democracy"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Yudhishtira's enlightened leadership with modern democratic systems, emphasizing the importance of self-realization and returning to the kingdom of God as the ultimate goal of life.

Ruling over the kingdom of the earth. Now an important point about Maharaj Yudhishtira. Srila Prabhupada says, "Maharaj Yudhishtira was not a typically unenlightened political leader of modern democracy." It is noteworthy that in the modern system of government, the democratic system of government, somebody who gathers enough votes, such a person becomes the elected leader of the people, but he is not enlightened in the scriptural directions how to rule the kingdom or how to rule the country because there is a ultimate goal of life that is to be pursued by all human beings under the able leadership of a king like Yudhishtira. What is that goal? The goal is self realization in order to prepare oneself to return to the kingdom of God, to enter into the kingdom of God. That goal, you can understand now, is completely missing in the life of people. Neither the elected leaders are aware of this goal, nor the people themselves are able to ascertain this goal. They do make enquiries what is the goal of life, but they think that life in this world is limited to the duration of time between birth and death. This is all the understanding they have. They don't have understanding of the spiritual reality that each living being is spirit soul and one is changing bodies life after life, but this change of body is actually a botheration, and this material existence is a place of suffering due to the very nature of material existence, and one is meant to become self realized specially in the human form of life and prepare oneself to enter into the kingdom of God where there is no suffering, there is no death, there is no disease. You have heard this many times in earlier sessions that the kingdom of God is the ideal place of inhabitation for all of us, and we should prepare ourselves to go.

### proper authority, scriptural guidance, modern democracy, infallible lord

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Yudhishthira simply has to follow the perfect laws given in the authorized scriptures as instructed by the infallible lord"
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating the importance of learning from proper authorities, following scriptural guidance, and contrasting this with the limitations and ideological conflicts of modern democratic systems, emphasizing the need to follow the infallible Lord's instructions. The session ends with Hare Krishna.

So that is being explained by Prabhupada. Maharaj Yudhishthira was instructed by Bhishma Deva and the infallible Lord also. Therefore, he had full knowledge of everything in perfection. See, this is the way to learn from the proper source, from the proper authority, and when one becomes enlightened, then one can properly execute the principles given in the scriptures and give benefit to people which is tangible. Now Prabhupada says about the modern democratic system, "The modern elected executive head of a state is just like a puppet because he has no kingly power. Even if he is enlightened like Maharaj Yudhishthira, he cannot do anything out of his own good will due to his constitutional position. The powers of the elected leader are limited or defined by the constitution. Therefore, there are so many states over the earth quarrelling because of ideological differences or other selfish motives. Somebody claims socialist system is best system, somebody claims communist system is best, somebody claims capitalist system is best, and they keep on fighting." So this is not the way. A king like Maharaj Yudhishthira has no ideology of his own. Yudhishthira is not telling, "I have got my way of ruling." No, he had but to follow the instructions of the infallible lord and the lord's representative and the authorized agent, Bhishma Deva. Yudhishthira simply has to follow the perfect laws given in the authorized scriptures as instructed by the infallible lord. Infallible means the lord never falls down from his position. He is always the supreme lord, always full of knowledge, full of all opulences, Bhagawan, the supreme personality of Godhead, and Bhishma Deva is the perfect representative of Krishna. Such a perfect representative instructed Yudhishthira in what is Dharma, how to rule, how to ensure that citizens' well being is provided. See, it is told in the shastras that the king should follow the great authority and the infallible lord without any personal motive and manufactured ideology. Nobody should manufacture their own laws or their own principles. They should follow the perfect authority, then there is possibility of success in ruling the kingdom properly. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "actually Krishna is just reciprocating the devotional service of his devotees"
**Summary:** Krishna reciprocates the loving devotional service of his devotees, even though He is self-satisfied and doesn't need anything.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Deviim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudhirayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 30th verse of the 10th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The meaning of this verse is: All these women auspiciously glorified their lives despite their being without interest, without individuality, and without purity. Their husband, the lotus-eyed personality of Godhead, never left them alone at home. He always pleased their hearts by making valuable presentations. So these descriptions may appear like Krishna is a henpecked husband, but actually Krishna is just reciprocating the devotional service of his devotees. That's all Krishna is doing because Krishna has no need for anyone's service. He is full in himself, Atma Rama. He is completely self-satisfied. So it is the devotees who, out of their own devotion to Krishna, their love for Krishna, they render service to him, and the mood of the devotees, pure devotees also, that we simply want to please Krishna. Reciprocally, Krishna also accepts the service, and in return for the service, Krishna wants to please his devotees.

**Key Quote:** "only through devotion we can attract Krishna's attention"
**Summary:** The queens served Krishna with devotion, and only pure devotion, not knowledge, skill, or mystic powers, can attract Krishna.

So the description here is that the queens, they always were rendering very, very nice service to Krishna in the palace. Now, these queens were provided by Krishna with each queen one palace and so many thousands of servants to attend to every single need of the king and the queen, of Krishna and his queen. But in spite of that, the queens would personally serve Krishna. They would not depend on, they would not take the help of any of the other servants. Personally, they would tend to every need of Krishna. That is described in detail in the tenth canto of the Bhagavatam. And Krishna very kindly accepted their service simply because it was offered with devotion. So only through devotion, we can attract Krishna's attention. We cannot attract Krishna's attention by any other way, not by knowledge, not by our skill, not by our perfection in some yoga practice, siddhis, mystic perfections. No. None of these things can attract Krishna because he is himself full of all mystic perfections. He is Yogeshwara. He is full of all knowledge. He is full of all varieties of opulences, wealth. So we cannot attract Krishna by our wealth, knowledge, or by our strength, nothing. But devotion, pure devotion, that attracts Krishna. So these queens attracted Krishna by their devotion. All the devotees, not only the queens, every devotee of Krishna, pure devotee of Krishna, attracts Krishna only by their pure devotion. That's all.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna accepts anything only from his pure devotees."
**Summary:** Devotional service purifies us, and Krishna accepts even mixed devotional service offered through a pure devotee spiritual master.

Nothing else can attract Krishna. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, "The devotees of the Lord are purified souls." Devotee means completely purified of all material contamination. Of course, in the beginning stage, when we begin devotional service in the neophyte stage, beginning stage, we may not be completely pure, we may be contaminated to whatever extent, but devotional service itself is purifying, itself is purifying. So we become purified as we keep on rendering devotional service according to rules and regulations, according to the principles of sadhana bhakti. But when we become completely purified, then our service comes to the level of pure devotional service. As long as there is contamination in the heart, our service is a mixed devotional service. It is not counted as pure devotional service. Nevertheless, Krishna accepts if such mixed devotional service is offered through a pure devotee, spiritual master, only then Krishna accepts. If such mixed devotional service is offered through a pure devotee, spiritual master. Mixed devotional service is never accepted by Krishna if somebody tries to do that independently. Therefore, in the beginning, we have to approach a bona fide spiritual master and render service to Krishna, begin rendering or continue to render service to Krishna through the spiritual master. Only then Krishna will accept it. Krishna accepts anything only from his pure devotees. So through the pure devotee, we can offer to Krishna some food we might have cooked. Otherwise, Krishna is not hungry or Krishna is not in need of any food. But when the pure devotee recommends that here is a sincere soul wanting to offer you some service, and Krishna very kindly accepts the seva of the neophyte devotee, even though it is mixed devotional service, he accepts it through the medium of the bona fide spiritual master who is a pure devotee.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Bhakti is never, never, never possible to be independently practiced"
**Summary:** Devotional service cannot be practiced independently; guidance from a pure devotee spiritual master is essential for progress and perfection.

Only through a pure devotee, we can offer our seva to Krishna in the mixed devotional stage, mixed devotional service stage. Otherwise, it is not possible. Therefore, don't try to do any service, devotional service independently. Independently, somebody may cultivate knowledge. Independently, somebody may practice. Independently, somebody may practice ashtanga yoga. Independently, somebody may try to perform some rituals. But that is impersonal kind of thing. You see, it doesn't depend on who the person is. They are just governed by some laws. That's all. Laws in this material world. And somebody may make progress also independently, trying to do something, cultivation of knowledge or perfecting their yoga practices, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, they may do independently. Though even in those aspects, it is recommended that one should have a guide so that you don't waste time making mistakes and trying to correct yourself through trial and error. But somebody is somehow desirous of independently practicing or trying out the practice itself. It may work, but not bhakti. Bhakti is never, never, never possible to be independently practiced, to make progress on the path of pure devotional service, it's never possible. Therefore, we see people who take to devotional service, but give up the shelter, the guidance, the teachings of the pure devotee spiritual master, they are lost in this material world. They cannot achieve perfection. Never. Perfection is never achieved that way. Whereas those who are carefully under the guidance of the pure devotee spiritual master and strictly follow his instructions without even one millimeter of deviation, they are the ones who make rapid progress. And Srila Prabhupada says, in this lifetime you can go back to Godhead. You can perfect yourself in this lifetime, go back to Godhead, irrespective of what your background had been before taking to devotional service. Even the most sinful person among sinners can take to devotional service under the guidance of a pure devotee spiritual master and perfect himself very quickly.

**Key Quote:** "As soon as the devotees surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord sincerely, the Lord accepts them and thus the devotees at once become free from all material contaminations."
**Summary:** Surrender to Krishna through a pure devotee spiritual master leads to immediate purification, transcending material qualifications.

So therefore, Prabhupada says, "As soon as the devotees surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord sincerely, the Lord accepts them and thus the devotees at once become free from all material contaminations. Such devotees are above the three modes of material nature." They are not on the platform of the three gunas. Krishna says that in Bhagavad Gita: mam chayo avyabhicharena bhakti-yogena sevate sagunan samatityetan brahma bhuyaya kalpate. One comes to the spiritual platform as soon as one renders pure devotional service to Krishna, then such a service is above the three gunas. So therefore, Prabhupada says, "There is no bodily disqualification of a devotee, whether he is from a Brahminical background, or a Kshatriya background, or a Vaishya background, or a Shudra background, or a Chandala background, or a sinful background, antyaja," it doesn't matter when it comes to pure devotional service. Just as the example is given by Srila Prabhupada, "There is no qualitative difference between the Ganges water and the Fildi drain water

**Key Quote:** "anybody who renders service to Krishna through the medium of a pure devotee actually becomes purified regardless of their background."
**Summary:** Like the Ganga river, devotional service through a pure devotee purifies regardless of one's background, as exemplified by Krishna accepting the service of the women under Bhaumasura's control.

when they are amalgamated." Now the Ganga river is flowing. When it comes from the Gangotri Himalayas to Haridwar, it is crystal clear water. But as it flows down the Gangetic plains through different towns, villages, cities, till it joins the Bay of Bengal, so many drain water may join the Ganga river flow. But that doesn't mean after the drain water is joining the Ganga, Ganga does not lose any potency, spiritual potency. Ganga does not lose any spiritual potency. And even it is proven that, let us say, a person who is infected with some disease, he's got germs of the disease on his body, and such a person goes and takes bath in the Ganga river, then, immediately if you take that water, where the person has taken a bath, that water will actually have those germs. But within three hours of taking that water and keeping it aside, that water, Ganga Jal, which had those germs, all those germs will be destroyed. This has been verified by medical scientists back in the British era, that these Hindus, they claim Ganga water is very pure always. How is it possible? So they have proven that actually. It's a fact. But we are more interested in understanding that the spiritual potency of Ganga is not reduced because some drain water is mixing with the river Ganga when it flows in different parts of this, North India. Similarly, anybody who renders service to Krishna through the medium of a pure devotee actually becomes purified regardless of their background. So this is how it is said here that the women who were actually under the clutches of Bhaumasura, and they had become polluted, but when Krishna accepted them, their service, sincere service, they became completely purified. And there was no more any question of their impurity remaining. So that is the mercy of the Supreme Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains verses 31 and 32, focusing on Krishna's departure from Hastinapura and Yudhishthira's protective arrangements driven by affection.

In this session, we will be discussing verses 31 to 32 of the 10th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. So, the 31st verse: The meaning of this verse is, while the ladies of the capital of Hastinapura were greeting him and talking in this way, the Lord, smiling, accepted their good greetings and, casting the grace of his glance over them, he departed from the city. So, the past few verses, we heard the glorification of Krishna by the ladies of Hastinapura in their talking amongst themselves when they had gone to the rooftop to bid farewell to Krishna. So, it is explained here, Krishna accepted their good greetings, and he cast his merciful glance on them, that way blessing them, and he departed from the city. The 32nd verse: Ajatashatrupritanam gopi thaya madhudvishah Parabhyah shankitathnehat prayum tacctur anginim. The meaning of this verse is, Maharaj Yudhishthira, although no one's enemy, engaged four divisions of defense—horse, elephant, chariot, and army—to accompany Lord Krishna, the enemy of the asuras or demons.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Yudhishthira's arrangements for Krishna's protection, describing the four divisions of defense forces and the advanced weaponry of ancient times, including the Brahmastra.

Yudhishthira did this because of the enemy and also out of affection for the Lord. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj, he is sending off Krishna, and even though there is no need for giving any special protection to Krishna, Yudhishthira knows Krishna is the supreme personality of God, but out of affection for him, he arranged four divisions of defense forces. Those days, there used to be warriors on horseback, warriors on elephant back, warriors on chariots, and warriors on foot, foot soldiers. So, four divisions—horse, elephant, chariot, and army, what is called? Horse infantry. They were to accompany Krishna till he reached Dwaraka. So, it is explained that Yudhishthira Maharaj did this out of affection for Lord Krishna because Yudhishthira Maharaj is a pure devotee of Krishna. So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, natural defensive measures are horses and elephants combined with chariots, horses, and men. Horses and elephants are trained to move to any part of the hills or forests and plains. These horses and elephants are trained up to engage in fighting in a battle by the warriors or Kshatriyas. The charioteers could fight with many horses and elephants by the strength of powerful arrows, even up to the standard of the Brahmastra, similar to modern atomic weapons.

In this present age, there used to be a division of the Vedas called Dhanurveda, Vedas called Dhanurveda, how to fight with different weapons, the skill for fighting with weapons. And some of the arrows that were discharged, they were having the power of mantra, power of mantra. That means the arrow, when released to go and strike a particular target, by the power of mantra, it will go searching for the target, wherever the target may be, not necessarily the target has to be in line with the arrow being shot, not necessary. By mantra power, it will go searching for the target, and they even had a very, very powerful weapon called Brahmastra, which is similar to modern atomic weapons. But the speciality of Brahmastra is it will go and strike only the target; it will not do destruction for mass destruction. It will not do unless the Kshatriya who releases that Brahmastra desires so. So, he can select a target and release the target, and then the target will go, and it will be stopped, and then it completely is Brahmastra and to only go and strike that target and destroy that target only. So, that was the kind of

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna is everyone's friend, but some beings are envious due to their demoniac nature, and Yudhishthira's actions stem from both fear of these enemies and affection for Krishna.

science, Dhanurveda. Maharaja Yudhishthira knew well that Krishna is everyone's friend and well-wisher. Krishna has no enemies because everyone is Krishna's part and parcel, and he is Surdam Sarva-Bhutana, he is the top master of the Bhuta, most well-wisher of every living being. So, where is the question of Krishna having enmity with anybody? Krishna is everyone's friend and well-wisher, but there are asuras who are by nature envious of Krishna, envious of the supreme lord is the demoniac nature. Demoniac nature is asuri bhava. So, in this material world only, not in the spiritual world, only in the material world, there are two categories of beings, created beings. In the 16th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, it is explained among created beings in this material world, there are two categories, daiva and asura, so divine nature and demoniac nature. Now, this is because some people, they wrongly think that Krishna is their enemy. They think Krishna is against them, or somehow they have developed some iniquities, or they have developed some kind of feelings towards Krishna. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj, out of fear of attack from others and also out of affection for Krishna,

**Key Quote:** "Krishna himself was sufficient to defend himself from the attack of others if required krishna himself could defend but still krishna accepted all the arrangements made by maharaj yudhishthira why because he could use it for his own good"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna is self-sufficient but accepts the arrangements of his devotees to reciprocate their love and play the role of a subordinate in his transcendental sporting.

he engaged all varieties of defensive forces as bodyguards of Krishna, and also some vipassana verdigris also as a rickshaw or a bike rickshaw and some of the other movements of Krishna. Now, it is specially mentioned by Prabhupada in the purport, Krishna himself was sufficient to defend himself from the attack of others. If required, Krishna himself could defend, but still Krishna accepted all the arrangements made by Maharaj Yudhishthira. Why? Because he could use it for his own good, and if you use it for the good of others, he can't break his form as a demon because he cannot break his form, but he can't break his form with this body, and if you use it as a weapon, he can't break his form, he can't break his form with this body. Another example is this. Another example is that, for example, the existence of God in the form of a demoniac, there are different形 Grinville kusama will take it as a demoniac because he could not disobey the king who was his elder cousin. Krishna, when he plays the part of being a relative of a devotee, he plays the role perfectly. So, he was a younger cousin of Yudhishthira. So, therefore, Krishna played that part, I am younger than Yudhishthira, I cannot refuse. That is the etiquette. So, I cannot refuse when Yudhishthira arranges bodyguards for my travel, I cannot refuse it. So, Prabhupada says, the Lord plays the part of a subordinate in his transcendental sporting.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Krishna's pastimes, such as his dependence on Yashoda Mata, as ways to give pleasure to his devotees and share transcendental bliss.

And thus, sometimes he puts himself in the care of Yashoda Mata for his protection in his so-called helplessness of childhood. A small child is after all helpless, totally dependent on the mother. When it is just born, what is the condition of the child? The infant, we do not even say child, we say infant, very, very, very small, just come out of the mother's womb, totally helpless. So, we should not mistakenly think that Krishna is helpless when he is a small child. He puts himself under the care of his mother Yashoda or Devaki as if he is a small child. But actually, he remains the Supreme Lord with all his powers, even as a small child. So, therefore, Prabhupada explains that is the transcendental lela or pastime of the Lord. Simply to give pleasure to his devotees, Krishna enacts these pastimes. The basic principle for all transcendental exchanges between the Lord and his devotees is exhibited to enjoy a transcendental bliss. So, Krishna keeps enjoying these transcendental pleasures, Krishna is full of transcendental blessings, transcendental bliss, and there is no comparison with this bliss even to the level of Brahmananda. Krishna shares that transcendental bliss with his devotees when he engages in transcendental pastimes with his devotees. So, both

**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains verse 33, highlighting the Pandavas' profound affection for Krishna and their reluctance to separate from him.

Krishna and the devotees are always in transcendental bliss. The thirty-third verse, atha duragataan shaurihi, kauravaan viraha aturan, sannivartya drdham snigdhan, praya svanagarim priyaihi. The meaning is, out of profound affection for Lord Krishna, the Pandavas, who were of the Kuru dynasty, accompanied him a considerable distance to see him off. They were overwhelmed with the thought of Krishna. The Lord, however, persuaded them to return home, and he proceeded towards Dwaraka with his dear companions. Yudhishthira Maharaj has made arrangements for bodyguards, four divisions of defense forces to accompany Krishna till Dwaraka. But even the Pandavas themselves, Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Manakula, Sahadeva also could not think of separation from Krishna because they are pure devotees. All pure devotees are so. They are very intimately connected with Krishna and therefore continuously thinking of Krishna only, continuously. Such continuous thinking of Krishna is a commandment of qualities of special prestige. Krishna is also the развит 좋은 is a characteristic of devotional service to Krishna bhakti for Krishna. Krishna says, think of me always. So, even if somebody is not a devotee, if they constantly think of Krishna, they become pure devotees, they awaken their pure devotion to Krishna. So, because the Pandavas were so intimately attached to Krishna in pure devotional service, they went with him at quite a distance, but then Krishna sent them back, persuaded them to return home, and he proceeded towards Dhwaraka. So, very reluctantly the Pandavas came back because a pure devotee cannot bear separation from the Lord

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devim Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet In this session we will be discussing from verses 34 to 36, the last three verses of this tenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. 34th verse Kurujaangala Paanchalaan Shurasenaan Sayamunaan Brahmaavartam Kurukshetram Matsyaan Saraswataan Athah Marudhanvam Atikratham Saviraviravirayoparan Anartanbhardavo Paagat Shantavaho Managvibhu This is actually the 34th and the 35th verses.

After crossing these provinces he gradually reached the Savveera and Abheera provinces, then west of these reached Dvārakā at last.

**Key Quote:** "They are real happenings. Just because it does not fit with our logical thinking, we should not reject them as mythology or something unacceptable, unbelievable."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada emphasizes the historical accuracy of the Bhagavatam, refuting modern theories about the formation of deserts and the limitations of modern researchers.

So the description is Krishna has started from Hastināpura and he is going to proceed towards Dvārakā crossing the different parts of the land in between Hastināpura and Dvārakā. So Śrīla Prabhupāda explains in the purport about this different lands being described in these two verses. The provinces passed over by the Lord in those days were differently named, but the direction given is sufficient to indicate that he travelled through Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Saurashtra, and Gujarat and at last reached his home province at Dvārakā. So Prabhupāda is trying to explain these are all historical incidents and they are not imaginary stories described in the Bhāgavatam, the Pūrāṇas, the itihāsas. They are not imaginary fiction. They are not fiction. They are real happenings. Just because it does not fit with our logical thinking, we should not reject them as mythology or something unacceptable, unbelievable. It may appear unbelievable but actually it is a fact. We do not gain any profit simply by researching the analogous provinces of those days up to now. But it appears that the desert of Rajasthan and the provinces of scanty water like Madhya Pradesh were present even 5000 years ago. Some characteristics of certain land are the same or were the same 5000 years back as is indicated by the statements in the Bhāgavatam. So these are factual statements. These are not some imaginary things. The theory of soil experts that the desert developed in recent years is not supported by the statements of the Bhagavatam. Some speculation modern researchers indulge in because they have limited resources, they have limited brains and they have limited access to knowledge, so they speculate, they theorize that deserts developed in recent years. It is not there in ancient times, proposes no even five thousand years back as given in the bhagavatam, the desert portion and the part of the land where there was scanty water existed 5,000 years back. Krishna passed through that while proceeding from Hastinapura to

### Kurukshetra as a real place, rejecting speculative interpretations, parampara system

**Key Quote:** "Kurukshetra continues to exist since the Vedic age and it is sheer foolishness when interpreters ignore or deny the existence of Kurukshetra"
**Summary:** The speaker refutes interpretations of Bhagavad-gita that deny the literal existence of Kurukshetra, emphasizing the importance of receiving knowledge through the parampara system.

Dwaraka we may leave the matter for expert geologists to research because the changing universe has different phases of geological development. It's also a fact that the land a mass keeps changing as there are you know changes happening over very very long periods of time. It does happen so let them do the research. We are not so much interested in the research. We are satisfied that the Lord has now reached his own province Dwaraka dhama from the Kuru provinces. Kurukshetra continues to exist since the Vedic age and it is sheer foolishness when interpreters ignore or deny the existence of Kurukshetra. So Bhagavad-gita, some people write commentaries, not some people, many of them, their commentaries indicate that Kurukshetra is not actually referring to some battlefield, it is referring to the body or referring to some conflict within the mind, all kinds of speculations when are presented when the situation when it is not directly related to the body and the mind, not just in the mind but also for the body as well. So Bhagavad-gita is the source of knowledge, the method of knowledge is the source of knowledge where the 11 minded yakas are fulfilled and the knowledge of the Dharma is a source of knowledge that stil is insignificant and the understanding of this will be a lot bigger but also the The liberated souls who do not speculate, who pass on the perfect knowledge received from Krishna in parampara without any change, without any alteration, without any speculation, without any addition or subtraction or any alteration, they present as it is. Prabhupada has written Bhagavad Gita as it is. Kurukshetra is the actual place where the battle took place 5000 years back, but in the Pandavas and Kauravas. It's a factual reporting in the Mahabharata, in the Bhagavad Gita.

### Krishna's adherence to Vedic principles, Krishna beyond karma, laws of karma
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/eN7YuPC5xdY?t=524
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna is never under the laws of karma. Krishna is the master of all the laws of material nature."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while Krishna appears to follow Vedic principles, he is not bound by karma, unlike ordinary beings who are subject to the laws of karma.

36th verse, the last verse. The meaning of this verse is, on his journey through these provinces, he was welcomed, worshipped and given various presentations. In the evening in all places, the Lord suspended his journey to perform evening rites. This was regularly observed after sunset. If you remember, the Lord is playing the part of a Kshatriya. So they belong to the Vedic culture. So they follow certain practices. At least the Brahmanal Kshatriyas and Vaishyas in the Vedic culture, they follow certain practices as described in the, prescribed in the Shastras, in the Vedic scriptures. So Prabhupada says in the purport, it is said here that the Lord observed the religious principles regularly while he was on the journey. There are certain philosophical speculations that even the Lord is under the obligations of fruitive action, karma. Some people say Krishna is under the laws of karma. That is wrong. Krishna is never under the laws of karma. But actually this is not the case. Krishna does not follow the laws of karma. Krishna does not depend on the action of any good or bad work. Since the Lord is absolute, everything done by him is good for everyone. Unlike us, we do some action, it is judged according to the laws of karma as pious or impious. Pious actions have got pious reactions, good reactions, and impious activities, sinful activities have got sinful reactions. So we accordingly either enjoy or suffer the results of our own activities which are under the laws of karma. Krishna is never under the laws of karma. Krishna is the master of all the laws of material nature. He is the master of material nature.

### Krishna's example, imitating Krishna, Vedic injunctions

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna also teaches by his own example how to follow the Vedic injunctions... One must act properly himself and teach the others how to follow the Vedic injunctions by his own actions."
**Summary:** Krishna sets an example by following Vedic injunctions, but not all his actions are meant to be imitated; one must distinguish between what to follow and what not to imitate.

He is the supreme controller of material nature, so he is never under the control. But still it is explained here, when Krishna descends on earth, he acts for the protection of the devotees and for the annihilation of the impious non-devotees. Although he has no obligatory duty, still he does everything so that others may follow. Krishna also teaches by his own example how to follow the Vedic injunctions. So if he plays the part of a Kshatriya, he follows the Vedic injunctions which are prescribed for a Kshatriya. That is the way, a factual teaching. One must act properly himself and teach the others how to follow the Vedic injunctions by his own actions. Otherwise no one will accept one's blind teaching. So Krishna himself is the awarder of fructive results. He is self-sufficient. Yet he acts according to the rulings of the revealed scripture in order to teach us the process of following the Vedas. If he does not do so, the common man may go wrong. But a warning is given here. In the advanced stage, when one can understand the transcendental nature of Lord Krishna, one does not try to imitate him. This is not possible. So every action of Krishna is not meant for teaching us. Some actions are meant for teaching us. As Prabhupada explains further, the Lord in human society does what is the duty of everyone, but sometimes he does something extraordinary and not to be imitated by the living being. His acts of evening prayer as stated herein must be followed by the living beings, but it is not possible to follow his mountain lifting or dancing with the gopis. So what we should follow and what we should not imitate. This distinction must be there when we hear about or read or try to examine the activities performed by Krishna

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, one should be guided by the bona fide spiritual master. To distinguish between what we should follow among the activities of Krishna and which actions of Krishna are not to be imitated, the spiritual master should be the guide."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of the sun and Shiva to illustrate the dangers of imitating powerful figures, emphasizing the need for guidance from a bona fide spiritual master in bhakti practice.

in his entire manifestation on this earth. One cannot imitate the sun which can exhaust water even from a filthy place. Example again is given of the sun. The sun is so powerful. Even the sun evaporates some filthy water from a dirty place. The sun doesn't become polluted. Ludicrous to think that sun will become contaminated. No. So the principle is the most powerful can do something which is all good, but our imitation of such acts will put us into endless difficulty. So we should not imitate the most powerful, the most powerful personalities, the controllers, what they do. Shiva drank an ocean of poison, but Shiva's followers try to imitate Shiva and they get into so much of problems. So they say Shiva smokes ganja so we can also smoke ganja, but Shiva smokes ganja for a different purpose. He has no attraction or addiction. He has no desire to enjoy smoking ganja. He does that just to give association for living entities who are in the mode of ignorance, Tamsic living entities, bhutas, pretas, pishachas, etc. Like that, Krishna performs some activities to protect his devotees, mountain lifting, govardhaniya. But we cannot imitate. We should never try to imitate that. Therefore, one should be guided by the bona fide spiritual master. To distinguish between what we should follow among the activities of Krishna and which actions of Krishna are not to be imitated, the spiritual master should be the guide for all such practices of our own, our own following the practice of bhakti. We should be guided by the spiritual master. I'll stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.

The necessities of human society are food, grains, fruits, milk, minerals, clothing, wood, etc., the material needs of the body. Certainly one does not require flesh and fish or iron tools and machinery. During the regime of Maharaj Yudhishthira, all over the world there were regulated rainfalls. Rainfalls are not in the control of the human being. The heavenly king Indra Deva is the controller of rains and he is the servant of the Supreme Lord Krishna. When the Lord is obeyed by the king and the people under the king's administration, there are regulated rains from the horizon and these rains are the causes of all varieties of production on the land.

Not only do regulated rains help ample production of grains and fruits, but when they combine with astronomical influences, there is ample production of valuable stones and pearls. See, even pearls which they mine from the bottom of the ocean. So, this is a great way for the human being to be able to produce intellectual property and also to be able to collect clean products from the ocean and precious stones from the earth. That is also produced by proper astronomical influences. It's a great science. It is not some mythology as foolish people think. Grains and vegetables can sumptuously feed the man and animals, and a fatty cow delivers enough milk to supply the man sumptuously with vigorous

The micro-index is important for the human being. The micro-index is important. Other than the micro-index, it is very important for the human being. The micro-index is very important with vigor and vitality. Milk is described by Srila Prabhupada as a miracle food because it contains all the necessary nutrition required for a human being. Now sometimes people wrongly think that a cow gives milk for its calf. Why do human beings interfere? It's not interference. The cow is made or created by the Supreme Lord Krishi Goraksha. It is to be protected by the human civilized human beings so that the excess milk that the cow gives is taken by the human beings who protect the cow and that milk nourishes the humans with the necessary nutrition for good health and most importantly for developing finer brain tissues to understand spiritual subject matter. This is a confidential thing that people do not know. Cows milk nourishes our brain tissues to understand what is Vedic knowledge, what is spiritual

knowledge and the cow necessarily gives more milk. Of course, when the cow is exploited then the cow may not give enough milk, but a cow which is properly cared for and properly looked after, it always gives more milk than what the calf requires. So the excess milk is supposed to be taken by the human being for his own need. Human beings require cows milk for their own nourishment, especially nourishing the brain tissues to understand what is God. If there is enough milk, enough grains, enough fruit, enough cotton, enough silk, enough jewels, why do people need cinemas, houses of prostitution, slaughterhouse etc.? Prabhupada is raising this point that people are mad after all these so-called entertainment and rubbish nonsense, but actually it is not required for a human being who understands the real goal of life to lead a healthy life progressing spiritually towards the ultimate goal. You don't require all this cinema and prostitution and slaughterhouse. What is the need of artificial luxurious life? You don't require all this cinema and prostitution and slaughterhouse. What is the need of artificial luxurious life? Cinema, cars, radio, flash hotels, has this civilization produced anything but quarreling individually and nationally? Prabhupada is raising this point. All modern development is only in the wrong direction, unortha, it's called unortha, unnecessary.

**Summary:** The lecture attributes scarcity and adversities to sinful activities and a godless civilization, criticizing factories as hellish environments that mass-produce unnecessary things, disrupting harmony with nature.

things are being produced in 20 and on the one side, on the other side there is apparent scarcity of food grains, scarcity of milk, scarcity of produce of different natural produce, a scarcity of rain, either a tea bridge tea or another adversity. There is too much raining. He illustrates the crop or there is scarcity of rain which does not give proper crops. The land will not be a proper cross. So all this is because of sinful activities, because of violating the laws of God, because of a godless civilization, misdirected civilization, misdirect. So, Prabhupada is pointing this out as the Acharya of our time. He is pointing out this defect in the modern way of living. Has this civilization enhanced the cause of equality and fraternity by sending thousands of men into hellish factory and war fields at the whims of a particular man? These rulers, they have all kinds of wrong ideas that let us have factories where men work and earn money and try to enjoy artificial entertainment systems. Factories, Prabhupada says is another name for hell because the conditions are very, very bad. It is not in harmony with nature to mass produce

so many unnecessary things in the name of advancement of civilization, name of development. It is said here that the cows used to moisten the pasturing land with milk, because their milk bags were fatty and the animals were joyful. When the cow is happy, the cow is happy. When is the cow happy? When it is nicely protected by the human beings. Go raksha, then they give plenty of milk. Do the cows not require proper protection for a joyful life by being fed with sufficient quantity of grass on the field? Why should men kill cows for their selfish purposes? This is a major defect of the human nature. So, Prabhupada is pointing out this defect in the modern way of living. Has this civilization

of the modern civilization that Prabhupada is pointing out as the Acharya. Maharaj Pariksit, the grandson of Maharaj Yudhishthira, while touring his vast kingdom saw a black man attempting to kill a cow. The king at once arrested the butcher and chastised him sufficiently. This is the way to rule the kingdom that nobody should even attempt to harm a cow. Cow should be given full protection. Should not a king or executive head protect the lives of the poor animals who are unable to defend themselves? Is this humanity? Are not the animals of a country citizens also? Praja, the word Praja is used. Praja means those who take birth in a particular land. So, even the animals they also require protection. They also require protection. Why are the innocent animals allowed to be butchered in organized slaughterhouses? Therefore, in contrast with the modern advanced civilized form of government, democracy, like Maharaj Yudhishthira's, is by far superior to a so-called democracy.

**Key Quote:** "We don't have to produce anything. We simply should not interfere with Krishna's arrangement."
**Summary:** The lecture explains Krishna as the seed-giving father and material nature as the mother of all living beings, asserting everyone's right to live under their protection and advocating non-interference with Krishna's arrangement for abundance.

This democracy is not at all a proper form of government because Maharaj Yudhishthira was perfectly ruling as the king of the entire world. Maharaj Yudhishthira was just the ruler of the entire world. He rulers the всего, and he rules the world. We are all creatures of material city, but we have to be aware of the fact that we are not the same kind of people. we are all creatures of material city, of material nature. In the Bhagavad Gita, it is said that Lord himself is the seed-giving father and material nature is the mother of all living beings on all shapes. sarva yonishu kaunteya murtaya sambhavanti yaha tasam brahma maha dyonir aham bija pradapita Krishna says, I am the seed-giving father and material nature is the source of birth for all living beings, Mother nature. So this is the way the world is created. So Krishna is the father. Mother nature is the mother of all creatures. Everyone has a right to live. We should respect their right to live under the protection of the Supreme Lord as father and material nature as mother in this material world. Thus, mother, material nature is enough foodstuff for both animals and for men by the grace of the Almighty Father Sri Krishna. We don't have to produce anything. We simply should not interfere with Krishna's arrangement. That's all. Then there'd be plenty for everyone,

He is endowed with intelligence more powerful than animals for realizing the course of nature and the indications of the Almighty Father. Human beings have developed intelligence. They can understand what is the design of this creation, that there is a creator, that is God Krishna, and he has got a plan. He's got a purpose for the behind this creation that is understood by intelligent people to make proper inquiries. So, the purpose of this creation is ultimately self-realization by utilizing whatever is provided for naturally without any difficulty simply by following the laws of God, simply by following that. So, without being guided by these enlightened self-realized souls, without being guided by the authoritative scriptures, we will be misled into thinking that there is some scarcity or there is some need for economic development or there is need for some artificial things which are being manufactured for the sake of entertainment, for the sake of reducing the these the people toiling in the factories, reducing their labor or their difficulty. All this is unnecessary. If we simply follow properly, everything is very perfect. That is the lesson to be learned from this description in the Bhagavata.

The departure of Lord Krishna for Dwarka, before actually describing the departure in this chapter, it is described the rule of King Yudhishthira. After Yudhishthira assumed the post of the emperor of the world after the Battle of Kurukshetra, then how was he ruling? That's being described here in the initial portion of this chapter. The fifth verse says, "Nadia samadra giraya." The meaning of this verse is religious oceans, hills, mountains, and falls of the oceans are mountains and falls of the mountains and falls of the mountains and falls of the mountains, forest creepers, and active drugs in every season paid their tax quota to the king in profusion. This is an interesting concept here. This verse is talking about rivers paying their tax quota to the king, and they were paying in profusion, plenty. There was plenty

of water in the rivers, of all kinds of valuables in the ocean, in the hills, in the mountains. That's being explained in the purport by Srila Prabhupada. So it's not just the citizens alone who pay the tax, and even among the citizens in the Vedic culture, only the vaisyas pay tax. The kshatriyas are rulers, and the brahmanas, they voluntarily accept to lead a very simple life. They don't accumulate money, they don't even accumulate goods, and the shudras are never given money. They are given all the necessities. They are taken care of by their masters because they always have to be under the protection of a brahmana and a shudra, a kshatriya or a vaisya. So they're taken care completely. They are never given money because there is a possibility that they may misuse the money for wrong purposes. They don't have sufficiently developed intelligence to understand the consequences of spending money for, let's say, smoking, drinking, gambling, etc. Whereas what about the vaisyas who have money in their hands or the kshatriyas? The vaisyas and kshatriyas are responsible. They are sufficiently engaged in their duties. They are very strictly, there are strict followers of the Vedic injunctions, so they are not only responsible, but they are also responsible for the, they are naturally protected and they are careful. So generally vaisyas, brahmana, kshatriyas, vaisyas do not indulge in sinful activities even if they have ample opportunity for doing that. They don't do it generally, they don't do it. So therefore money should not be given to the shudras. That doesn't mean that they should not be given to the shudras.

**Key Quote:** "The secret to success is to take refuge under the protection of the supreme lord"
**Summary:** This segment discusses how a king manages the kingdom through gifts of nature and emphasizes the necessity of the Supreme Lord's sanction for success in any endeavor.

So therefore the tax was collected by the king only from the vaisyas. So then how will the king manage the kingdom when there are a lot of expenses? The king would also receive the gifts of nature in profusion because he was ruling according to the principles of dharma. That will be explained here in the purport. Srila Prabhupada says, since Maharaj Yudhishthira was under the protection of the Ajita, Ajita is another name for Krishna, the infallible Lord, as above mentioned, the properties of the Lord, namely the rivers, the oceans, the hills, the forests, etc., were all pleased and they used to supply the respective quota of taxes to the king. Whose property is it? Rivers, oceans, hills, etc. They are the property of the Supreme Lord. So Srila Prabhupada says the secret to success is to take refuge under the protection of the Supreme Lord. That is the secret of success for the king to properly rule the kingdom without experiencing any scarcity. Without the Supreme Lord's success, without the Supreme Lord's sanction, nothing can be possible. Ultimately, for every single thing, the Supreme Lord's sanction is absolutely required to make economic development by our own endeavors on the strength of tools and machinery is not all like it is happening in the modern times. The sanction of the Supreme Lord must be there, otherwise despite all instrumental arrangements, everything will be unsuccessful.

**Key Quote:** "ultimately the cause of success is daiva or the supreme lord krishna as paramatma in the heart"
**Summary:** This segment explains the five factors required for successful accomplishment of any action, highlighting the importance of 'daivam' or the Supreme Lord's sanction.

The ultimate cause of success is daiva, the supreme. In the 18th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains five factors which are to be considered for successful accomplishment of every action in this material world. The four factors are in our hands. When we do some action, it's in our hands, four factors, but the fifth factor is called daivam, and daivam means the Supersoul, the Personality of God, Krishna, Satan in our heart is Paramatma. Ultimately, the cause of success is daiva or the Supreme Lord Krishna as Paramatma in the heart. Without His sanction, no action can be successfully accomplished. Please remember this always, always the most important factor. Of course, that does not mean that we neglect the other four factors which are in our hands, like there should be proper endeavor, there should be the proper instruments to be used, there should be the proper place or conditions for doing that action, there should be the effort on the part of the particular person, the doer. A doer is required for the accomplishment of any action. Nothing happens automatically without an effort or endeavor by a doer or a group of doers, a team effort under the guidance of a leader, and without the proper instruments of action, no action can be accomplished. But this is not all. These four factors, daiva is very, very important factor and that generally people who are other non-devotees, they do not know or they don't care for this fifth, most important factor.

**Key Quote:** "the king is the agent of the supreme lord to look after the welfare of the mass of people"
**Summary:** This segment discusses the king's role as an agent of the Supreme Lord, the concept of a welfare state, and the importance of utilizing natural resources for the service of the Lord.

Daiva. Kings like Maharaj Yudhishthira knew perfectly well that the king is the agent of the Supreme Lord to look after the welfare of the mass of people. Here the concept of welfare state is coming. The king is ruling as the representative of Krishna. Ultimately, Krishna is the supreme ruler, sarva loka maheshwaram. He is the Supreme Lord who is the controller of all planets, all persons, all demigods, everyone. So if there is a king who is ruling a particular province or a state or a kingdom or a planet, that king should understand his position as an agent of the Supreme Lord Krishna only. Actually, the state belongs to the Supreme Lord. The rivers, oceans, forests, hills, drugs, etc., are not creations of man. They are all creations of the Supreme Lord, and the living being is allowed to make use of the property of the Lord for the service of the Lord. Please understand this point. All these facilities exist for one purpose, that is human beings should utilize all the natural resources which are the property of the Lord and is provided for what? For service of the Lord. Today's slogan is that everything is for the people and therefore the government is for the people and by the people, but to produce a new species of humanity at the present moment on the basis of God consciousness and perfection of human life, the ideology of God of godly communism, the world has to again follow in the footsteps of kings like Maharaj Yudhishtira or Parikshit Maharaj. There is enough of everything by the will of the Lord, by the will of Krishna. There is plenty of all natural resources and we can make proper use of the things to live comfortably both enmity between men or between animal and man or between man and nature.

**Key Quote:** "simply we have to become god conscious that's all nothing else is required"
**Summary:** This segment contrasts a God-conscious society with a godless civilization, emphasizing that true prosperity and happiness come from becoming God-conscious.

We can live comfortably, but we should understand the secret is that the control of the Lord is there everywhere, and if the Lord is pleased, every part of nature will be pleased. The river will flow profusely to fertilize the land. The ocean will supply sufficient quantity of minerals, pearls, and jewels. This is practically unknown to modern man. What is the use of the ocean? The forest will supply wood, drugs, and vegetables, and the seasonal changes will effectively help produce fruits and flowers in profuse quantity. There will be no scarcity for anyone of any of the basic needs. There will be plenty. On the other hand, Prabhupada is commenting about the modern civilization, a godless civilization, the artificial way of living which is the case in the modern civilization, depending on factories and tools can render so-called happiness only to a limited number at the cost of millions. See what is happening today. They are producing in plenty mobile phones and electronic goods because they somehow figured out a method of mass producing these at a very cheap price and selling them in the millions to the people and diverting their attention from the main business of human life, which is God realization or service to Krishna, and thereby people suffer. So to actually get every necessity in plenty, simply we have to become God conscious. That's all, nothing else is required.

**Key Quote:** "Our existence in this material world is always disturbed by three kinds of miseries imposed by material nature upon all of us."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the three types of miseries (Daiva, Bhuta, and Atma) that cause suffering in the material world, explaining their origins and effects on living beings.

This is a very interesting verse that our existence in this material world is always disturbed by three kinds of miseries imposed by material nature upon all of us. So they are described here in this verse as Daiva. The disturbances or the miseries imposed by supernatural powers, the Devatas who control the wind, who control the rain, who control the heat, the sunshine, etc. So we suffer due to excessive heat or excessive cold or excessive rain or excessive wind, cyclone, tornado, hurricane, or earthquakes or epidemics. Of course, epidemics doesn't come under Daiva. Earthquakes comes under that. Then Bhuta, due to other living entities, enemies or mosquitoes or some other living beings, some wild animals or some pests like that. Then Atma, Atma refers to our own body and mind. When the body becomes fatigued, body becomes injured, body becomes old and invalid, body becomes diseased, we suffer. Or the mind, mind is disturbed due to fear, anxiety, worry, stress, we suffer. So due to our own body and mind also we suffer.

**Key Quote:** "To be non-violent to human beings and to be a killer or enemy of the poor animals is Saturn's philosophy."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the peaceful conditions under Yudhishthira Maharaj's rule with the current state of affairs, criticizing the hypocrisy of being kind to humans while harming animals.

So these are imposed upon us. As spirit soul, we are actually free from all these three. But when we are covered by this body, we have to suffer. Now in the case of the citizens of the world when Yudhishthira Maharaj was ruling as the emperor, it is described here, the citizens, citizens includes not only the human beings but also the animals. And all other creatures, Praja, Praja means those who are born in a particular land. So all those who have taken birth are entitled to be protected by the king, not just humans alone. So all of them were experiencing a very peaceful life, free from these three kinds of miseries, Klesha Daiva Bhutatma Hetavaha. So here it is said, because Yudhishthira Maharaj is not having any enemy, Ajata Shatru. He for whom enemy is never born, Ajata, never born, Shatru, Shatru means enemy. So therefore the living beings were not at any time disturbed by the enemy. They were not disturbed by mental agonies, diseases, or excessive heat or cold. They were not disturbed by any of these. So in the purport Srila Prabhupada explains, "To be non-violent to human beings and to be a killer or enemy of the poor animals is Saturn's philosophy. This is demoniac mentality. This is not divine nature."

**Key Quote:** "Why should people kill poor animals?"
**Summary:** The speaker condemns the unnecessary killing of animals for food, advocating for vegetarianism and emphasizing the right of all creatures to live under the protection of a ruler.

Just like now-a-days, they say we should not harm human beings, other human beings. But when it comes to animals, they don't hesitate to kill animals, specially in the western countries, and now-a-days even in India. So many millions of animals are killed just because people want to eat animal flesh. When there is plenty of animal flesh, plenty of vegetables, fruits, and vegetarian grains, dal available, why should people kill poor animals? Why should they kill animals? So this is not at all justified. It is showing enmity towards animals. So this is condemned in the scriptures, unnecessary killing of any creature, not only animals, even the birds, even the insects, even the worms. Everyone has got a right to live under the protection of the ruler or the king. As was explained in the previous verse, the king is ruling on behalf of the supreme lord, and all creatures are children of the supreme lord in this world. So this perspective, that everyone has the right to live, is the perspective of the Vedic scholars in the scriptures, the Sarvejana Sukhino Bhavantu, or all creatures, may they be living happily, safely, nicely. This is the correct perspective for our own living in this world, not that we just think human beings should be not harmed, but it is okay to kill animals.

**Key Quote:** "There is enmity towards poor animals and therefore the poor creatures are always anxious."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the anxiety and suffering of animals due to human cruelty, criticizing godless governments that fail to protect them.

In this age Srila Prabhupada says there is enmity towards poor animals, and therefore the poor creatures are always anxious. They can understand, those animals, they cannot speak, but they can sense that the humans, some humans, they are very, very hard hearted, they are very cruel, and they treat these animals very badly. So always the anxiety is there. The animal can understand that they are going to be killed. The poor animals is being forced on human society. The killing is not without any after effect. Though the government may not take any action against the animal killers, because the government is a godless government, that's why. So they have got just some which punishes someone who kills another human being, but there is no punishment if somebody kills an animal, though the animal also has got a right to live under the protection of the government. But nature, which is controlled by God, nature will not spare these people who kill animals, while the animals should be actually protected, especially the cow.

**Key Quote:** "The war or this fighting between human beings is a reaction by mother nature because these people indulge in killing animals."
**Summary:** The speaker connects the widespread killing of animals to the occurrence of wars and conflicts, suggesting that these are reactions from nature.

Bhagavad Gita says go raksha, cow should be specially protected, and the other animals should not be killed. They should be left alone to live their own life, the other animals. But because so much killing is going on, there is reaction. And what way do we experience the reaction? That is explained here. Vishwila Prabhupada says, "Therefore there is always a strain of cold or hot war between men individually and collectively or nationally. Men kill each other. People kill each other in the name of nationality." One nation declares war against another nation, Vietnam war, the Iraq invasion, or all these kind of wars that happen in Syria, so much of fighting between two different groups of Islamic followers, the Shias and Sunnis, so much of fighting. And I recently heard that the United Nations is trying to stop this fighting, and it has been going on for the last 11 years. There is no respite. The militants, they attack the ordinary civilians. Ordinary civilians are attacked by the militants, and each group goes and, you know, attacks these civilians apparently belonging to the opposite group. Like Shias will go, and the Shia militants will go and attack the civilians belonging to Sunni community, and Sunni militants retaliate and attack the civilians belonging to Shia community. Civilians are completely non-violent. They don't indulge in fighting, but the militants, they want to enforce their own ideology or whatever that may be, but they are fighting against each other, and in the process so many people are either injured or killed, and it has been going on for the last 11 years without any respite. So this is what Srila Prabhupada says, that the war or this fighting between human beings is a reaction by mother nature because these people indulge in killing animals. They are indulging in killing animals.

**Key Quote:** "If the government or the head of state is conversant with these religious principles and rules according to the scriptural codes, then all the people will be peaceful happy and there will be plenty of supply."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by highlighting the benefits of a God-conscious ruler who follows scriptural principles, leading to peace, happiness, and abundance for all.

Whereas here it is described in this particular verse that we are discussing, at the time of Maharaj Yudhishthira, there were no different nations. There were only eight states. Yudhishthira Maharaj was the emperor of the world. So there were many states. The whole world was united because there was one emperor, and the supreme head, being a trained king like Yudhishthira, kept all the inhabitants free from anxiety, diseases, and excessive heat and cold. That was about 5000 years back. They were not only economically well to do, as was described in the previous verse, nature used to supply plenty of all the natural resources, and they were also physically fit and undisturbed by supernatural power. They were also protected against enmity by other living beings, and they were also protected against bodily and mental agonies. So this is the result of the king being God conscious, king following the principles, the religious principles as described in the scriptures. This is nothing to do with any belief system or any kind of sectarian view of who they believe in or what they believe in now, but actually the scientific understanding that ultimately there is only one supreme lord, and he is in control, and he administers through nature justice for all kinds of unnecessary killing. This is the understanding. And so if the government or the head of state is conversant with these religious principles and rules according to the scriptural codes, then all the people will be peaceful, happy, and there will be plenty of supply. That is what is to be learnt from this particular verse.

So, the reduction of the burden began when he was on his mother's lap, just a few days old infant, Puthana came to kill Krishna and Krishna instead of Puthana killing him, of course Krishna cannot be killed, so Krishna sucked out the life air and from there on these demons were delivered by Krishna when Krishna killed him. Puthana killed them one after another, one after another, one after another, but even after so much of killing, still some demons remained towards the end of Krishna's manifest pastimes. So, the remaining demons were assembled in the battle of Kurukshetra and Krishna did not personally kill them, but Krishna and Puthana killed them. Puthana arranged killing them through the Pandavas, his devotees. Now, the benefit for these demoniac forces or demons is that when Krishna kills them, they are delivered, they are liberated. Not only that, even when Krishna was present on the battlefield, even though they were not directly killed by Krishna, just because Krishna was present on the battlefield, because of the presence of Krishna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, all those who died in the presence of Krishna were liberated, were delivered. So, Krishna is merciful to everyone. But nevertheless, he had to take this action because the devotees are unnecessarily harassed by the demons, unnecessarily. So, when the harassment becomes too much,

**Key Quote:** "Krishna resided at Hastinapura for a few months to pacify his relatives."
**Summary:** This segment explains why Krishna stayed in Hastinapura after the battle of Kurukshetra, focusing on pacifying relatives who lost loved ones and showing special mercy to Bhishma Deva.

Krishna personally comes or empowers his agents to actually deal with these demons. So, after that battle of Kurukshetra, after Yudhishthira was enthroned as the emperor of the world, Krishna's work is over, he has to return to Dwaraka. So, here it is described, when did he go to Dwaraka? Departure of Lord Krishna of Dwaraka. Not immediately, even though his work was over, he stayed back a few months as is described in this seventh verse. Krishna resided at Hastinapura for a few months to pacify his relatives, because in this battle, so many were killed. So, many of them were related to Krishna. So, Krishna had to pacify the survivors, and also to please his own sister Subhadra. Subhadra was married to Arjuna and that was explained by Prabhupada in the purport, why Krishna had to stay back to pacify Subhadra. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, Krishna was to start for Dwaraka, his own kingdom after the battle of Kurukshetra and Yudhishthira's being enthroned, but to oblige the request of Maharaja Yudhishthira, and to show special mercy to Bhishma Deva, Lord Krishna stopped at Hastinapura, the capital of the Pandavas. Yudhishthira requested Krishna, please stay back for a few months, and Krishna accepted. But during that time, as is described in this verse, he also was pacifying his relatives, and he showed special mercy to Bhishma Deva as was described in the previous chapter.

**Key Quote:** "Subhadra was especially to be pacified because she lost her only son Abhimanyu, who was just married."
**Summary:** This segment delves into the reasons for Subhadra's grief, the circumstances surrounding Abhimanyu's death, and the events leading up to the battle of Kurukshetra, including the Pandavas' exile and Duryodhana's schemes.

He was personally present and Bhishma was to go into the body, and blessed Bhishma Deva by his presence. So, it is further said by Srila Prabhupada in the purport. The Lord decided to stay, especially to pacify the aggrieved king, Yudhishthira, as well as to please Subhadra, the sister of Lord Krishna. Now, why was Subhadra aggrieved? That is because, Subhadra was especially to be pacified because she lost her only son Abhimanyu, who was just married. Abhimanyu was the son of Subhadra and Arjuna. Subhadra was married to Arjuna. So, this Abhimanyu, he left his wife Uttara, who was the mother of Maharaja Pariksit. Now, it is described in the Mahabharata as well as the Bhagavata elsewhere, that when the Pandavas were in exile, the thirteenth year they spent in the kingdom of Virat Raj, Virat Maharaja, the kingdom of Virata, Virata Pradesh. So, they disguised themselves. Arjuna became a dancing teacher, in the court of Virat Raja. So, Virat Maharaja could not make out that this dance teacher who is seeking some engagement or employment is actually Arjuna. He could not make out because the Pandavas disguised themselves. According to the agreement in the gambling match, which was a cheating, but nevertheless, because the Pandavas lost, Yudhishthira Maharaja agreed to go and exile and stay. Those accustomed to royal comforts, they have to stay in the forest, in exile, twelve years. And the thirteenth year, they have to hide themselves somewhere. And if Duryodhana discovers where they are hiding, then they have to again go twelve years for exile, twelve more years for exile, because Duryodhana attempted to kill the Pandavas, just so that he could rule the kingdom out of his greed, though he is not entitled. It's not his rightful claim to become the emperor, but because he was greedy, somehow or the other, eliminate the Pandavas, who are the rightful claimants for the throne. So he tried to kill them, but because the Pandavas were always protected by Krishna, Duryodhana could not kill them.

Then somehow, by trick, by cheating, send them away to the forest, and keep them in the forest forever. So this was the plot that was hatched by Duryodhana in consultation with his maternal uncle Shakuni, who was another wicked person. Same mentality as Duryodhana, demoniac mentality. Shakuni, Shakuni also. So this Duryodhana and Shakuni plotted to send away the Pandavas to exile, by cheating the Pandavas in a gambling match. And 13th year exile, what happened? That Arjuna disguised as a dancing teacher, and he became the dance teacher of Virat Maharaja's daughter, Uttara. So then, after the period of exile was over, one year is over, the 13th year, then the Pandavas revealed their identity, and they had to go back to Hastinapura to get back their kingdom, which they had lost during the gambling match, because they fulfilled the conditions. So when they went back, they were not given the kingdom back, and Duryodhana refused. So Duryodhana said, if you want the kingdom, you have to fight and defeat us, and then only take back the kingdom. So then the battle of Kurukshetra

was inevitable. But still, when Virat Maharaj came to know after the 13th year of exile of the Pandavas, that they were the Pandavas, the great Pandavas, and Arjuna, the great bowman, the greatest bowman of his time, he was living in Kognito, and he was a dance teacher. So Virat Maharaj felt very, very bad, sorry for the Pandavas. In any case, he thought that now is the opportunity for me to marry my daughter to Arjuna, when he discovered Arjuna is the one who was the dance teacher. So when he offered to marry his daughter to Arjuna, because Kshatriyas, they can marry, Arjuna is already married to Draupadi, but Kshatriyas can marry more, have more than one wife, can have more than one queen. So when he was offered, he refused because by teaching Virat Maharaja's daughter, being the dance teacher, he was like, a teacher is on the level of the father. So I am like the father of your daughter, so I cannot marry your daughter. So Virat Maharaj was very disappointed. Then he said, okay, I cannot marry, but my son can marry your daughter. So Abhimanyu was just 16 years old, but still he was a prince, and Virat Maharaj's daughter was a princess. So it was a suitable match, therefore Arjuna offered Virat Maharaj that he can marry your daughter to my son. And Virat Maharaj was very pleased, so this Virat Maharaj's daughter Uttara was married to Abhimanyu, who was the son of Arjuna and Subhadra. But soon after that, what happened, the battle of Kurukshetra was declared, had to be fought, and the Pandavas along with their sons, Abhimanyu also went to fight, but this boy never returned alive, he was killed in the battle, in the fighting. So Subhadra lost her son, Uttara, the daughter-in-law of Arjuna, lost her husband Abhimanyu, Arjuna's son. So to pacify, and Subhadra is Krishna's sister, so after the battle of Kurukshetra, because Subhadra lost her son, Krishna wanted to stay back and pacify Subhadra.

### Krishna's affection for devotees, Devotees as relatives, Krishna's equality

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is always pleased to satisfy his devotees."
**Summary:** This segment clarifies that Krishna's affection is primarily for his devotees, who take on the roles of his relatives in his pastimes, emphasizing that Krishna is equal to all but shows special affection to his devotees.

That is being described here. So that's the context in which it is said here, Krishna wanted to satisfy, pacify his sister. Now, it should be understood that, Krishna has no particular affection for his relatives, like conditioned souls have some specific affection for their own relatives. No. Krishna is actually affectionate to his devotees. And when he performs his Leela, his devotees assume the role of Krishna's relatives. Just like Devaki and Vasudeva are devotees of Krishna, but they play the role of Krishna's father and mother. Or Subhadra is the devotee of Krishna, but she plays the role of Krishna's sister. Like that. So, Krishna is always pleased to satisfy his devotees. And therefore, he stayed back to pacify his sister, who is a devotee of Krishna. Not because she's sister. She's playing the part of sister, but she's devotee. And only the devotees can play the part of sister, the devotees can play the part of the Lord's relatives. And the Lord is always absolute. He's not particularly partial to his relatives, and he's neglectful about other people, indifferent to other people. No. He's always equal to everybody, but his devotees, he's got some special affection. So, I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

### Etiquette, Humility of Krishna, Krishna's Pastimes, Devotion, Personal vs. Impersonal aspect of God
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/XWi-tEQus3A?t=58
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna takes pleasure when his pure devotees treat him as an equal or treat him as a subordinate."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Krishna's humility in bowing to Yudhishtira, despite being the Supreme Lord, and how He enjoys being treated with love and affection by His devotees, even as an equal or subordinate, contrasting this with the impersonal understanding of Brahman.

In this session we will be discussing from the 8th verse of the 10th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. आमंत्र्यचाभ्यनु ज्ञातः परिश्वज्याभिवाध्यतं आरुरोह रथम् कैश्चित् परिश्वक्तो अभिवाधितः The meaning of this verse is, afterwards, when the Lord asked permission to depart and the king gave it, the Lord offered his respects to Maharaj Yudhishtira by bowing down at his feet. And the king embraced him. After this, the Lord, being embraced by others and receiving their obeisances, got into his chariot. So this was described as the title of the chapter, Departure of Lord Krishna for Dwaraka from Hastinapura. So Krishna, after finishing his work of conducting the battle of Kurukshetra, and installing Maharaj Yudhishtira as the emperor of the world, he was now leaving Hastinapura for Dwaraka. Now the description here is that Krishna, even though he is the supreme personality of Godhead, he conducts himself in an ideal manner, setting an example for everyone else, that how the younger ones should show respect to the elders. Krishna is, that is explained by Prabhupada in the purport, Maharaj Yudhishtira was the elder cousin of Lord Krishna. So Maharaj Yudhishtira is elder to Krishna. And therefore, while departing from him, the Lord bowed down at the king's feet. King refers to Yudhishtira. So Krishna is bowing down to Yudhishtira's feet. This is the etiquette, this is the culture. Krishna is younger to Yudhishtira, so therefore he is bowing down. And Yudhishtira, what is Yudhishtira doing? The king, that is Yudhishtira, embraced him as a younger brother. Yudhishtira embraced him. Although, the king knew perfectly well that Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead. Yudhishtira knows. At the time of Krishna's advent in this world, 5,000 years back, very few people knew Krishna to be the supreme personality of Godhead. Most of them could not recognize him. So, this is another reason why people cannot recognize that Krishna behaves as if he is one among all of us. But then Krishna also performs activities which are extraordinary, which establish his position as the supreme lord. When Krishna is playing with the cowherd boys, it looks like he is one among them. But when there is a war, there is a danger. Some demon comes to attack. Krishna effortlessly kills the demons and dispatches them. So, that killing the demons is not at all an ordinary activity. It's not possible for anyone else to do that. Or lifting the Govardhan hill, that's not possible for anyone to do. Even though he is just a seven-year-old boy, he lifted the Govardhan hill on his little left finger. So, certain activities of Krishna are extraordinary. But if somebody hears about it, they don't have the proper understanding about who is Krishna. They tend to disbelieve it, or they tend to think it is some kind of mythological story. But actually, Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead. He has unlimited power. So, it is not at all impossible for Krishna to lift the Govardhan hill, or to kill some big demons. But, Krishna also performs activities as if he is an ordinary person. So, here it is being described how the exchange took place when he was leaving Hastinapura for Dwaraka. When he was leaving Hastinapura for Dwaraka, the Lord took pleasure when some of his devotees accepted him as less important in terms of love. No one is greater than or equal to the Lord, but he takes pleasure in being treated as younger than his devotees. See, this is Krishna's transcendental pastime, that even though those who recognize him, they respect him as the supreme Lord, they offer obeisances always, under all circumstances. Everyone offers obeisances to him as the supreme Lord. But, Krishna takes pleasure when his pure devotees treat him as an equal or treat him as a subordinate. Krishna takes pleasure. So, that is the personal aspect of the Lord. The Lord is the supreme Lord, as a personality. This is the feature of a personality. That they take pleasure or they love something, then it doesn't matter whether etiquette demands something else. So, these are all transcendental pastimes of the Lord, and the impersonalist cannot enter into the supernatural role.

### Separation from Krishna, Attractiveness of Krishna, Conditioned Souls, Devotion, Vrindavan Pastimes

**Key Quote:** "Lord Sri Krishna is so attractive for the living beings, especially for the devotees, that it is impossible for them to tolerate separation."
**Summary:** This segment explains the unbearable feeling of separation from Krishna experienced by devotees, especially the Vrajavasis when Krishna left Vrindavan, and how this separation is a testament to Krishna's supreme attractiveness and the deep love of His devotees, contrasting this with the forgetfulness of conditioned souls under the influence of illusion.

Now, as regards Bhima and Arjuna, because they were equal in age to Lord Krishna, they embraced him. So, mutually they embraced each other, because they are equals. And, Nakula and Sahadeva are younger to Krishna, therefore they bowed down to Krishna. So, this is the description of Krishna leaving for Dwaraka. He mounted his chariot, and after he was properly bowing down, and receiving embraces, etc. The 9th and 10th verse describe further, Subhadra Draupadi Kunti Virata Tanaya Tatha Gandhari Dhritarashtrascha Yuyatsur Gautamo Yamao Vrukodascha Dhaumyascha Striyo Matsya Sudadayaha Nasehire Vimukhyanto Viraham Sarangadhanmanaha This is two verses, the 9th and the 10th verses. In these verses, it is described, the translation of these two verses. At that time, Subhadra Draupadi Kunti Uttara Gandhari Dhritarashtra Yuyatsur Krupacharya Nakula Sahadeva Bhimasena Dhaumya and Satyavati, all nearby, all nearly fainted, because it was impossible for them to bear separation from Lord Krishna. So this is describing, what is the reaction of the residents of the palace of Hastinapura when Krishna was leaving for Dwarka. Krishna has mounted his chariot. Now what was the reaction? They all felt that this separation is impossible to bear for them. All these personalities. So Prabhupada explains in the purport the reason for this. Prabhupada says, Lord Sri Krishna is so attractive for the living beings, especially for the devotees, that it is impossible for them to tolerate separation. This is the meaning of the word Krishna. He is supremely attractive. So he is attractive for everyone. But then somebody may say, I don't feel attracted to Krishna. That is explained by Prabhupada here as the conditioned soul. All of us are conditioned souls in the present condition, the present situation. We are all conditioned souls. Under the spell of the illusory energy, the illusory energy forgets the Lord. So because of the influence of illusion on all of us, we forget Krishna. That means we do not recognize Krishna. We do not remember Krishna. We do not know about Krishna like that. Otherwise, the living entity can never forget Krishna. If we are not under the influence of illusion, we cannot, we can never forget Krishna. So the feeling of such separation cannot be described but can simply be imagined by devotees only. What is the kind of separation a devotee feels? Another devotee can understand that. Non-devotees cannot understand. What is this? Because this is separation from the most beloved personality, the most attractive personality, the most loving personality, the most intimately related personality. So the separation is unbearable. It's unbearable. Prabhupada also describes, not only an example is given here, Krishna leaving Hastinapura for Dwaraka, but when Krishna left Vrindavan and came to Mathura, after it is described here, after the separation from Vrindavan of the great innocent rural cowherd boys, girls, ladies and others, they all felt shocked throughout their lives, the Vrajavasis. They felt the shock of separation and they experienced that throughout their lives because Krishna never went back. Though when leaving Vrindavan, Krishna told the Vrajavasis, I'll come back after few days. I got some work in Mathura. But He never returned. Krishna never returned to Vrindavan.

### Radharani's Separation, Brajavasis' Love, Kurukshetra Meeting, Devotee Relationships, Intimate Attachment to Krishna

**Key Quote:** "So deep and so intimate is the attachment for Krishna among pure devotees. So this we have to understand."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the intense separation felt by Radharani and the Brajavasis, their heart-rending reunion with Krishna in Kurukshetra, and the unique and varied relationships devotees have with the Lord, emphasizing the impossibility of separation for those who have directly contacted Krishna.

So the Brajavasis, rest of their life they simply were crying and crying and crying and crying in separation from Krishna. This is their attachment to Krishna. So that is described here. The separation of Radharani, the most beloved cowherd girl, is beyond expression of all the devotees. The topmost devotee is Radharani. She felt the separation the most. So then it is also described once later on, much later. They met at Kurukshetra during a solar eclipse, the Brajavasis and Krishna coming from Dwaraka to Kurukshetra. Brajavasis coming from Vrindavan to Kurukshetra. And the feeling which was expressed by them is heart-rending. The feeling the Brajavasis expressed on seeing Krishna in Kurukshetra at the time of solar eclipse, that is very, very, very touching. There is of course a difference in the qualities of the transcendental devotees of the Lord. Not all are identical that way. They have varieties of relationships. But none of them who has ever contacted the Lord by direct communion or otherwise can leave him for a moment. That is never possible. Separation is never possible. And if at all they are separated, they feel that within the core of their heart, I cannot tolerate being away from Krishna even for a single moment. A fraction of a second I cannot tolerate. So deep and so intimate is the attachment for Krishna among pure devotees. So this we have to understand.

**Key Quote:** "Simply because of the presence of Krishna, everything will be in plenty."
**Summary:** The lecture begins with a discussion of Srimad Bhagavatam 1.11.1, focusing on Lord Krishna's entrance into Dwaraka and the prosperity that arises from His presence, emphasizing the connection between Krishna consciousness and material abundance.

In this session we will be discussing from the first verse of the eleventh chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is the beginning of the new chapter. This new chapter is entitled Lord Krishna's Entrance into Dwaraka. It is a natural sequence of the previous chapter. Previous chapter described departure of Lord Krishna for Dwaraka. Now this chapter is going to describe Lord Krishna's arrival in Dwaraka. Sūtavāca ānartāṁsa upavrajya svṛddhāṁ janapadāṁ svakāṁ dadmau dharavaram teṣāṁ viṣādam śamayan niva The meaning of this verse is Sūta Gosvāmī said, Sūta Gosvāmī speaking to the sages of Naimishāraṇya. He is describing these. Events leading to Parīkṣit Mahārāja meeting Śukadeva Gosvāmī. So Sūta Gosvāmī said, Upon reaching the border of his most prosperous metropolis known as the country of the ānartas or Dwaraka, the Lord sounded his auspicious conch shell heralding his arrival and apparently pacifying the dejection of the inhabitants. So the description is now being given. Krishna has reached Dwaraka. So he sounded his conch shell to announce, herald means to announce his arrival. And that sound of his conch shell which announced the Lord's arrival was, immediately able to pacify the dejection of the inhabitants. Dejection means the low spirits in which they were situated because of the absence of Krishna. Feeling separation from Krishna, they were in low spirits. Suddenly when they heard the conch shell, what happened? That's going to be described very nicely in the next few verses. So they are obviously very, very happy to hear that sound of the Lord's conch shell. Oh, the Lord has come back. And here the description of Dwaraka is the most prosperous metropolis. Simply because of the presence of Krishna, everything will be in plenty. Because Krishna is the source of everything. So even in the material world, material nature will supply, as was explained in the previous chapter, material nature will supply everything we require in plenty if we simply become Krishna conscious. If we simply become devotees of Krishna. So that is also being described here. The most prosperous metropolis known as Dwaraka. Called as Dwaraka.

**Key Quote:** "When the lord descends on the earth his eternal associates also come with him."
**Summary:** This segment delves into Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the inhabitants of Dwaraka as eternal associates of Krishna, their melancholia due to separation, and their intense affection for the Lord, highlighting the nature of spontaneous love of Godhead.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport. The beloved Lord was away from his own prosperous metropolis of Dwaraka for a considerably long period because of the battle of Kurukshetra. Krishna had gone from Dwaraka to Hastinapura. And he wanted to enthrone Yudhishthira as the emperor of the world. Krishna had come for... reducing the burden of the earth which was overburdened by demoniac forces. Posing as Kshatriyas but actually they were demons. So the last installment of wiping out these demoniac forces was done by Krishna through the battle of Kurukshetra. In which Krishna engaged his devotees. The Pandavas. In killing all these demons. But because of Krishna's presence on the battlefield they were all liberated. And Srila Prabhupada explains. The inhabitants because of Krishna being away from Dwaraka. They were overcome with melancholia due to the separation. Melancholia means. Sadness. They were overcome with sadness because Krishna was away. So Prabhupada explains what is the relationship between the inhabitants of Dwaraka and Krishna. When the lord descends on the earth his eternal associates also come with him. So these inhabitants of Dwaraka are not ordinary people. They are eternal associates of Krishna. Just as the entourage of a king accompanies him. Entourage means. Those who surround an important personality. Wherever he goes. He does not go alone. The king. He has his ministers. He has his secretaries. He has his bodyguards. He has his servants. He has all those people surrounding him. So like that the lord also has got his eternal associates. Always appearing with him whenever he appears in this world. Such associates of the lord are eternally liberated souls. And they cannot bear the separation of the lord even for a moment. Because of intense affection for the lord. The associates are very very deeply attached to Krishna. So therefore. When the attachment is very very. Very strong. Then the separation also they cannot bear even for one moment. Thus the inhabitants of the city of Dwaraka were in a mood of dejection. In a sad mood. Low spirits. And expected the arrival of the lord at any moment. They were alert. For. Receiving news of the lord's arrival. So the heralding sound of the auspicious conch shell was very encouraging.

**Summary:** The lecture discusses the spiritual feelings of separation and joy in the presence of the Lord, emphasizing that these are varieties of spiritual emotions accommodated in dealings between devotees and the Lord, highlighting the alertness and eagerness to receive the Lord as signs of spontaneous love.

And apparently the sound pacified their dejection. Apparently. Because. The devotees can never be. Separated from the lord. Because simply by thinking of the lord. They have his association. Simply by chanting his name. Simply by remembering his pastimes. That's the absolute nature of the lord. But still. There is a certain special feeling. In the presence of the lord. All are spiritual feelings. The feeling of separation. The feeling of. The. The feeling of. The presence of the lord bringing in a certain joy. That the lord has come back. All these are varieties of. Spiritual emotions. Which are all accommodated in spiritual dealings. Between the devotees of the lord. And the lord himself. In the spiritual world. Or even in the material world. In the lord incarnates. They were still more aspirant. To see the lord amongst themselves. And all of them became alert. To receive him in the befitting manner. These are signs. Of spontaneous love of godhead. So these are all. Special devotees. Of krishna. The second verse.

**Key Quote:** "By contact with Krishna, matter becomes spiritualized."
**Summary:** This segment focuses on the second verse and Prabhupada's purport, explaining the spiritual significance of the conch shell reddened by Krishna's lips, symbolizing the spiritualization of matter through contact with the Lord and engagement in devotional service.

The meaning of the second verse is. The white and fat bubble. Of the conch shell. Being gripped by the hand of lord krishna. And sounded by him. He blew his conch shell. Very loudly. Apparently. Sorry. Appeared to be reddened. By the touch of his transcendental lips. The conch shell is white. Krishna is blowing by. Touching it. To his lips. And his lips are completely red. So. The conch shell appeared to become reddened. It seemed that. A white swan was playing in the stems. Of red lotus flowers. A simile is given. So pravupara explains in the purport. The redness of the white conch shell. Due to the lip touch of the lord. Is a symbol of spiritual significance. The lord is all spirit. And matter is ignorance of this spiritual existence. See. Ways to understand. What's the difference between matter and spirit. Spirit is. The spiritual substance. Of which. The spiritual world is made. Spirit is. A living. Spirit is full of life. Living symptoms. And matter is. Dead matter. It is dull. But. The actual. Understanding of matter as opposed to spirit is. Ignorance of spiritual existence. Factually there is nothing like matter in spiritual enlightenment. When somebody is spiritually enlightened. Even in the material world. For them. There is no matter. Or in other words. They are able to engage even matter in Krishna's service. And matter becomes spiritualized. When engaged in devotional service. Spiritual enlightenment takes place at once. By the contact of the supreme lord Shri Krishna. By contact. With Krishna. Matter becomes. Spiritualized. The lord is present in every particle of his existence. And he can manifest his presence in anyone. Lord is everywhere. He is present. Fully present. Everywhere. But. For manifesting his presence. We have to. Make contact. With the supreme lord. So how is this contact made? By ardent love and devotional service to the lord. One can actually. Establish that spiritual contact with Krishna. Everything in spiritual contact with the lord. Becomes spiritually reddened. Like the conch shell in the grip of the lord.

### Srimad Bhagavatam, Krishna's presence, Devotee's feelings

**Key Quote:** "How can we exist without your presence?"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains the feelings of the citizens of Dwaraka upon Krishna's arrival, emphasizing their longing for his presence and the joy they experience upon seeing him.

In this session we will be discussing from the 10th verse of the 11th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Katham Vayam Natha Chiro Shite Tvai Prasanna Drishtya Khila Tapa Shoshanam Jivemate Sunda Rahasa Shobhitam Apashyamana Vadanam Manoharam Iti Chodiritha Vachachah Prajanam Bhaktavatsam Bhaktavatsalah Shunvaano Nugraham Drishtya Vitanvan Pravishat Puram. The meaning of this verse is: O Master, if you live abroad all the time, then we cannot look at your attractive face whose smiles vanquish all our sufferings. How can we exist without your presence? Upon hearing their speeches, the Lord, who is very kind to the citizens and the devotees, entered the city of Dwaraka and acknowledged all their greetings by casting his transcendental glance over them.

**Key Quote:** "All other material beauty will completely become insignificant"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the unparalleled beauty of Krishna and how a glimpse of his face can completely captivate a devotee, making material beauty seem insignificant in comparison.

Krishna has reached Dwaraka city, and the citizens have so nicely expressed their feelings to Krishna that Krishna acknowledged their greetings by casting his transcendental glance over them. So here we can particularly notice that those who are pure devotees of Krishna, they are always attracted by Krishna's most beautiful and attractive face, that they cannot take their eyes off Krishna's face. So even though we have experience of beauty in this material world, this material beauty cannot be compared with Krishna's supreme beauty. So if at all we are able to get a glimpse of Krishna's beautiful face, even for a brief moment, then we get completely attracted to Krishna, and consequently all other material beauty will completely become insignificant. We will never again go after material beauty. So how do we get attracted to Krishna's beautiful form by just getting a glimpse of Krishna's beautiful face?

**Key Quote:** "The relationship between Krishna and devotees is of varieties but whatever be the variety of relationship all relationships with Krishna are very very intimate"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how Krishna's smile can alleviate suffering and emphasizes the intimate and varied relationships devotees have with Krishna, highlighting Krishna's reciprocation with each devotee.

That is what is being described here, that when we cannot see your attractive face, then we are missing your beautiful smile which vanquishes all our sufferings. Of course, devotees don't suffer, but this is just to say that even if there were any suffering, it would simply disappear if the devotees just have a glimpse of Krishna's beautiful attractive face. So Krishna is very kind to his devotees, and devotees are very much attached to Krishna, so the relationship is very, very intimate. It doesn't matter what is the variety of the relationship, because the relationship between Krishna and devotees is of varieties, but whatever be the variety of relationship, all relationships with Krishna are very, very intimate. So therefore, any pure devotee of Krishna situated in any variety of relationship is always very, very much attached to Krishna, and Krishna equally reciprocates with every kind of devotee. That is a transcendental variegatedness in the spiritual world.

**Key Quote:** "Don't hear about Krishna from unauthorized sources, from people who do not factually know Krishna"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of hearing about Krishna from pure devotees like Srila Prabhupada, who provides authoritative descriptions based on the Srimad Bhagavatam, and warns against misleading information from unauthorized sources.

There are countless devotees, all of them in the spiritual world. Krishna's personal, pure devotees, they have very intimate relationship with Krishna. They are completely absorbed in thought of Krishna. They are only engaged in serving Krishna, and Krishna personally reciprocates with each and every devotee. This we have to always remember. Don't consider Krishna to be like another person of this material world. Never make that mistake. So we have to carefully read, hear, understand the truth, tattvataha. You have to understand who is Krishna. Don't hear about Krishna from unauthorized sources, from people who do not factually know Krishna. They will be misleading you. So hear from pure devotees, and for us Prabhupad is the pure devotee who perfectly describes Krishna, and he describes Krishna from the most authoritative source, the Srimad Bhagavatam. So in the purport to this verse, Srila Prabhupad explains, "Krishna's attraction is so powerful that once being attracted by him, one cannot tolerate separation from him."

**Key Quote:** "Krishna directed Vasudeva to transfer him and hide him in Vrindavan"
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Krishna's birth in Mathura, his transfer to Vrindavan to protect him from Kamsa, and his eventual return to Mathura to free his parents.

The example is there in the 10th canto of the Bhagavatam. Krishna, when he appeared 5000 years back, he was born in Mathura, and because Devaki and Vasudeva were anxious to protect Krishna, so Krishna directed Vasudeva to transfer him and hide him in Vrindavan. So Krishna in his Lila was hiding in Vrindavan for about 12 years, but actually Krishna's Lila is that his childhood he will spend in Vrindavan in the company of the Brajavasis who are his intimate devotees. Then Krishna left Vrindavan because he wanted to rescue his parents Vasudeva and Devaki who were being harassed by Kamsa, and Krishna and Balaram went from Vrindavan to Mathura in order to free his parents, and Kamsa was killed along with his associates.

### Jarasandha, Demoniac Nature, Krishna's protection, Separation from Krishna
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/5jXUlaUC-oM?t=576
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Once one is attracted by Krishna one cannot tolerate separation from him"
**Summary:** The speaker continues the narrative, describing Jarasandha's repeated attacks on Mathura and the intense feelings of separation experienced by the residents of Vrindavan when Krishna did not return.

But then Jarasandha became very envious of Krishna because Jarasandha's daughters were married to Kamsa. So when Kamsa was killed, Jarasandha's daughters became widows. Jarasandha became angry at Krishna that Krishna killed Kamsa. Jarasandha never considered why Kamsa was killed. He never thought about that. He never found fault with Kamsa. This is the way of the demoniac nature, Asuri Swabhava. So Jarasandha decided to attack Mathura and kill Krishna. Of course, demons are foolish, so foolish that they don't realize Krishna can never even be touched or approached by demons or materialistic persons, what to speak of killing Krishna. Anyway, Jarasandha decided to attack Mathura. He went with one division of army, and Krishna, in order to not disturb or involve the residents of Mathura in the fight against Jarasandha, Krishna and Balarama with few soldiers, they faced the army, huge army of Jarasandha outside Mathura, and Krishna and Balarama completely destroyed the entire army which had accompanied Jarasandha, but spared the life of Jarasandha. And Jarasandha attacked Mathura like this 17 times, and each time Jarasandha was defeated. But because Krishna became busy with all these things, the Brindavan, they were waiting for Krishna to return after finishing some business in Mathura, but Krishna never returned, so they were feeling the separation from Krishna very, very intensely, that they could not forget Krishna even for one moment, even though Krishna never returned to Brindavan. So that's why Prabhupada says, "Once one is attracted by Krishna, one cannot tolerate separation from him."

### Eternal relationship with Krishna, Sun and Sun Rays Analogy, Artificial Separation, Molecular parts of Krishna

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "We are eternally related with Krishna as the sun rays are eternally related with the sun disc"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the eternal relationship between the living entities and Krishna using the analogy of the sun and its rays, emphasizing that the separation is artificial and due to the influence of material energy.

Why is this so? Prabhupada explains, "Because we are eternally related with Krishna as the sun rays are eternally related with the sun disc. The sun rays are molecular parts of the solar radiation. Thus the sun rays and the sun cannot be separated. Can you have sun rays without sun planet? No. Can you have sun planet without sun planet emanating sun rays? That is also not possible. So the sun rays and the sun planet are always together, always connected. Now there is something called a separation by the cloud, but that separation by the cloud of ourselves and the sun is temporary and artificial, and as soon as the cloud is cleared, the sun rays again display the natural effulgence in the presence of the sun. Similarly, the living entities who are molecular parts of the solar radiation, sorry, the living entities who are molecular parts of the whole spirit Krishna, are separated from the Lord by the artificial energy."

**Key Quote:** "So was Dwarka protected by the descendants of Vrishni, Bhoja, Madhu, Dasharha, Arha, Kukkura, Andhaka, etc., who were as strong as Lord Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 11th verse of the 11th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, describing the protection of Dwarka by the Vrishni dynasty.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 11th and the 12th verses of the 11th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. The 11th verse first, Madhu Bhoja Dasharhaarha Kukkurandhaka Vrishnibhihi Atma Tulya Balair Guptam Nagair Bhogavateem Iva. The meaning of this verse is, as Bhagavati, the capital of Nagaloka, is protected from the Nagas, so was Dwarka protected by the descendants of Vrishni, Bhoja, Madhu, Dasharha, Arha, Kukkura, Andhaka, etc., who were as strong as Lord Krishna. So the description is given that the residents of Dwarka were very nicely protected from the vrishnis. The reason for this is because the brothers of all the 3 great Mountains, Pushkara and Vrishna were also very well protected. They had different clans. They were divided by the Vrishnis. There were several clans of the Vrishni dynasty. They are named as Bhoja Dynasty, Madhu Dynasty, the Dasharha Dynasty, Arha Dynasty, Kukkura Dynasty, Andhaka Dynasty. So the members of these dynasties were known as the Vrishnis.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The city of Dwarka was well protected by the descendants of Vrishni who were as powerful as the Lord insofar as he manifested his strength upon this earth"
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport on the 11th verse, comparing Dwarka's protection to Nagloka and discussing the extent of Lord Krishna's manifested power.

They had three clan of Vrishni. They were protecting Dwarka because they were as strong as Lord Krishna. Now Prabhupad clarifies in the purport what is the meaning of this 'as strong as Lord Krishna.' So Srila Prabhupada first of all says the comparison is made to Nagloka. So in the purport Srila Prabhupada says the Nagloka planet is situated below the earth planet and it is understood that the sun rays are hampered there. The darkness of the planet is however removed by the flashes of the jewels set on the head of the Nagas, the celestial serpents, and it is said that there are beautiful gardens, rivulets etc. for the enjoyment of the Nagas. It is understood here also that the place is well protected by the inhabitants called the Nagas, so also the city of Dwarka was well protected by the descendants of Vrishni who were as powerful as the Lord insofar as he manifested his strength upon this earth. So we understand this point, the Lord is unlimitedly powerful, but when he descends into this world he manifests a certain strength which is required for the purpose of his pastimes, so as much strength he manifested in Dwarka for the sake of his Leela as the king of Dwarka, to that extent all the Vrishnis were powerful

**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains the 12th verse, describing the opulence and natural beauty of Dwarka, contrasting it with modern cities.

enough to give sufficient protection to the residents of Dwarka. In the twelfth verse it is explained, the twelfth verse Sarvarthu Sarva Vibhava Punya Vriksha Latashramaihi Udhyana Upavana Aaramair Vrita Padmakara Shriyam. The meaning of this verse is, the city of Dwarka puri was filled with opulences of all seasons, there were hermitages, orchards, flower gardens, parks, and reservoirs of water breeding lotus flowers all over. So, Srila Prabhupada explains this beauty of the city of Dwaraka. Perfection of human civilization is made possible by utilizing the gifts of nature in their own way. As we find here within the description of its opulence, Dwaraka was surrounded by flower gardens and fruit orchards along with reservoirs of water and growing lotuses. There is no mention of mills and factories supported by slaughterhouses which are the necessary paraphernalia of the modern metropolis. The propensity to utilize nature is the same as the propensity to utilize nature.

**Key Quote:** "Advancement of civilization is estimated not on the growth of mills and factories to deteriorate the finer instincts of the human being."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the natural opulence of Dwarka with the problems of modern industrial civilization, highlighting the deterioration of human instincts due to factories and slums.

The propensity to utilize nature is the same as the propensity to utilize nature. Nature's own gifts is still there even in the heart of modern civilized man. The leaders of modern civilization select their own residential quarters in a place where there are such naturally beautiful gardens and reservoirs of water. But they leave the common men to reside in congested areas without parks and gardens. The leaders of modern civilization select their own residential quarters in a place where there are such naturally beautiful gardens and reservoirs of water. The leaders of modern civilization select their own residential quarters in a place where there are such naturally beautiful gardens and Bloodaremos in private. The places OR basis are occupied by the leaders. But the congested SLUM areas are left for the common man. In two or three quarters is a village outskirts of Dwaraka. But in two or three quarters is a village outskirts of Dwaraka. Even if people live in your place, the village will define you as Kリணatesvara. Question is the fact that here we find of course a different description of the City of Dwaraka. It is understood that the whole Dham or the residential round quad was surrounded by such gardens and trees. It is as the city actor of Dvaraka knows some villages yet Dwaraka seems Hembred out of it. was surrounded by such gardens and parks with reservoirs of water where lotuses grow. It is understood that all the people depended on nature's gifts of fruits and flowers without industrial enterprises promoting filthy huts and slums for residential quarters. Advancement of civilization is estimated not on the growth of mills and factories to deteriorate the finer instincts of the human being. Modern civilization, the so called development of technology leads to mass production of some items in very very difficult situation in the factories.

**Key Quote:** "And such activities deteriorate the finer sentiments of the human being and society to form a dungeon of demons."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses 'ugra karma' (pungent activities) and its connection to demoniac nature, contrasting it with the spiritual atmosphere of Dwarka.

So the labor class, they are engaged in this production and they are not given proper facilities for residing in this city. And as a result of their engaging in ugra karma, pungent activities, their finer instincts as humans deteriorate. Whereas in the case of Dwarka Dham, the arrangement is such that the atmosphere helps to develop the potent spiritual instincts of human beings and that atmosphere gives them a chance to go back to Godhead. So Srila Prabhupada further explains, development of factories and mills is called ugra karma or pungent activities. This ugra karma is mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita also. In the description of divine and demoniac nature in 16th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, the qualities of divine natured people and the qualities of demoniac natured people are elaborately described in that 16th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. So one of the qualities described of demoniac natured people is that they engage in ugra karma, pungent activities.

**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between pious and impious trees, criticizing the planting of only impious trees in modern cities.

And such activities deteriorate the finer sentiments of the human being and society to form a dungeon of demons. The demoniac nature flourishes when there is such ugra karma performed by the laborers. We find herein the mention of pious trees which produce seasonal flowers and fruits. The impious trees are useless jungles only and they can only be used to supply fuels. So among trees also, pious trees and impious trees. Pious trees yield something useful like fruits, flowers or medicinal herbs like that or fragrant flowers, very sweet fruits. Whereas these impious trees, they don't give any such fruits, flowers or useful leaves. They only at best can be used for some burning the wood when the wood is dry after the tree has been cut down. In the modern civilization, such impious trees are planted on the sides of trees. You can see all over in the city. None of the roads where the government arranges to plant trees, they have any pious trees. No flowers, no fruits, only impious trees are planted.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna not only teaches by instructing us but also manifesting the ideal atmosphere, ideal development which he demonstrated in Dwarka."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of developing finer senses for spiritual understanding, utilizing nature's gifts, and highlights Dwarka as an ideal civilization demonstrated by Krishna.

Human energy, Srila Prabhupada explains, should be properly utilized in developing the finer senses for spiritual understanding in which lies the solution of life. As human beings, we have developed intelligence. So if the proper atmosphere is created, then we can develop the finer senses. And with such a development, it leads to spiritual understanding. Spiritual understanding gives us the clue for the ultimate solution to all problems. Otherwise, we are simply busy making a temporary patchwork solution to various problems in this material world. So fruits, flowers, beautiful gardens, parks and reservoirs of water with ducks and swans playing in the midst of lotus flowers and cows giving sufficient milk and butter are essential for developing the finer tissues of the human body. There is a whole plan by the Supreme Lord that this nature's gifts can be utilized for developing the finer tissues in the brain to understand spiritual subject matter and thereby prepare ourselves to go back to Godhead and thereby make a complete solution, perfect solution for all problems. As against this, the dungeon of mines, factories and workshops develop demoniac propensities in the working class. The vested interests flourish at the cost of the working class and consequently there are severe clashes between them in so many ways. You see the problem with the modern civilization. The labor class are not properly given facilities and they develop this demoniac tendency and they always keep fighting. The description of Dwarka Dham is the ideal of human civilization. So Krishna not only teaches by instructing us but also manifesting the ideal atmosphere, ideal development which he demonstrated in Dwarka.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the Vedic tradition of using natural decorations with modern artificial decorations, highlighting the environmental benefits of biodegradable natural products compared to non-biodegradable materials like plastic.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, signs of decoration in special festivals were also collected from the gifts of nature such as the plantain trees, the mango trees, fruits and flowers. Mango trees, coconut palms and plantain trees are still accepted as auspicious signs. Whenever there is a need in the Vedic culture for decoration, they utilize such natural things. They don't manufacture artificially some decorative items. Such artificial decorative items are later on very difficult to dispose of. Just like nowadays so much of hue and cry, about plastic, the plastic waste is very difficult to dispose of. Whereas all these natural products, they are, as is said, biodegradable. So, there is no difficulty in disposing them off. And they are easily available without much endeavor on the part of the people to purchase them. So, there is no difficulty in disposing them off.

The entrance of the temple, the picture of Hanuman and Garuda are always painted at the entrance, even the deity of Hanuman Garuda are there in the beginning of the temple, so they are the great servitors of the Lord. Both render valuable service to the Supreme Lord. For devotees such paintings and decorations are still adored and the servitor of the master is paid more respects for the satisfaction of the Lord. Krishna says in Bhagavatam, madbhakta puja abhyadika, worship of my devotee is greater than worship of me. Krishna says that in Bhagavatam eleventh canto while instructing Uddhava. So Hanuman and Garuda are great servants of the Supreme Lord, so when they are paid respects by the devotees the Lord is thoroughly pleased by such respects paid to his dear

servants. So the flags were decorated with paintings of Garuda or Hanuman. So in the Bhagavatam there is a description of different pastimes of the Lord with Garuda participating in those pastimes. When Krishna went with Satyabhama to the Indra loka to get one parijata tree, that time he went on the back of Garuda. And when Krishna had to fight against Banasura, then during one month he, similar to the time pressure on Lord Shiva to get the tree, then he went to, he was carried to that capital of Banasura by Garuda and Garuda also was assisting the Lord in fighting against Banasura. So in this way even Hanuman, Hanuman serves the Supreme Lord in his form as Ramachandra and Ramayana, the elaborate description is there how Hanuman served Lord Rama in so many ways. Hanuman is extraordinarily powerful but he uses all that power only for service of Lord Rama, not for any other purpose. As opposed to that, people in this world due to some pious credits if they have got some power they want to utilize that for their own good, for lauding over others or for their own sense gratification. But the devotees never utilize anything they may have or they may possess or they may acquire for their own sense gratification, they never use it for lauding over others because the Supreme Lord is the Lord of everyone, he is the Lord and everything should be utilized for His service.

**Key Quote:** "everything is used simply for devotional service of the Supreme Lord that's all that's the ideal"
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the ideal of using all abilities and power for the devotional service of the Supreme Lord, citing Garuda's devotion as an example.

Because everything belongs to him, Isha vastyam idam sarvam yatkincha jagattyaham jagat. So therefore these two devotees, servitors of the Supreme Lord are always engaged in the service of the Lord and they are very powerful personalities. It is said Garuda when he's flapping his wings when carrying the Lord, the hymns of the Sama Veda emanate from the flapping of the wings of Garuda. This is the devotion of Garuda, great personalities, they have extraordinary power, abilities but everything is used simply for devotional service of the Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "the highways subways lanes markets and public meeting places were all thoroughly cleansed and then moistened with scented water"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 14th verse, describing the cleanliness and opulence of Dwarka, where roads were cleansed and scented with natural flower extracts to welcome the Lord.

They teach us the ideal way of utilizing whatever we may possess. The 14th verse: samarjit mahamarga rathya apanaka chatwaram siktaam gandha jalair uptaam phala pushpakshatam kuraihi. The meaning of this verse is: the highways, subways, lanes, markets and public meeting places were all thoroughly cleansed and then moistened with scented water. See the opulence of Dwarka is to clean all the roads thoroughly with water and then sprinkle scented water, nice fragrance to welcome the Lord. Fruits, flowers and unbroken seeds were strewn everywhere and this is also the opulence of the inhabitants of Dwaraka. So many fruits, so much flowers are there because the flower gardens are giving plenty of flowers and fruit orchards are supplying plenty of fruits. So they can afford to strew them everywhere in order to welcome the Lord on the streets, in the junction places, road junctions and in the arches. So Srila Prabhupada explains, scented waters prepared by distilling flowers like rose and khevra, were requisitioned to wet the roads, streets and lanes of Dwaraka Dham. Again, scent is not artificially prepared by some chemicals but rather by distilling natural flowers which have got nice fragrance. Such places along with the market place and public meeting places were thoroughly cleansed.

**Key Quote:** "Cleanliness is very prominent in Vedic civilization."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of cleanliness in Vedic civilization and contrasts the former abundance of parks and gardens with the modern-day concrete jungles in cities.

So clean. So cleanliness is very prominent in Vedic civilization. That means they are situated in the goodness, mode of goodness. If not in the transcendental spiritual platform. Of course Dwaraka Nivasis are on the transcendental platform. But even those who are not on the transcendental platform, they should at least be in the mode of goodness. That helps to develop the pious activities leading to ultimate development of bhakti. From the above description it appears that the city of Dwaraka Dham was considerably big, containing many highways, streets and public meeting places with parks, gardens and reservoirs of water, all very nicely decorated with flowers and fruits. Nowadays we don't find so many parks or gardens in cities especially, because people have become very very greedy for constructing so many buildings. The cities are more like concrete jungles, especially the most developed cities even in our country. Formerly there used to be more gardens and parks and open spaces.

**Key Quote:** "When Krishna Consciousness is there, there is plenty of supply of everything by material nature."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna consciousness leads to an abundance of natural resources and describes Dwaraka as an ideal city where everyone was devoted to Krishna.

But now you don't find that. To welcome the Lord such flowers and fruits with unbroken seeds of grain were strewn over the public places. This is the opulence of the residence of Dwaraka. Of course when Krishna Consciousness is there, there is plenty of supply of everything by material nature, because material nature is directed by the Supreme Lord. Maya Dhyakshena Prakriti Hisu Yatesu Characharam. So the Lord will direct nature to supply everything when people are God conscious, Krishna conscious. When people become sinful then material nature withholds the production of grains and fruits and flowers, and grains won't be sufficient like that. Unbroken seeds of grain or fruits in the seedling stage were considered auspicious, and they are still so used by the Hindus in general on festival days. So this is the culture, that decorations are done using natural supplies by nature, natural gifts like fruits, flowers, unbroken seeds, water pots with yogurt and grains like that. So Dwaraka, so Dwaraka where Krishna resided with all the Vrishnis, his relatives and friends and his family members was the ideal city and everyone there was devoted to Krishna, were devotees of Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam describing the festive reception of Krishna in Dwaraka, emphasizing the auspicious decorations and atmosphere.

In this session we will be discussing from the 15th verse of the 11th chapter of the 1st canto of Shreemad Bhagavata.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Without distribution of food no function is complete and that is the way of Vedic tradition"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's teachings about the importance of worshiping the Lord with requisite ingredients and distributing the remnants (prasadam) as an essential part of Vedic culture.

So Srila Prabhupada says a very important point here in the purport: the process of reception according to Vedic rites is not at all dry. The reception was made not simply by decorating the roads and streets as above mentioned, but by worshiping the Lord with requisite ingredients like incense, lamps, flowers, sweets, fruits, and other palatable eatables according to one's capacity. You see, so worship of the Lord is the center point in all these decorations, all the arrangements, worship of the Lord. So the Vishnu Purana says the entire varnashrama dharma aims at worship of Vishnu by all the members of this society irrespective of which classification they belong. The worship of the Lord Vishnu is the goal of practicing varnashrama dharma and only by worship of Vishnu, the Supreme Lord, can we perfect our life, can we prepare ourselves to get ultimate liberation and go back home, back to Godhead. So that was clearly demonstrated by the Supreme Lord Vishnu, these devotees of Dwaraka, how they received the Lord and how they worshipped him. So Srila Prabhupada further says all were offered to the Lord, everything that they were using for decorating and the items they had kept ready to receive the Lord, they were used to not only decorate but also to offer to the Lord like incense, lamps, fruits, and edibles, different eatables, and the remnants of foodstuff are distributed amongst the gathering citizens. So it was not like a dry reception of these modern days. Modern days they have reception for some important personalities or leaders but there is no distribution of foodstuff, there's no worship of the Lord, that is missing, that is lacking. Each and every house was ready to receive the Lord in a similar way and thus each and every house on the roads and streets distributed such remnants of food to the citizens and therefore the festival was successful. Without distribution of food no function is complete and that is the

**Key Quote:** "If they eat food which is not offered to Krishna, then they are eating sin."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Bhagavad Gita to explain that eating food not offered to Krishna leads to sinful reactions, emphasizing the importance of offering food as a sacrifice.

Vedic culture. This is the Vedic culture, that Vedic culture means worship of the Lord and the remnants are distributed to the people who participate in this festival. So it's not a dry reception or dry festival, no. So Prabhupada says no function is complete in the Vedic culture without distribution of food. Regarding distribution of food, in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains in the third chapter, thirteenth verse, yajna shishta asinaha santaha mucchante sarva-kilbhishaihi bunjate tetu agham paapa ye pachanti atmakaranat. Very important verse, where Krishna describes in this third chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, that devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins, because they eat food which is offered first for sacrifice. Yajna is sacrifice, yajna shishta is remnants of food offered for yajna. Others who prepare food for personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin. Krishna says this in the Bhagavad Gita. Bunjate means they eat. Who? Agham paapa, huge quantities of sin. Who are they? Ye pachanti, those who prepare food, atmakaranat, for their own sense enjoyment. There is no offering made to the Supreme Lord. So, nowadays you can see, most people, they simply purchase some ready-made food, and eat it, or they prepare something at home that is also simply prepared and eaten. They do not know that they have to worship the Lord and offer him foodstuff, and only accept remnants of food. So, what is wrong if simply somebody eats without offering to the Lord? It is explained in this verse of the Bhagavad Gita, if they

**Key Quote:** "So when we are to offer food, we should remember, we should offer food only that is in the mode of goodness."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that taking birth in the material world is due to past sinful activities and that we should offer food in the mode of goodness to Krishna.

Our taking birth itself in this material world is because of our past sinful activities. So we already are carrying a load of sinful reactions from our past life or past lives. Now adding to that more sinful reactions by not offering food and simply consuming food, not offering food is only going to increase our suffering in this world. Regarding the type of food that should be offered to Krishna, Krishna accepts only food which is in the mode of goodness. So what is food in the mode of goodness? It is described in the 17th chapter, 8th verse. āyuḥ sattva balārogyaḥ sukhaḥ prīti vyavardhanāḥ rasyaḥ snigdhāḥ sthirāḥ hṛdyāḥ āhārāḥ sātvikaḥ priyāḥ That which is in the mode of goodness, food is in the mode of goodness, increase the duration of life, āyuḥ. Purify one's existence, sattva. Bala, they give strength. ārogyaḥ, they promote good health. Sukhaḥ means they give happiness. And prīti vyavardhanāḥ and they give satisfaction. And further characteristics of such food, such nourishing foods are sweet, juicy, fattening and palatable. So unless food is palatable, unless food is of this characteristic, it is not in the mode of goodness. Typically, food in the mode of passion is very, very pungent, extremely spicy. Excess of spice is used or excess of salt or excess of sourness, chili, like that. And food in the mode of ignorance is completely decomposing and stale. And that which is untouchable, in the Vedic language, untouchable is that which is stool and flesh, animal flesh, animal eggs, animal remains. So these are all untouchables.

**Key Quote:** "Prasadam distribution should be there."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of performing sacrifices in the mode of goodness and emphasizes the significance of prasadam distribution in temples, following Srila Prabhupada's instructions.

So when we are to offer food, we should remember, we should offer food only that is in the mode of goodness. And further, regarding sacrifice, Krishna says in the 17th chapter, 13th verse, The meaning of this verse is, That sacrifice performed in defiance of scriptural injunctions, in which no spiritual food is distributed, no hymns are chanted, and no remunerations are made to the priests, and which is faithless, that sacrifice is of the nature of ignorance. So merely doing a sacrifice is not enough. The sacrifice has to be performed in the mode of goodness. So the characteristic of Tamsik sacrifice, or sacrifice in the mode of ignorance is, food is not distributed. As opposed to this, what was described in this 15th verse, in the description of Dwaraka Dham, how they received Krishna, they worshipped Krishna, they offered night foodstuffs to him, and the remnants were distributed among the people. Even when Prabhupada established his Kaun temples, he always said, Prasadam distribution should be there. Prasadam distribution should be there. So it's the Vedic culture, the temple's food is offered to the deity, who is worshipped, Krishna or Vishnu deity, and the remnants are distributed among the temple visitors. This is the Vedic culture. Prasadam distribution.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by highlighting the benefits of prasadam distribution in Kali Yuga, emphasizing its ability to purify the heart, awaken devotion, and facilitate spiritual advancement, ending with a Hare Krishna.

Prasadam distribution is also important in Kali Yuga because people can purify their heart of sinful reactions simply by taking Prasadam, Krishna Prasadam. And not only it purifies their heart of sinful reactions, but it also awakens their dormant devotion. Prasadam is completely satisfying to the tongue and even to the mind. Prasadam nourishes the body very nicely. So such Krishna Prasadam should be offered, nice preparation should be offered, palatable, sweet, juicy, nourishing. Foods in the mode of goodness should be offered to Krishna and the remnants should be distributed. Only then will people easily become Krishna conscious. They will progress on the path of bhakti and they will be able to actually make spiritual advancement, develop all good qualities that are to be found in devatas. Asyasthi bhakti bhagavati akinchana sarvair gunaistatra samasate suraha All good qualities are to be found in those who engage in pure devotional service and develop all divine qualities.

So here is a description of the most intimate family members of Krishna, Krishna's father Vasudeva. The most dear Krishna was approaching Dwaraka Dhamma, magnanimous Vasudeva, Akrura, Ugrasena, his grandfather, Balaram, his brother, Pradyumna, his son, Charudeshna, Samba, all sons of Krishna. They were extremely happy to hear that Krishna is coming back to Dwaraka Dhamma, returning to Dwaraka Dhamma.

**Key Quote:** "So, all the eight daughters of Devaka, Ugrasena's brother, were married by Vasudeva."
**Summary:** The speaker begins to describe the personalities mentioned in the verses, starting with Vasudeva, detailing his lineage, marriages, and relationship to Krishna and other important figures.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada gives a brief description of each of these personalities. First of all, he describes the personality of Vasudeva. Now, all these personalities actually are participating in Krishna Leela in certain roles. But actually, in the spiritual world, their actual position may be different in some cases. So here, it's described Vasudeva was the son of King Shurasena. Shurasena was ruling, King of the district of Shurasena. And his son was Vasudeva. Krishna appeared as the son of Vasudeva and husband of Devaki. Vasudeva married Devaki, and Devaki was the mother of Krishna. Krishna appeared from the womb of Devaki. And, of course, Vasudeva is described as the father of Lord Shri Krishna. He is also, Vasudeva is also the brother of Kunti. Kunti is the mother of the Pandavas. So, Kunti's brother is Vasudeva. And Vasudeva is also the father of Subhadra. Vasudeva and Devaki had eight sons and one daughter. That one daughter was Subhadra. Krishna appeared as, was born as, the eighth son of Vasudeva and Devaki. Balaram actually was the seventh son of Vasudeva and Devaki, but he was transferred to the womb of Rohini by Krishna's own arrangement for his lila, for his pastimes. Then further, Srila Prabhupada says, Subhadra was married with her cousin, Arjuna, because Subhadra and Arjuna are daughter and son of Vasudeva and Kunti, who are brother and sister. So, therefore, Subhadra and Arjuna are cousins. But Srila Prabhupada says, such marriage is permitted, and this system is still prevalent in some parts of India, even today. Vasudeva was appointed minister of Ugrasena, and later on, he married eight daughters of Ugrasena's brother, Devaka. Ugrasena's brother, Devaka, had eight daughters. Devaki was one of them. So, Vasudeva not only married Devaki, but he also married the other seven sisters of Devaki. So, all the eight daughters of Devaka, Ugrasena's brother, were married by Vasudeva.

**Key Quote:** "This is called Krishna Leela, actually."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of Vasudeva and Devaki, focusing on Kamsa's attempts to kill Krishna, the transfer of Balaram to Rohini's womb, and Krishna's eventual birth and transfer to Gokula.

Kamsa was his brother-in-law. That means Kamsa, as the son of Ugrasena, was the brother-in-law of Vasudeva. Vasudeva accepted voluntary imprisonment by Kamsa on mutual agreement. Then, to deliver the eighth son of Devaki, this is described in the tenth canto of the Bhagavatam, that before Krishna's appearance, there was a prophecy that the eighth son of Devaki would be the cause of death of Kamsa. So, Kamsa immediately arrested. He was about to kill Devaki, but Vasudeva somehow convinced Kamsa not to kill Devaki, on the promise that every child born of Devaki, he would hand over to Kamsa. So, Kamsa, in order to ensure that every child that is born would be handed over to him, he imprisoned Vasudeva and Devaki. Now, this Kamsa, cruel Kamsa, killed the first six sons born of Devaki and Vasudeva, Shatgarbha. And, when Devaki became pregnant for the seventh time, then that child was transferred by arrangement of Yogamaya, by Krishna's arrangement through Yogamaya, the seventh son of Devaki and Vasudeva was transferred to Rohini's womb, from Devaki's womb. That was Balaram. And, Kamsa thought the seventh pregnancy was a miscarriage. The child died in the womb. That's what Kamsa thought. And then, Krishna appeared as the eighth son in the womb of Devaki, but when Devaki was pregnant for the eighth time, Kamsa was just waiting. Now, this child is going to take birth. I must kill this child as soon as it's born. But, Kamsa could not actually lay his hands on the child, eighth child which is born of the womb of Devaki. Krishna appeared middle of the night by potency of Yogamaya. Kamsa and all the doorkeepers and prison keepers were all asleep under the influence of Yogamaya. And, that is when Vasudeva and Devaki offered wonderful prayers to Krishna when Krishna appeared. And, because they were anxious to protect Krishna, Krishna instructed Vasudeva to transfer him from the prison of Kamsa to the house of Nanda Maharaj and Yashoda, from Mathura to Gokula. And, that's what Vasudeva did in the middle of the night. And, while all this was happening, Kamsa is fast asleep and all his doorkeepers are also asleep. So, this is called Krishna Leela, actually. It's Krishna's pastime.

**Key Quote:** "We should hear from the scriptures. The divine nature of all of Krishna's activities."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the divine nature of Krishna's activities and the importance of understanding them through scripture, continuing with Vasudeva's role as the maternal uncle of the Pandavas and his eventual disappearance.

His appearance, his activities are all divine. And, how to understand these activities as divine is explained in the Srimad Bhagavatam in great detail. We should not speculate or we should not give our own interpretation. No. We should hear from the scriptures the divine nature of all of Krishna's activities. Then, further, it is described Vasudeva as the maternal uncle of the Pandavas. That means, Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva, their mother's brother, maternal uncle is Vasudeva. So, as maternal uncle of Pandavas, he took active part in purificatory processes of the Pandavas, Samskaras. When Krishna appeared within the bars of Kamsa's prison house, Krishna was transferred by Vasudeva to the house of Nandaman. That's what I explained in detail. Krishna disappeared along with Baladeva prior to the disappearance of Vasudeva. Therefore, Arjuna took charge of funeral ceremony after Vasudeva's disappearance. These are all pastimes of Krishna and his devotees, intimate devotees. They are also under the protection of Yoga Maya.

Next, the description is given about Akrura. Akrura was a great devotee of Krishna. He is famous for having attained success in devotional service by one single process of offering prayers, vandanam of the nine different processes of bhakti. Akrura is famous for perfecting his devotional service simply by offering wonderful prayers. His prayers are given in the Bhagavatam in the tenth canto, prayers by Akrura to offer to Lord Krishna. Beautiful prayers are given. He glorifies Krishna as the one Supreme Lord who appears in so many different Indian incarnations and he has sung a song which is not only describing the ten incarnations but describes more than ten, about twenty incarnations he describes, including the ten famous Dashavatara incarnations of Krishna. So, Akrura is famous for having offered wonderful prayers to Krishna and perfected his devotional service.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the power of bhakti and continues describing Akrura's role in Krishna's pastimes, including his support of Arjuna's marriage to Subhadra and his presence at Abhimanyu's wedding.

Bhakti is so nice, simply by hearing about Krishna, simply by singing Krishna's glory, simply by offering prayers to Krishna or simply by remembering Krishna's pastimes, one can achieve all. The power of perfection, complete self-realization and ultimate liberation. That is the power of bhakti. So Akrura is described as the commander-in-chief of the Vrishni dynasty. He was also a Kshatriya. But most importantly, Akrura is a great devotee of Lord Krishna. He was the husband of Suthani, who was the daughter of Ahuka. Ahuka is another name for Ugrasena, so Ugrasena is the father-in-law of Akrura. Akrura married daughter of Ugrasena. Now, Akrura supported Arjuna when Arjuna took Subhadra forcibly away by the will of Krishna. Subhadra is Krishna's sister. Now, Krishna wanted to marry his sister to Arjuna, but Balaram wanted to marry his sister to Duryodhana. So Krishna arranged that before Balaram could fix that marriage, Arjuna kidnapped Subhadra, and Krishna and Akrura actually went and met Arjuna after the kidnapping. So both of them presented dowries to Arjuna after this incidence because there was no proper marriage like that. Then Akrura was also present when Abhimanyu, the son of Subhadra, was married with Uttara, the mother of Maharaj Pariksit.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Ugrasena's history, including his imprisonment by Kamsa, his divine nature, and his eventual reinstatement as king by Krishna and Balarama, also highlighting his inquiry to Narada about Krishna's divinity.

So here is a description about Ugrasena. Ugrasena was one of the powerful kings of the Vrishni dynasty and cousin of Krishna. Ugrasena was the son of Maharaj Kuntibhoja. His other name is Ahuka. His minister was Vasudeva and his son was the powerful Kamsa. This Kamsa imprisoned Ugrasena and forcibly became the king of Mathura. Ugrasena was ruling Mathura, but Kamsa imprisoned his own father because Kamsa was a demoniac natured person. Ugrasena was divine natured. So they are of opposite natures, so they don't get along. Demons don't get along with divine natured people and demons unnecessarily give trouble to divine natured people, unnecessarily. So by the grace of Lord Krishna and Lord Balaram, Kamsa was killed, and Ugrasena was re-installed on the throne. When Shalva attacked the city of Dwaraka, Ugrasena fought very valiantly and repulsed the enemy. Ugrasena was not a weak Kshatriya, he was a powerful Kshatriya. So Shalva was a very, very powerful king. So Ugrasena was able to resist Shalva's attack and fought very bravely. Ugrasena inquired from Narada about the divinity of Lord Krishna. See, even Ugrasena, he's a devotee, but still, one has to hear from proper spiritual authorities about the actual divine position of the Supreme Personality of God. So Ugrasena inquired from Narada about the divinity of Lord Krishna. So Narada is an authority.

**Key Quote:** "So Krishna decided to actually bring about an apparent quarrel between the members of the Yadu dynasty themselves, and they killed each other."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Krishna orchestrated the dissolution of the powerful Yadu dynasty through internal conflict.

When the Yadu dynasty was to be vanquished, Ugrasena was entrusted with the iron lump produced from the womb of Samba. This is a pastime, how the Yadu dynasty itself would actually be dissolved, because they were very, very powerful. They defeated everyone else, but how would they end their manifestation? So Krishna decided to actually bring about an apparent quarrel between the members of the Yadu dynasty themselves, and they killed each other. And that's the way they actually disappeared from the surface of this globe, from the earth.

### Balarama, Rohini, Vasudeva, Nanda Maharaj, plenary expansion, Vishnu Tattva

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Balarama is the plenary manifestation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the first expansion of Krishna in the spiritual world he is Krishna's own expansion but still they act as if they are two independent personalities that's the way they behave and act that's the nature of Godhead so he is as powerful as Lord Krishna this plenary manifestation he belongs to the Vishnu Tattva the principle of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker details Balarama's birth, his upbringing under Nanda Maharaj, and his position as the plenary expansion of Krishna, emphasizing his power and connection to the Vishnu Tattva.

Maharaj along with his mother Rohini when Vasudeva embraced imprisonment by mutual agreement with Kamsa, so Vasudeva had 16 Queens of which Rohini and Devaki were two of them, so Krishna appeared as the son of Devaki and Balarama appeared as the son of Rohini, but when Balarama appeared Rohini was under the protection of Nanda Maharaj, so Balarama grew up in Vrindavan along with Krishna as his son of Rohini, but Balarama was introduced to Nanda Maharaj as his father, the child when it is just born, so it is born from the womb of a particular mother, so since he appeared from the womb of Rohini, Rohini is his mother, then who is the father? Because father actually is Vasudeva, he is in imprisonment under Kamsa, so therefore he grew up under the care of Nanda Maharaj as his foster father as much as Krishna grew up under Nanda Maharaj as his foster father, same Balarama also. So this is Leela. Lord Krishna and Balarama were constant companions from their very childhood although they were stepbrothers, but actually Balarama is the plenary manifestation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the first expansion of Krishna in the spiritual world, he is Krishna's own expansion, but still they act as if they are two independent personalities, that's the way they behave and act, that's the nature of Godhead, so he is as powerful as Lord Krishna, this plenary manifestation, he belongs to the Vishnu Tattva.

### Balarama's pastimes, anger, forgiveness, spiritual strength, Adi Guru

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Now in the Vedas, Balarama is described as a supreme lord without whose favor one cannot realize the absolute truth."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts Balarama's pastimes, including his anger towards Arjuna and the Kauravas, his eventual forgiveness, and his role as the original spiritual master (Adi Guru) who bestows spiritual strength.

He attended the Swayamvara ceremony of Draupadi along with Krishna. When Subhadra was kidnapped by Arjuna by the organized plan of Krishna, Balde was very angry with Arjuna and wanted to kill him at once. But Krishna for the sake of his dear friend Arjuna, he fell at the feet of Balarama and implored him not to be so angry. So Balde was thus satisfied by Krishna pacifying him and Arjuna's life was spared. Once, Balarama was very angry with the Kauravas and he wanted to throw their whole city into the depths of the Yamuna. But the Kauravas realized their mistake in not agreeing to Balarama's proposition. So then they begged forgiveness and Balarama at once forgave them, and then he actually pardoned and he did not do so. So they were actually saved. The Kauravas were saved. Now in the Vedas, Balarama is described as a supreme lord without whose favor one cannot realize the absolute truth. Now, Bala means spiritual strength, not physical strength. So less intelligent people interpret this Bala as some physical strength, but Bala means spiritual strength. So no one can have spiritual realization without the mercy of Balarama. So therefore, Balarama is described as the original spiritual master, Adi Guru.

Next, the description of Pradyumna. He is an incarnation of Kamadeva. He was born as the son of the personality of Godhead, Krishna and Rukmini. Rukmini is the principal queen of Krishna. He was very angry with his charioteer. Why did you remove me from the battlefield? It's actually a quality of a Kshatriya. He never turns his back and retreats from a battle. Either he will win or he will lay down his life. That's the way a Kshatriya has to fight. So he went back to the battlefield and he was victorious over Shalva. He fought very bravely and is victorious. He is actually originally one of the four plenary expansions of Krishna was Vasudeva Sankarsana Pradyumna Aniruddha or one of the four expansions of Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by describing the Rajasuya Yagna performed by Yudhishthira to glorify Krishna and emphasizes the deep attachment and devotion of Krishna's associates.

He was present during the Rajasuya Yagna of Maharaja Yudhishthira. Yudhishthira, in order to glorify Krishna, he performed Rajasuya sacrifice in which Krishna was elected as the president of the Yadu dynasty. Krishna was the president of that big assembly of all great saintly persons, all sages, all Rajarshis, all Devatas. They were all present. Krishna was elected as the president. So Yudhishthira just did this to glorify Krishna. That's all. When all the Vrishnis were assembled during the time of Prabhasa Yagna, Samba's glorious activities were narrated by Satyaki before Lord Krishna. He was also present with his father Lord Sri Krishna during the Ashwamedha Yagna performed by Yudhishthira. So, Samba died in that fratricidal war between the members of the Yadu dynasty. So all these sons of Lord Krishna, they left their respective palaces and lived in the Yadu dynasty. They left their respective palaces and leaving aside all other engagements, whether lying down, sitting, dining, whatever. They hastily went towards their exalted father Krishna because they were very intimately attached to Krishna. That means all of the associates of Krishna are his intimate devotees, and they are very, very, very attached to Krishna. That is the special feature of devotion to Krishna. The attachment to Krishna is very, very, very strong. It's very, very powerful, because Krishna attracts everyone in that way. The name Krishna means all attractive. So he is attractive to everyone, particularly to his intimate devotees. He is very, very attractive. So I'll stop here. Thank you. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "the Vedic way of receiving great personality creates an atmosphere of respect which is saturated with affection and veneration for the person received."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the Vedic way of receiving a great personality, emphasizing the atmosphere of respect, affection, and veneration it creates.

In this session we will be discussing from the eighteenth and the nineteenth verses of the eleventh chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The eighteenth verse first. वारनेंद्रम् पुरस्कृत्या ब्रामनै ससुमंगलैही शंकत् तूर्य निनादेन ब्रह्मः घोषेन चाद्रताह प्रत्यु जग्मू रथैर खृष्टा प्रनयागत साध्वसाह. The meaning of this verse is the eighteenth verse: They hastened towards the Lord on chariots with brahmanas bearing flowers. Before them were elephants, emblems of good fortune. Conch shells and bugles were sounded and Vedic hymns were chanted. Thus they offered their respects which were saturated with affection. So, the previous two verses described how the family members of Krishna, the intimate family members, they rushed towards, hastened towards Krishna with great affection and they actually, it is described here, they were carrying flowers and they were on chariots and brahmanas were chanting Vedic hymns and conch shells and bugles were sounded and they offered their respects saturated with affection. So, Srila Prabhupada says the Vedic way of receiving great personality creates an atmosphere of respect which is saturated with affection and veneration

for the person received. So, this program of reception is full of sincerity on part of both the receiver and the received.

So, to offer respect and to receive respect because the devotee always offers respect to Krishna and Krishna always receives such respect

**Key Quote:** "we may not hate even the prostitutes if they are devotees of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of prostitutes being among those who received Krishna, and explains Prabhupada's perspective that even prostitutes can be devotees.

because Krishna is the most respectable personality. The 19th verse: Vaara Mukhyascha Shata Sho Yaanai Stad Darshanot Sukhaha Lasat Kundalan Nirbhata Vaara Mukhyascha Shata Sho Yanai Stad Darshanot Sukhaha Lasat Kundalan Nirbhata Kapola Vadana Shriyaha Kapola Vadana Shriyaha Kapola Vadana Shriyaha Kapola Vadana Shriyaha. The meaning of this 19th verse is: At the same time many hundreds of well-known prostitutes began to proceed on various vehicles. They were all very eager to meet the Lord and their beautiful faces were decorated with dazzling earrings which enhanced the beauty of their foreheads. This is very interesting. That among the many different persons who received Krishna when Krishna entered Dwaraka there were hundreds of well-known prostitutes. Now Srila Prabhupada explains this very nicely. How come prostitutes are there in Dwaraka and they are going to receive Krishna? Prostitutes are devotees. So here Prabhupada explains we may not hate even the prostitutes if they are devotees of the Lord. Even to date there are many prostitutes in great cities of India who are sincere devotees of the Lord. So you may wonder how can somebody be engaged in such a sinful activity as a prostitute and at the same time be a devotee of Krishna? The two don't go together, isn't it?

**Key Quote:** "devotional service to Lord Krishna is uncheckable in all circumstances."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotional service is an activity of the soul, and is separate from one's profession or external circumstances, meaning anyone can become a devotee.

So Prabhupada explains by tricks of chance one may be obliged to adopt a profession which is not very adorable in society but that does not hamper one in executing devotional service to the Lord. So devotional service to Lord Krishna is uncheckable in all circumstances. That means devotional service is an activity of the soul and a profession adopted for some maintenance in the material world is with respect to the body, external body. So external body may be that of one engaged in a profession as a Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaisa, Shudra but or even a prostitute as a profession but that does not prevent anyone from becoming a devotee of Krishna. So much so that Shastras say even a Chandala can be a devotee of Krishna. Chandala is an outcast, is an outcast fifth class person in the Varnashrama system. Chandala means the lowest of the four Varnas, lower than the fourth Varna also, lower than the Shudra. But even a Chandala can take to devotional service by the mercy of Lord Krishna or his pure devotee. So pure devotees preach Krishna consciousness to everyone. Irrespective of who the person is and by the blessings and mercy of a pure devotee anyone can become a devotee of Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "it is better that prostitutes be available in the market place so that the sanctity of society can be maintained."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Prabhupada's view that prostitutes are a necessary part of society, comparing it to the government allowing wine shops, but emphasizes that this doesn't mean it is encouraged.

So it is understood here which Srila Prabhupada further explains that even in those days about 5000 years ago there were prostitutes in a city like Dwaraka where Lord Krishna resided. So Srila Prabhupada explains this means that prostitutes are necessary citizens, citizens, they are also part of the society, city, they are necessary for a proper upkeep of society. What is the meaning of this? Prabhupada gives an example to help us understand. The government opens wine shops but this does not mean that the government encourages the drinking of wine. So why should government open wine shops? The idea is that there is a class of men who will drink at any cost and it has been experienced that prohibition in great cities encourage illicit smuggling of wine. Similarly men who are not satisfied at home require such concessions and if there is no prostitute then such low class men will induce others into prostitution. So therefore Srila Prabhupada says it is better that prostitutes be available in the market place so that the sanctity of society can be maintained. The chaste women are never disturbed or bothered by these low class men who are not satisfied at home with their properly wedded wife. It is better to maintain a class of prostitutes than to encourage prostitutes within society.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the real reformation is to encourage everyone to become devotees of Krishna, which will purify them of sinful habits and tendencies.

The real reformation now here is the very most important point in this entire purport. Prabhupada says the real reformation that is required is to enlighten all people to become devotees of the Lord and that will check all kinds of deteriorating factors of life. If somebody is having some sinful habit how can they become free from this sinful habit? Not simply by abstinence but by taking to devotional service. By taking to devotional service any sinful person can become completely purified of the sinful tendencies, sinful habit and can become a first class purified devotee of Krishna. Why? Because originally every one of us is a devotee of Krishna only. That's our original position. But in contact with material nature under a misunderstanding that I am this body or I belong to this material world or I want to enjoy materially I am awarded a material body in contact with material nature. And that's how I develop material desires and those material desires lead to so many sinful activities when somebody does not endeavor to satisfy the material desires by dharma, by laws of dharma. So violating the laws of dharma is sin, is papa.

**Key Quote:** "your attraction for the flesh and bone of an insignificant woman would be properly utilized if this same attraction could be diverted to the devotional service of the Supreme Lord Krishna"
**Summary:** The speaker shares the story of Bilvamangal Thakur, who was overly attached to a prostitute named Chintamani, who then instructed him to divert his attraction to Krishna, leading him to become a great devotee.

So even those who are sinful can be reformed, can be rectified by their taking to devotional service. Now Srila Prabhupada gives a very nice example of another great Acharya, Srila Bilvamangal Thakur, a great Acharya of the Vishnu Swami Vaishnava sect in his householder life was overly attached to a prostitute who happened to be a devotee of the Lord. Bilvamangal Thakur in his household life he was attached to a prostitute who was a devotee. One night when this Bilvamangal Thakur in his Purvashram before he became a devotee himself, Acharya, in his householder life he came to the house of this prostitute Chintamani one night when there were torrents of rain and there was a thunderstorm. So Chintamani was astonished to see how this Bilvamangal came on such a dreadful night after crossing a foaming river full of waves at the risk of his life he came so she said to Bilvamangal that your attraction for the flesh and bone of an insignificant woman would be properly utilized if this same attraction could be diverted to the devotional service of the Supreme Lord Krishna to achieve attraction for the transcendental beauty of Lord Krishna. This was a momentous hour for Bilvamangal and he took a turn towards spiritual realization by the words of a prostitute. Later on Bilvamangal Thakur accepted the prostitute as his spiritual master and in several places of his literary works he has glorified the Lord Krishna in the form of the name of Chintamani who showed him the right path. You see? So, this is an instance of a prostitute who is a devotee instructing somebody to become a devotee of Krishna acting as the guide.

**Key Quote:** "even the low-born chandalas and those who are born in family of unbelievers and even the prostitutes shall attain perfection of life if they take shelter of unalloyed devotional service to me."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes the Bhagavad Gita to emphasize that even those of low birth or occupation can attain perfection through devotional service to Krishna, and that the path is open to everyone under proper guidance.

So, therefore, Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita in the ninth chapter thirty-second verse even the low-born chandalas and those who are born in family of unbelievers and even the prostitutes shall attain perfection of life if they take shelter of unalloyed devotional service to me. That means Krishna is telling Arjuna if they take shelter of unalloyed devotional service to Krishna because in the path of devotional service there are no impediments due to degraded birth and degraded occupation. The path is open for everyone who agrees to follow this path under proper guidance. So, therefore, it is described here the prostitutes of Dwarka they were all unalloyed devotees of Krishna. They were very eager to meet Krishna as much as all the other devotees were eager and they were already on the path of liberation as described in the Bhagavad Gita. So, therefore, the only reformation in society that is necessary is to make organized effort to turn everyone to become a devotee of Krishna and in this way there will be no anomalies in society.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the importance of arts, culture, and social structure in ancient Dwaraka, emphasizing a Krishna-centered culture where all activities revolve around the Lord and His devotees.

So among the citizens there were these expert dramatists, artists, singers, historians, all of them. So Prabhupada explains in the purport, it appears that 5000 years ago the society also needed the services of dramatists, artists, dancers, singers, historians, genealogists, public speakers, etc. Dances, singers and dramatic artists of Dwaraka mostly hailed from the base at the state complaints of Suthra community, whereas the learned historians and public speakers hailed from the brahmana community that they belonged to a particular caste and were so trained among their families.

**Summary:** This segment addresses the nature of the Puranas as historical narratives, refuting modern historians' dismissal of them as mythology and highlighting the significance of superhuman activities in these texts.

that's the way the whole society becomes spiritualized now Srila Prabhupada explains very importantly we should understand that these descriptions of the Lord's superhuman activities in different ages and millenniums were not necessarily arranged in chronological order all the Puranas are historical facts described only in relation with the Supreme Lord in different ages and times as well as on different planets also we do not find any chronological order in these descriptions in the Puranas the modern historians therefore cannot catch up the link and thus they unauthoritatively remark that the Puranas are all imaginary stories only you see just because it is not chronologically arranged or because it is describing events of the Supreme Lord which are extraordinary beyond conception of the human being of the modern day so they say all these stories in the Puranas are all fiction imaginary stories that's what they dismiss they have coined a term called mythology mythology means it is derived from the word myth myth means something which is not a fact it is not true but the truth is that all the stories in the Puranas are factual historical narrations so Prabhupada says further in the Puranas even 100 years ago in India all dramatic performances was centered around the superhuman activities of the Supreme Lord I remember when I was a primary school student one of the famous cinemas was the Sampoorna Ramayan and all of you are aware that Sampoorna Ramayan at the time also head fiquei And all of you are aware that on the TV serial there was this Mahabharata, it was very nicely

**Summary:** The speaker discusses how traditional performances centered around Krishna's activities served as a means of imparting Vedic knowledge to the common people, even those without formal education.

produced by famous TV program producers and it was a very popular and super hit program. So about 100 years back there used to be only performances whether it is drama or dance or any art form including cinema and theater simply centered around the super human activities of the Supreme Lord Krishna. The common people would be very entertained by the performance of dramas and yatra parties who played wonderfully on the super human activities of the Lord. And thus even the illiterate agriculturist would be a participant in knowledge of Vedic literature despite a considerable lack of academic qualifications. So many people in the villages they will be engaged in some simple occupation like potters, carpenters. The labourers in the agricultural field, they don't go to a Guru Kho to study the Vedas formally. But that does not mean they are ignorant about the Vedic knowledge. They are educated by simply participating in hearing the wonderful descriptions of Krishna's pastimes by these dramaturgs, by the historians, by the reciters of the Puranas, by the singers. In this way, they also become enlightened in Vedic knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "Expert players in drama, dance, singing and speaking are required for the spiritual enlightenment of the common man."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of Puranas as part of Vedic literature and highlights the role of drama, dance, and singing in achieving spiritual enlightenment for the common person.

Therefore, among Vaishnavas, the Puranas are counted among the Vedic literature, because the Puranas are just describing everything in connection with Krishna. So, Puranas are not outside the scope of the Vedas. The Mayavadis, they reject the Puranas as not belonging to the original Vedas. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport here, Therefore, expert players in drama, dance, singing and speaking are required for the spiritual enlightenment of the common man. For the enlightenment of the common man, there is no need to endeavor to give them formal education. Simply by performing drama or having a dance performance centered around the wonderful pastimes of Lord Krishna and his incarnations and his pure devotees activities, the common people get enlightened in this spiritual subject matter.

**Key Quote:** "The narrations of Krishna's pastimes are extraordinary activities which will interest any person."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts mundane entertainment with Krishna-centered performances, emphasizing the latter's ability to spiritualize society and the inherent attractiveness of Krishna's pastimes.

So, this is the way of spiritualizing society. Instead of having some dance performance which is not connected with Krishna consciousness, which may entertain people, but it doesn't help to spiritualize people's consciousness. So, nowadays the cinema and even the dance performances, ball dance and rock and roll dance and all kinds of music and cinema and all that, centered around some mundane subject matter or mundane fiction, novel. That's all actually not at all spiritually beneficial. Neither is it able to educate the common people. So, whereas the performance of drama, dance and the narration of the historical narrations centered around the superhuman activities of Krishna, or his incarnations or his pure devotees, that will enlighten the common people and simultaneously it will be entertaining for them also. Because the narrations of Krishna's pastimes are extraordinary activities which will interest any person. There is so much of heroic deeds performed by Krishna in displaying his pastimes when he appears in this world.

### Krishna's heroic deeds, Actual fights vs. staged fights, Krishna's mercy, Purification through hearing Krishna's activities

**Key Quote:** "Simply by hearing such activities, anyone can become spiritualized in their consciousness."
**Summary:** This segment focuses on Krishna's heroic deeds and actual fights against demons, contrasting them with staged performances and highlighting the purifying effect of hearing about Krishna's activities.

And these are factual. Krishna comes to subdue the asuras when the asuras give unnecessary trouble to Krishna's devotees. So, Krishna actually engages in such a fight against the asuras. But the descriptions in the Puranas about Krishna's superhuman activities are very, very attractive. Instead of watching some cinema where some so-called hero engages in some so-called fighting with some villain, which is not really true because the hero doesn't have the strength to fight against the villain. It is simply a show of fighting. Whereas when the Supreme Lord comes to this material world, incarnates in this material world, he actually subdues these asuras who become powerful and harass the ordinary citizens. So, it is an actual fight. It is not a show, merely a show. Krishna fighting against Kamsa or Krishna fighting against the different demons. Bakasura and Gurdabhasura. All these demons who appeared. Vatsasura. Krishna actually killed them. And of course, Krishna's killing is also beneficial for these asuras because they are purified and they are delivered from suffering in hell. They are delivered. Because they go on committing sinful activities. So, it is Krishna's mercy. So, these descriptions, the wonderful activities of Krishna described in the Puranas, are worth hearing because simply by hearing such activities, anyone can become spiritualized in their consciousness. They can become purified. They can become enlightened. Spiritually enlightened.

**Key Quote:** "Material education is useless as regards ultimate liberation."
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by emphasizing the uselessness of material education for spiritual liberation and advocating for the encouragement of Krishna-centered performances in society for the benefit of all.

And that's the only thing that's required for a human being to achieve all perfection. In fact, material education is useless. As regards ultimate liberation, it may be helpful for the sake of earning a livelihood. May be helpful. But as far as spiritual enlightenment is concerned, material subject matter is useless. Studying material subject matter is useless. So, therefore, such performances by the dramatists, by the singers, which is centered around Krishna's superhuman activities, are spiritually beneficial for everyone. All class of people. And therefore, such things should be encouraged in society. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

### Reciprocation, Pure Devotion, Impersonalism

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "He satisfies everyone in terms of one's development of spiritual consciousness."
**Summary:** The lecture begins by explaining how Lord Krishna reciprocates with different types of devotees and admirers, contrasting this with the impersonalists' view of the Absolute Truth.

In this session we will be discussing from the 21st and the 22nd verses of the 11th chapter of 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Bhagavam Stratra Bandhunam Pauranam Anuvartinam Yathavidhi Upasangamya Sarvesham Manam Adadhe. The meaning of this 25th chapter: Lord Krishna, the personality of Godhead, approached them and offered due honor and respect to each and every one of the friends, relatives, citizens, and all others who came to receive and welcome him. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "The Supreme Lord, personality of Godhead, is neither impure nor pure. He is neither impersonal nor an inert object unable to reciprocate the feelings of his devotees. Here the word Yathavidhi, or just as it behooves, is significant. He reciprocates just as it behooves with his different types of admirers and devotees. Of course the pure devotees are of one type only, because they have no other object for service but the Lord. And therefore the Lord also reciprocates with such pure devotees just as it behooves. Namely, he is always attentive to all the matters of his pure devotees. There are others who designate him as impersonal. And so, the Lord also does not take any personal interest. He satisfies everyone in terms of one's development of spiritual consciousness. And a sample of such reciprocation is exhibited here with his different welcomers."

**Key Quote:** "So when he is the absolute controller, how can that energy which he absolutely controls put him in illusion? That's never possible."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the nature of the Absolute Truth as the Supreme Person with transcendental qualities, contrasting this with the impersonalists' misunderstanding of Krishna's incarnations and emphasizing that the Lord is always liberated.

So, for this explanation we should have the background understanding that the Absolute Truth is ultimately realized as the personality of Godhead, the Supreme Person. And he is having transcendental form, transcendental qualities, transcendental feelings, transcendental activities. Whereas the impersonalists, they refuse to even consider the scriptural description of the Absolute Truth as the Supreme Person. They also wrongly think that when the Supreme Lord incarnates in this world, they think that his form is material, his feelings are material, his personality is material, his personal qualities are all material qualities. And they make the mistake of considering him to be one of the conditioned souls. Whereas the fact is that the Lord is always liberated because it is his energy which conditions everyone else in this material world. So when he is the absolute controller, how can that energy which he absolutely controls put him in illusion? That's never possible. So therefore Srila Prabhupada says that he is neither impersonal nor an inert object unable to reciprocate feelings. And of course his devotees are situated in a proper relationship with him, person to person relationship. And he accommodates all varieties of relationships. He is unlimited personality. He can and he does accommodate all devotees' relationships. Because he is unlimited, he has unlimited devotees. He has unlimited relationships. That's his nature of his personality.

**Key Quote:** "Nobody was ignored, nobody was considered too insignificant for the Lord to give his attention."
**Summary:** The lecture moves to the 22nd verse, explaining how Krishna greeted everyone present, regardless of their social standing, highlighting his unlimited power and personal reciprocation with each devotee.

And in the next verse, the 22nd verse: prahvabhi vadanashklesha karasparsya smitekshanaihi asvasya ca asvapakebhyo varais caabhi matair vibhuhu. How did Krishna reciprocate with the different people? That's being explained in this verse. The meaning of this 22nd verse: The Almighty Lord greeted everyone present by bowing his head, exchanging greetings, embracing, shaking hands, looking and smiling, giving assurances and awarding benedictions even to the lowest in rank, asvapakebhyo. In the Purport Shri Laha Prabhupada explains, "To receive the Lord Shri Krishna, there were all grades of population, beginning from Vasudeva, Ugrasena, and Gargamuni, all elders. The father, Vasudeva is the father, Ugrasena is the grandfather, Gargamuni is the teacher, the acharya. Down to the prostitutes and chandalas, already been described in the previous verse, even prostitutes came to receive the Lord, because they are also his devotees. Chandalas, they are accustomed to eat dogs, such chandalas also came to receive the Lord, because they are also his devotees. And every one of them was properly greeted by the Lord in terms of rank and position. Exactly according to their position, the Lord greeted them. Nobody was ignored, nobody was considered too insignificant for the Lord to give his attention."

**Key Quote:** "So that is not the position of Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He has unlimited power, he is an unlimited personality."
**Summary:** This segment contrasts Krishna's unlimited capacity to reciprocate with everyone to the limited capacity of worldly people, emphasizing that all living entities are eternally related to Krishna as His parts and parcels.

Such a consideration may be there for a person of this world who is limited, let's say a big man in our usual dealings in this world. He may be having so many people with whom he may have to interact. But if there are many people with whom he has to interact, he will give his attention only to the top people, the most intimate people, or the important people. He will not give attention, he cannot give attention to everyone. So that is not the position of Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He has unlimited power, he is an unlimited personality. So he expands and he reciprocates with each and every one of his devotees personally, but it is exactly according to their specific relationship. So Srila Prabhupada explains here the truth about all the living entities. As pure living entities, all are the separated parts and parcels of the Lord. Every living being, countless living beings, everyone is part and parcel of Krishna. mamayivamsho jivaloke jivabhuta-sanatana. Eternally related, eternally connected. And thus, no one is alien by his eternal relation. No one is alien, no one is unknown, no one is new to the Supreme Lord.

### Material Contamination, Affection, Recall

**Key Quote:** "But the Lord is equally affectionate to all his parts and parcels despite material gradation."
**Summary:** The lecture explains why there are gradations among living entities despite being part and parcel of Krishna, attributing it to different levels of material contamination, and emphasizes Krishna's equal affection for all, highlighting His descent to recall them back to His kingdom.

Such pure living entities are graded differently. Why this gradation if all are pure living entities, all are part and parcel of Krishna? Why the gradation? Because they are graded differently because they have different contamination of the modes of material nature. Different degrees of contamination, different combinations of the contamination of sattva guna, rajya guna, tamo guna, according to their previous association with the material nature itself. But the Lord is equally affectionate to all his parts and parcels despite material gradation. According to contamination, there are grades of people in this world. But the Lord is equally affectionate to everyone. That's the truth about the relationship of each one of us with the Supreme Lord. He descends only to recall these materialistic living beings back to his kingdom. Why does he come? He comes to recall, "Come back to me. Please come to me. You are mine. You are my part and parcel. You belong to me." He says this in the Bhagavad Gita: sarva bhutani asheshani drakshasi atmani ato mayi. They are all in me. They belong to me. They are mine. Very, very clearly Krishna says this in the Bhagavad Gita in the fourth chapter, thirty-fifth verse. So, Prabhupada says further, "Intelligent persons take advantage of this facility offered by the Personality of Godhead to all living beings." When he comes to recall, intelligent persons will accept this call of the Lord and they will follow the Lord's directions, how they can be reinstated in their original position in the spiritual kingdom of God. So, Srila Prabhupada further says, "No one is rejected by the Lord from the kingdom of God and it remains with the living being to accept this or not."

**Key Quote:** "Living being has free will and the Lord never forces himself upon anyone that you must come now."
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by emphasizing the free will of the living being to accept or reject Krishna's invitation to return to Krishnaloka, reminding the audience of the miseries of material existence and encouraging them to prepare themselves to return to the spiritual kingdom.

You should always remember we have a tiny amount of free will and that's a characteristic of living being. Living being has free will and the Lord never forces himself upon anyone that you must come now. If you don't want to go to Krishnaloka, you can remain here. But remember that this is not your proper situation. This place is filled with miseries and you have to suffer miseries due to your material existence. So, put an end to these miseries, prepare yourself and go to Krishnaloka as Krishna invites and Krishna directs and Krishna instructs in the Bhagavad Gita and the Bhagavata. So, I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

### Vedic culture, role of Brahmanas, glorification of the Lord
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/cdbXzRnv51g?t=53
**Verse References:** SB 1.11.23
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "It is the glorifiers, the brahmanas, who become themselves glorified by glorifying Krishna."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the Vedic culture where Brahmanas offer free service and glorify the king, and how glorifying Krishna benefits the glorifier.

In this session, we will be discussing the 23rd and 24th verses of the 11th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. 23rd verse: स्वयं च गुरुभिर विप्रै सदारै स्थविरैर अपी आशिर्भिर युज्यमानोन्यैर वन्दिभिष्चाविषत्पुरं. The meaning of this 23rd verse: Then the Lord personally entered the city accompanied by elderly relatives and invalid brahmanas with their wives, all offering benedictions and singing the glories of the Lord. Others also praised the glories of the Lord. So, Srila Prabhupada comments on this particular verse in the purport as follows: "The brahmanas in society were never attentive to banking money for future retired life. This is the Vedic culture. The brahmanas always offer free service and even if they get excess of some charity, they spend it off in devotional service. They don't keep money for future. When they were old invalids, they used to approach the assembly of the kings and simply by praising the glorious deeds performed by the kings along with their wives, they would be provided with all necessities of life. What a wonderful society. When they require, they just go and ask the king, and the king will provide. Such brahmanas were not, so to speak, flatterers of the kings, but the kings were actually glorified by their actions." See, they are not doing this just to get some benefit. They are factually glorifying the king for his factual glorious qualities. And here, they are glorifying the supreme king of all kings, the supreme lord, Krishna, who is full of all wonderful qualities. So, the kings, Srila Prabhupada says, were sincerely still more encouraged in pious acts by such brahmanas in a dignified way. The brahmanas would glorify the kings for their good qualities. The kings would also feel encouraged. They would also feel enthused, inspired to do more of such pious activities. In a dignified way, the brahmanas would glorify the king. Lord Sri Krishna is worthy of all glories, and the praying brahmanas and others would glorify themselves by chanting the glories of the lord. In the case of glorification of Krishna, it is not Krishna who is actually in need of the glorification.

### Archa-vigraha, Deity worship, Transcendental form of the Lord

**Key Quote:** "The transcendental form of the lord installed in a temple is not different from the lord personally."
**Summary:** This segment explains the significance of the Archa-vigraha, the deity form of the Lord, and how it is not different from the Lord himself, being expanded by His internal potency.

The 24th verse: Rāja mārgaṁ gate kṛṣṇae dvārakāyā kulaś triyaḥ harmyāṇi āruruhur vipraḥ tad īkṣana mahotsavāḥ. The meaning of this 24th verse: When Lord Krishna passed over the public roads, all the ladies from the respectable families of Dvārakā, kulaś triyaḥ, went up to the roofs of their palaces just to have a look at the lord. They considered this to be the greatest festival. So Śrīla Prabhupāda elaborately explains this in the purport: "To have a look at the lord is a great festive occasion, undoubtedly, as it was considered by the metropolitan ladies of Dvārakā. This is still followed by the devout ladies of India. Especially during the days of the jhūlan and janmashtami ceremonies, the ladies of India still throng up, in the greatest number, at the temple of the lord, where his transcendental eternal form is worshipped. The transcendental form of the lord installed in a temple is not different from the lord personally. Such a form of the lord is called archa-vigraha, or archa-incarnation, and is expanded by the lord by his internal potency, just to facilitate the devotional service of his innumerable devotees who are in the material world. The material senses cannot perceive the spiritual nature of the lord, and therefore the lord accepts the archa-vigraha, which is apparently made of material elements like earth, wood and stone, but actually there is no material contamination."

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Even though he appears in a material statue, actually he is not contaminated by matter."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the concept that although the Archa-vigraha appears to be made of material elements, it is completely spiritual and not contaminated by matter because the Lord is transcendental.

So, Śrīla Prabhupāda is comparing that when Kṛṣṇa incarnated, He was received by the ladies of Dvārakā by them going on top of the roofs, and just having the darshan of the lord was like a festival for their eyes, because the lord is very, very, very, very beautiful. And the same facility is available even now in the form of the lord being worshipped in the temple, where he is beautifully decorated, ornamented, and cared for by his devotees. So, this archa-incarnation, worshipable deity form, is not different from the lord personally. It is not an imaginary form, it is not a dead statue. It is actually expanded by the lord's spiritual potency, and it facilitates the devotional service of the devotees. Further, Śrīla Prabhupāda explains, the material senses cannot perceive the spiritual nature of the lord. Therefore, the lord accepts the archa-vigraha, which is apparently made of material elements like earth, wood and stone. See, the archa-incarnation is made of material elements, but that doesn't mean it is a material statue. No. Why? Because the lord is Kaivalya, one alone. There is no matter in him. He is one without a second, and therefore, the almighty lord can appear in any form without being contaminated by the material conception. So when the lord appears in the archa form, he is appearing in his transcendental forms, completely spiritual form. Even though he appears in a material statue, actually he is not contaminated by matter. He is completely spiritual, and his appearance is also completely transcendental. This is difficult to understand for ordinary people, but this is being explained by the āchārya. This is explained in the scriptures.

### Spiritual transformation, Deity worship, Festivals

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "There is a spiritual transformation of their consciousness."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the spiritual benefits of having darshan of the Archa-incarnation, leading to a transformation of the heart and consciousness, and compares temple festivals to the festive atmosphere during the Lord's incarnation in Dvārakā.

And it is a fact that those devotees who have darshan of the archa-incarnation of the lord are deriving spiritual benefit simply by having darshan. Their heart becomes cleansed. There is a transformation of their heart. There is a transformation of their consciousness. There is a spiritual transformation of their consciousness. So that is proof that they are not having darshan of a material form. This has to be very carefully understood. If the form were material, there would have been no spiritual transformation by seeing a material form. Whereas, the proof that devotees have darshan of the archa-incarnation resulting in spiritual transformation of the heart means that the form they are seeing is completely spiritual, and therefore, the transformation is taking place. So, Śrīla Prabhupāda further explains, festivities in the temple of the lord as held generally are like festivals performed during the manifestive days of the lord of Dvārakā, about 5000 years ago. So, when the lord would enter Dvārakā, it was a festival for all the inhabitants of Dvārakā. The lord has appeared, the lord has come back, returned to the city. Same way, the lord's appearance is celebrated as Janmashtami festival or Julan festival on certain occasions like the spring festival, the autumn festival. All these are actually the same type of festive atmosphere which was actually present 5000 years back.

### Acharyas, Deity installation, Deity vs Idol, Materialistic people

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Deity is the factual presence of the lord in his transcendental form. Idol is an imaginary form, a material form, which is imagined to be something like God."
**Summary:** This segment explains that only authorized Acharyas can install deities, inviting the Lord to reside in the Archa-vigraha, and distinguishes between a deity (factual presence of the Lord) and an idol (imaginary form).

The authorized āchāryas who know the science perfectly install such temples of the lord under regulated principles just to offer facilities to the common man. The āchāryas are installing the deities. Ordinary people cannot install deities on their own. It's only the āchāryas who invite the lord to come and reside in the archa-vigraha and accept the worship of the devotees. Because the lord is intimately connected, related with the āchārya, so the āchārya can invite and the lord does accept the invitation of the āchārya to facilitate common people. For the common people's spiritual benefit, the lord accepts the invitation of the āchārya and comes and resides in the archa-form, the archa-incarnation. There are persons who are less intelligent, who, without being conversant with the signs of devotional service, mistake this great attempt to be idol worship. There are materialistic people, impersonalists, and all kinds of demons who call this worship of the deity as idol worship. So Prabhupāda makes a clear distinction between deity and idol. Deity is the factual presence of the lord in his transcendental form. Idol is an imaginary form, a material form, which is imagined to be something like God. So idol is different, deity is different. So these materialistic people, the demons, the impersonalists, they think that devotees are worshipping an idol. They poke their nose into that to which they have no access. The impersonalists, the materialists, the demons,

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that only devotees can understand and access the transcendental reality of the Lord, benefiting spiritually from deity worship, which results in heart transformation.

have no access to the transcendental reality of the Supreme Lord because they deny, they criticize. So therefore, they have no access. So only devotees can understand this. Devotees can access. Devotees can worship. Devotees can benefit spiritually by such worship, by such darshan. And the benefit, the result is seen in the heart transformation. In second canto, second chapter, there is a description that devotional service, transformation of the heart, change of heart. So that is the proof of that form of the Lord being completely transcendent. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Satiation means upon repeatedly doing something one becomes completely satisfied so that there is no more possibility of being further, taking further satisfaction"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains the concept of satiation, contrasting it with the unending attraction to the Lord's beauty.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 25th verse of the 11th chapter of the 1st canto of Shri Madbhagavatam: Nithyam Nireeksha Mananam Yadapi Dvarakaukasam Na Vitrupyantihi Drushaha Shriyo Dhamangam Achyutam. The meaning of this verse is, "The inhabitants of Dvaraka were regularly accustomed to look upon the results of the Dvaraka Reservoir of all beauty, the infallible Lord. Yet they were never satiated, Na Vitrupyantihi. They were never satiated." What is the meaning of satiation? Satiation means upon repeatedly doing something, one becomes completely satisfied so that there is no more possibility of being further, taking further satisfaction. One becomes saturated, that's the word in English. Satiation has got another word, saturation.

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "There is a certain point of saturation or satiation where no more they can eat and relish that sweet"
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of adding salt to water and eating sweets to illustrate the concept of satiation in the material world.

Just like if you take a glass of water and you keep adding salt, then this salt becomes dissolved. But if you keep adding more and more salt, a certain point of saturation comes where no more salt will dissolve in that water, in the saline solution, in the salt solution. No more it will dissolve because it is saturated. Similarly, when somebody, let us say, eats a piece of sweet, then they may take a small piece and they taste it, oh it's very nice. Let me have a little more. So they have one more piece of the sweet and then they feel even more satisfied. Then one more piece, one more piece. How many pieces can they keep eating? There is a certain point of saturation or satiation where no more they can eat and relish that sweet. In fact, it becomes nausea. That means they feel like no more even looking at that sweet. So that is the point of saturation.

**Key Quote:** "Anything material seen for a number of times ultimately becomes unattractive by the law of satiation"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that unlike material beauty, the beauty of the Lord never leads to satiation, as experienced by the residents of Dwarka.

The inhabitants of Dwarka, even though they are accustomed to seeing the most beautiful form of the Lord, they never felt saturated. They never thought we have seen enough. They never felt like that. So it is explained by Prabhupada in the purport, "When the ladies of the city of Dwarka got up on the roofs of their palaces, they never thought that they had previously many times seen the beautiful body of the infallible Lord." They never thought like that, "We have seen it enough number of times," though they had actually seen many many many times before. This indicates that they had no satiation in desiring to see the Lord. Anything material seen for a number of times ultimately becomes unattractive by the law of satiation. We have experience in this material world. If we repeatedly see something beautiful, we become saturated, we become satiated. We cannot see it anymore. It is no longer attractive. It becomes unattractive after saturation, point of saturation. That is true for all material beauty. The law of satiation acts materially.

**Key Quote:** "In the case of spiritual beauty, there is no satiation. There is no saturation. Never."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the Lord's infallibility and contrasts it with the fallible nature of living entities who become covered by material bodies and lose their spiritual identity.

In the case of spiritual beauty, there is no satiation. There is no saturation, never. The word infallible is significant here because although the Lord has mercifully descended on earth, He is still infallible. Infallible means He never falls down to the material platform. We, on the other hand, we fall down to the material platform when we come to the material world. When we come in contact with the gunas, material nature, we become conditioned. We fall down to the material platform. From the spiritual platform, we fall down to the material platform. So Prabhupada says, "The Lord does not become fallen, whereas the living entities are fallible." Fallible means they are prone to fall down because when they come in contact with the material world, they lack their spiritual identity. What happens to our spiritual identity? We are all spirit souls. What happens to it? It becomes covered by the material body. And thus, the body materially obtained becomes subjected to birth, growth, transformation, situation, deterioration, annihilation under the laws of nature. Our spiritual beauty is covered.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord's body is not like that. He descends as he is and is never under the laws of material modes"
**Summary:** The speaker describes the deterioration of the material body with age and disease, contrasting it with the eternal and uncontaminated nature of the Lord's spiritual form.

And the material form, however nice it may look when one is young, as the body ages or as the body changes, as the body becomes diseased or old or invalid or wrinkled, then the body is no longer beautiful. The body is no longer beautiful. When a person becomes dirty due to sweating, then until the person takes a good bath, will not appear beautiful, will not appear fresh, you see. The Lord's body is not like that. He descends as He is and is never under the laws of material modes. Spiritual form never deteriorates, never becomes dirty. There is no possibility of material contamination. And in the case of the Lord, there is no possibility of material covering. This material covering applies only to living entities.

**Key Quote:** "This material covering applies only to living entities who are desirous of material enjoyment"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the material covering applies only to those who desire material enjoyment, and that the Lord's body is the source of all beauty and everything that exists.

Who are desirous of material enjoyment, who are desirous of materially lording over material nature. Only to such living entities the spiritual form gets covered by a material covering and that material covering is strictly according to the material laws, subject to deterioration. It cannot remain the same. It never remains the same. Anything material has to deteriorate with time, with color. The Supreme Lord's body is the source of everything that be. Aham sarvasya prabhavo, Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, "I am the source of everything, Janmadyasya yatha." The Supreme Lord is the ultimate source of everything. In the Vedanta Sutra also, it is explained. Bhagavad Gita also explains this. Bhagavatam also explains this. The opening verse of the Bhagavatam says, Janmadyasya yatha Anvayati tarthas Krishna Vasudeva. The son of Vasudeva, the divine son of Vasudeva and Devaki, is actually the ultimate source of everything. So the Supreme Lord's form or body is the source of everything that be. It is the reservoir of all beauties.

**Key Quote:** "If at all we have spiritual eyes to see, then we cannot say we have seen enough. Never."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the limitations of material vision and the ever-fresh nature of the Lord's transcendental form, emphasizing that the Lord's name, form, qualities, and entourage are all spiritual manifestations.

We cannot have sufficient experience of seeing the Lord's transcendental form. If at all we have spiritual eyes to see, then we cannot say we have seen enough, never. No one therefore is satiated by seeing the transcendental body of the Lord because they are, there are always manifestations of newer and newer beauties. This is the nature of the Lord's form, ever fresh. In the Brahma Samhita, nava yauva namcha, ever fresh youthful beauty is the nature of the Lord's transcendental form. So the Lord's transcendental form is the nature of the Lord's transcendental form. So never compare the Lord's form with any material form. Never consider the Lord's form to be material. It may appear like a material form, but it is not a material form. So therefore Srila Prabhupada concludes this purport by telling that transcendental name, form, qualities, entourage, etc., are all spiritual manifestations. When the Lord descends to this material world, incarnates, He incarnates in His transcendental form with transcendental name, transcendental qualities, His spiritual entourage, His associates were all completely spiritual beings.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the importance of chanting the Hare Krishna mantra and emphasizes that there is no satiation in chanting the Lord's holy name because it is full of nectar.

In spiritual form, but they look like ordinary people, but they are not ordinary people. They are all spiritual manifestations of the Lord. In this material world, there is no satiation in chanting the holy name of the Lord. We keep chanting Hare Krishna Mantra everyday because it is a spiritual sound vibration. There is no satiation in chanting the holy name of the Lord. We are not yet bored chanting the same mantra, Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. Everyday we chant minimum of 1728 times this mantra, 16 rounds. And liberated souls, pure devotees like Haridasa Thakur, they chant 1 lakh names of the Lord everyday, 3 lakh names, about 22 hours in a cycle of 24 hours they chant. Why? Because it is full of nectar, namamrutam. It is full of nectar and unlimited supply of nectar is there when one keeps chanting, chanting, chanting, chanting. Of course, the chanting has to be done purely to taste that nectar of the holy name, namamrutam.

It is there. It is there in the holy name, in the transcendental vibration. There is no satiation in discussing the qualities of the Lord.

This is described in the Atmarama verse of the Srimad Bhagavatam, 1st canto, 7th chapter, Atmarama verse: Atmarama Shchamunayo Nirgrantha Api Urukrame Kurvanti Ahitukim Bhaktim Itthambhuta Gunoharihi. Itthambhuta means it is full of attractive qualities, attracts everybody. So devotees who discuss these wonderful qualities of the Lord, they are never tired. Machchitta Madgata Parasparam Katayan Taschamam Nithyam. They are always discussing about the wonderful qualities of the Lord and they derive great satisfaction and happiness, Tushyanticha Ramanticha.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces and recites verse 26 from the 11th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on the description of the Lord's chest, face, arms, and lotus feet.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudhirayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 26th verse of the 11th chapter of the 1st canto of Shri Madbhagavatam: Shriyo Nivaso Yasyo Raha Paanapatram Mukham Drisham Bahavo Lokapalanam Saranganaam Padambujam. So here is a description of the Lord's beautiful form. The translation of this 26th verse: The Lord's chest is the abode of the goddess of fortune. His moon-like face is the drinking vessel of the moon for eyes which hanker after all that is beautiful. His arms are the resting places for the administrative demigods, and his lotus feet are the refuge of pure devotees who never talk or sing of any subject except his lordship. So systematically the description is being given of the chest of the Lord, the moon-like face, his arms, and his lotus feet: Yasya Uraha, then Mukham, then Bahavaha, and Padaambujam.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the meaning of the verse, explaining that the Lord's chest is the abode of the goddess of fortune, his face is the object of beauty for the eyes, his arms provide shelter to the demigods, and his lotus feet are the refuge of pure devotees.

So all the four are described very, very nicely in this verse. So the chest is the abode of the goddess of fortune, the goddess of fortune, Nivasa Sriaha Nivasa. So the moon-like face is the drinking vessel for eyes which hanker after all that is beautiful. Our eyes are always searching, seeking something beautiful to look at, but which is the most beautiful object of vision for our eyes? It is the eyes of the Lord. It is the Lord's form, and particularly the Lord's face. And his arms are the resting places for the administrative demigods. So Prabhupada explains in the purport what this means. The Lord gives all protection to the demigods who are engaged in administration of this universe by the Lord's protection to the demigods, by actually giving protection through killing the demons, either directly himself or through his agents, through his empowered devotees. He kills the demons and he protects the devotees, the demigods. Then his lotus feet are the refuge of pure devotees.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the pure devotees' devotion to the Lord's lotus feet and references the Brahma Samhita to describe the transcendental abode of the Lord, filled with desire trees and Surabhi cows.

So the lotus feet are the refuge of pure devotees. The pure devotees always take shelter of the Lord's lotus feet, and they always do discuss about the Supreme Lord. Their only topic of discussion is the Supreme Lord. So the purport, Shila Prabhupada explains, there are different classes of human beings all with different enjoyment from different objects to seek new pleasures than обс cartridges. There are persons who are seeking after the favour of the goddess of fortune, and for them, the Vedic literatures give information that the Lord is always served with all reverence by thousands and thousands of the goddesses of fortune at the Chintamani Dhamma. This is the verse in the Brahma Samhita, Chintamani prakara sadmasu kalpa vriksha lakshavrteshu surabhi rabhi palayantam, lakshmi sahasra shata sambhrama sevya manam. Lakshmi refers to the goddess of fortune, sahasra shata, hundreds of thousands of goddesses of fortune are serving him with great reverence, sambhrama sevya manam. So if you want to know more about the goddess of fortune, you can click on the link in the description below. This description is there in the Brahma Samhita, the transcendental abode of the Lord where the trees are all desired trees and the buildings are made of touchstone, Chintamani prakara sadmasu. The trees are desired trees. They yield all kinds of desires. They satisfy all kinds of desires. The Lord Govinda is engaged there in herding the Surabhi cows as his natural occupation, Surabhi rabhi palayantam lakshavrteshu. He is surrounded by so many cows, beautiful cows, Surabhi cows.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Simply darshan of the Lord's transcendental form means we can simultaneously have darshan of the goddess of fortune because she always resides on the chest of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that seeing the Lord's form allows one to see the goddess of fortune and contrasts this with the impersonalists' inability to perceive the Lord's form; he also suggests that artists should focus on the Lord's beautiful face for complete satisfaction.

And they yield so much milk, oceans of milk. These goddesses of fortune can be saved. They are seen automatically if we are attracted by the bodily features of the Lord. There is no need to separately endeavour to have darshan of the beautiful goddess of fortune. Simply darshan of the Lord's transcendental form means we can simultaneously have darshan of the goddess of fortune because she always resides on the chest of the Lord. Now, Srila Prabhupada makes a remark about the goddess of fortune. He says, the impersonalists cannot observe such goddesses of fortune. Why? Because of their dry speculative habit. So, the speculation leads them to conclude that absolute truth is impersonal, no form, no personality. This is their conclusion. So, when they cannot see the form of the Lord, they can neither see the form of the goddess of fortune. Because she always resides on the chest of the Lord. Now, there are artists who are overtaken by the beautiful creation, this material creation. Prabhupada said, they should better see to the beautiful face of the Lord for complete satisfaction. Artists want to paint something very beautiful. They admire the creation, but millions and billions of times more beautiful is the beautiful face of the Lord. Of course, the creation has got beauty, no doubt about it, but that's just a reflection of the original beauty of the face of the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "Whatever beauty we see in this material world is a reflection of the original beauty of the form of the Lord or the face of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that all beauty in the material world is a reflection of the Lord's beauty and that administrative demigods and devotees can find protection and fearlessness by taking shelter of the Lord's arms.

So whatever beauty we see in this material world is a reflection of the original beauty of the form of the Lord or the face of the Lord. The face of the Lord is the embodiment of beauty. All beauty is there in the face of the Lord. What they call beautiful nature is but a smile. What they call the sweet sounds of the birds are but specimens of the whispering voice of the Lord. See, this is a description in the Bhagavatam second canto about the Lord's beauty and Lord's melodious voice that is manifest in this material world as a reflection. There are administrative demigods in charge of departmental service of cosmic management, and there are tiny administrative gods in the state service. They are always afraid of other competitors. Those in position of power in this material world, they are fearful of competitors who may overtake them. But if such administrative gods or administrative demigods, if they take shelter of the arms of the Lord, the Lord can protect them always from the attacks of enemies. This is always a fact. Pure devotees always take shelter of the Supreme Lord's arms. So pure devotees are never afraid, never afraid. They are called abhaya, nirbhaya. A faithful servant of the Lord engaged in the service of the administration is the ideal executive head

**Key Quote:** "A faithful servant of the Lord engaged in the service of the administration is the ideal executive head and can well protect the interest of the people in general."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts faithful administrators who protect citizens with materialistic administrators who cannot provide real protection and explains that the Lord is the essence of everything, and pure devotees are called sarangas because they glorify him.

and can well protect the interest of the people in general, like Yudhishthira Maharaj, Parichit Maharaj. They were ruling the whole world, but because they had taken protection of the Supreme Lord, they were able to give protection to the citizens. They were able to give proper protection to the citizens. Other so-called administrators are symbols of anachronisms leading to the acute distress of the people who are governed by them. These materialistic administrators, their own life is in danger. What to speak of them giving protection to the citizens they are ruling? It is not possible. They cannot give real protection. They may try, but they are invariably defeated by more powerful persons. That's the nature of this material world. But any administrator can remain safely under the protection of the arms of the Lord. That's what is meant by telling his arms are the resting place for the administrative demigods. The Lord's arms are worthy of taking shelter because they can give protection to anyone and everyone in this material world. So, Prabhupada explains the word saranganam. So Prabhupada says, the essence of everything is the Supreme Lord and therefore he is called saram. Saram is the essence, and those who sing and talk about him are called sarangas, or the pure devotees. The pure devotees are called sarangas because they are always singing and glorifying and talking about the Supreme Lord who is the essence of everything, Sara. So they are called sarangas. The pure devotees are always hankering after the lotus feet of the Lord. Why? Prabhupada explains, the lotus has a kind of honey which is transcendentally relished by the devotees, and the devotees are like bees who are always after the honey of the lotus feet of the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotees are like bees seeking the honey of the Lord's lotus feet and recites a prayer by Rupa Goswami expressing his desire to be fixed at the Lord's lotus feet to relish transcendental service, concluding with thanks and Hare Krishna.

So, Srila Prabhupada is quoting the great devotee Acharya, Srila Rupa Goswami. He has sung a song about the lotus honey comparing himself to the bee. Srila Rupa Goswami says in this song, O my Lord Krishna, I beg to offer my prayers unto you. My mind is like the bee and it is after some honey. Kindly therefore give my bee mind a place at your lotus feet, which are the resources for all transcendental honey. I know that even big demigods like Brahma do not see the rays of the nails of your lotus feet, even though they are engaged in deep meditation for years and years together. Still, O infallible one, my ambition is such, for you are very merciful to your surrendered devotees. O Madhava, I know also that I have no genuine devotion for the service of your lotus feet, but because your lordship is inconceivably powerful, you can do what is impossible to be done. Your lotus feet can deride even the nectar of the heavenly kingdom and therefore I am very much attracted by them. O Supreme Eternal, please therefore let my mind be fixed at your lotus feet so that eternally I may be able to relish the taste of your transcendental service. This is the beautiful prayer offered by Srila Rupa Goswami, the Acharya in the Gaudiya Vaishnava Sampradaya. So, the devotees are satisfied with being placed at the lotus feet of the Lord because there is a certain honey to be relished by the devotees who take shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

Sitata Patra Vyajanair Upaskritaha Prasuna Varshair Abhivarshitah Sitata Patra Vyajanair Upaskritaha Prasuna Vyajanair Upaskritaha Prasuna Vyajanair Upaskritaha The meaning of this verse is, as the Lord passed along the public road of Dwaraka, his head was protected from the sunshine by a white umbrella.

**Summary:** This segment explains how the simultaneous appearance of the sun, moon, rainbow, and lightning, as described in the verse, is possible only through the inconceivable potency of the Lord.

dark cloud was surrounded simultaneously by Sun, moon, lightning and rainbows. The description here is of a very, very, very beautiful scene when Krishna is passing on the public road of Dwaraka being welcomed by somebody holding an umbrella, by shower of flowers, by his yellow garments appearing very, very beautiful, all complementing each other to create a very beautiful scene. So here the comparison is made to a natural phenomena that occurs in a beautiful sky. So Shri la Prabhupada comments in the purport, the Sun, moon, rainbow and lightning do not appear in the sky simultaneously. When there is Sun, the moonlight becomes insignificant, and if there are clouds and a rainbow, there is no manifestation of lightning. These are the natural phenomena that occur in the sky. So how was it possible that all of them are described as simultaneously appearing in the scene? So that is explained here. The Lord's Bodily Hue is just like a new monsoon cloud, he is compared here into the cloud. The white umbrella over his head is compared to the sun, the movement of the bunch hair fan of flukes is compared to the moon, the showers of flowers are compared to the stars, his yellow garments are compared to the rainbow. So all these activities of the firmament, firmament means the sky, being impossible simultaneous factors, cannot be adjusted by comparison. If you try to imagine that the scene was like all these appearing simultaneously, that is never possible as a natural phenomenon. The advantage of the white umbrella over his head is that it can be adjusted by comparison. The advantage of the white umbrella over his head is that it can be adjusted by comparison. The adjustment is possible only when we think of the inconceivable potency of the Lord. The adjustment is possible only when we think of the inconceivable potency of the Lord. The adjustment is possible only when we think of the inconceivable potency of the Lord. The adjustment is possible only when we think of the inconceivable potency of the Lord. The adjustment is possible only when we think of the inconceivable potency of the Lord. The adjustment is possible only when we think of the inconceivable potency of the Lord. The adjustment is possible only when we think of the inconceivable potency of the Lord. The adjustment is possible only when we think of the inconceivable potency of the Lord. The adjustment is possible only when we think of the inconceivable potency of the Lord. The adjustment is possible only when we think of the inconceivable potency of the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "So the Lord, by His inconceivable energy, makes the impossible also possible."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the Lord's unlimited power and the beauty of the scene in Dwaraka, highlighting the devotees' affection for Krishna.

This is the important point to note here. The Lord's potency is inconceivable. Why? Because the Lord is all-powerful. And in His presence, anything impossible can be made possible by His inconceivable energy. So the Lord, by His inconceivable energy, makes the impossible also possible. That's the all-powerful Lord. Supremely powerful. Unlimitedly powerful. Infinitely powerful. It's possible. Everything is possible. But, the situation created at the time of His passing on the roads of Dvārakā was beautiful and could not be compared to anything besides the description of natural phenomena. It's so very beautiful that something comparable for our understanding who are not actually being present at that time, we are hearing the description from the Srimad Bhagavatam as described by the author. Or in this case, as described by Suta Goswami, who is describing to the sages Naimisharanya what was it like when Krishna was received by His devotees and how they were so very enthusiastic and eager and happy to receive the Lord with all wonderful arrangements for the reception of the most beloved personality, at the same time the most exalted personality, most respected personality, and they want to show their affection. Each one of them. Each one of them want to show their affection for Krishna. Because they are all related to Krishna. Everyone. So, the comparison can only be made with a natural phenomenon. And, if you could somehow imagine the natural phenomena occurring simultaneously, the sun, the moon, the rainbow and the lightning in the sky, which is impossible, but by the Lord's inconceivable potency, it's possible.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the limitations of scientific knowledge in understanding the Lord's creation and quotes Vedanta Sutra to emphasize the inconceivable nature of reality.

Then, that scene might appear something like all the four simultaneously coming in the sky. Now, regarding the Lord's inconceivable potency, Srila Prabhupada explains in another place in one lecture delivered while speaking on Bhagavad Gita. Prabhupada says, there are so many things that is not possible even to understand by the modern process of scientific experimental knowledge. The Lord's creation is so very wonderful that if somebody tries to comprehend what is the creation like by their process of scientific experimental knowledge, it is not possible. And, if the creation of the Lord is not possible to be understood by scientific process of knowledge, how can this ever understand God Himself, the source of everything? You cannot even know material objects by your so-called scientific study and research. You can know little more, that's all, by some advancement of your material knowledge. But, you cannot completely understand even this creation, the inferior creation of the Lord. So, Vedanta Sutra advises all of us, achintya khaluye bhava na tam starkena yojoyet This is what the Vedanta Sutra states. Things which are beyond your imagination, beyond your reach, beyond your thoughts, beyond your words, beyond your sense perception, how can you understand them by your experimental so-called scientific research? It's not possible. Therefore, achintya, achintya means inconceivable. We cannot conceive even material things which are created by the Lord.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So, these are all achintya, beyond our conception."
**Summary:** This segment explains the inconceivable duration of life in Brahmaloka according to the Bhagavad Gita, highlighting the vast difference in time scales and the limitations of human comprehension.

In the Bhagavad Gita, it is said, sahasra yuga pariyantam aharyat brahmano viduhu Prabhupada gives an example for helping us understand what's really inconceivable about this. Brahmanaha means of Lord Brahma and the living creatures in the Brahmaloka, the highest, topmost planet in the entire universe. So in that planet, Brahmaloka planet, the people or living entities who are living there, their duration of life, what is it like? What is their duration of life? The Bhagavad Gita says, sahasra yuga pariyantam Now yuga, the word yuga used here means according to our calculation on the earth, time calculation on the earth. Yuga here means the four yugas combined together. Now, satya yuga means eighteen lakhs of years. Treta yuga, twelve hundred thousands of years. Dwapara yuga, eight hundred thousands of years. And Kali yuga, four hundred thousands of years. So, totally, all these four put together, forty-three hundred thousands of years makes one Divya yuga. And one thousand such Divya yugas that is one day of the inhabitants of Brahmaloka. So can you do the calculation? Can you imagine what is the duration of their day? So they live a hundred years, 100 years according to that calculation of day, such day and night, and 365 such days and nights, 100 such years they live. So, it's just not possible for us to calculate this. What is the duration of life of the people who live in Brahmaloka, the topmost planet in this material universe? So, these are all achintya, beyond our conception. It has been calculated elsewhere, and it is said their lifespan, Brahmaloka lifespan, is something like 4 trillion 30 billion of our solar years. 4 trillion 30 billion. That is their lifespan. And even that is limited. That's limited. That is just half a breadth of Maha Vishnu. That is the lifespan of the inhabitants of Brahmaloka or Lord Brahma. Half a breadth of Maha Vishnu. So, what is Maha Vishnu's time scale? So, we cannot imagine all this. We cannot conceive of all this. Then, what to speak of the spiritual world?

**Key Quote:** "So, the best thing is to follow the process, the Vedic process, to receive knowledge by the descending process."
**Summary:** This segment advocates for receiving knowledge through the descending process (parampara) due to the limitations of the human mind in comprehending the vastness and complexity of the universe.

We cannot calculate even something of the material world perfectly. So, the best thing is to follow the process, the Vedic process, to receive knowledge by the descending process. Descending process means the perfect knowledge is available from the Supreme Lord, coming down in the parampara system. We simply have to receive it. That's all. And for receiving such knowledge, we have to prepare ourselves. And that preparation is nothing but the practice of spiritual life. And it is perfect knowledge handed down. Because by our experimental method, we can't even conceive what is the nature of things in this one universe. There are millions of such universes. Each universe has millions of planets. Each planet has millions of living entities. Each living entity has millions of complicated structures within their form. There are 3 trillion cells within our body. And there are 200 varieties of cells. All this is inconceivable for our tiny brain to accommodate. So, therefore, the descending process. I'll stop here.

### Lord Krishna's Return to Dwaraka, Respect for Mothers, Family Dynamics

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "after entering the house of his father he was embraced by the mothers present and the Lord offered his obeisances unto them by placing his head at their feet the mothers were headed by Devaki his real mother"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verses to be discussed, focusing on Lord Krishna's return to Dwaraka and his respectful interaction with his father's wives, emphasizing the importance of respecting all mothers.

In this session we will be discussing from two verses, 28 and 29, of the 11th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, the same topic: Lord Krishna's entrance into Dwaraka, how the Dwaraka Nivasis received Lord Krishna when he returned to Dwaraka from Hastinapura. Pravishtastu Griham Pitro Parishvakta Swamatrabhihi Vavande Shirasa Saptah Devaki Pramukha Mudha, the meaning of this verse is: after entering the house of his father, he was embraced by the mothers present, and the Lord offered his obeisances unto them by placing his head at their feet. The mothers were headed by Devaki, his real mother. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, Krishna has entered his father's house. Vasudeva was living in a palace. Krishna has entered his father's house. Vasudeva was living in a palace in Dwaraka, and Vasudeva, the father of Lord Krishna, had completely separate residential quarters where he lived with his 18 wives. Kings used to have more than one queen, so Vasudeva was a king and he had 18 queens, so he used to live in separate residential quarters with his 18 queens. Out of them, Srimati Devaki is the real mother of Lord Krishna. Devaki and Vasudeva gave birth to Krishna, but in spite of all this, all other stepmothers were equally affectionate to Lord Krishna, as would be evident from the following verse. So Lord Krishna also did not distinguish his real mother from his stepmothers, and he equally offered his obeisances unto all the wives of Vasudeva present on the occasion.

### Seven Mothers, Vedic Culture, Respect

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "according to scriptures there are seven mothers Saptaita Matara Smrita"
**Summary:** The lecture expands on the concept of 'seven mothers' in Vedic culture, including the biological mother, the wife of the spiritual master, the wife of a brahmana, the queen, the cow, the nurse, and the earth, highlighting the importance of respect for all in the position of a mother.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in another place that Lord Krishna is teaching us by his example that there are actually seven mothers for everyone, every civilized human being, seven mothers: Atma Mata Guru Patni Brahmani Raja Patnika Dhenur Dhatri Tatha Prithvi Saptaita Matara Smrita, seven mothers according to the Vedic conception. So the meaning of this particular verse that I have just now recited, according to scriptures there are seven mothers, Saptaita Matara Smrita. First one is Atma Mata, the real mother. Guru Patni, the wife of the spiritual master, Guru Patni. Number three, Brahmani, means the wife of a Brahmana. Number four, Raja Patnika, the wife of the king, that means the queen. Then number five, Dhenu, the cow, and number six, Dhatri, means the nurse, and last one, the seventh one, Prithvi, means the earth mother. Earth mother, cow, all of them are mothers, all of them are mothers. This is the Vedic culture, very advanced culture, the highest respect is offered to the mother, but mother is not just one. Our limited understanding is generally we have one mother, but no, there are other mothers, there are other mothers, others in the position of mother. As regards respect, offering respect, from that perspective it is being said here how one should offer respect to one's mother, the same respect should be offered to the others also who are in the position of respect as one's own mother. Hmm, even by this injunction of the Shastras, the seven kinds of mothers, the stepmother who is the wife of the father is also as good as one's own mother, because the father is also one of the spiritual masters. So if the father is spiritual master, and if he has eighteen wives, all the eighteen of them are one's mother, each one of them is mother.

### Krishna's Example, Imitation vs. Following, Lord Shiva
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/ZZWUvC7WGM0?t=385
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Lord Krishna the Lord of the Universe plays the part of an ideal son just to teach others how to treat their stepmothers"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that while Lord Krishna sets an example, not all his activities should be imitated, distinguishing between following and imitating, using the example of Lord Shiva drinking poison to illustrate the dangers of imitation.

So Lord Krishna, the Lord of the Universe, plays the part of an ideal son just to teach others how to treat their stepmothers. Generally stepmothers are not given as much respect as one's own mother normally, but here Lord Krishna is teaching, mother is respectable, and seven types of mother we have to respect. That is the perfect culture, Vedic culture, the most advanced developed culture, so that we can develop our Krishna consciousness, we can awaken our devotion, dormant devotion to Krishna, which is covered right now within the heart. So this culture is important from that perspective. Now Srila Prabhupada says that Lord Krishna teaches by his example certain things which are to be followed by everyone, but that does not mean we can imitate all of Krishna's activities, which sometimes people tend to do. Prabhupada explains in another lecture given on the occasion of giving a discourse on Bhagavad Gita, Srila Prabhupada says, Anukaran and Anussaran, two Sanskrit words are there, one is imitation, the other word refers to following the footprints. Anukaran means imitation, Anussaran means following the footprints. If one tries to follow the footprints of great personalities, that is very nice, but we cannot imitate. Imitation is dangerous. Just like Lord Shiva, he drank an ocean of poison and kept it in his throat, he did not allow that poison to go down, so he became known as Neelakanta, blue-throated, because he is holding the poison in his neck, in his throat. So if somebody imitates Lord Shiva and indulges in intoxication, ganja, he will go to hell. So this imitation of Shiva is dangerous, is dangerous.

### Power and Contamination, Rules and Regulations, Following Examples

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "those who are powerful you cannot find some fault with them nor can you imitate their powerful activities that's never possible"
**Summary:** The lecture uses the analogy of the sun absorbing impurities without being contaminated to further explain why not everyone can imitate powerful figures like Lord Shiva, emphasizing the importance of following rules and regulations and appropriate examples.

Very dangerous. Now Shiva is very, very, very powerful. So somebody may say Shiva is smoking ganja, so why I can't smoke ganja? No, you cannot, because you cannot imitate Shiva, you can only follow Shiva in his footprints. Those activities which Shiva performs, among many activities that he does, only those activities which he performs for setting an example for the common people, only those activities we have to follow. Now another example Srila Prabhupada gives, just like the sunshine. The sunshine is so very strong that it is absorbing the moisture of the filthy place, contaminated place, contaminated place where one is passing urine, but still the sun is very, very, very powerful, so the sun doesn't get contaminated by absorbing urine from a filthy place, no. But if we try to live in a filthy place where people pass urine, then we will become immediately contaminated because we don't have the power to counteract that infection, we don't have it. So Bhagavatam says those who are powerful, you cannot find some fault with them, nor can you imitate their powerful activities, that's never possible. So for the common people, we have to follow the rules and regulations, and while following the rules and regulations, the examples are set by great personalities, only those examples which are specifically meant for us to follow.

### Affection for Krishna, Spontaneous Love, Following Krishna's Example

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "krishna bowing down showing respect to all his stepmothers touching his head to their feet that is to be followed"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the affection the mothers of Dwaraka had for Krishna, contrasting activities that should not be imitated (like the Rasa dance) with those that should (like showing respect to mothers and stepmothers).

The 29th verse, ta putram ankam aaropya snehasnuta payodharaha harsha vikvalitaatmanaha vikvalitaatmanaha shichur si shichur netrajair jalaihi. The meaning of this verse is, the mothers, after embracing their son, who is the son? Lord Krishna, the Supreme Lord, sat him on their laps. Due to pure affection, milk sprang from their breasts. They were overwhelmed with delight, and the tears from their eyes wetted the Lord. So this is the affection all the mothers, the 18 queens of Vasudeva, had for Krishna, and this is a natural, eternal, spontaneous affection they have, relationship they have. So Shila Prabhupada says in the purport, when Lord Krishna was at Vrindavan, even the cows would become moistened by affection towards him, and he would draw milk from the nipples of every affectionate living being. So what to speak of the stepmothers who were already as good as his own mother. So we should not imitate Krishna in the matter of Krishna dancing with young gopis in the rasa dance or Krishna lifting Govardhan Hill, don't imitate, but Krishna bowing down, showing respect to all his stepmothers, touching his head to their feet, that is to be followed, that is to be followed. We should show respect to the seven kinds of mothers, including stepmothers, that is to be followed.

**Key Quote:** "that's why we require guidance for our guidance there are three authorities guru sadhu shastra"
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by emphasizing the need for guidance from guru (spiritual master), sadhu (previous acharyas), and shastra (scriptures) to discern which activities of great personalities should be followed and which should not be imitated.

So one, certain activities of Krishna, certain activities of an incarnation of the Supreme Lord, certain activities of powerful personalities like Lord Shiva are meant for us to follow. So how do we know which activity we are supposed to follow and which activity we are not supposed to imitate? That's why we require guidance. For our guidance there are three authorities: guru, sadhu, shastra. Guru means our own spiritual master, the bona fide spiritual master, he guides, and the authority also is the scriptures, shastra, and the previous acharyas, their instructions, their injunctions. So three authorities: guru, sadhu, shastra. Guru means one's own spiritual master, and sadhu means the previous acharyas, and shastra means the scriptures. All the three are meant to be consulted which activities of great personalities we are supposed to follow and which activities we are not supposed to imitate. I'll stop here, thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Immediately they began to run towards the city entrance, simply to receive the Lord, to have his darshan, long-desired audience."
**Summary:** The citizens of Dwarka eagerly await Krishna's arrival and rush to greet him upon hearing the sound of his conch shell.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet In this session, we will be discussing from the third verse of the eleventh chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, Tam Upashrutya Ninadam Jagadbhaya Bhayavaham Pratyudyayukh Prajasarva Bhartradarsana Lalasaaha. The meaning of this verse is, the citizens of Dwaraka, having heard that sound which threatens fear personified in the material world, began to run away. Run towards him fast, just to have a long-desired audience with the Lord, who is the protector of all devotees. So this is the description of how the citizens of Dwaraka responded to that sound of Krishna's conch shell. Krishna was announcing to the citizens, knowing very well that they were eagerly awaiting his arrival in Dwaraka. So he sounded his conch shell. Before he actually entered the city, he sounded his conch shell. And what did the citizens do? Immediately they began to run towards the city entrance, simply to receive the Lord, to have his darshan, long-desired audience.

**Key Quote:** "The pure devotees, the liberated souls, the eternal associates never forget Krishna even for one moment."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the citizens of Dwarka were liberated souls who are eternally connected to Krishna and constantly remember him.

As already explained by Srila Prabhupada in the Purport, the citizens of Dwarka who lived at the time of Lord Krishna's presence there were all liberated souls who descended there along with the Lord as entourage. They accompanied the Lord. They are all his eternal devotees. They are all liberated souls. They have nothing to do with this material world of karma. We take birth here because we have got the force of karma and we accept a material body. These devotees of Krishna, liberated souls, they come in their spiritual form as much as Krishna appears in his original spiritual form. And it is described, all were anxious to have an audience with the Lord although because of spiritual contact, they were never separated from the Lord. We should not think that they are forgetful of Krishna at any time. No. That is our condition that we forget Krishna and we are put into so much material miseries, material difficulties, material problems only because of forgetfulness of Krishna. But the pure devotees, the liberated souls, the eternal associates never forget Krishna even for one moment. They are constantly thinking of Krishna, constantly remembering Krishna, constantly in touch with Krishna through varieties of ways.

**Key Quote:** "Similarly, the citizens of Dwarka were all immersed in thought of the Lord while he was away from Dwarka to attend the battle of Kurukshetra."
**Summary:** The speaker compares the citizens of Dwarka's constant remembrance of Krishna to the gopis' remembrance of Krishna and emphasizes the joy derived from this constant connection.

Just as the gopis of Vrindavan used to think of Krishna while he was away from the village for cowherding engagements. The example is given by Srila Prabhupada, the gopis in Vrindavan. Krishna is to go for cowherding. The gopis would always think of Krishna when he was away from the village. Similarly, the citizens of Dwarka were all immersed in thought of the Lord while he was away from Dwarka to attend the battle of Kurukshetra. They were thinking of Krishna. They were remembering his pastimes. They were thinking of his beautiful form, of his qualities, of his relationship. Everything. They are constantly immersed and that itself is a source of unlimited joy for them. They are always in this. But there are varieties of experiences of this ecstasy in different times, in different ways. The ecstasy of the devotees is ecstasy. The ecstasy of the devotees is experienced by them.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "But Krishna is one Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker refutes the idea that the Krishna of Vrindavan, Mathura, and Dwarka are different, asserting that Krishna is one Supreme Lord who manifests in different forms and relationships.

Some distinguished fiction writer in Bengal concluded that the Krishna of Vrindavan, that of Mathura and that of Dwarka were different personalities because Krishna's activities are entirely different in Vrindavan, in Mathura and Dwarka. There are varieties of relationships, varieties of forms, varieties of activities, varieties of qualities displayed by Krishna. But Krishna is one Supreme Lord, one person, though he presents himself in different forms, in different moods according to the relationship. But he is one person. He is not different. There are not many persons there, only one person. Historically there is no truth in this conclusion. That means Krishna is the same everywhere, in Dwarka, in Mathura, in Vrindavan. The Krishna of Kurukshetra and the Krishna of Dwarka are one and the same personality. Advaitam acchutamanadi manantaroopam Not only Krishna in Dwarka, Vrindavan and Mathura are one person. Even Krishna and Rama and Narasimha and Varaha are the same person, Krishna, in different incarnations. Even in the spiritual world, Narayana, Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha are the same person, Krishna. But he is present in different forms according to the need of reciprocating with his different forms.

### Melancholy in Krishna's absence, Krishna as the dispeller of darkness, Awakening to Krishna

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Similarly, all darkness is dispelled, all ignorance is dispelled, all sadness is dispelled when Krishna sounded his conch shell and announced his arrival in Dwaraka."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the citizens of Dwarka felt melancholy in Krishna's absence, comparing it to darkness at night, and that Krishna's arrival dispels this darkness like the rising sun.

The citizens of Dwarka were thus in a state of melancholy. Melancholy means feeling of sadness due to the Lord's absence from the transcendental city. When Krishna was absent, the citizens were feeling sad. Krishna is not there. We long for Krishna. As much as we are put into a state of melancholy at night because of the absence of the sun, the example is being given. In darkness, without sunshine at night, we feel sadness. The sound heralded by Lord Krishna was something like the heralding of the sunrise in the morning. When the sun rises in the morning, the darkness is immediately dispelled. And thieves and plunderers and all kinds of rogues, they again go back into hiding because they stealthily try to do all their nefarious activities at night in the darkness. Whereas as soon as the sun rises, all these thieves and plunderers, they go away into hiding. Similarly, all darkness is dispelled, all ignorance is dispelled, all sadness is dispelled when Krishna sounded his conch shell and announced his arrival in Dwaraka. So all the citizens of Dwarka awoke from a state of slumber. Slumber means sleepiness. They were like sleeping in the absence of Krishna, and they awoke because of the sunrise of Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is the only protector of all his devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna is the sole protector of his devotees and explains the non-dual nature of Krishna, where his name, form, qualities, and abode are identical to him.

And they all hastened towards him just to have an audience, just to have darshan of Krishna's beautiful form. They all rushed towards Krishna, their entrance of the city of Dwaraka. The devotees of the Lord know no one else as their protector. Krishna is the only protector of all his devotees, and Krishna is the only one who can give protection. No one else can protect us. Especially in the material world, we are, that Prabhupada explains in the next paragraph. This sound of the Lord is identical with the Lord as we have tried to explain by the non-dual position of the Lord, Advaya jnana. In the Bhagavatam it is explained Krishna is Advaya jnana, the non-dual substance. That means Krishna is absolute. His name, his form, his qualities, his pastimes or his activities, his paraphernalia, his devotees, his abode, all are identical with Krishna. That means Krishna is fully present in his name, in his form, in his qualities, in his abode, in his devotees, pure devotees, in his opulence.

### Material existence full of fear, Problems of material existence, Influence of Maya

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "The material existence of our present status is full of fear."
**Summary:** The speaker describes material existence as being full of fear and problems due to our association with Maya, the illusory energy of the Lord.

Everything is Krishna. There are no two things. In the material world there is always matter and spirit. We have a material body. This body is different from us. We are spirit soul. Whereas Krishna is identical with his form because his form is completely spiritual. Krishna is identical with his name because his name is completely spiritual. So Prabhupada explains further the material existence of our present status is full of fear. Out of the four problems of material existence ahara, nidra, bhaya, maithuna food problem, shelter problem, fear problem, mating problem the fear problem gives us more trouble than the others. We are always fearful due to our ignorance of the next problem. We are faced with many different problems one after another. That is material existence. So the whole material existence is full of problems and thus the fear problem is always prominent. This is due to our association with the illusory energy of the Lord known as Maya. So in the absence of Krishna consciousness when you forget Krishna then we are in touch or we are trapped, captured by the illusory energy Maya.

**Key Quote:** "Yet all fear is vanished as soon as there is a sound of the Lord represented by his holy name"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that chanting the Hare Krishna mantra dispels all fear and connects us with Krishna through his sound representation.

Yet all fear is vanished as soon as there is a sound of the Lord represented by his holy name as it was sounded by Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in the following sixteen words Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Chaitanya Mahaprabhu taught us this Hare Krishna mantra. He chanted and he also instructed us to chant Hare Krishna thereby associated with Krishna through his sound representation, through his sound form Hare Krishna mantra. Hare Krishna mantra is fully present in the Hare Krishna mantra. And as soon as we say Hare Krishna immediately all fear will vanish, all problems will disappear, all miseries will go away and we come in direct contact with Krishna if we chant and hear Hare Krishna. Chanting and hearing Hare Krishna is as simple yet very very effective and powerful way of driving away all fear of becoming free from all problems. So that is what Srila Prabhupada explains we can take advantage of these sounds and be free from all threatening problems.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that chanting Hare Krishna awakens our Krishna consciousness, leading to dependence on Krishna and liberation from all problems.

Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is teaching us to put an end to our suffering in this world. Somebody may say how can simply chanting Hare Krishna solve all my problems? The difficulty is that in material existence we forget Krishna and we don't understand that we have to take shelter of Krishna for solving all our problems, for getting all our necessities, for getting complete protection from Krishna. But instead in forgetfulness we make so many other arrangements which are incomplete, imperfect, insufficient. All this can be solved simply by chanting Hare Krishna and awakening our Krishna consciousness to come to the state of dependence on Krishna, full dependence on Krishna, and thereby we become completely liberated from all problems. All our problems are solved.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 30th verse of the 11th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Athavishat Swabhavanam Sarvakamam Anuttamam Prasadayatra Patneenam Sahasranicha Shodasha. The meaning of this verse is, "Thereafter, the Lord entered his palaces, which were perfect to the fullest extent. His wives lived in them, and they numbered over 16." So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, Lord Krishna had 16,108 wives, and for each and every one of them, there was a fully equipped palace, complete with necessary compounds and gardens. Full description of these palaces is given in the 10th canto. All these palaces were made of the best marble stone. They were illuminated by jewels, and decorated by curtains and carpets of velvet and silk, nicely bedecked and embroidered with gold lace. These things we can't even imagine in our present yuga. The personality of Godhead means one who is full with all power, all energy, all opulences, all beauties, all knowledge, and all renunciation. That's the meaning of the word Bhagavan—full of six opulences. Therefore, in the palaces of the Lord, there was nothing wanting for fulfilling all desires of the Lord. The Lord is unlimited, and therefore his desires are also unlimited. And the supply is also unlimited. Therefore, his desires are also unlimited.

**Key Quote:** "When the great sage Narada heard that Lord Krishna had married 16,000 wives after he had killed the demon Narakasura, Narada was astonished."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Narada's visit to Dwarka, describing the city's beauty, the palaces of Krishna's wives, and the overall opulence, based on the 10th canto of Srimad Bhagavatam.

Everything being unlimited, it is concisely described here as sarvakamam sarvakamam anuttamam—sarvakamam, full with all desirable equipment. Now, in the 10th canto, there is a beautiful description of the palaces of Krishna. In the 69th chapter of the 10th canto, there is a description. When the great sage Narada heard that Lord Krishna had married 16,000 wives after he had killed the demon Narakasura, sometimes also called Bhamasura, Narada was astonished. The Lord Krishna had expanded himself into 16,000 forms and married these wives simultaneously in different palaces. So, being inquisitive as to how Krishna was managing his household affairs with so many wives, Narada, desiring to see these pastimes, set out to visit Krishna's different homes. So, when Narada arrived in Dwaraka, he saw gardens, and parks full of various flowers of different colors, and orchards overloaded with a variety of fruits. Beautiful birds were chirping, and peacocks crowed delightfully. There were ponds full of blue and red lotus flowers, and some of these tanks were filled with varieties of vegetables, and varieties of lilies. The lakes were full of nice swans and cranes, and the voices of these birds resounded everywhere. In the city of Dwaraka, there were as many as 900,000 great palaces. How many? Nine lakh palaces, built of first-class marble, with gates and doors made of silver. The pillars of the houses and palaces were bedecked with jewels, such as touchstone, sapphire, emerald, and the floors gave off a beautiful luster. Floor giving off luster. Have you ever heard of this? The highways, lanes, streets, crossings, and marketplaces were all beautifully decorated. The whole city was full of residential homes, and streets and also the thresholds of every residential house were very clean. On both sides of every path there were bushes and at regular intervals there were large trees that shaded the avenues so that the sunshine would not bother the passer-by. In this greatly beautiful city of Dwarka, Lord Krishna the Supreme Personality of Godhead had many residential quarters. The great Kings and Princes of the world used to visit these palaces just to worship Lord Krishna. The architectural plans were made personally by Vishwakarma, the engineer of the demigods. And in the construction of the palaces of Lord Krishna, he exhibited all of his talents and ingenuity. These residential quarters numbered more than 16,000.

**Key Quote:** "The great sage Narada entered one of these houses and saw that the pillars were made of coral and the ceilings were bedecked with jewels."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the description of Krishna's palaces, focusing on the intricate details of the architecture, decorations, and the service provided by numerous maidservants and manservants.

And a different queen of Lord Krishna resided in each of them. As many queens, so many palaces, one for each queen. The great sage Narada entered one of these houses and saw that the pillars were made of coral and the ceilings were bedecked with jewels. The walls as well as the arches between the pillars glowed. The palaces were decorated with decorations made of different kinds of sapphires. Throughout the palace were many canopies made by Vishwakarma that were decorated with strings of pearls. All this is a factual description. This is not somebody's imagination. This is not some mythology, because the Lord is full of all opulences. So what is surprising if his palaces are so beautifully decorated. The chairs and other furniture were made of ivory and bedecked with gold and diamonds, and jewel lamps dissipated the darkness. The material nature by constitution is dark, but when there is a need of a light source, the Lord's palace was illuminated by jeweled lamps—the jewels which emit light. There was so much incense and fragrant gum burning that the scented fumes were coming out of the windows. The peacock sitting on the steps became illusioned by the fumes mistaking them for clouds and began dancing jubilantly. So beautiful. The smoke coming out of the windows seemed like clouds for the peacocks sitting on the windows, and they were dancing very jubilantly. There were many maid servants, thousands and thousands of maid servants in each palace, and all of them were decorated with gold necklaces, golden bangles and beautiful saris. There were also many man servants nicely dressed in cloaks and turbans and jeweled earrings. Beautiful as they were, the servants were all engaged in different household duties.

**Key Quote:** "This material world is filled with miseries. It's the nature of this material world. We don't belong here."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the opulence of the spiritual world with the suffering of the material world, emphasizing that Krishna's opulence is meant to attract conditioned souls and that material pleasures are not real.

So this is just to give us an idea. What is the kind of opulence of the Supreme Lord? You cannot compare it with opulence of the richest person in this entire creation, material creation. Of course, in the spiritual world, the Lord enjoys with all his devotees. He shares his opulences. Nobody there is bereft of any need, necessity. To serve the Lord, they have everything that they simply desire, because there are desire trees in the spiritual world. But even when Krishna appeared on this earth planet, He brought down his opulence. His abode descended. Dwaraka Dham, Mathura Dham, Vrindavan Dham descended with Krishna. And naturally, these beautiful places were full of the opulences. This is just to attract the conditioned soul, to prepare themselves to go to the spiritual world and live with Krishna as one of his associates in a loving relationship. Each one of us is God with Krishna. Krishna wants to attract us. Why are you suffering in this material world? This material world is filled with miseries. It's the nature of this material world. We don't belong here. Foolishly, ignorant people may think that even if there are miseries, let me make adjustment and learn to live, and try to enjoy the pleasures available in this world—the material pleasures available. But Bhagavad Gita says material pleasures are not real pleasures.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by inviting listeners to seek spiritual bliss with Krishna, highlighting Krishna's availability to all and the power of devotional service, particularly chanting Hare Krishna, to attain the spiritual world.

They are simply due to some sense contact producing some sensation, and it is wrongly interpreted as material pleasure. But actually it is simply different kind of distress. It is filled with distresses, this material existence, and different kinds of distresses are interpreted. Or if there is a relief from some distress that is thought of as happiness, pleasure, material pleasure. So we are entitled to pure spiritual bliss of the kind that Krishna enjoys with his associates. And in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna is inviting, "Come. Come to me. Live with me. Enjoy with me." And that too in a loving relationship. Krishna is one. Living entities are countless. But that doesn't mean that Krishna is unavailable for some insignificant living being. No. Krishna is available for each and every living being in the spiritual world. Why spiritual world? Even the material world. He has expanded as Paramatma in the heart of everyone, of each one of us. He is available for each one of us, even in the material world. But material world is not direct. Spiritual world is direct relationship—directly available. So Krishna invites us, "Please come to the spiritual world." And simply by chanting Hare Krishna and perfecting our devotional service, we can immediately transfer ourselves to the spiritual world. I'll stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.

coyly. So here is a description: when Krishna entered the palaces, he expanded himself into 16,108 forms and simultaneously he entered each of the palaces. So when he was in his home, he is available to each and every queen simultaneously, unlike the living entities of this world or even of the spiritual world. At least in this world, a yogi can expand himself into maximum 10 forms. Krishna expanded himself into as many forms as required, so therefore nobody can imitate Krishna, nobody can duplicate Krishna. So Krishna is the supreme unlimited personality of Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "God is one but that one Supreme Lord expands himself in plenary expansions plenary means with full power in each of the forms that he expands his form is power is not diminished"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the queens' devotion and quotes Srila Prabhupada's purport, explaining Krishna's plenary expansions and the concept of oneness and multiplicity in the Supreme Lord.

And the queens, when they saw the Supreme Lord, their husband, their beloved husband entering the palace, they at once got up from their seats and meditations, but they were also shy, so they looked through the covering in a shy manner. So Sri Lak Prabhupada explains elaborately in the purport a very important point: the Lord entered his home palaces occupied by 16,108 queens. This means the Lord at once expanded himself in as many forms as possible. The Lord entered his home palaces occupied by 16,108 queens. This means the Lord at once expanded himself in as much as he could. The Lord at once expanded himself in as much as he could, as many plenary expansions as there were queens and palaces and entered in each and every one of them simultaneously and separately. Here is another manifestation of the feature of his internal potency. He can expand himself in as many forms of spiritual identity as he desires even though he is one without a second. God is one, but that one Supreme Lord expands himself in plenary expansions. Plenary means with full power. In each of the forms that he expands, his form is power is not diminished. It is confirmed in a Shruti mantra that the absolute is one alone, a come a va-advitiya, and yet he becomes many as soon as he so desires. These may be the same as the other shrutis and shrutis do not have the soul.

**Key Quote:** "The separated portions are representations of his energy and the plenary portions are manifestations of his personality."
**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between plenary and separated expansions of Krishna, explaining that plenary expansions are manifestations of His personality with full power, while separated expansions are representations of His energy with a gradation of power.

These may be the same as the other shrutis and shrutis do not have the soul. Manifold expansions of the Supreme Lord are manifested as plenary and separated portions. The separated portions are representations of his energy and the plenary portions are manifestations of his personality. The technical point: Krishna expands himself, his own personality in plenary portions. Full power, each of the plenary expansions. Like Krishna, Rama, Narasimha, Varaha, Narayana, Govinda. All of them have same power. All of them are the Supreme Lord. The same Supreme Lord. One and only Supreme Lord. Whereas he has got energies and expansions of the energies are called separated expansions. They are not plenary expansions. That means there is gradation of power in each of the expansions of the energy. As much as is required for the purpose of the expansion of the energy, only that much power will be present in the expanded portion.

**Key Quote:** "unbelievers become astonished to learn that lord krishna married more than 16 000 queens because they think of lord krishna as one of them and measure the potency of the lord by their own limited potency never make this mistake"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Krishna's transcendental potency (Vaibhava) and his title as Yogeshwara, emphasizing his unlimited siddhis and warning against comparing Krishna to ordinary beings.

Separated expansion. Thus the personality of God had manifested himself in 16,108 plenary expansions and simultaneously entered into each and every one of the palaces of the Queens. This is called Vaibhava or the Transcendental Potency of the Lord. This is the technical word Vaibhava. It means this is the spiritual potency or transcendental potency of the Lord. Because he can do so, he is known as Yogeshwara. In the level of the Lord, he is known as Yogeshwara. In the eleventh chapter, it is described Krishna as Yogeshwara. 18th chapter: yatra Yogeshwara Krishna yatra partho dhanur dharaha tatra sri vijayo bhutir dhruvanitir matir mama. Krishna is Yogeshwara. He has got unlimited siddhis, unlimited siddhis. Ordinarily, a yogi or mystic living being is able to expand himself at the most to tenfold expansions of his body, at most ten expansions, but the Lord can do so to the extent of as many thousands or infinitely as he likes. Unbelievers become astonished to learn that Lord Krishna married more than 16,000 queens because they think of Lord Krishna as one of them and measure the potency of the Lord by their own limited potency. Never make this mistake. Don't think Krishna is like another

**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of marginal potency (tatastha shakti) and the distinction between the potent (Krishna) and his potency, highlighting the spiritual quality of both and the transcendental pastimes exchanged between them.

ordinary living being. No, he is the Supreme Lord, infinitely powerful, infinitely expanded. One should therefore know that the Lord is never on the level of the living beings and these living beings are but expansions of his marginal potency. Krishna has got one potency called tatastha shakti, marginal potency, and living beings are expansions of this tatastha shakti. One should also never equalize the potent and the potency. Krishna is the potent, the possessor of the potency, and the potency is the energy of Krishna, the potency of Krishna, energy of Krishna. So don't equalize the possessor of the potency, all the potencies, Krishna, one Supreme Lord with the potency itself, don't equalize. As far as the quality is concerned, there is not much difference between the quality of the potent and the potency. Both are spiritual. The queens were also expansions of his internal potency, internal potency, the queens, and thus the potent and the potencies are perpetually exchanging transcendental pleasures known as the pastimes of the Lord: Krishna leela, Ram leela, Narsimha leela, Varaha leela. That is the term used only for the Lord, his transcendental pastimes exchanged between the potency and the potent.

**Key Quote:** "he married only sixteen thousand wives and entered in each and every one of them in different palaces just to impress in the history of the human beings on the surface of the earth that the lord is never equal to or less than any human being"
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates Krishna's unlimited potency and greatness, emphasizing that even marrying 16,000 wives doesn't fully manifest his power, and describes the queens' constant meditation on Krishna and Vedic injunctions for women whose husbands are away.

One should not therefore become astonished to learn that the Lord married so many wives. On the contrary, one should affirm that even the Lord marries 16,000 million wives, he is not completely manifesting his unlimited and inexhaustible potency because he is unlimited. That's a fact. He is not completely manifesting his unlimited and inexhaustible potency because he is unlimited. That's a fact. That's a fact. He married only sixteen thousand wives and entered in each and every one of them in different palaces just to impress in the history of the human beings on the surface of the earth that the Lord is never equal to or less than any human being. However powerful a human being might be, no one therefore is either equal to or greater than the Lord. The Lord is always great in all respects. God is great is eternal truth. Therefore, as soon as the Queen saw from a distance their husband was away from home for long periods due to the Battle of Kurukshetra, they all arose from the slumber of meditation and prepared to receive their most beloved. See, even in Krishna is away from the palace, the Queen's are engaged in meditating on Krishna constantly. They cannot forget even for a fraction of a moment. None they're so attached, they're so pleased to always think of him. Krishna says that in the Bhagavad Gita: man mana, always think of me. So the Queen's and all the devotees, not only the Queen's, all the devotees in the spiritual world are always thinking of Krishna every moment, thinking of Krishna and thereby being very much satisfied and full of bliss, transcendental pure bliss. According to Yajnavalkya's religious injunctions, a woman whose husband is away from home should not take part in his social functions, should not decorate her body, should not laugh and should not go to any relatives house in any circumstance. This is a Vedic culture, scriptural directions also. This is the vow of the ladies whose husbands are away from home. At the same time, it is also enjoined that a wife should never present herself before the husband in unclean state. She must decorate herself with ornaments and good dress and should always be present before the husband in a happy and joyous mood.

**Key Quote:** "the lord's devotees cannot live even for one moment without meditating on the lord and what to speak of the queens who are all goddesses of fortune"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the queens' unwavering devotion and constant meditation on Krishna, comparing them to the gopis of Vrindavan, and explains how they abandoned their vows upon seeing Krishna's return.

So what about the queens of Dwarka? It is explained the queens of Lord Krishna were all in meditation thinking of the Lord's absence and were always meditating upon him. The Lord's devotees cannot live even for one moment without meditating on the Lord and what to speak of the queens who are all goddesses of fortune incarnated as queens in the past times of the Lord and Dwarka are all Lakshmi. They can never be separated from the Lord either by presence or by trance. When Krishna is personally present, they are with Krishna and when Krishna is away, physically away, then they are always with Lord by meditation, completely absorbed in thinking of him only. Now similarly, the gopis at Vrindavan could not forget the Lord when the Lord was away in the forest cowherding. When the Lord boy Krishna was absent from the village, the gopis at home used to worry about his traversing the rough ground with his soft lotus feet. By thinking thus, they were sometimes overwhelmed in trance and mortified in the heart. They feel for Krishna within their heart every moment when he's away from home, from the village. Such is the condition of the pure associates of the Lord. They are always in trance and so the queens also were in trance during the absence of the Lord from Dwarka. Presently, having seen the Lord from a distance, they at once gave up all their engagements including the vows as women described above.

**Key Quote:** "Although due to feminine shyness, there were many hindrances to embracing the dear husband, Lord Sri Krishna, the Queens performed that act by seeing him through the eyes."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains verses 32 of the 11th chapter of the 1st canto Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on the queens' devotion to Lord Krishna and their expressions of love upon his return.

In this session we will be discussing from the 32nd verse and the 33rd verse of the 11th chapter of the 1st canto Srimad Bhagavatam. The 32nd verse is as follows. The meaning of this verse is, So this is spoken by Suta Goswami. He is addressing the sages of Naimisharanya headed by Shaunaka, who is described here as Bruguvarya, chief amongst the Brugus. That's addressing Shaunaka Rishi, who is the chief of the Brugus. The explanation here is, the ecstasy they experienced as soon as they saw the Lord and their natural reaction was to embrace him. So first they embraced him within the innermost recesses of their hearts, and then they embraced him visually, and then they sent their sons to embrace him, which is equal to personally embracing him. Now after all this, they tried to restrain their feelings by not shedding tears, but they could not avoid that. They inadvertently shed tears. These are tears of joy on seeing their beloved Lord returned to the past. Those tears, impassioned with his love and respect. This is a very important case for the Lord. So, how can this be fair? You know, Shaunaka and his wife were inside a palace after a long period of absence. So, Srila Prabhupada explains this in the Purport. Although due to feminine shyness, there were many hindrances to embracing the dear husband, Lord Sri Krishna. The Queens performed that act by seeing him through the eyes, by putting him in the course of their hearts. As soon as they saw the impression of the Lord within the core of their heart, these were their instincts, and by sending their sons to embrace him, still the act remained unfinished and tears rolled down their cheeks despite all endeavors to check them. So Srila Prabhupada further explains here, one indirectly embraces the husband by sending the son to embrace him because the son is developed as part of the mother's body. The embrace of the son is not exactly the embrace of husband and wife from the sexual point of view, but the embrace is satisfaction from the affectionate point of view. The embrace of the eyes is more effective in the conjugal relation and thus according to Srila Jeeva Goswami there is nothing wrong in such an exchange of feeling between husband and wife. So this is the explanation

**Key Quote:** "In the material world no one is permanently fortunate however clever one may be."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains verse 33, highlighting the impermanence of material fortune and the importance of surrendering to the lotus feet of Krishna.

for the meeting of the queens with their husband Lord Krishna, the king of Dwarka. Then the next verse, the 33rd verse. The meaning of this 33rd verse is, although Lord Sri Krishna was constantly by their sides, as well as exclusively alone, His feet appeared to them to be newer and newer. The goddess of fortune, although by nature always restless and moving, could not quit the Lord's feet. So what woman can be detached from those feet having once taken shelter of them? So Srila Prabhupada explains this elaborately in the purport. The result of somebody completely surrendering to the Lord and taking shelter of his Lord's feet. What is the result of that? Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, conditioned living beings are always after the favour of the goddess of fortune, although by nature she is moving from one place to another. In this material world, everyone, all conditioned souls are living. It doesn't matter if you are saying that you are living or not, you are no longer living. It is youratura. They are in a state of existence where they have to seek anything and everything that they want, that they need. That is not the state of existence in the spiritual world, in the association of the Lord. In the spiritual world everything is in plenty and merely by desiring anyone can get whatever they need because there are desiraries to supply everything in the spiritual world. But that's not the case in the material world. In the material world there are material laws which are working, the laws of karma, and one has to work in order to even maintain oneself. So, such conditioned living beings, means those who are under the conditions of material nature, all the living beings within this material world who have come here for the sake of material enjoyment, independent material enjoyment, in forgetfulness of Krishna, they always seek the favor of the goddess of fortune. And the nature of the goddess of fortune is she keeps moving from one place to another. She is not fixed up except at the lotus feet of Krishna. And further Srila Prabhupada says, In the material world no one is permanently fortunate however clever one may be. Nobody is always fully fortunate, no. There have been so many big empires in different parts of the world. There have been so many powerful kings all over the world. And there have been so many fortunate men. But all of them have been liquidated gradually. Permanently nobody is having all the wealth or the power or the other kinds of fortunes. It's never permanent. This is the law of material nature.

**Key Quote:** "The spiritual relation with the Lord is so enlivening and resourceful that no one can leave the company of the Lord once having taken shelter of him."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami contrasts the material and spiritual worlds, emphasizing Krishna's eternal youthfulness and the eternal bliss of the spiritual realm, free from the influence of time and material modes.

As soon as the body is finished, everything is finished, connected with the body. But spiritually it is different. What is the difference? That is explained in the Brahma Samhita. According to Brahma Samhita, The Lord is served very respectfully by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune. The statement in the Brahma Samhita is, They are always in a lonely place also with the Lord, the goddess of fortune. But still the association with the Lord is so inspiringly newer and newer, that they cannot quit the Lord for a moment, even though they are by nature very restless and moving and are moving about. Another name for Lakshmi is Chanchala. She is restless. She always keeps moving around. But when it comes to the association of the Lord, particularly His lotus feet appear always newer and newer. That is the spiritual nature. And that is the special thing about the Lord. Adhyam purana purusham na va yauvanam ca. In the Brahma Samhita. Na va yauvanam. He is freshly youthful all the ways, even though he is the oldest personality. He is the youngest in the Brahma Samhita. He is the oldest personality. Purana purusham. Oldest personality. But his transcendental form never ages like this material forms. Never. And the form always appears freshly youthful. The spiritual relation with the Lord is so enlivening and resourceful that no one can leave the company of the Lord once having taken shelter of him. So that's why the scriptures are directing us. Take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. All your problems will be solved. No more any attraction will remain in the material world. Actually material world is not really attractive. It is a presentation of the illusory energy to bewilder the living entities who are desirous of independent enjoyment. It is just an interaction of the three gunas, producing a temporary appearance of some attractive features. But spiritual beauty, spiritual world is not at all conducted by the three material modes. There is no touch of matter there. There are no material modes. There is no destructive kala. The time factor is conspicuous by its absence in the spiritual world.

### surrender, potencies, enjoyment, devotion
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/kcyhwydg42Q?t=796

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So therefore Bhagavad Gita directs us surrender to the Lord, and in his association you will be able to satisfy your desires completely."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains the concept of living beings as feminine potencies of the Lord, emphasizing the importance of surrendering to Krishna for complete satisfaction and experiencing ecstasy through devotion.

So such a spiritual world Krishna is inviting all of us. The living beings are by constitution feminine by nature. Prakriti. That's the way they are designated or explained in the Bhagavad Gita. The male or enjoyer is the Lord, and all manifestations of his different potencies are feminine by nature. The Lord is only male, only Purusha, and all his potencies are prakriti, feminine. In the Bhagavad Gita the living beings are designated as paraprakriti. Apareyam itastu anyam prakritim vidhime param jivabhutam. The living beings are jivabhutam. They are param. Paraprakriti, or superior potency, spiritual potency. The material elements are aparaprakriti or inferior potency. They lack consciousness. Just like this table. This table doesn't have any consciousness. Any of the material items, objects, they don't have consciousness. Consciousness is only in the spiritual entities beginning with the living beings. Such potencies are always employed for the satisfaction of the employer or the enjoyer. All potencies are meant for the enjoyment of the Lord. He is the only enjoyer. He is the only Purusha. So therefore Bhagavad Gita directs us surrender to the Lord, and in his association you will be able to satisfy your desires completely. And that is what will be explained in the next few verses. How the devotees, they serve the Lord and seek and they are able to experience ecstasy, satisfaction, happiness, everything. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "He simply created hostility between the powerful administrators, and they fought amongst themselves."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse and explains how the Lord pacifies the earth by creating conflict among burdensome rulers.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udeerayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 34th verse of the 11th chapter of the 4th chapter of the 1st Chant of Srimad Bhagavatam. The meaning of this 34th looks as the Lord was pacified after killing those kings who were burdensome to the earth. They were puffed up with military strength, horses, elephants, chariots, infantry, etc. He himself was not a party in the fight. He simply created hostility between the powerful administrators, and they fought amongst themselves.

**Key Quote:** "I think every living being in this material world thinks I am an enjoyer."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's purport, discussing the illusion of being an enjoyer in the material world and the influence of Maya.

He was like the wind which causes friction between bamboos and so sparks a fire. So Sri La Pravapada explains in the purport, as stated above, the living beings are not factual enjoyers of things which are manifested as God's creation. The Lord is the genuine proprietor and enjoyer of everything manifested in this creation. Unfortunately, influenced by the deluding energy, the deluding energy means the energy which puts us in illusion, the material energy, Maya. The living being becomes a false enjoyer under the dictation of the modes of nature, the gunas, sattva guna, rajya guna, tamo guna, the influence creates an influence such that I think every living being in this material world thinks I am an enjoyer.

**Key Quote:** "You see, God is God, nobody else can become God."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how the false sense of becoming God leads to increasing material strength and becoming a burden on the earth, causing suffering for sane people.

And that is a false enjoyer, because it is explained why false enjoyer, puffed up, puffed up by such a false sense of becoming God. You see, God is God, nobody else can become God, but we try to become God. And what happens? The deluded living being increases material strength by so many activities, and thus becomes the burden of the earth, so much so that the earth becomes completely uninhabitable. By the same people. The earth is meant for all the living beings who are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but some people, they try to lord over others, and they become burdensome for the earth. That the sane people, the saintly people, the sober people, they find it difficult to live on the earth.

**Key Quote:** "This state of affairs is called dharmasya glani."
**Summary:** The speaker connects the situation to 'dharmasya glani' from the Bhagavad Gita, explaining how the Lord appears to save the saner section of humanity and alleviate the burden of vicious administrators.

This state of affairs is called dharmasya glani. This is the term that is used in Bhagavad Gita. Yada yadahi dharmasya glani bhavati bharata. The fourth chapter, Krishna describes this. Or dharmasya glani is also described by Prabhupada here as misuse of the energy of the human being. When such misuse of human energy is prominent, the saner living beings become poor. The saner living beings become perturbed by the awkward situation created by the vicious administrators who are simply burdens of the earth, and the Lord appears by his internal potency just to save the saner section of humanity and to alleviate the burden due to the earthly administrators in different parts of the world.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord comes to actually reduce this burden."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how demoniac kings exploit others, and the Lord reduces this burden by creating hostility among them, similar to a forest fire caused by bamboo friction.

The Lord comes to reduce the burden of these vicious administrators, these demoniac natured kings who are not properly ruling. They simply amass wealth and power and exploit the weaker sections of society, or exploit the saintly people, or exploit the common people. The Lord comes to actually reduce this burden by eliminating. Eliminating means the Lord actually purifies them by killing them. He purifies them, or he delivers them, or he liberates them. Now the Supreme Lord does not favor either of the unwanted administrators, but by his potential power, he creates hostility between such unwanted administrators, as the air creates fire in the forest by the friction of the bamboos.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Air is blowing. And the friction between two bamboos. That creates a spark."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the analogy of the forest fire, explaining how the Lord creates friction between demons, leading to their self-destruction.

Now here specifically the reference is made where the Lord does not himself involve in killing. He just creates friction between the demons, and they kill each other. And the example is given, just like in a forest, air is blowing, and the friction between two bamboos, and the friction between two trees, that creates a spark, and dry bamboo catches fire, and the forest fire destroys the whole bamboo forest. Similarly, even the friction between the demons, they fight each other, and they kill each other. Now Srila Prabhupada explaining the example given, the fire in the forest takes place automatically by the force of the air, and similarly, that means nobody goes to set fire. No human being is required to set fire in a forest. The forest fire takes place, the air creating friction between the bamboos, creating a spark, and the spark ignites a fire, dry bamboo catches fire, and it spreads.

**Key Quote:** "The hostility between different groups of politicians takes place. By the unseen design of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker connects the forest fire analogy to political conflicts, stating that they occur by the Lord's design, and only devotees are saved from false prestige.

Similarly, the hostility between different groups of politicians takes place by the unseen design of the Lord. The unwanted administrators, puffed up by false power and military strength, thus become engaged in fighting amongst themselves over ideological conflicts and so exhaust themselves of all powers. They will kill each other because they cannot tolerate different ideologies. Each one has his own ideology. Nobody follows the ideal Supreme Lord. That is the nature of demoniac quality people. The history of the world reflects this factual will of the Lord, and it will continue to be enacted until the living beings are attached to the service of the Lord. Those who become devotees, they are saved from this false prestige.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the futility of seeking material power, stating that those who do so are punished by the laws of nature and are bound to reincarnation.

Falsely declaring themselves to be God, falsely possessing power, which is not going to last, thinking that they are forever going to remain powerful. So till they become wise, they are going to keep on taking birth again and again, and every birth, they simply try to lord over, and they try to exploit others, and they are punished by the laws of nature appropriately. They cannot escape punishment.

**Key Quote:** "Daivi Hesha Gunamayi Mamamaya Duratyaya."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Bhagavad Gita 7.14, explaining that the deluding energy is difficult to overcome, but those who surrender to Krishna can cross the ocean of material existence.

Perfect justice is there in nature. In the Bhagavad Gita, this fact is very vividly described in the 7th chapter 14th verse, Daivi Hesha Gunamayi Mamamaya Duratyaya. The deluding energy is my potency, Mamamaya, and thus it is not possible for the dependent living beings to supersede the strength of the material modes, Duratyaya. It is not possible to supersede, but those who take shelter in me, Krishna is speaking these words, Mam evaye prapadyante. Those who take shelter in Krishna, they can cross over the gigantic ocean of material energy, Maya metam tarantite. The gigantic ocean of material existence, they are very easily able to cross it.

**Key Quote:** "Independent. Attempts at establishing peace in this world. Are never going to be successful."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that peace and prosperity cannot be achieved through fruitive activities or speculation, but only through surrender to the Supreme Lord.

This means that no one can establish peace and prosperity in the world by fruitive activities or by speculative philosophy or ideology. Independent attempts at establishing peace in this world are never going to be successful as long as people don't surrender to the Supreme Lord and follow the Lord's directions for establishing peace, for themselves becoming peaceful, and for bringing about peace in the entire world. Is never possible by human efforts, by people's speculation, by having their own ideologies. It's never going to work. The only way is to surrender unto the Supreme Lord and thus become free from the illusion of the deluding energy, this material energy which is acting, influencing, bewildering all the living beings. That influence one has to overcome by surrender to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Unfortunately persons who are engaged. In destructive work. Are unable to surrender to the personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Bhagavad Gita 7.15, explaining that those engaged in destructive work, the lowest of mankind, sinful, atheistic, and materialistic individuals, are unable to surrender to the Lord.

There is no other way. So Prabhupada Srila Prabhupada further explains, unfortunately persons who are engaged in destructive work are unable to surrender to the personality of Godhead. This is the 15th verse of the 7th chapter, Namaham duskruti no mudha. Duskruti naha means engaged in vicious activities, destructive work. That's their nature, demonic nature people, or those who are lowest of mankind, those who are sinful, those who are atheistic, those who are materialistic, they are unable to surrender to the Lord. They are all now four categories. Krishna has described in the Bhagavad Gita. Prabhupada is quoting that Bhagavad Gita verse, the 15th verse of the 7th chapter. They are all fools of the first order.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "They are all fools of the first order."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the four categories of people who cannot surrender to Krishna: fools, the lowest of mankind, those robbed of knowledge, and those with a demoniac mentality who challenge God.

Mudha. Mudha means they are compared to ass, donkey. And the second category, they are the lowest of the human species of life, Narathama, the lowest of mankind. The third category are the people who are Mayaya Apahrutagyana. They are robbed of their knowledge, although apparently they seem to be academically educated, Apahrutagyana Mayaya. By the material energy, illusory energy, their knowledge is stolen away. Though they have accumulated knowledge, they have studied, or they have academic achievements, all that knowledge is lost by the influence of maya. And the last category of these Dushkrutina, they are all of the demoniac mentality, Asurambhavamashrita, always challenging the supreme power of the Lord. They never surrender to Krishna. They always want to challenge. If there is God, I will defeat him, I will kill him, I will finish him off. I am powerful. I am supremely powerful.

**Key Quote:** "They only think in terms of body. And the. Material. Energy."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that those who hanker after material power are fools because they are ignorant of the living energy and spiritual science, and they cannot understand spirit without surrendering to Krishna.

This is their mentality. Those who are very materialistic, always hankering after material power and strength, are undoubtedly fools of the first order. They think that this material world, there is no controller, so let us take charge, let us take control. We will become powerful and defeat all the fellow humans and then control of the entire world. This is their plan, but they are fools. Why? Because they have no information of the living energy. They only think in terms of body and the material energy, and they are also ignorant of the supreme spiritual science. They are absorbed in material science. The end of the material body. Material science is like that. It has no understanding of what is spirit. They don't have understanding of the supreme spirit, individual spirit. They have no understanding of spirit at all, and neither they can really understand if they don't surrender to Krishna, if they don't take devotion and service. This will always remain unknown to them, and they will be always deluded by the material. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Here is a warning given by Suta Goswami that the Lord's pastimes especially with his queens with his with the gopis appears like he is a mundane personality ordinary person appears like he is overpowered by their attractive features but actually He is Eternally the controller the Master, the enjoyer, the Lord"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's pastimes may appear mundane but are actually transcendental, warning against misunderstanding the Lord's nature.

Here is a warning given by Suta Goswami that the Lord's pastimes, especially with his queens, with the gopis, appears like he is a mundane personality, an ordinary person. It appears like he is overpowered by their attractive features, but actually He is eternally the controller, the Master, the enjoyer, the Lord, the controller. Eternally always. The energies of his are always under him, whereas we become overpowered by another energy when we try to lord over. So there is a very big difference between ourselves and the Supreme Lord, though when he incarnates, he looks like one of the created beings. He looks like that he is not. That will be elaborately explained with Prabhupada here. In the purport, Prabhupada says, "The Lord married and lived like a householder. This is certainly like a mundane affair."

**Key Quote:** "Krishna can expand himself into any number of forms millions billions trillions unlimited number of forms he can expand that is Krishna"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Krishna's unique ability to expand himself into unlimited forms, contrasting it with the limited powers of yogis.

Like a materialistic person, an ordinary person, a person of this world. But when we learn that he married 16,108 wives and lived with them separately in each and every palace, certainly it is not mundane. There is no history of any person of this world marrying 16,108 princesses, never. That's not possible. And not only that Krishna married so many, but he lived with each of them separately in a separate palace. He expanded himself. That's also explained by Srila Prabhupada that a yogi can expand himself by power acquired mystic power into ten forms at most, but Krishna can expand himself into any number of forms, millions, billions, trillions, unlimited.

**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that Krishna's relationships with his wives are based on pure, transcendental love, not mundane sex attraction, and that they are not ordinary women.

Number of forms he can expand. That is Krishna. Therefore, the Lord living as a householder amongst his competent wives is never mundane, and his behavior with them is never to be understood as mundane sex relation. This material world, everyone is driven by sex attraction, especially the male and female attraction is based on sex relationship, but the relationship of the Lord is based on pure love, and that love is free from all material characteristics or material traits. It is completely free from material characteristics or material from sex, sex contamination, or tinge of sex, sexual attraction. It is free from all that. The women who became the wives of the Lord are certainly not ordinary women because to get the Lord as one's husband is the result of many, many millions of births tapasya because to get the Lord as one's husband is the result of many, many millions of births tapasya, austerity. Who can become the wife of the Supreme Lord or for that

**Summary:** The speaker explains the necessity of purification through austerity (tapasya) to approach and understand the Supreme Lord, emphasizing that materially conditioned souls lack spiritual vision.

austerity? Who can become the wife of the Supreme Lord or, for that matter, the friend of Krishna? This is, these are all, the friend of Krishna. This is, these are all very accurately explained in the, very accurately explained in the Bhagavata, very accurately this explained. They perform millions of lifetimes of tapasya, and they become, they perform millions of lifetimes of tapasya, and they become completely purified of all material, completely purified of all material contamination. If there was in and without contamination, if there was in and without such tapasya, it's not possible to, such tapasya it's not possible to purify oneself, and without purification, one, purify oneself, and without purification, one can't even approach the Supreme Lord, can't even approach the Supreme Lord. One can't even see the Supreme Lord, what to, one can't even see the Supreme Lord, what to speak of approaching him. One can't speak of approaching him. One can't even see him. One cannot even know him. One cannot even know him. So he remains unknown to all materially conditioned souls, though when he incarnates, they are able to see him, but that seeing is not the spiritual vision by which they can see the spiritual form and understand the spiritual nature of the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker describes how Krishna displays his transcendental pastimes to attract conditioned souls and re-establish their eternal relationships with him.

They cannot. They think he is another person of this world, but that is completely wrong understanding. When the Lord appears on different lokas or planets or on this planet of human beings, he displays his transcendental pastimes just to attract the conditioned souls to become his eternal servitors, friends, parents, and lovers respectively in the transcendental world. Each one of us, we have got a relationship with Krishna, a relationship of pureness, pure love, spiritual love. Now love is a word not to be mistaken with loving relationships in this material world. Material world or relationships are based on the body, on matter, on material qualities. A relationship with the Lord is based completely on spiritual attributes. The Lord is completely spiritual. We are also pure spirit souls, Irtundas.

So when we become purified of all material contamination, then our actual spiritual form, spiritual identity is revealed. And in that spiritual identity, we can approach the Lord and actually reestablish the forgotten relationship, the spiritual relationship of spiritual love. That is what is being described here. In the spiritual world, the Lord eternally reciprocates such exchanges of service. He's got millions and billions of devotees in his personal abode, and he's constantly engaged in pastimes with them. Everything else is taken care by Krishna's own Yogamaya potency. In the spiritual world, nobody has to work. Nobody has to do anything to maintain themselves. They're simply engaged in a devotional service of Krishna, and they are enjoying rendering such service because the Lord reciprocates.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's pastimes are meant to attract us to the spiritual world, but materialistic people foolishly misunderstand them and try to imitate Krishna's activities.

And then they experience ecstasy. That will be explained in great detail in the 10th canto. Here just a mention is being made because Krishna has reached Dwaraka. So when he comes to this world, the Lord displays his pastimes which are going on in the spiritual world, and he wants to attract us. You can also enjoy with me like all these devotees of mine are enjoying with me. That's what Krishna's message is.

who fail to understand the real nature of Krishna's personality, which is revealed in the Bhagavatam and the Bhagavad Gita and all the Vedic scriptures. It is clearly revealed. Now as regards service in the material world, Prabhupada says, "Service is pervertedly represented in the material world and broken untimely, resulting in sad experiences." We may establish a nice relationship with another person of this world, but it is broken when the body is finished. This body, material body is temporary, and the relationship lasts only as long as the body is there. When the body is finished, relationship is finished. The illusion living being conditioned by material nature cannot understand out of ignorance that all our relations here in the mundane world are temporary and full of inebriates. Inebriate means defects. Everything here is defective. Material relationships are defective, and they are also temporary. They don't last because the body itself is temporary.

**Key Quote:** "Material presentation by maya, we consider that as permanent, as eternal. It is actually temporal. And it is based on the fact that we are in a state of ignorance."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that material relationships are based on ignorance and illusion (maya), offering only temporary happiness, while a relationship with Krishna leads to permanent happiness in the transcendental world.

So relationships based on body will be temporary, and it is temporary. It is a state of ignorance. As long as we are materially conditioned, we are in ignorance that we cannot understand the effect of the illusion. We think whatever we are perceiving is reality. Material presentation by maya, we consider that as permanent, as eternal. It is actually temporal, and it is based on the fact that we are in a state of ignorance, and it is based on the actions and reactions of the three gunas. It is not a factual reality. What is presented, what appears like real but is not real. Such relations means these material relations cannot help us be happy perpetually. Some temporary happiness may be there in such material relations, but it cannot give us permanent happiness. If the same relation is established with the Lord, then we are transferred to the transcendental world after leaving this material body. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita.

**Key Quote:** "If we establish our relationship with Krishna, then we desire each one of the devotees in the spiritual would have their own relationship with Krishna so therefore the women amongst whom Krishna lived as their husband are not therefore women of this mundane world but are eternally related with him as transcendental wives"
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the importance of establishing a relationship with Krishna through devotional service, emphasizing that Krishna's wives are transcendental beings who have attained their position through bhakti.

This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita. If we establish our relationship with Krishna, then we desire each one of the devotees in the spiritual world have their own relationship with Krishna. So therefore, the women amongst whom Krishna lived as their husband are not therefore women of this mundane world but are eternally related with him as transcendental wives. See, that adjective transcendental is used. They are transcendental wives of Krishna, a position they attained by perfection of devotional service. Only by devotional service is possible. Bhakti amam abhijanati. Only by bhakti, and that bhakti also progresses in different stages of development. So there is a stage of perfection where one is firmly established in their relationship with Krishna. That is their competency because the verse says he enjoyed with competent women. What is their competency? They have perfected their devotional service and established a relationship as the wives of Krishna. So if we carefully understand this, we can give up this false attempt at trying to enjoy material, material, and re-establish our forgotten relationship with Krishna and

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam describing Krishna's unagitated state despite the beauty and allure of his queens.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 36th verse of the 11th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is the section which describes Krishna's relationship with his queens, and Suta Goswami clarifies a very, very important point in this connection. The verse is as follows. The meaning of this verse is: Although the queen's beautiful smiles and furtive glances were all spotless and exciting, and although they could conquer Cupid himself by making him give up his bow in frustration, and although even the tolerant Shiva could fall victim to them, still, despite all their magical feats and attractions, they could not agitate the senses of the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "What is the spiritual nature of the Lord? He is un-agitated by their association Even though they are very very beautiful."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the transcendental qualities of Krishna, emphasizing his detachment even from the most attractive features, contrasting this with the influence of Cupid and even Lord Shiva.

Now, Suta Goswami is describing the transcendental quality of the soul, of the Supreme Lord in his association with his 16,108 queens. What is the spiritual nature of the Lord? He is un-agitated by their association, even though they are very, very beautiful. They have beautiful smiles. They have very, very attractive glances. They can conquer Cupid himself. Cupid generally agitates the mind of materialistic people in this world to get attracted to material beauty, but Cupid himself becomes attracted by the beauty of these queens. And the Lord Shiva is known as a Dheera, but even Lord Shiva, He may fall victim to the attraction of the queens, but the queens can never agitate the senses of the Supreme Lord, which means that why did Upanishad interact with the queens as if he was engaged in a mundane love affair?

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Srila Prabhupada's explanation regarding the path of liberation and the restrictions on association with women in various ashramas, raising the question of Krishna's association with 16,000 queens.

That is because of their devotion that we explained in the later verse. So here it is just stated by Suta Goswami that they could not agitate the senses of the Lord. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, the path of salvation, that means the path of liberation from this material bondage, are a path going back to Godhead always forbids the association of women, and a complete Sanatana Dharma or Vanashrama Dharma scheme forbids or restricts association of women. Srila Prabhupada explains elsewhere three of the four ashramas completely forbid association with women: brahmachari ashram, vanaprastha ashram, and sannyas ashram, no association of women. Only in the Grihastha ashrama there is permission to associate with women, that also under highly restricted conditions, only with one wife, and that also for the sake of producing Krishna conscious children and becoming responsible, raising children and becoming responsible, raising a Krishna conscious family. All these are there, Grihastha ashrama, Grihastha Dharma. So Prabhupada raises this question, how then can one be accepted of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is addicted to more than 16,000 wives? Krishna seemed to be very much attached to those Queens, and He is one person, and He has 16,108 Queens and is attached to them, so what is the proper understanding? This question may relevantly be raised by inquisitive persons really anxious to know about the transcendental nature of the Supreme

**Summary:** The speaker explains the difference between Krishna and ordinary beings, focusing on how Krishna is not conquered by Cupid's influence, and how male-female attraction leads to material bondage.

Lord. And to answer such questions, the sages at Nainbi Sharanya have discussed the transcendental character of the Lord in this and in the following verses. What is that transcendental nature of Krishna different from the nature of people of this world? How is it different? So Srila Prabhupada further says, it is clear herein that the feminine attractive features which can conquer Cupid or even the supermost tolerant Lord Shiva could not conquer the senses of the Lord. Here is the difference, the distinct difference between Krishna and everyone else. Cupid's business is to invoke mundane lust. Mundane lust means his material lust. Material lust means materially attractive, material lust means material lust. Flute 아주 is the spirit with which the want of банal lust in spiritual earth is manifested. Extract love and karmically flow in the world instead of the lust. Tambad iramthis great 스ırहामि revenues from the the activities of the world are being carried on by the central attraction of male and female that is the central point of material existence a male is searching after a mate to his liking and the female is looking after a suitable male that is the way of material stimulus and as soon as a male is combined with a female the material bondage of the living being is at once tightly interlocked by sex relation and as a result of this both the males and females attraction for sweet home motherland bodily offspring wealth becomes the illusory

**Key Quote:** "Material existence means miseries under illusion we cannot understand that we always think miseries are now and then coming and going that's what we think but actually we are always in the middle of miseries"
**Summary:** The speaker describes how family life and material pursuits create an illusory field of activities, emphasizing that material existence is inherently full of miseries, using the analogy of climatic conditions.

field of activities. A whole field of activities opens up. Man and woman marriage each other, and then the family expands, children and relation and relatives and friends and home and wealth and accumulation of wealth, a society, friendship, community, all these things become the illusory field of activities, and thus a false but indefatigable attraction for a temporary material existence which is full of miseries is manifest. See, material existence means miseries. Under illusion, we cannot understand that. We always think miseries are now and then coming and going, that's what we think, but actually we are always in the middle of miseries. Sometimes these miseries are overlooked, we are not cognizant of them, or it doesn't bother us as much as it may bother somebody else. Just like the climatic conditions are related for some people. A cold weather is very much related to the situation of the world. Some Ontarians say that the cold weather is pleasant for the people who are in the cold weather, and they dislike the cold weather because the body, the body is pleasant for them because their body somehow they have made it acclimatized to the cold weather by generating lot of heat within, and they like this cold weather, but in summer they just can't tolerate even a little bit of heat, they cannot tolerate. And then the other people are not tolerant of them, so that's a concept. Whose body is very warm, they are not so uncomfortable in summer, but in winter they can't tolerate little cold also. The fact is this is told by one Acharya Govinda Das Kaviraj. We are always harassed by four different material conditions, climatic conditions: Sheetha means cold, Vata. Sheetha-Atapa means heat and Vata means wind and varisolana-the rain.

**Key Quote:** "Those who are therefore on the path of salvation for going back home back to Godhead are especially advised by all scriptural instructions to become free from the bondage of the world"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the struggle for existence and the path to salvation, emphasizing the need to become free from material attraction through the association of devotees.

Cold, heat, wind, and rain, these are sometimes there in different times of the year, and they always bother us. One or the other botheration is there, but we are so determined to enjoy that we'll somehow make adjustment and try to live amid such conditions, unfavorable conditions, and try to create a favorable atmosphere by adjustment. This called material advancement of civilization, but the scriptures warn us and awaken us to the reality. It is temporary, and you are simply engaged in a hard struggle for existence. So those who are therefore on the path of salvation for going back home, back to Godhead, are especially advised by all scriptural instructions to become free from the bondage of the world and become free from the bondage of the world and from such paraphernalia of material attraction because material attraction makes us forget the reality. We go deeper into illusion because of material attraction between male and female, and how is this possible to become free from this paraphernalia of material attraction? It is possible only by association of the devotees of the Lord, were called Mahatmas...Mahar Manas Tummampartha Day目. The Mahatmas are the pure devotees, they are always under the shelter of the internal potency of the Lord, the spiritual potency, and they are always engaged in devotional service, and such Mahatmas association will help us to become free from material attraction. Now Prabhupada explains elaborately that this material world is such that Cupid's work is going on to keep the living entities under material bondage, but association of devotees helps us to come out of this material bondage by losing attraction for all material things, by developing spiritual attraction to come out of this bondage. Krishna, it is not done in a void. It is possible by positive spiritual attraction, and that positive spiritual attraction is by association of pure devotees, association of pure devotees.

So it is described here, just like the Lord is transcendentally situated because of which he is never agitated. He is never agitated by any feminine attractive features. Similarly, if we situate ourselves on the spiritual platform, all material attraction will be nullified, attractions will be nullified completely, and we get attracted to Krishna, which is desirable, which is most desirable, which is the best, the safest, and the topmost position of perfection for any living being to get attracted to Krishna and to become attached to Krishna, to become connected with Krishna in eternal relationship of love. That is the goal. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "But actually Krishna is only reciprocal."
**Summary:** This segment introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains that Krishna's dealings, even those that appear ordinary, are a display of his reciprocity with his devotees while maintaining his supreme position.

In this session we will be discussing from the thirty-seventh verse of the eleventh chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: tam ayam manyate loko yasangam api sanginam atmaupamyena manujam vyapruvanam yato abudhaha. The meaning of this verse is, the common materialistic conditioned souls speculate that the Lord is one of them. Out of their ignorance they think that the Lord is affected by matter, although he is unattached. These are words spoken by Srila Suta Goswami. He is speaking to the sages of Naimisharanya. He is describing the Lord. He is describing the transcendental position of the Supreme Lord Krishna. To a common person it may appear like Krishna is an ordinary man because his dealings look like, his dealings with his queens in Dwaraka appears like he is a henpecked husband. But actually Krishna is only reciprocal. He is reciprocating with them because they are his devotees. And he is only attracted by their devotional service. And accordingly Krishna responds with every devotee, every pure devotee. And even while reciprocating with his devotees, even though he may appear to take a subordinate position, his supreme position remains unaffected, because he is the Lord eternally, always, under all circumstances, in all times, at all places, in every situation, in his dealings with everyone.

**Key Quote:** "Due to ignorance only, the foolish mundane wranglers misunderstand the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** This segment focuses on Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the verse, highlighting the term 'abudhaha' (foolish) and describing 'mundane wranglers' who misunderstand and spread misinformation about God.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains this verse in the purport. The word abudhaha is significant here. Abudhaha means foolish because of ignorance. Due to ignorance only, the foolish mundane wranglers misunderstand the Supreme Lord. Srila Prabhupada uses this term, mundane wranglers. Mundane means somebody who is of this material world, is completely covered by ignorance due to the influence of the material nature. Such a person is called a mundane person. And wrangler means one who simply picks up quarrel for even trivial reasons. One is always trying to pick up a dispute. So, these foolish mundane wranglers are those who are always trying to find fault with God, Krishna, incarnations, spiritual persons, transcendentalists. And they themselves are actually very, very materialistic. So, they can never accept that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person. At the most, they may agree to accept some transcendental reality which is impersonal at the most, but even that they do not properly understand. So, Srila Prabhupada says here, the foolish mundane wranglers misunderstand the Supreme Lord. It's always the case with such people. Not only they misunderstand, they spread their foolish imaginations amongst innocent persons by propaganda. They are also engaged in propaganda, that God is impersonal or God does not exist or everyone is God, or God is ordinary person like that. The Supreme Lord Sri Krishna is the original primeval personality of Godhead.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes Krishna's divine potency, using the examples of lifting Govardhan Hill and subduing Kaliya to illustrate his unlimited power and how every action of Krishna is full of this potency.

Primeval means he is the original person. And when he was personally present before the eyes of everyone, he displayed full-fledged divine potency in every field of activities. Now, if you carefully analyze every action of Sri Krishna, as described in the authentic scriptures, you will definitely find his divine potency working. Otherwise, how is it possible for a seven-year-old boy to lift Govardhan hill on his little left finger and hold it for seven days and nights continuously against a torrential rain, devastating rainfall sent by Indra? How is it possible? Only because he is unlimitedly powerful. That's the only explanation that can be given. Or he subdued that huge, powerful serpent Kalia who had 101 hoods and was very poisonous, spewing poison in the entire area of Yamuna lake. How could he subdue that Kalia? It's only because he is unlimitedly powerful. He is a supreme person. So, every action of Krishna is full of his divine potency.

**Summary:** This segment contrasts Krishna's activities with ordinary activities, explaining that Krishna's actions are characterized by bliss, knowledge, and eternity, and are performed on the transcendental platform.

And therefore, he is the Lord under all circumstances. As we have already explained in the first verse of Srimad Bhagavatam, he is completely independent to act however he likes. But all his actions are full of bliss, knowledge and eternity. This is the difference between Krishna's activities and our activities. He may appear like an ordinary person, but his actions are full of bliss. It gives pleasure to him and his devotees, always, every action. So, that is the characteristic difference in the quality of the activity, the nature of the activity. And his activities are full of knowledge. Nothing is ignorance. Nothing is done ignorantly by Krishna, and eternity. Everything is on the spiritual platform, on the transcendental platform. Only the foolish mundaners misunderstand him, unaware of his eternal form of knowledge and bliss. Foolish mundaners. These foolish materialistic people. They don't understand Krishna's personality. Why? Because they don't want to understand. They simply want to deny God. Now, the nature of Krishna's personality as eternal form of knowledge and bliss

Plenty of evidence is there in the scriptures about Krishna's personality. His different potencies work in a perfect plan of natural sequence. Parasthi Shaktir Vividhaiva Shuyate Swabhaviki Gyanabhila Kriyacha. All his energies are working exactly according to his will. He doesn't have to do anything. Then what are his activities meant for? It's simply meant for his pleasure pastimes. That's all. He doesn't have to do anything for the sake of maintaining this world or for the sake of controlling any particular thing. He doesn't have to do because his energies work according to his will. Sathya Sankalpa. Another name for Krishna. He wills and things are carried out by his subordinate energies, who are always engaged in serving.

His desires. And there is a perfect plan of natural sequence, in this material world particularly. Everything is happening sequentially, very naturally, and according to a certain plan. Kala, Karma, Guna. So that is perfectly arranged by Krishna, that the seasons are changing, the sun is rising, the time is passing by, and systematically creation, maintenance, destruction is happening, and all the natural laws are working. Laws of nature are working perfectly. Every condition soars. Every soul is taking birth according to their karma, in course of time. Changes are happening. Krishna doesn't have to involve himself in details. The details are already coded into the material nature. That is Krishna's wonderful creation, that the foolish scientists will never understand, because they cannot decode that, because nature is working. They have their theories. Krishna is doing everything by the agency of his different potencies, while he remains eternally the supreme independent. He is aloof from everything, because he is engaged in his pleasure pastimes with his devotees.

**Summary:** This segment explains the difference between Krishna's internal and external potencies, emphasizing that Krishna descends by his internal potency and is unaffected by the material modes of nature (nirguna).

When he descends from the material world by his causeless mercy, to different living beings. When he descends from the material world by his own potency. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says, I appear by my internal potency. What is the difference between internal potency and external potency? External potency is the material energy under which we are all placed, due to which we are in illusion. But Krishna does not come by the agency of the material energy, or illusory energy or external potency. He uses his internal potency or spiritual energy for all his activities, for his incarnation, for his appearance, for his activities, everything. He uses his internal potency. He is not subject to the conditions of the material modes of nature. We are all affected by something. Sattva guna, raja guna, tamo guna, always acting on us. But Krishna is completely aloof from these three gunas, even when he is in the material world. Nirguna. He is called nirguna.

**Summary:** This segment addresses the misunderstandings of mental speculators (mayavadis) regarding the impersonal Brahman feature and emphasizes that the correct understanding of Krishna can only be obtained from pure devotees through the parampara system.

Unaffected by material nature. The mental speculators misunderstand him as the supreme person, and they consider his impersonal features as inexplicable, Brahman to be all. The mental speculators are the mayavadis. They always speculate. They don't take the scriptural statements to be fact. They misunderstand the scriptural statements, and they always argue that the impersonal feature is the highest truth. Whereas in the Bhagavad Gita, Brahmano hi pratishtaham. It is clearly explained that the Brahman feature or the impersonal feature is subordinate to the supreme personality of Godhead. Yesya prabha prabhavato jagalanda koti. In the Brahmasamhita it is explained. The Brahman feature is the effulgence of the body of the transcendental form of Krishna. Very clearly it is explained everywhere. In the Vedanta Sutra also it is explained like that. So this. The correct understanding can only get from pure devotees, from the parampara system, from the proper explanation of the Vedic literature, given by the acharyas, Vaishnava acharyas. Only then you can understand. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "The Supreme Lord, Krishna, is transcendental only, nirguna, nirguna this word is used."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the Vedas, Shruti, and Smriti, emphasizing the transcendental nature of Krishna and citing confirmations from various scriptures and Acharya Shankara.

So Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport. In the Vedas and Vedic literatures, Shruti and Smriti—Shruti is the portion of the Vedas which is coming down through the oral tradition from the beginning of creation, whatever was revealed to Brahma by the Supreme Lord within the heart of Brahma, Tene Brahma Hrudaya Adhikavaye. The original Vedas and Smriti is the corollary literature in pursuance of the Vedas. The Vedas explained by saintly persons, great acharyas, great rishis, for understanding of the common people. The Smriti literature means the Upuranas, the Itihasas, Dharmashastras, like that. So all of them affirm that in the divinity there is nothing material. The Supreme Lord, Krishna, is transcendental only, nirguna. Nirguna, this word is used. The Supreme cognisant is always cognisant, is always full of consciousness and is supremely conscious person. Hari or the personality of God had a supreme transcendental person beyond the range of material affection. Hari nirgunasakshaa. This is the statement in the Bhagavad Gita, in the 10th canto. Hari, the supreme personality of Godhead, is a supreme transcendental person situated beyond the range of material affection.

### Krishna's Activities, Material Nature, Divinity

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So why should Vasudeva be afraid or why should Krishna be afraid?"
**Summary:** The speaker addresses potential doubts about Krishna's interactions with the material world, such as his birth in the Yadu dynasty and his killing of asuras, questioning why these actions appear to be influenced by material nature.

These statements are confirmed even by Acharya Shankara. Shankaracharya says, Narayana paro avyaktat. So he admits, Narayana, the supreme personality of Godhead is beyond this manifested and unmanifested matter. One may argue that his relation with the goddess of fortune may be transcendental. But what about his relation with the Yadu dynasty being born in that family? Or is killing the non-believers like Jarasandha and other asuras directly in contact with the modes of material nature? Because Lakshmi is situated transcendentally. People may consider his relationship with Lakshmi to be also transcendental. But what about Krishna taking birth in the Yadu dynasty as the son of Vasudeva and Devaki while they were imprisoned? And as if Vasudeva and Devaki are afraid that Kamsa will kill this newborn child, Vasudeva takes that newborn child and hides him in Gokula, Vasudeva under the care of Yashoda and Nanda. It appears like Krishna is afraid or Vasudeva is afraid of Kamsa killing the child. So why should Vasudeva be afraid or why should Krishna be afraid? Because Krishna only directed Vasudeva, take me to Gokula. So why did Krishna do so? Therefore, his taking birth in the Yadu dynasty as the son of Vasudeva and Devaki under very very peculiar circumstances or his killing the non-believers like Jarasandha and other asuras directly in contact with the modes of nature. This Jarasandha and all these asuras, they are completely entrenched in the three gunas and they are killed by Krishna as if Krishna had no other means of subduing these people.

**Key Quote:** "That is the affirmation in these words. prakṛtiṣṭhopi tad gunaihi na yujyate"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's divinity is never in contact with the qualities of material nature, as he is the ultimate source and controller of everything.

So the answer is, Prabhupada gives the answer, that divinity of the personality of Godhead is never in contact with the qualities of material nature in any circumstances. That is the affirmation in these words: prakṛtiṣṭhopi tad gunaihi na yujyate. He is in contact, appears to be in contact, but he is aloof, never in contact. Actually, he is in contact with such qualities because he is the ultimate source of everything. ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo janmadyasya yatah. Everything has ultimately got its source in Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the ultimate source of everything. So he is the source of the three gunas also. They are his energies. They are working according to his control and direction and his will. So, he being the controller, he will never come under the control of the materials. He will never come under the control of the material modes of nature.

### Yogeshwara, Mystic Powers, Krishna's Supremacy

**Key Quote:** "Yogeshwara means he is the master of mystic power, or in other words, the all-powerful."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's position as Yogeshwara, the master of all mystic powers, contrasting it with the limited powers of ordinary yogis and highlighting Krishna's unlimited siddhis.

Please understand this point. He being the supreme controller always, eternally, why will he come under the control of material nature? He is known, therefore, as Yogeshwara. In the Bhagavad Gita, yatra yogeshwara krishnao yatra pārthodhanuddharah. Yogeshwara means he is the master of mystic power, or in other words, the all-powerful. A yogi in this material world, after practicing severe austerities, may get ashta siddhi, eight kinds of mystic powers, which will bewilder even the greatest of human beings. Everybody can be bewildered by the ashta siddhi displayed by some powerful yogis, perfect yogis. But Krishna is Yogeshwara, the master of all these yogis. And he only awards that ashta siddhi to the yogis. He has unlimited siddhis. Krishna has unlimited siddhis. A yogi can only have eight siddhis. Of course, eight major and eight minor. They have different kinds of siddhis. But maximum, eight major siddhis and eight minor siddhis, and four auxiliary siddhis. This is explained in detail in the eleventh canto of the Bhagavad Gita. But Krishna personally has unlimited mystic powers. So we cannot even imagine what are the kinds of mystic powers Krishna has. Just like a yogi, to give an example. A yogi can expand into eight forms, at the most, ten forms. Krishna expanded into 16,108 forms when he married 16,108 princesses and was living with them in 16,100 palaces. So that is Krishna, Yogeshwara.

### Devotees, Transcendence, Goswamis of Vrindavan

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Even his pure devotees are unaffected by material kunas."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's devotees are also unaffected by material qualities, using the example of the six Goswamis of Vrindavan who renounced material opulence for devotional service.

Please understand this point. And Krishna's devotees, learned devotees are not affected by the influence of material mounts. What is being of Krishna? Even his pure devotees are unaffected by material gunas. The example is given. The great six Goswamis of Vrindavan, the direct disciples of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who were in Vrindavan, living in a very austere condition, for doing devotional work, according to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's directions. They all came from greatly rich and aristocratic families. But when they adopted the life of mendicants of Vrindavan, superficially they appeared to be in a wretched condition of life. But factually, they were the richest of all in spiritual values. The Goswamis, the six Goswamis of Vrindavan, tyaktva, toornam, ashesha, mandala, pati, srenim, sada, tuchchavat. They gave up all aristocracy and all material opulences. And they adopted the renounced order, Goswamis. And they were living like beggars, just begging for a little food. Little food, not much. And from whom? From the devotees, from the brajavasis, little food. And then doing the work of writing extensively the scriptures, preparing the scriptures for us, for common people, explaining the transcendental subject matter. And then they were engaged in excavating lost places in Vrindavan. And they were engaged in preaching Krishna consciousness. They were engaged in chanting, performing Sankirtana, showing by their example how we should do. So, such Mahabhagavatas, or first great devotees, all the moving amongst men are not contaminated by honour, insult, hunger or satisfaction, sleep or wakefulness, which are all resultant actions of the three modes of material nature. So, we can understand how they are unaffected by the three gunas when we see their behaviour. They don't care for any honour. Somebody praises them, they are not elated. And somebody insults them, they don't feel hurt.

**Key Quote:** "So, there is a test you can apply to actually understand whether somebody is actually transcendently situated or not."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how to recognize someone who is truly situated in transcendence, emphasizing that it's not just about outward appearance but also about their behavior and freedom from material desires.

They continue with their service unaffected by all these conditions. And the Goswamis were so controlled in their sense activities, they used to sleep for two hours or not even that. So, what were they doing? They were busy with writing books, with excavating lost places of Krishna's pastimes, and preaching and chanting and Sankirtana. Twenty-two hours they used to work, constantly engaged in such work. And with great internal pleasure, they used to do that, not as if it's a burden. Now, Prabhupada explains that some of them are engaged in worldly dealings yet are unaffected, the pure devotees. Unless these neutralities of life are there, one cannot be considered to be situated in transcendence. So, there is a test you can apply to actually understand whether somebody is actually transcendently situated or not. It's not just by dressing oneself in some saffron clothes or just remaining in some simple dress or staying in a forest. That alone is not the criterion. It's also how their behavior is under different circumstances. When they interact with ordinary people, do they become affected by anger or by insult? Or do they have any trace of material desires? Do they have any trace of envy? No. So, it is very, very evident and this is clearly proved by their interactions with ordinary people.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that the divinity and its associates are on the same transcendental plane, protected by the internal potency of the Lord, and ends the discourse.

So, the divinity and its associates are on the same transcendental plane and their glories are always sanctified by the action of the internal potency of the Lord. They are always under the internal potency. This is described by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita: mahātmānastu mām pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ. Krishna's internal potency is particularly the protector of the pure devotees. And Krishna himself also employs his internal potency for all his activities. I'll stop here.

### Krishna's glories, devotee simplicity, Krishna's reciprocation

**Key Quote:** "The simple and delicate women truly thought that Lord Sri Krishna, their beloved husband, followed them and was dominated by them."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the verse, highlighting the simplicity of Krishna's queens who were unaware of His full glories, and emphasizes that Krishna reciprocates with devotees due to their unconditional devotional service.

This is the last verse of this chapter, 11th chapter. Tamme Nire Avala Moodha Strainam Chanu Vratam Rahaha Apramana Vido Bhartur Ishwaram Matayoyatha The translation of this verse is, "The simple and delicate women truly thought that Lord Sri Krishna, their beloved husband, followed them and was dominated by them. They were unaware of the extent of the glories of their husband, as the atheists are unaware of him as the supreme controller." So, the queens in Dwaraka, they were not aware of the glory of their husband. They were not fully aware of Krishna's glories, because Krishna's glories are unlimited. And they were very, very simple women. Devotees are simple by nature. They are not shrewd like materialistic persons. Devotees are very, very simple and straightforward in all their dealings. And devotees sometimes think that Krishna is very nicely responding to all their actions or all their interactions. But actually the fact is Krishna is only reciprocating because the pure devotees are engaged in his devotional service unconditionally.

**Key Quote:** "Even the transcendental wives of Lord Sri Krishna did not know completely the unfathomable glories of the Lord because his glories are unlimited."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Lord Ananta Sesha to illustrate the unlimited nature of Krishna's glories, which are beyond comprehension even for great beings.

That's the only reason Krishna reciprocates, and there is no other reason. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, even the transcendental wives of Lord Sri Krishna did not know completely the unfathomable glories of the Lord because his glories are unlimited. Nobody can estimate what is the extent of Krishna's glories. To give an example, Lord Ananta, Sesha, he has got millions and billions of hooves. Ananta means unlimited. So he is holding all the universes on his hooves. And how many universes are there? So many, millions and billions of universes. And he is glorifying Krishna by his millions of mouths. And he has not been able to reach the end of the glorification of Krishna. He's been glorifying since the beginning of creation. And he's been glorifying, glorifying. He keeps on glorifying till the end of the duration of this life of the universe. So which means to say that Krishna's glories are actually unlimited. Even Lord Ananta cannot find the end of his glories.

### Yogamaya, transcendental relationships, Krishna's humility

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "It's because in such a case of the pure devotees, there is the action of the internal potency of the Lord, the spiritual potency, the internal potency, Yogamaya."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the apparent ignorance of devotees about Krishna's full glories is due to Yogamaya, which facilitates the exchange of transcendental relationships, using the example of Arjuna ordering Krishna as his chariot driver.

So what to speak of anybody else? Now, the ignorance of the devotees, pure devotees, about Krishna's glories is not mundane. It's not due to material influence. It's because in such a case of the pure devotees, there is the action of the internal potency of the Lord, the spiritual potency, the internal potency, Yogamaya. Why is there this action of Yogamaya? Because there is an exchange of feelings between Krishna and his eternal associates which Yogamaya facilitates. The Lord exchanges transcendental relations in five ways as proprietor, master, friend, son, and lover. And in each of these pastimes, he plays fully by the potency of Yogamaya, the internal potency. He plays exactly like an equal friend with a covered voice, or even with friends like Arjuna. Arjuna orders Krishna, please take my chariot between the two armies. And Krishna very nicely takes the chariot exactly according to the order of Arjuna.

### Krishna's supreme position, pleasure pastimes, devotional service

**Verse References:** BG 11.41-42
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Simply for the sake of pleasure the Lord reciprocates."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna's supreme position is unaffected by His roles in pastimes, and that the Lord and His devotees engage in pleasure pastimes driven by mutual love and a desire to please each other.

But Krishna's position is not compromised when we realize Arjuna is affected by seeing the relatives on the enemy's side. He becomes afflicted by confusion. Should I fight? Should I not fight? And Krishna instructs him in Bhagavad Gita. So from that we understand Krishna's supreme position is unaffected by Krishna assuming the position of a chariot driver subordinate to Arjuna. He plays, that is Lord Krishna, plays, exactly like a son in the presence of Yashoda Mata. He plays exactly like a lover in the presence of the cowherd damsels. And he plays exactly like a husband in the presence of the queens of Dwarka. Such devotees of the Lord never think of the Lord as a supreme. They don't think he is supreme, but think of him exactly as a common friend, a pet son, or a lover, or husband, very much dear to their heart and soul. That is the relation between the Lord and his transcendental devotees. It's a relationship. And these are called pleasure pastimes of the Lord. Simply for the sake of pleasure the Lord reciprocates. And the devotees also serve him simply to give him pleasure. Krishna wants to please his devotees. Devotees want to please Krishna. This is what is going on in the spiritual world, in all spiritual relationships. Eternally this goes on.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord, when he comes down, he wants to give us a sample."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna descends to the material world with His associates to give a glimpse of the spiritual world and attract conditioned souls, emphasizing the need for purification through bhakti to join Krishna's pastimes.

This is not understood by the materialistic persons, by atheists, by common people, by those who are under the influence of the illusory energy. They cannot understand this. When the Lord descends, he does so along with his own devotees. He gives them an entourage to display a complete picture of the transcendental world where pure love and devotion for the Lord prevail without any mundane tinge of lording it over the creation of the Lord. See, what is going on in the spiritual world eternally, always. The Lord, when he comes down, he wants to give us a sample. He wants to display a sample of what is going on there. Why? Just to attract us, who are stuck up in this material world with a misconception that I belong to this material world. I am this material body. So, to deliver us, to get us out of this entanglement, Krishna very mercifully, very kindly comes. And he comes with his associates, and he displays exactly what is going on there, so to deliver us, so that we become attracted. Because Krishna is always engaged in pleasure pastimes with his pure devotees, we can also join Krishna in those pleasure pastimes provided we purify our material contaminated heart. That is important.

**Key Quote:** "In the spiritual world, or in contact with Krishna, in devotional service, there is always transcendental bliss."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the dry, unsatisfying nature of material existence with the transcendental bliss of devotional service, urging listeners to understand this difference through the descriptions in the Bhagavatam.

We should also purify by the process of bhakti. And we can also become completely free from material miseries, from material entanglement, from the repetition of birth and death. We can get out of this material existence, because Krishna will take us back to his own personal abode. Here, simply we are engaged in some lording over material nature, or engaged in some sense gratification, because we are always in want of some happiness. We are seeking happiness because our heart is dry without any natural experience of bliss. That is not our natural position in the material world, to always be blissful. In the spiritual world, or in contact with Krishna, in devotional service, there is always transcendental bliss, naturally. Always it is there. So, you should carefully understand this difference from the descriptions in the Bhagavatam.

**Key Quote:** "They are perfect representations of the marginal or internal potency in complete negation of the influence of the external potency."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's associates who descend with Him are liberated souls with pure Krishna consciousness, untouched by material contamination, unlike conditioned souls who desire to lord over material nature.

You should understand the difference. The devotees of the Lord who come with him when he comes to this world are all liberated souls. They may appear to take birth like ordinary people, like when Krishna appeared as the son of Vasudeva and Devaki in the Yadu dynasty. His associates appeared in Vrindavan, in Mathura. His associates appeared like that. Neither Krishna is actually under the clutches of Maya nor his pure devotees associated with the spiritual world are under the control of Maya, material, illusory energy. No. Even though they take birth, even though they seem to be performing some ordinary activities, they are completely aloof, because their consciousness is, the devotees consciousness is pure Krishna consciousness. They are perfect representations of the marginal or internal potency in complete negation of the influence of the external potency. See, originally all of us we are pure spirit. We are originally not contaminated by material energy. But in association with this material world, with a desire to lord over material nature, with a desire to enjoy materially, we become contaminated. Whereas the pure devotees, they are not contaminated. When they come to this material world, they remain uncontaminated,

**Key Quote:** "The wives of lord Krishna were made to forget the immeasurable glories of the lord by the internal potency, so that there might not be any flaw of exchange."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that pure devotees don't seek material enjoyment because they experience spiritual bliss, and that Yogamaya allows Krishna's queens to forget His greatness, enabling a free and loving exchange of feelings, concluding with a thank you and Hare Krishna.

because they don't lord over material nature. They don't want to materially enjoy. Why should they materially enjoy, try to materially enjoy, when they have so much of spiritual bliss? Why will they want to enjoy materially? We are the people who are starving for happiness, so we take whatever illusory happiness is available, or we try to squeeze out material happiness by sense gratification. That is not the way the transcendentalists, the pure devotees relish spiritual pleasure. No. The wives of lord Krishna were made to forget the immeasurable glories of the lord by the internal potency, so that there might not be any flaw of exchange. See, for the exchange to take place between Krishna and his queens, if they become aware of Krishna's greatness, then they will not freely exchange their feelings of love for Krishna. Then they will be inhibited. So, to enable them to have a free exchange of their loving feelings with Krishna, the external potency will make them forget Krishna's real greatness, and they will think Krishna is like them, a person belonging to this world. Like that they will think. They take it for granted that Krishna is a henpecked husband, and they think that Krishna is always satisfying them, because he is henpecked. But actually he is satisfying, because he is pleased by their devotional service. That is the reality. So, we should understand this carefully from the Bhagavad Gita. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

These presentations were like the offering of a lamp to the sun. Yet the citizens began to speak in ecstatic language to receive the Lord, just as wards welcome their guardian and father. Beautiful description here. How did the citizens receive the Lord? They went with presentations out of love and affection for him to receive him. They went with some presentations. Now to whom are they offering these presentations? To the Supreme Lord who is fully satisfied. Atma Ramam. Satisfied in himself completely, 100%. And self-sufficient one. Purnakamam. He is independent in satisfying his desires. He is not dependent on anyone else. Unlike our condition, we are always dependent. We are never independent. We are never self-satisfied. We seek satisfaction from some other source other than our self. So, unto such a Lord, who himself is supplying everything they are having. But it is described here, it is not irrelevant. Their presentation to Krishna are not irrelevant. Why? It is like offering a lamp to the sun. The sun is the source of all light. And the sun's brilliance allows the sun to lied about rather than be in the readers' space. Let us go on to Ps. 129-8, that the sun always provides blessings and grace to the servants. So to this be puppies leaning onto an awaited God and forty to the assistance of peachy Followers, who are repenting, as company towardsray the Lord, so that others may come to his service.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's self-sufficiency, completeness, and eternal existence, contrasting it with the constantly changing condition of beings in the material world.

The sun is the source of all light, and the sun's brilliance and valor act as provision of divine light in life is showering to all beings. Moreover, while fleshments are through мелty subjects, absent  rose野 from the soil, now instead brightness in front of that what will a lamp be like it will be like totally non-existent but still when it is offered with devotion with with some feelings then it is accepted similarly the citizens were offering with love and devotion to Krishna their presentations and they began to speak in ecstatic language to receive the Lord so what they were speaking will be presented in the next few verses but they began to speak in ecstatic language they were fully ecstatic joyful Krishna has come back just as when some small children when the father is away and the father comes back home how they welcome their father with ecstasy joy in ecstatic words they welcome the father same way so in the purport Srila Prabhupada explains the supreme Lord Krishna is described here in his Atma Rama Atma Aramaha he is self-sufficient self-sufficient and there is no need for him to seek happiness from anything beyond himself he's complete we are a very very very very tiny portion of Krishna without our connection with Krishna we are incomplete this is what you have to understand to realize this incompleteness Krishna is also described in the Eshopan scriptures Krishna is also described in the Eshopan scriptures Purna madhaha Purnam idam Purnaar Purnam uddachyate he is Purna is full in himself complete in himself he is self-sufficient because his very transcendental existence is total bliss Krishna's existence itself is full of bliss the The entire spiritual world is full of bliss, the source of all bliss.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Our identity as the tiny part of Krishna is eternally our identity."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the concept of consciousness, refuting the idea of merging with Krishna, and emphasizes the importance of pure devotional service in offering to Krishna.

What is our condition? Constantly changing our position. At least in the material world, our position is constantly changing. Krishna is all cognizant. He is fully aware of everything. His consciousness is spread everywhere. His consciousness is universal consciousness. Now, sometimes people think that we can merge into Krishna and also become fully cognizant. No, that is never possible. One may try to merge into Krishna, but even after merging, the tiny particle of consciousness of the individual soul remains the tiny particle. The particle remains the particle. That is the law of identity. So, our identity as the tiny part of Krishna is eternally our identity. And Krishna as the complete whole is always the complete whole. He is never incomplete. We are never complete without our connection with Krishna. Krishna is also all blissful, total bliss. Krishna is the source of all bliss for everyone else. And Krishna himself is always blissful. Therefore, any presentation, however valuable it may be, is not needed by him. See, we become happy if somebody gives us a gift because we are in need. We are in need of the gift because we are incomplete. But Krishna is not in need of anything. Still, because he is the well-wisher for one and all, he accepts from everyone everything that is offered to him in pure devotional service.

### pure devotional service, loving reciprocation, energy of Krishna, worship, love and affection

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "It is all a sign of pure love and affection between the Lord and the devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna accepts offerings made with pure devotion, emphasizing the loving reciprocation between the Lord and the devotee, and comparing it to offering a lamp to the sun.

So, whenever you make an offering to Krishna, we have to do it in pure devotional service. Yome bhaktya prayacchati Whatever you may offer. Generally, devotees don't eat anything which is not offered to Krishna. So, they may prepare varieties of foodstuff for offering to Krishna. But Krishna will accept it only if it is offered with pure devotion. Not otherwise. Because he is not in need of anything. Still, he will accept when it is offered with pure devotion. That is his loving reciprocation with his devotees. It is not that Krishna is in want for such things. Because the things are themselves generated from his energy. Where are we getting all that we have, whatever we can offer to Krishna? We are getting it from Krishna only, through his energy. The comparison is made herein that making offerings to the Lord is something like offering a lamp in the worship of the sun god. Anything fiery and illuminating is but an emanation of the energy of the sun. And yet, to worship the sun god, it is necessary to offer him a lamp. Etiquette of worshipping any great personality in the Vedic culture. One of the offerings made is an offering of lamp, arati. So, in the worship of the sun, a lamp is offered to the sun, not because the sun is in need of illumination. The sun is source of illumination for all of us. But because it is a way of worshipping the sun god. Now, Prabhupada says, in the worship of the sun, there is some sort of demand made by the worshippers. They offer prayers, asking for something. But in the case of devotional service to the Lord, there is no question of demand from either side. Neither Krishna is in need of worship. Now, the devotees are worshipping the Lord. They are worshipping Krishna to ask something from Krishna. Because Krishna supplies everything that the devotees require completely. Devotees don't have to ask Krishna for anything. Krishna naturally, automatically, very lovingly supplies everything for the devotees. So, Prabhupada says, in devotional service, there is no demand from either side. Neither devotees demand anything from Krishna, nor Krishna demands anything from the devotees. It is all a sign of pure love and affection between the Lord and the devotee. This is the wonderful quality of pure devotional service. It is pure love. There is no demand.

### father-son relationship with God, demands from Krishna, devotional service, unalloyed devotion, attraction to Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Lord is the supreme Father of all living beings."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the relationship between the Lord and devotees as a father-son relationship, explaining that devotees can ask Krishna for their needs, but Krishna will not provide anything that hinders their devotional service, leading to unalloyed devotion and attraction to Krishna.

So, it is free from any obligations. There is no obligation. The Lord is the supreme Father of all living beings. And therefore, those who are conscious of this vital relation with God can make filial demands from the Father. And the Father is pleased to supply the demands of such obedient sons without bargaining. Prabhupada explains, still, devotees, if at all, at any time there is any need for the devotees, they will only approach Krishna and only ask from Krishna. Though there is no need, but in case there is some need at any time, the devotees will only ask Krishna and nobody else. And Prabhupada says further, the Lord is just like a desire tree, and from him everyone can have everything by the causeless mercy of the Lord. But, Prabhupada explains one important point, for those who are practicing devotional service, whenever you need anything, you ask Krishna only and not anybody else. But, you should also remember, as a supreme Father, the Lord does not supply to a pure devotee what is considered to be a barrier to the discharge of devotional service. So, if we ask in our beginning stages of devotional service from Krishna, something which will block our devotion, then Krishna will not supply that. So, this has to be remembered. Those who are engaged in devotional service of the Lord can rise to the position of unalloyed devotional service. Unalloyed devotional service is pure devotional service, free from any mixture of karma, and material desires, free from all those mixtures. Pure devotional service, we can come to that position by his transcendental attraction. When he attracts us, spiritually. So, by pure devotional service, attraction for Krishna is awakened in the heart. Right on a material condition, we are attracted to so many different material things. That's because of ignorance.

**Key Quote:** "When the heart is purified of all these material misconceptions, and our spiritual consciousness is awakened, then spontaneously we are attracted to Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by explaining that purifying the heart and awakening spiritual consciousness leads to spontaneous attraction to Krishna, his name, form, qualities, and activities, ultimately leading to pure devotional service.

That's because of our heart lacking Krishna consciousness. But, when the heart is purified of all these material misconceptions, and our spiritual consciousness is awakened, then spontaneously we are attracted to Krishna, Krishna's name, Krishna's form, Krishna's qualities, Krishna's activities, Krishna's devotees, Krishna's abode, Krishna's descriptions. We are spontaneously attracted. And then we become absorbed in hearing, chanting, remembering, etc. That transcendental attraction is the way to elevate ourselves above these gunas, above the modes, and become completely situated in pure devotional service. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the sixth verse of the eleventh chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining it as a prayer by the citizens of Dwaraka recognizing Krishna's supreme position and transcendence over time.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session we will be discussing from two verses, the sixth verse and the seventh verses of the eleventh chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. These two verses are given separately, but they are related. So I will discuss in this one session both the verses. First I will discuss the sixth verse: Natas Mate Natas Sadangri Pankajam Virincha Vairincha Surendra Vanditam Parayanam Chemam Ihe Chathamparam Nayatrakala Prabhavet Paraprabhu.

**Key Quote:** "Bhakti means knowledge, Bhakti means complete material detachment, Bhakti means pure heart. That is Bhakti"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that devotion to Krishna is not blind sentiment but is rooted in knowledge, detachment from material desires, and a pure heart.

This is one of the prayers offered by the citizens of Dwaraka to Krishna. The citizens said, "O Lord, you are worshipped by all demigods like Brahma, the four Sanas, Sanaka, Sanatana, Sanandana and Sanatkumara, and even the king of heaven, Surendra, the king of heaven Indra. You are the ultimate rest for those who are really aspiring to achieve the highest benefit of life. You are the supreme transcendental lord, and inevitable time cannot exert its influence upon you." So these citizens are enlightened persons. They know what is Krishna's position. Their attachment or attraction for Krishna is not blind. They are not ignorant fools. They are completely knowledge. So one of the important points to remember is Bhakti means knowledge. Bhakti means complete material detachment. Bhakti means pure heart. That is Bhakti.

**Key Quote:** "The supreme means nobody is equal to him and nobody is greater than him"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the nature of bhakti, contrasting it with material sentiments and emphasizing the importance of progressing to actual devotion filled with knowledge and detachment, referencing Prabhupada's explanation of Krishna's supreme position.

Bhakti is not just a word of speech. Bhakti is not just another material sentiment. In a heart filled with material desires, in a heart full of ignorance, that is not Bhakti. That may appear like Bhakti, or that may be a beginning of one's expression of devotion to Krishna, but one has to make progress from the stage of sentiment to the stage of actual devotion, filled with knowledge, detachment, transcendental feelings, etc. So Prabhupada explains in the purport, "The supreme lord is Shri Krishna, is confirmed in Bhagavad Gita, Brahma Samhita, and other authorized Vedic literatures. No one is equal to him, and no one is greater than him." And that is a verdict of all this knowledge, all the scriptures. He is the supreme. The supreme means nobody is equal to him, and nobody is greater than him.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's position as the supreme Lord is not a position exactly it is he who is always the supreme"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Krishna's eternal supremacy with the temporary positions of the demigods, explaining that Krishna is constitutionally the supreme Lord, while living entities are dependent and influenced by time and karma.

Between Krishna and the other Devata's, between Devata's there is competition, though there is hierarchy among Devata's. But still their position is never permanent. The Devata's position is not permanent. The entire temple repose creation will be destroyed completely along with the demigods quitting their posts, that their body itself will be finished, so what to speak of their post. But Krishna's position as the supreme Lord is not a position exactly, it is he who is always the supreme. He is not occupying the post as if the post is sometimes vacant and somebody else may come. No, he is the supreme Lord constitutionally. The influence of time and space is exerted upon the dependent living entities. We are all dependent in this material world. Those are taken birth by force of karma. We depend on the material nature, and there is Kala, powerful Kala, which restricts our duration of life in this body, which limits everything what we can do. Now we as living beings, we are part and parcel of Krishna, but what is our position? The living entities are predominated Brahman. We are spirit, we are spiritual beings, and Lord is spirit, supreme spirit, supremely spiritual being. But we are predominated, we are controlled, we are subordinate to Krishna, whereas the supreme Lord is a predominating absolute. He is always the Lord, the controller, the master, the enjoyer, the supremely powerful. That we have to remember.

**Key Quote:** "As soon as we forget this clear fact, we are at once in illusion."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the two states of existence: Krishna consciousness, where one is protected by Krishna, and illusion, where one is governed by the stringent laws of material energy, leading to suffering.

As soon as we forget this clear fact, we are at once in illusion. There are only two states of existence for every living being. Either we are in Krishna consciousness, where we are properly situated under the full protection of Krishna, Krishna providing us with everything without even ever asking, or we are in the shelter of the illusory energy, and the illusory energy is very stringent laws which are governing every single being. We are in illusion because we forget who we are, we forget who is Krishna, we forget our spiritual nature. We think we are product of matter. We identify with the body. This is illusion, and threefold miseries constantly occur. We are constantly attacking the body, the mind.

**Summary:** The speaker defines God consciousness as the clear awareness of the living being, distinct from matter, and emphasizes the eternal subordination and gratitude owed to Krishna.

Cognizant means we are always full of consciousness, aware, we are always aware. That awareness is distinctly a quality of the living being as opposed to the body, matter. Matter doesn't have cognizant, doesn't have awareness, doesn't have consciousness. So we are not matter. We are not this material body. We are not product of material nature. No. In God consciousness or Krishna consciousness, one bows down unto Him. Him means Krishna, the Supreme Lord, in all circumstances. Eternally we are subordinate. Eternally we should be grateful to Krishna for everything.

The seventh verse: tvameva mātā atha suhṛt patih pitā tvam sad-gurur naḥ paramam ca daivatam yasyān vṛtyākṛtino bhavu vimā. The meaning of this seventh verse is, "O creator of the universe, you are our mother, well-wisher, lord, father, spiritual master and worshipable deity." Krishna is everything for his devotees. So that is being highlighted here. "By following in your footsteps, we have become successful in every respect. We pray therefore that you continue to bless us with your mercy."

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna has good plans for all living beings, and success in life comes from following His advice, particularly as given in the Bhagavad Gita.

So Sri Lapa Rāpāda explains in the purport, "The all-good personality of Godhead, being the creator of the universe, also plans for the good of all good living beings." See actually Krishna does not make a distinction between different living beings in this world as good and bad, but we become good or bad according to our good and bad, according to our attitude, according to our choice, the choice we make. So he has all good plans for us, Krishna. The good living beings are advised by the Lord to follow his good advice, and by doing so, they become successful in all spheres of life. Success in life, especially in human life, is not just about success when we follow Krishna's instructions, as he has given us advice in the Bhagavad Gita.

### Demigod Worship, Material Desires, Krishna as the only worshipable Lord, Material and Spiritual Success
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/VXAmI17rayg?t=644
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "There is no need to worship any deity but the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker argues against worshipping demigods for material desires, stating that Krishna is the only worshipable Lord and can bestow both material and spiritual success.

This material world is such a complex place. People have so many material desires, and they sometimes think that the devatas can fulfill my material desires better than Krishna, or they are ignorant of Krishna. So therefore they don't even approach Krishna. They only go to demigods, or some of them who are completely atheistic. They don't even go to any demigods or Krishna. They simply depend upon their own personal strength, personal abilities, personal intelligence, without realizing all these personal things are given by Krishna only through material nature. So foolish people are like that. So Prabhupada says there is no need to worship any deity other than Krishna. Krishna is the only worshipable Lord for everyone. Even the devatas worship Krishna as was explained in the previous verse. Brahma, Shiva, Indra, the topmost devatas. Everyone, all the devatas are Vishnu Bhakta. Vishnu Bhakta Smruto Daiva Asuras Tad Viparyaya. Asuras are non-devotees. All the 33 crore devatas in this one universe are all devotees of Vishnu or Krishna. So if they are worshipping Krishna, why shouldn't we worship Krishna? They derive everything they have including their power from Krishna. So we should understand Krishna's position is absolute Lord, not relatively situated as Lord sometimes. No. The demigods are relatively situated. The Lord is all-powerful, and if he is satisfied by our obedience unto his Lord's feet, he is competent to bestow upon us all kinds of blessings for the successful execution of both our material and spiritual lives.

**Key Quote:** "Both materially and spiritually we are successful simply by worshipping Krishna, by depending on Krishna, by following Krishna's instructions even in material life."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that there is no need for separate endeavors for material success, as both material and spiritual success come from worshipping and depending on Krishna, highlighting the eternal relationship between the soul and the Supreme Lord.

This is an important point Srila Prabhupada is making. For spiritual life, somebody may think I may have to worship Krishna, but for material life, they think they have to worship some devatas or they have to work hard in material existence. No. There is no need of any separate endeavor for success in material life either. Both materially and spiritually we are successful simply by worshipping Krishna, by depending on Krishna, by following Krishna's instructions even in material life. And it is important to remember for attaining spiritual existence, the human form is a chance for all of us to understand our eternal relation with God. We have an eternal relationship with Krishna. It is not like the material relationships which are based on this body. They end with the body. Material relationships end with the body. Spiritual relationship is with Krishna, and that is eternal. That is never based on this body. It is actually the relationship between the soul and this Supreme Lord Krishna. It is eternal to Supreme Soul. That relationship, because soul is eternal. Krishna is eternal. Therefore relationship is also eternal. Soul to soul. Our relation with Him is eternal. It can either be broken or vanquished. Material relationships are broken. Spiritual relationship with Krishna is never broken.

It is just forgotten for the time being. Now somebody may be forgetful of Krishna, but it can be revived also by the grace of the Lord if we follow His injunctions. If we follow His instructions, it can be revived. And these injunctions are revealed in the scriptures of all times and all places. Shastra means that which gives us the instructions, how we can revive our memory of Krishna. That is what is actually explained in the Shastra.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's form is completely transcendental and it can be seen only by pure devotees, those who have the vision to perceive transcendental form."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining that the residents of Dwaraka are expressing their joy at seeing Krishna and emphasizing that only pure devotees can perceive Krishna's transcendental form.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 8th verse of the Lakshmi, 11th chapter of the 1st canto of Shri Madbhagavatam: Aho Sanatha Bhavatasma Yadvayam Traivishta Panam Apidura Darshanam Prema Smita Snigdha Nireeksha Nananam Pashyema Rupam Tavasarva Saubhagam. The meaning of this verse is: Oh, it is our good luck that we have come again today under your protection, by your presence, for your Lordship. The Lordship rarely visits even the denizens of heaven. Now it is possible for us to look into your smiling face, which is full of affectionate glances. We can now see your transcendental form full of all auspiciousness. This is a verse spoken by the residents of Dwaraka who had come to receive Krishna when Krishna was entering Dwaraka after sounding his conch shell. All the saints were saying to Krishna, all the citizens who are waiting to have darshan of Krishna, they came running, leaving whatever they were doing. And they are so attached to Krishna, it is very evident from all these descriptions here. So what is their reaction to be able to see Krishna once again? They are telling, it is our good luck that we have come again today under your protection, by your presence. So devotees are always under the protection of Krishna, and they are able to directly see Krishna. That is special because Krishna's form is completely transcendental and it can be seen only by pure devotees,

**Key Quote:** "The impersonalists and the materialists, when they see Krishna, when Krishna appears and gives darshan as an incarnation, as Krishna, Rama, Narasimha, Varaha, they see that form and they think that form is material."
**Summary:** The lecture contrasts the vision of devotees with that of impersonalists and materialists, who, due to their ignorance, perceive Krishna's form as material.

those who have the vision to perceive transcendental form. There are transcendentalists who don't perceive spiritual form. They are called impersonalists because their conception of the absolute truth is that the absolute truth is impersonal. Impersonal means no form, no spiritual qualities, no spiritual form, no spiritual name, no spiritual paraphernalia, no spiritual abode. So they are totally impersonalists. They are totally ignorant and therefore unable to see the transcendental form of the Lord even when he appears on this earth planet. So does it mean they can't see Krishna at all as a person when he comes? No, Krishna becomes visible, but they think the form of Krishna is material. That's what they think. The impersonalists and the materialists, when they see Krishna, when Krishna appears and gives darshan as an incarnation, as Krishna, Rama, Narasimha, Varaha, they see that form and they think that form is material. This is the biggest mistake made by non-devotees.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the perspective of pure devotees who recognize Krishna's form as transcendental and emphasizes the auspiciousness associated with seeing, thinking of, and describing Krishna.

As far as devotees are concerned, pure devotees, they see Krishna, but they also know Krishna's form is not material. They know Krishna's form is not material. So therefore, they are telling here, the residents of Dwaraka, they are all pure devotees, every one of them. So they are telling that Krishna never visits the denizens of heaven, but he stays in Dwaraka and just he had gone a little time for settling things in Hastinapura. So the citizens were missing him. They were missing him. And what are they able to see now? They are able to see Krishna's smiling face. Krishna is very, very kind to his pure devotees. So therefore, when Krishna sees them, they are able to see Krishna's smiling face. Now, further it is said, Krishna's smiling face is full of affectionate glances. That is because the relationship between Krishna and each and every devotee is one of loving affection. Therefore, Krishna's glance upon his devotees is full of affection. And they are also telling, we can now see your transcendental form. Krishna's form is fully transcendental and this is only known to the pure devotees. Nobody else knows this. This transcendental form is described here as full of all auspiciousness, Sarva Saubhagam.

**Key Quote:** "By devotional service, a devotee directly sees Krishna, just like I see you or you are seeing me. Exactly like that, they are seeing Krishna face to face, which is impossible to be done even by the denizens of higher planets, the demigods, including Lord Brahma, the topmost demigod."
**Summary:** The lecture explains that only through devotional service can one directly see Krishna, a privilege not even afforded to demigods like Brahma, and describes how demigods can only access Vishnu indirectly in Shwetadvipa.

It is full of all auspiciousness. Just thinking of Krishna's transcendental form, seeing Krishna's transcendental form, remembering Krishna's transcendental form, hearing descriptions of Krishna's transcendental form, describing oneself, Krishna's transcendental form, all these are meant to bring all auspiciousness. In the Purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The Lord in his eternal personal form can be seen only by pure devotees. The Lord is never impersonal, but he is the supreme absolute personality of Godhead." Krishna is not impersonal. Krishna has an impersonal feature but that is subordinate to the personality. And Srila Prabhupada says, "This absolute personality of Krishna is possible to be visited by devotional service face to face." By devotional service, a devotee directly sees Krishna, just like I see you or you are seeing me. Exactly like that, they are seeing Krishna face to face, which is impossible to be done even by the denizens of higher planets, the demigods, including Lord Brahma, the topmost demigod. It is described by Prabhupada here, that when Brahmaji and other demigods want to consult Lord Vishnu, the plenary portion of Lord Krishna, where does Vishnu stay? Vishnu resides in this material world in a special planet of his own, which is a completely spiritual planet, Shwetadvipa. And the demigods, when they have some problem, they visit Lord Vishnu in this personal planet, but they cannot enter that planet. They have to wait on the shore of the ocean of milk where Lord Vishnu is lying on Shwetadvipa. This ocean of milk and the Shwetadvipa planet are the replica of Vaikunthaloka within the universe.

**Key Quote:** "Pure devotees means their heart is completely free from all material contamination. Material contamination is of two kinds. One is called material contamination of fructive activities."
**Summary:** The speaker defines pure devotees as those free from material contamination, specifically mentioning 'fructive activities' or the desire for material benefits from actions.

Vaikunthaloka is far beyond the spiritual sky even, but that Vaikunthaloka descends when Lord Vishnu comes into this world. So, neither Brahmaji nor the demigods like Indra can enter into this island of Shwetadvipa, but they can stand on the shore of the ocean of milk and transmit their message to Lord Vishnu, who is known as Kshirodaka Shai Vishnu. Kshirodaka means milk ocean. Shai means he is lying down on that milk ocean, on Shesha Naga. So, they can transmit message standing on the shore of the milk ocean. So, when they look at the milk ocean, they can't see anything of the island on the milk ocean. They can't see that. They can just see the vast expanse of the milk ocean, and they transmit their message to Lord Vishnu. Therefore, the Lord is rarely seen by them, but the inhabitants of Dwaraka, because of their being pure devotees, without any tinge of material contamination, of fructive activities and empirical philosophical speculation, can see the Lord face to face by the grace of the Lord. What's the meaning of this? Pure devotees means their heart is completely free from all material contamination. Material contamination is of two kinds. One is called material contamination of fructive activities. Fructive activities is the desire for doing material activities which will give some material benefit. That's called fructive activity. That's a contamination in the consciousness of a conditioned soul of this world. All of us, to different degrees, we have this fructive mentality. We will not do any action if it does not give us some material benefit in any form. We think that it is useless to do some work without expectation of any positive material gain.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "As long as the heart is contaminated by material contamination, one can never know the absolute truth. It's impossible. It's impossible to know the absolute truth."
**Summary:** The lecture contrasts actions of devotees with those driven by material gain, and discusses the futility of empirical philosophical speculation in realizing the absolute truth, emphasizing the necessity of a pure heart.

Whereas, devotees, they perform actions, they work for Krishna, exclusively for pleasing Krishna. They don't do any material activities. Pure devotees never do any material activities. So therefore, their heart is described as free from the tinge of fructive action. And the second material contamination in the heart is the empirical philosophical speculation. Speculation, you understand, people try to guess or try to conjecture whatever they can't see, whatever they can't perceive, whatever they can't know by direct perception, or even they cannot conceive using the descriptions in the scriptures. They can't relate with it. Then they try to imagine in their mind, by their fertile brain. This is called speculation. And it is philosophical speculation is by taking help of the philosophical descriptions in the scriptures, philosophical descriptions in the scriptures. And empiric is something which is verifiable by material methods. So impersonalists and some of the materialists and some philosophers, material philosophers, all of them indulge in this empiric philosophical speculation, and they think that they can realize the absolute truth or have an understanding of the absolute truth by this method. But the fact is the absolute truth can never be realized by any of such methods, material methods. As long as the heart is contaminated by material contamination, one can never know the absolute truth. It's impossible.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that the original state of living entities is to see the Lord face to face, and that this can only be achieved through bhakti or devotional service, under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master.

It's impossible to know the absolute truth. So the original state of the living entities is to be always pure in the heart and thereby be always be able to see the Lord face to face in his personal abode and reside there in loving relationship with the Lord. That's the normal condition. This present condition in the material world is a condition of forgiveness, condition of forgetfulness of Krishna. So, reviving our natural constitutional position is only possible by bhakti, by practice of devotional service and no other way. That is what Srila Prabhupada concludes this purport by telling, if you engage in pure devotional service under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, you can revive your original position. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Every moment seemed like millions of years when Krishna was absent from Dwaraka."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse and explains how the residents of Dwaraka felt Krishna's absence, emphasizing their deep attachment to Him.

In this session we will be discussing from the 9th verse of the 11th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Yari Ambujaksh Apasasarabho Bhavan Kurun Madhun Vatha Suhradidrikshaya Tatravdha Koti Pratimakshanobhavet Ravim Vinakshnor Ivanastavachyuta. The meaning of this verse is, O lotus eyed lord, whenever you go away to Mathura, Vrindavan or Hastinapura to meet your friends and relatives, every moment of your absence seems like a million years. O infallible one, at that time our eyes become useless as if bereft of sun. A very beautiful verse where the residents of Dwaraka who have come to receive Krishna, when Krishna arrived in Dwaraka from Hastinapura after a long period of absence, they are expressing their feelings, how they were missing Krishna. Every moment seemed like millions of years when Krishna was absent from Dwaraka.

### senses, knowledge, Krishna as the source of light, illusion

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Without him, all our knowledge is either false or partial."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, comparing Krishna to the sun and explaining that without Krishna, our senses and knowledge are limited and we are in illusion.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, we are all proud of our material senses for making experiments to determine the existence of God, but we forget that our senses are not absolute by themselves. What is the meaning of this statement? Our senses are not absolute. This means that the senses can act only under certain conditions. Absolute means unconditional. For example, our eyes. As long as the sunshine is there, our eyes are not absolute. Our eyes are useful to a certain extent, but in the absence of sunshine, the eyes are useless. Lord Sri Krishna, being the primeval Lord, the supreme truth, is compared to the sun. Without him, all our knowledge is either false or partial. The opposite of the sun is darkness, and similarly, the opposite of Krishna is Maya, or illusion. The devotees of the Lord can see everything in true perspective due to the light disseminated by Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "The pure devotee cannot be in the darkness of ignorance."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on how devotees in Krishna consciousness can see everything properly due to the light disseminated by Krishna, and how pure devotees are always situated in transcendental knowledge, referencing Krishna's instruction to always think of Him.

So here is an example given by Prabhupada, rather the example given in the Bhagavatam itself, that just like the eyes are useless when there is no light, similarly, in the absence of Krishna, or in the absence of Krishna consciousness, when we are in illusion, when we are in mind, or in Maya, we are unable to see Krishna, or we are unable to see anything spiritual. Whereas the devotees who are always in Krishna consciousness, they are able to see everything properly due to the light disseminated by Lord Krishna. So Srila Prabhupada explains, by the grace of the Lord, the pure devotee cannot be in the darkness of ignorance. Devotee, pure devotee means always situated in transcendental knowledge, never in ignorance. That is the characteristic of a pure devotee, because the pure devotee is always Krishna conscious. Therefore, Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, Manmana, always think of me. If we always think of Krishna, we are always situated in Krishna consciousness, and in that way, we'll never be in ignorance. We'll always be situated in perfect knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "Everything in existence is only Krishna and his energies."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that everything is Krishna and His energies, differentiating between spiritual and material energy, and how material energy acts as illusion for conditioned souls who are forgetful of Krishna.

Srila Prabhupada continues to explain, therefore, it is necessary that we must always be in the sight of Lord Krishna, so that we can see both ourselves and the Lord with his different energies. Elsewhere it is explained that everything in existence is only Krishna and his energies. Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead, and he has many varieties of energies. All his energies are transcendental, spiritual, because he is complete spirit. So since his energies emanate from him, they cannot be anything material. They are all spiritual. But what is described as material energy, which is Krishna's another type of energy, is only material for the conditioned souls, for those who are forgetful of Krishna, for those who are in the darkness of ignorance. For them, this material energy acts to put them in illusion. But factually, this material energy is also Krishna's own energy for the purpose of the conditioned souls. This we have to carefully...

**Key Quote:** "As long as we are desirous of material enjoyment, as long as we want to be Krishna, we cannot know Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how the desire for independent enjoyment and forgetfulness of Krishna leads to being placed in the material energy, and emphasizes the need to come out of this contamination.

In the state of forgetfulness of Krishna, we are placed in the material energy of Krishna's spiritual energy, the internal potency, the spiritual world. So this material world is Krishna's material energy. But when we forget Krishna, or we desire independent enjoyment, or we become, because of our desire to seek independent enjoyment, independent of Krishna, we want to be Krishna. So as long as we are desirous of material enjoyment, as long as we be Krishna, we cannot know Krishna. So we have to come out of this contamination.

To remove the material contamination, to purify the heart of all material contamination, is the process of Bhakti. Even the chanting of Hare Krishna is described by Krishna. We begin cleansing our heart of material contamination. Now this material contamination is accumulated over millions of lifetimes. So only when we take to Krishna consciousness and the heart of our heart is cleansing of all material activity of our heart is accumulated of material activity of our heart is accumulated of our heart is of material activity of material off the heart is our heart is accumulated of material activity of our heart is accumulated of the material variable of material of the reaction of are due to our own misdeeds in the past so learn to tolerate them while you are...

**Summary:** The speaker encourages tolerance of material miseries, understanding our spiritual identity, and engaging in Krishna conscious activities to cleanse the heart and become situated on the spiritual platform, concluding with a call to become Krishna Conscious like the residents of Dwarka.

in the material world with a material body, also it helps if you try to understand that you are not this material body, you don't belong to the material world. Even now in your present condition, within your heart you are situated as pure spirit in pure Krishna consciousness, as a pure devotee of Krishna. So you just have to penetrate the layers of coverings and enter your own inner heart, in a portion of the heart, the core of the heart, and the process is the process of bhakti. So in the beginning stages it is a process of cleansing the heart. So till the heart is cleansed we cannot enter the inner heart of the heart and enter the inner heart of the heart and we cannot remember the core of our heart, we cannot enter the spiritual realm within our heart, our own spiritual existence, we cannot get into. So we have to wait for the cleansing in our body to happen, so therefore we have to learn fro readiness in life. We have to come to Krishna Consciousness by the process of Bhakti and that is what is being explained by Prabhupada in this purport. Just like the residents of Dwarka are always Krishna Conscious, similarly we should also become Krishna Conscious by constantly chanting Krishna's name, hearing about his glories, hearing the pastimes of Krishna from the Bhagavatam, like that performing more and more Krishna Conscious activities. And in this way, if we become Krishna Conscious, we can very quickly cleanse our heart and become situated on the spiritual platform, even while in this material world we can be in spiritual consciousness and thereby in the spiritual world.

**Key Quote:** "like that for the all powerful lord unlimited lord it is very very insignificant to vanquish the radiation of the brahmastra"
**Summary:** The speaker explains how the Lord easily vanquished the Brahmastra aimed at Pariksit, comparing it to the sun evaporating a dewdrop, highlighting the Lord's unlimited power.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namah Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Jai Vanarottamam Deviim Saraswatiim Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudhirayet. In this session, we will be discussing the 10th and 11th verses of the 12th chapter of 1st Canto Srimad Bhagavatam. The meaning of this verse is: The Lord was thus engaged in vanquishing the radiation of the Brahmastra just as the sun evaporates a drop of dew. He was observed by the child, who thought about who he was, while Pariksit is being given darshan by the Lord. What was the Lord doing? He was engaged in vanquishing the radiation of the Brahmastra. He was protecting child Pariksit from being destroyed by the Brahmastra. The Brahmastra, its power, is so immense. It can destroy one whole universe. That is the power of Brahmastra. That Brahmastra, the Lord vanquished as easily as the sun evaporates a drop of dew, one drop of water that is condensed on a blade of grass. When the sun rises in the morning and dispels the darkness and even the cold that's in winter, when water vapor condenses and a droplet is sitting on a blade of grass, and the sun rises, it can evaporate the drop of dew, not only one drop, but millions and billions and trillions of drops of water everywhere. The sun will immediately evaporate like that.

**Key Quote:** "krishna is always eternally unlimitedly powerful so therefore never compare krishna with any devatas"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Krishna's unlimited power and warns against comparing Him to demigods, who derive their power from Krishna.

Like that, for the all-powerful Lord, the unlimited Lord, it is very insignificant to vanquish the radiation of the Brahmastra because, even though the Brahmastra is very powerful, it has so much destructive power, but it is limited, and Krishna's strength, or Krishna's potencies, are unlimited. This difference always exists between Krishna and everyone else. So, Srila Prabhupada says the devatas, however powerful they may be, they are powerful by limitation, and Krishna is always eternally, unlimitedly powerful. So, therefore, never compare Krishna with any devatas, never compare Krishna with Shiva or Brahma or Durga, any devata or devi. You don't compare Krishna. Krishna is always unlimitedly powerful. And, in fact, the demigods, the devatas, the devi devatas, they are all deriving from Krishna. Whatever power they may have, they're deriving from Krishna's unlimited source.

**Summary:** The speaker recounts how Krishna entered Uttara's womb, saved Pariksit from the Brahmastra, and then disappeared after giving darshan.

Krishna is the ultimate source of everyone's power. So, Krishna entered the womb of Mother Uttara, Pariksit's mother, and saved that child Pariksit by simply vanquishing that radiation of Brahmastra, just like the sun evaporates a small droplet of water as soon as it rises. The 11th verse, the meaning of this 11th verse: While thus being observed by the child, the Supreme Lord, Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul of everyone, and the protector of the righteous, who stretches in all directions and who is unlimited by time and space, disappeared at once. Krishna's work is over. He vanquished the Brahmastra, saved Pariksit, and gave him darshan, unlimited time and space.

### Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mayavadi Philosophy, Difference between Lord and Living Beings

**Verse References:** SB 1.12.11
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This one difference, if you remember, immediately we can understand the difference between the Supreme Lord Krishna and every other living being, in whatever position, whatever situation, whatever power, whatever position, no living being can compare with the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the difference between the Supreme Lord and individual living beings, refuting the Mayavadi philosophy that equates all living beings with God, emphasizing the Lord's unlimited nature.

gave darshan and immediately he disappeared. So, Srila Prabhupada explains the description of the Lord means He is all-pervading Supersoul, Bhagavan. He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the protector of the righteous, the Supreme Lord, all kinds of opulences including power. That Supreme Lord, while He was being observed by the child, He suddenly disappeared. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "Child Pariksit was not observing a living being who is limited by time and space. There is a gulf of difference between the Lord and the individual living being." This should particularly be noted by the Mayavadi philosophers. They always think that every living being is ultimately God, Brahman, or Supreme, or Absolute Truth, or Atma, whatever term they may use. They think there is no difference between God and each one of us, but that is wrong. The Lord is mentioned herein as a Supreme living being, unlimited by time and space, whereas every living being is limited by time and space. This one difference, if you remember, immediately we can understand the difference between the Supreme Lord Krishna and every other living being, in whatever position, whatever situation, whatever power, whatever position, no living being can compare with the Lord. Even though a living being is qualitatively one with the Lord, qualitatively one means in quality, we are spirit, in quality, the Lord is also completely spiritual. Quantitatively, there is a great difference between the Supreme Soul and the common individual soul. It's a very, very big difference. You cannot conceive what's the difference.

### All-pervasiveness, Consciousness, Krishna's Presence
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/oTyiL8KO0dA?t=495
**Verse References:** BG 9.4
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna is in your body, my body, everyone's body, everybody. That's the difference between Krishna and each one of us."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of all-pervasiveness, contrasting the limited consciousness of individual souls within their bodies with Krishna's unlimited consciousness that pervades everything.

Unlimited versus limited, the difference. In the Bhagavad Gita, both the living beings and the Supreme Being are said to be all-pervading. That is the description of the Lord. The living being is described as all-pervading, the spirit soul. But, there is a difference between these two. There is a difference between these two kinds of all-pervasiveness. What's the difference? A common living being or soul can be all-pervading within his own limited body. I am present throughout my body. That's why if an ant bites my toe, immediately I come to know, or an ant bites somewhere in my forehead, I immediately come to know. Because, even though I am a very tiny spirit, even though I am a very tiny spirit soul within this body, by my consciousness, I am present everywhere. My consciousness is spread throughout my body. Your consciousness is spread throughout your body. Even Brahma's consciousness is spread throughout his body. But, what about Krishna? What about Krishna's awareness or consciousness? It is spread everywhere: in the spiritual world, in the material world, in every universe, in every planet, in every living being, in every space, in all time. No limitation. The Supreme living being is all-pervading in all space and all time. You see, all space and all time. A common living being cannot extend its influence over another common living being by its all-pervasion. Very simple example: I am within this body. By even using yogic power, I cannot extend my influence over another person's body. Not possible. But the Supreme Supersoul, the Personality of God, is unlimitedly able to exert its influence over all places and all times and over all living beings. See, Krishna enters into the heart of every living being. I have entered into this body. I am situated in this body. Krishna has entered into my body, your body. You are situated in your body. You are not in my body. I am not in your body. Krishna is in your body, my body, everyone's body, everybody.

**Key Quote:** "Because he is all-pervasive, unlimited by time and space, he can appear even within the womb of the mother of child Parikshit."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's all-pervasiveness allows Him to appear anywhere, unlike limited living beings, and that He protects those who are surrendered to Him.

That's the difference between Krishna and each one of us. Because He is all-pervasive, unlimited by time and space, He can appear even within the womb of the mother of child Parikshit. Try to understand this point. He can appear anywhere, wherever He pleases, wherever He wants to. We cannot do so. We are limited, always limited, where we can go, how much we can exert a certain influence. That also, empowered by Krishna. Now, the Lord is described as all-pervading through all time and space. He is also described here as the protector of the righteous, Dharmakut. Anyone who is a surrendered soul unto the Supreme is righteous, and he is specifically protected by the Lord in all circumstances. So, if we have surrendered to Krishna, we are protected by Krishna always, in all situations, all circumstances.

### Protection of the Unrighteous, External Energy, Ten Directions

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Lord is the indirect protector of the unrighteous also."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Lord indirectly protects the unrighteous by rectifying their sins through His external energy, and describes the Lord as being dressed in all ten directions, signifying His presence everywhere.

Now, Srila Prabhupada says a very important point here. The Lord is the indirect protector of the unrighteous also. Directly, He protects all those who are surrendered souls who are righteous, but He is also the indirect protector of the unrighteous, those who are not righteous, for He rectifies their sins through His external energy. The external energy is controlling all the unrighteous souls to rectify their mentality of being rebellious to the Supreme, of their mentality of not surrendering to Krishna, so that, when they surrender, they become completely protected by the Lord. They become delivered from this material existence. They are free from all material miseries, material bondage. The Lord is mentioned herein as one who is dressed in ten directions, Dasha ma sasya mishato dasha ma sasya, who is dressed in all ten directions. That means He is present everywhere and can appear and disappear at His will. What are these ten directions? The eight directions you know: east, west, north, south, north-east, north-west, south-east, south-west, and up and down. So these are called the ten directions. Now He is present everywhere, in all directions, in all ten directions. This means, dressed with garments on ten sides, up and down. He is present everywhere and can appear and disappear at His will.

**Key Quote:** "So when Krishna appears, he becomes visible to us right in that place where he appears. And when he disappears, he becomes invisible."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that Krishna's disappearance doesn't mean He leaves, but rather becomes invisible, and that He is present everywhere, but can only be seen when He gives darshan.

from everywhere and anywhere. Now, His disappearance from the side of child Parikhit does not mean that He appeared on the spot from any other place. He was present there, and even after disappearance, He was present there, although invisible to the eyes of the child. So when Krishna appears, He becomes visible to us right in that place where He appears, and when He disappears, He becomes invisible. He is there, present, because He is everywhere, but He becomes invisible. That's all. This material covering of the effulgent firmament, firmament in the sky, is also something like a womb of the Mother Nature, and we are put into the womb by the Lord, the Father of all living beings. So He is present everywhere, even in the material womb of Mother Durga, and those who are deserving can see the Lord. He is present wherever we have our awareness in the material world also. He is present, but we can see Him only when He gives darshan, when He becomes visible, not otherwise. So I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So that we can also become pure devotees and perfect our lives very very easily simply by following in their footsteps."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of Emperor Pariksit's birth and emphasizes his status as a pure devotee and the importance of following in the footsteps of such ideal devotees.

In this session, we will be discussing from the twelfth verse of the twelfth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Tata Sarva Gunodarke Sanukula Grahodaye Jagne Vamsadharapandur Bhuyapandur Ivaujasa. The meaning of this verse is, "Thereupon, when all the good signs of the zodiac gradually evolved, the heir apparent of Pandu, who would be exactly like him in prowess, took birth." So this is the chapter describing the birth of Emperor Pariksit. And his birth is very special because by birth he is a pure devotee. And that's the reason he was protected in the womb. He was protected in the womb by the love of his mother, by Krishna himself personally. And throughout his life, he was conducting himself as a pure devotee. So such pure devotees are directly coming from the spiritual world. They have got the purpose of life as the mission of the divine. And therefore, such personalities are described in Srimad Bhagavatam as ideal devotees whose footsteps we should all follow. So that we can also become pure devotees and perfect our lives very, very easily simply by following in their footsteps.

**Key Quote:** "Jyotir Veda, complete science, perfect science."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the astronomical circumstances of Pariksit's birth and emphasizes the factual basis of astronomy and astrology according to Srila Prabhupada, highlighting that these are complete and perfect sciences.

Now Pariksit's birth is happening in a very, very favorable astronomical situation. The birth itself is like that and Srila Prabhupada will explain the reason for the birth being very special. Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "Astronomical calculations of stellar influences upon a living being are not suppositions, but are factual as confirmed in Srimad Bhagavatam." There is a lot of speculation about what is astronomy, what is astrology, and what are the stars or the different heavenly bodies whose movements are basis of a calculation done in astronomy as well as in astrology. A chart is prepared and based on the chart a learned astrologer can read and actually tell many things about the person taking birth in a particular time, in a particular place under the influence of these stars or these heavenly bodies appearing in the sky. So, these calculations as Srila Prabhupada says here are factual. They are not some theories based on some speculation which are some sentimental people's belief systems. No, these are cent percent true and they are all factual. And it is based on a complete science, Jyotir Veda, complete science, perfect science.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Every action of life produces another reaction which is binding upon us."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that all living beings are controlled by the laws of nature and that every action produces a reaction, binding us to the material world, referencing the Bhagavad Gita.

So, Srila Prabhupada says further, "Every living being is controlled by the laws of nature at every minute." It is foolish to think that we are free, independent. We can do whatever we like. No, we cannot. There is some degree of freedom, but we have to act responsibly because there is control by the laws of nature every minute, just as a citizen is controlled by the influence of the state. Just like state laws are working, and if somebody is belonging to a particular state, he has to obey the laws. The state laws are grossly observed, but the laws of material nature being subtle to our gross understanding cannot be experienced grossly. How these influences are working, the astronomical influences, we cannot see with our eyes manifest in gross terms. As stated in the Bhagavad Gita, third chapter, ninth verse, "Every action of life produces another reaction which is binding upon us." Every action that we perform, every action has got a reaction according to the laws of nature, and that reaction is binding us to this material world. It is tying us down. We cannot escape the reaction. And it is also told in the same verse in the Bhagavad Gita, "Only those who are acting on behalf of Yajna or Vishnu are not bound by reactions."

So there is a special facility given to human beings who are performing actions on behalf of Vishnu, Yajna. Yajna arthat karma naha, it is called. Karma done, actions done, on behalf of Yajna, Yajna arthat. Such people, who are they? They are devotees, devotees of Vishnu, devotees of the Supreme Lord. They are not bound by reactions because they do all work on behalf of Vishnu. So our Srila Prabhupada further says, "Our actions are judged by the higher authorities who are the agents of the Lord, and thus we are awarded bodies according to our activities." So many living beings in so many varieties of bodies. What is the basis somebody is born in a particular type of body? The basis is the judgment of the higher authorities according to the work we have performed in the previous life. So there is a definite law working. There is a definite basis. There are enforcers of all these laws, and they are not visible to our eyes. They cannot be perceived with our gross senses. Only foolish, ignorant, arrogant, less intelligent, atheistic, demoniac people say there is no higher control. I don't believe in astronomy. I don't believe in astrology. I don't believe in scriptures. Only such foolish people talk nonsense, rubbish. And even as they are talking, they don't realize that even their movement of the tongue is controlled. Next moment such a foolish person gets a paralytic stroke. He can't talk. He can't move his limbs. He cannot even utilize his body at all, and he is simply admitted to some hospital or he lies in some place completely like a vegetable. And then he speaks all kinds of rubbish as long as he is able to vibrate his tongue. You see, this is the reality, and we see it all around us all the time. So, the fact is, the laws of nature are there. They are being enforced by the devatas, the agents of the Supreme Lord Krishna, and they are binding upon us. Nobody is exception.

### laws of nature, imprisonment, astrology, misuse of science

**Key Quote:** "This astrological science is a great science. And misuse of a science does not make it useless."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the material body as a prison and emphasizes the importance of scriptures in enlightening us about this reality, further discussing astrology as a great science that is sometimes misused by quacks.

Nobody is exception. The laws of nature are so subtle that every part of our body is influenced by the respective stars, and a living being obtains his working body to fulfill his terms of imprisonment. We are very proud of the body that we have, but we don't realize that this body is a prison for the soul, the real I, real self, for me. It is a prison. It is limiting me in so many ways because we do not know as spirit-soul what is the kind of freedom I have. That I do not know. I am totally ignorant of that reality. So, therefore, the scriptures are enlightening us, educating us, informing us, warning us that you are imprisoned in your material body, and it has got a basis. Why? Why are you imprisoned? To fulfill the term of imprisonment imposed by the higher authorities according to a set of laws of nature which are working, perfectly working. The state laws may not be always imposed perfectly. Some, few people may escape the state law, but nobody can escape the laws of nature. So, a man's destiny is therefore ascertained by the bird-time constellation of stars, and a factual horoscope is made by a learned astrologer. It is a great science. This astrological science is a great science, and misuse of a science does not make it useless. In recent times, it has been misused, abused, and ignorant people sometimes do get cheated by bogus astrologers who do not know the science, and they make money out of misleading people. So, that doesn't mean the science is wrong or the science is not valid. It is the person who doesn't know the science who is cheating people. It is a quack who cheats people, not the learned, enlightened, authorized doctor. So, there is a difference between a quack and a doctor, a good doctor. Similarly, there is a difference between a learned astrologer and a bogus astrologer. There is a big difference and we have to learn that.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jaya Muthi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 13th verse of the 12th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, 12th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam: Tasyapreetamana Raja Vipraya Dhaumya Kripadibihi Jatakam Karayamasa Vachayitvacha Mangalam. The meaning of this verse is: King Yudhishthira, who was very satisfied with the birth of Maharaj Pariksit, had the purificatory process of birth performed. Learned Brahmanas, headed by Dhaumya and Kripa, recited auspicious hymns.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of samskaras as purificatory processes to remove material contamination and revive one's spiritual position.

So this is a Vedic tradition, Vedic culture. On the birth of a child, there is something called Jatakarma which is performed. It is one of the samskaras, purificatory processes. Purification by cultural method. The life of a human being in this material world is contaminated in so many ways. Material contamination is there. But if one becomes purified of all material contaminations, one revives his or her spiritual position. The spiritual process is the purification of the material contaminations. So this is a great science, it is called the Spiritual Science.

**Key Quote:** "varnashrama dharma is a scientific method of purification."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of varnashrama dharma and the role of qualified brahmanas in performing purificatory processes to create a good population.

And such samskaras, cultural purificatory processes, are employed for purifying the material contamination. So Yudhishthira was satisfied with the birth of Maharaj Pariksit, and he had the purificatory process performed, Jatakarma. So for such purification to happen, they take help of learned brahmanas who know the science, and they actually perform the purification by the proper method according to the science. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, there is a need for a good and intelligent class of brahmanas who are expert in performing the purificatory processes prescribed in the system of varnashrama dharma. Varnashrama dharma is a scientific method of purification, a system of practicing Dharma, religion, religious processes by which every human being can become purified of all material contamination and revive their spiritual position. Unless such purificatory processes are performed, there is no possibility of good population. How can we have a nice population, nice citizens, responsible, well-behaved, with good qualities, who know the aim of life, who are progressive in their thinking? How can we get such a population by performing such purificatory processes under the able guidance of the with the help of learned Brahmanas.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that in Kali Yuga, most of the population is of Shudra quality due to the lack of purificatory processes and the scarcity of qualified brahmanas.

with the help of learned Brahma. In the age of Kali, the population all over the world is of Shudra quality or lower for want of this purificatory process. So in Kali yuga, according to the scriptures, kalava shudra sambhava aha, in Kali yuga most of the population which is born from the human population is of the shudra quality, means they are not having cultural purification. Now, shudra quality means they are not refined, they are not purified, why? Because there is no purificatory process for purifying the child which is born, why? Because there is this acute scarcity of learned brahmanas. So such learned brahmanas are not easily available in Kali Yuga. Some so called brahmanas by birth are there in Kali Yuga, but they are all bogus.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the nine qualifications of a Brahmana as mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita, emphasizing knowledge, realization, and faith.

Because they are not having qualification, neither they are learned in the Vedic sciences, nor their behavior, their conduct, their character is up to the standard of Brahmanical prescription in the Shastra. In the Bhagavad Gita, it is clearly said, a Brahmana is qualified in so many ways. At least nine distinct qualifications a Brahmana should have: Shamo, Damo, Tapaha, Shoucham, Shanti, Arjavam, Evacha, Gyanam, Vigyanam, Astikyam. Nine qualifications for a Brahmana mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita: Control of the mind, control of the senses, performing austerities, Tapasya, Shoucham, maintaining internal and external cleanliness, Shoucham, Shanti, tolerant, Arjavam is simple, is not duplicitous, straightforward, honest in all his dealings with everyone, Arjavam, Evacha, Gyanam is having proper knowledge, Vigyanam is having proper realization of that knowledge of the Vedas, and Astikyam has got faith in the Vedic scriptures, is not simply

reciting some hymns or verses like a parrot. No, he is learned, he knows the science, he is able to apply that science in his own life, guide others how to apply that science, he knows the reality, he knows the truth, and he has got faith, he is not faithless. He is not a blind follower, he is not a foolish person who actually is ignorant but poses as a Brahmana by cheating innocent people. Not such a Brahmana. So there is an acute scarcity of qualified, learned, gentle Brahmanas. Such Brahmanas are not there in Kali Yuga. It is not possible, however, to revive the Vedic process of purification in this age of Kali, but there is the Pancharatrika system also recommended for this age. See, this Varnashram. To revive that is very difficult in Kali Yuga because there are no proper facilities and there are no good Brahmanas to revive this.

**Key Quote:** "The Pancharatrika system acts on the Shudra class of men."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Pancharatrika system is specifically meant for the Shudra class of people and is designed for spiritual upliftment.

But there is another system recommended in the scriptures that is called Pancharatrika system specially for Kali Yuga. The Pancharatrika system acts on the Shudra class of men, supposedly the population of Kali Yuga. So Pancharatrika is specially meant for the Shudra class of people, those who are born without cultural purification, without samskara. Such people, they can take advantage of the Pancharatrika system. And in this Pancharatrika system, there is a prescribed purificatory process suitable for this age and the present time. You see, this is the arrangement of the Supreme Lord Krishna for us in Kali Yuga when there is a scarcity of Brahmanas, when there is no cultural purification happening before the birth of a child. Such a purification or purificatory process as prescribed in the Pancharatrika system is allowed only for spiritual purification, for spiritual upliftment and not for any other purpose. See, the purpose is also very clearly explained in the scriptures. Why this Pancharatrika system is given when already the scriptures describe a Varanashrama Dharma system? Why? Because it is necessary for spiritual upliftment of the population through this Pancharatrika method.

**Key Quote:** "Spiritual upliftment is never conditioned by higher or lower parentage."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that spiritual upliftment is not dependent on parentage and that the Pancharatrika system can purify anyone regardless of their background.

Which is possible that anyone from any kind of background can be uplifted to the spiritual platform directly without going through the complicated procedures of the Varanashrama system. Spiritual upliftment is never conditioned by higher or lower parentage. See, Srila Prabhupada explained a very, very, very important point. If somebody is born without samskara or samskruta, culturally not refined, but irrespective of what is the status of the parents or the family in which one takes birth, one can be uplifted spiritually by the Pancharatrika system.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Before a child is conceived, the very first samskara is called Garbhadana samskara."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of Garbhadana samskara, the purification process before conception, which is often missing in Kali Yuga.

This is the method of purification. After the Garbhadana purificatory process, there are certain other samskaras like Seeman Tonnayana, Sardh Bhakshana, etc. During the period of pregnancy and when the child is born, the first purificatory process is Jatakarma. See, before a child is conceived, the very first samskara is called Garbhadana samskara. Or, the parents combine to conceive a child by themselves purifying their consciousness of material contamination by observing their child, by observing certain specific practices. Now, that is missing in Kali Yuga. Garbhadana samskara is missing. They do not even know about it, that they can have a child with a good background if they are able to perform this Garbhadana samskara. They themselves become purified before they combine for conceiving a child. It's not accidental. It's not by chance some child is born to some parents. No. It is a complete science. What kind of child you want, accordingly there is a prescription in the scriptures.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating the eternal nature of the soul and the importance of Jatakarma samskara performed by expert brahmanas, referencing Yudhishthira and Parikshit Maharaj as an example.

How parents can actually have a child with a good background. Because life is continuous. It's not that life begins at birth and ends at death. No. It's the soul who is eternal, who is accepting a particular type of body. So, Maharaj Yudhishthira, with the help of good and learned Brahmanas, like Dhaumya and Kripacharya, performed this Jatakarma samskara for Parikshit Maharaj. And it is described here that these two Brahmanas, Dhaumya and Kripacharya, were very learned, and they properly performed that samskara because of which the child was properly purified. Cultural purification of the child happened because of these two expert Brahmanas performing the Jatakarma samskara. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

Hiranyam Gaam Mahim Gramaan Hasti Ashwaan Nirupatir Varan Pradat Svannam Chavipre Bhyaha Prajaatirthesa Tirthavit. The meaning of this verse is: Upon the birth of his son, the king, who knew how, where, and when charity should be done, gave gold, land, villages, elephants, horses, and good food grains to the brahmanas. Particularly in this verse, it is said, Prajaatirthesa Tirthavit. On the occasion of giving in charity on the birth of his son, Yudhishthira Maharaj gave charity because he knew Tirthavit. He knew how to give charity, to whom charity should be given, and when it should be given.

**Key Quote:** "Dana or charity or dakshina only given to brahmanas and sannyasis for the spiritual service they render to service spiritual service they render to the society free of charge"
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's perspective that charity (dana/dakshina) is specifically meant for brahmanas and sannyasis who provide spiritual service without charge, emphasizing that this is different from helping the poor.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "Only the brahmanas and sannyasis are authorized to accept charity from the householders. Only the brahmanas and sannyasis are authorized to accept charity from the householders, especially from the householders." And only the brahmanas and sannyasis in the Varna Shtrama System can accept charity. It doesn't say scriptures don't prescribe poorer people should be given charity. No. That is not the correct understanding. Dana, or charity, or dakshina, is only given to brahmanas and sannyasis for the spiritual service they render to the society free of charge. The dakshina that is given, or dana that is given to a brahmana or sannyasi, is not a prescribed charge for the services rendered. No, there is no such prescription anywhere in the scriptures. Neither a brahmana will ever ask that you give me this much fees for some consultation or for some service I may render. No, never, never. So, this is very culture, you see. The best of the service is regarding giving advice, giving guidance, giving any help in any way to conduct a sacrifice, or to worship the Lord, or to prepare an horoscope, or to do any of these brahmanical activities, or to teach the Vedas. Never will a brahmana charge anyone who seeks the services of a brahmana. Never, never will he charge. So, then how do they maintain themselves? This is the way they are given dakshina, they are given dana by the householders without any consideration of how much the householders are benefiting, how much service they're taking. No, no such consideration. So, it is said here specifically...

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the importance of giving charity to qualified brahmanas, highlighting their role in providing spiritual upliftment and welfare to society.

In all the different occasions of samskaras, especially during the time of birth, marriage, and death, wealth is distributed to the brahmanas because the brahmanas give the highest quality of service in regard to the prime necessity of humankind. What is the prime necessity of a human being? Spiritual upliftment, spiritual elevation, progress towards the ultimate goal of life. In that regard, the brahmanas are giving the highest quality of service because such service is not ordinarily possible to be obtained from anyone else other than qualified, learned brahmanas who are engaged in tapasya, who are engaged in constantly worshipping the Lord, in constantly studying the scriptures, in constantly performing welfare activity for the entire human society. Not only human society, for the entire world, of all living creatures. Foolish people don't understand this. So, such brahmanas deserve to get dakshina, dana, especially during three occasions: birth, marriage, and death.

**Key Quote:** "They lived a simple life, even though they had, in the form of dakshina or dana, all these things which are given, but they never made a show of that, neither they exploited."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how brahmanas, although receiving substantial charity, lived simple lives dedicated to the well-being of society, without exploiting their position.

It must be given. The charity was substantial in the shape of gold, land, villages, horses, elephants, and food grains, with other materials for cooking, complete foodstuff. So, the brahmanas were not, therefore, poor in the actual sense of the term. Proper qualified brahmanas were properly given charity. They were not exactly poor, though they would never make a show of wealth. They never made a show of wealth. They lived a simple life, even though they had, in the form of dakshina or dana, all these things which are given, but they never made a show of that, neither they exploited the system to become very, very rich and become extravagant in spending, or simply indulge in sense-enjoyment with dana or dakshina that they received. No, never. On the other hand, they'll be always austere in their mode of living. Tapasya. And they'll be simple and straightforward in all their dealings. And they'll be very benevolent to the general people in society. Always willing to do welfare activity for everyone in the society. Because they possessed gold, land, villages, horses, elephants, and sufficient grains, they had nothing to earn for themselves. There was no need for them to earn some money for their own maintenance. They would simply devote themselves to the well-being of the entire society. See, so nice a system. That somebody is fully devoted for the welfare of the society, and they don't have to bother to find out some means of earning some money for their own maintenance. Their maintenance is taken care of, and they simply give very good service to the whole society, everyone.

**Key Quote:** "Charity has got a purpose. Giving charity is purposefully given."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of giving charity with purpose, considering the place, time, and recipient, as outlined in the scriptures, and contrasts this with the commercialization of services in Kali Yuga.

Now, the word that is used here, Tirthavit, is significant in this verse because the king, that is Yudhishthira Maharaj, knew well where and when charity has to be given. Yudhishthira Maharaj was aware. He was enlightened. He was Raja Rishi. He was a saintly king. So, he knew when and where charity has to be given. Charity is never unproductive or brutal. Charity has got a purpose. Giving charity is purposefully given, and it is given with due consideration of who is the person who is to be given charity, and when it is to be given, and where should it be given. The place, the time, the candidate for receiving charity, all these are very clearly explained in the scriptures. In the Bhagavad Gita, it is said that charity should be given in the mode of goodness. Mode of goodness means following the scriptures. It is regulated. Only brahmanas and sannyasis should be given charity, and these brahmanas and sannyasis do accept charity because they don't have any other means of livelihood for their maintenance. They have no other job or profession or work or some income or some wealth. They don't have anything like that. And whatever service they give, they give it free of charge, always. In this case, anyone who comes needs some service, they give it free of charge, totally free, 100% free. Never there is any consideration of charges.

**Key Quote:** "But Vedic culture is, brahmanas are never commercially oriented."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the Vedic system of taxation, where only Vaishyas (businessmen) were taxed, and the collected taxes were used by Kshatriyas for the welfare and protection of all citizens, while brahmanas were exempt.

That is a true brahmana, a true sannyas. So, Kali Yuga, we only know that people who are expert in some field of learning, they have fees, they charge fees, professional fees. And the government collects taxes on those fees. So, it has become what we can say as commercial, a commercial venture. But Vedic culture is, brahmanas are never commercially oriented. Neither the government or the king would charge any tax on the brahmanas. Never brahmanas are taxed. Kshatriyas will tax only Vaishyas who are business minded. Only Vaishyas are taxed, and Kshatriyas don't collect taxes from other Kshatriyas, and Kshatriyas don't collect any tax from brahmanas and sutras. So, only Vaishyas are the ones who give taxes, and only the Kshatriyas collect such taxes to engage in welfare activity for the whole society. For all the citizens, welfare of the citizens, they collect taxes, and in return, they give protection to the citizens, and they ensure that the society is properly maintained. The common facilities for the people in the state or the kingdom are properly maintained.

### charity, daridra narayana, compassion, daya

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "A needy person should be shown compassion. Daya. Not Dana. Not Dakshina."
**Summary:** The speaker refutes the concept of 'Daridra Narayana' (poor Narayana), clarifying that charity (dana) is meant for spiritually enlightened individuals, while the poor should be shown compassion (daya) and helped with basic needs.

So, Srila Prabhupada says further, "In the Shastras, charity was offered to persons who deserve to accept charity, but didn't have spiritual enlightenment." You see, who can receive charity? One who is spiritually enlightened, whether it's a brahmana or a sanyasi. Both of them are supposed to be spiritually enlightened. And nowadays, what goes on in the name of Daridra Narayana, Srila Prabhupada says, "The so-called Daridra Narayana, a misconception of the Supreme Lord by unauthorized persons, is never to be found in the Shastras as the object of charity." Daridra means somebody who is poverty stricken, and a poverty stricken person sometimes is designated wrongly as Daridra Narayana. Narayana is never Daridra, and a Daridra can never become Narayana. So, this is completely wrong. Combining these two terms and designating some poor people as object of charity wrongly is a total misconception because the Supreme Lord is always having unlimited opulences. By definition, Bhagavan. Bhaga means opulences. Vaan means one who possesses. And to what extent? Unlimited. And a poverty stricken man is poverty stricken because of his sinful past. So, never consider a poverty stricken man as Narayana. So, there is a difference between giving charity to spiritually enlightened persons and helping some poor people who may be needy. There is a difference between the two. A needy person should be shown compassion. Daya. Not Dana. Not Dakshina. What is called Daya. Daya means you want to help somebody who is in need because you have the means to share. You have little excess, so you share it with somebody who is in need. That is called Daya, compassion.

**Key Quote:** "this potless son has been restored by the all-powerful and all-pervasive Lord Vishnu, the personality of Godhead, in order to oblige you"
**Summary:** The speaker explains verses 15 and 16 of the 12th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on the Brahmanas' description of Parikshit's birth and Lord Vishnu's protection.

In this session we will be discussing from the 15th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, the 16th verse, and the 16th verses of the 12th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. To begin with the 15th verse: Tam Uchur Brahmanas Tushta Rajanam Prashrayanvitam Esha Hyasmin Prajatantau Purunam Paura Varshabha. The meaning of this 15th verse is: The learned Brahmanas who were very satisfied with the charities of the king addressed him as the chief amongst the Purus and informed him that his son was certainly in the line of descent from the Purus. So the learned Brahmanas are describing that the child which is born in this dynasty is actually a very, very fortunate child and deserving to take birth in this glorious dynasty, is going to only increase the glories of this dynasty in which great people had appeared earlier. So the next verse, 16th verse, daivena apratighatena shukle samstham upeyushi ratovo anugraharthaya vishtuna prabhavishtuna. The meaning of this verse is: the brahmanas said this potless son has been restored by the all-powerful and all-pervasive Lord Vishnu, the personality of Godhead, in order to oblige you, brahmanas speaking to Yudhishthira. So in order to oblige Yudhishthira, this child has been protected by the Supreme Lord personally. He was saved when he was doomed to be destroyed by an irresistible supernatural weapon.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord wants to continue the line of pious kings to rule over the earth as his representatives for the actual progress of a peaceful and prosperous life."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the two reasons why Lord Vishnu saved Parikshit: his spotless nature as a pure devotee and his role as the sole surviving male descendant of the Puru dynasty, essential for continuing the Lord's mission of spiritual upliftment.

The history you have heard before is described by Prabhupada in the purport. The child Pariksit was saved by the all-powerful and all-pervasive Vishnu or Lord Krishna for two reasons. So specifically Prabhupada is citing two reasons why this child was saved. When it was attacked by that irresistible supernatural weapon, Brahmastra, the child was saved by the all-powerful and all-pervasive Vishnukara of Lord Krishna's seenives, it is the... the impossibility to've grass from the temple, or even the ultraviolet up pen, or even the entre Integration between the dreams of Sun and moon. And it's Vorabhadopinakay Av приход,лиз If this suratimes on Lord Vishnu was released, of Vishnu had not been provoke by this yanlış, it would certainly have 贸 a mother itself. But because the child was protected personally by Lord Vishnu the child did not die. So why it was saved by Vishnu, two reasons. The first reason is that the child in the womb of the mother was spotless due to his being a pure devotee of the Lord. So there is no ordinary child spotless pure because pure devotee of the Supreme Lord means there is no material contamination, there is no past karma, sinful reactions, nothing, spotless child and that is described here shukle samstha mupe yushi, shukle means pure, the child is pure, spotless. The second reason, there is a second reason why the child was saved by the Supreme God personally. The second reason is that the child was the only surviving male descendant of Puru, the pious forefather of the virtuous King Yudhishthira. In this dynasty where great personalities had appeared and they were doing excellent service to the society of protecting the citizens by ruling exactly according to scriptural directions and elevating the people to the spiritual platform, spiritual upliftment of the people in the society. They were doing that work very nicely. So in order to further the mission of the Supreme Lord in this material world, which is spiritual upliftment of the people, these kings in this Puru dynasty, all the forefathers of Yudhishthira and Yudhishthira himself, all had actually done excellent service in the mission of the Supreme Lord in this world. And this child was the only surviving male descendant because everyone else was killed in the battle of Kurukshetra. All of them were killed in the battle of Kurukshetra.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the Lord's plan for pious kings to rule and facilitate spiritual progress, emphasizing Krishna's desire to liberate beings from material suffering and correct their misconceptions about belonging to the material world.

All the other descendants were killed in the battle. So therefore this child was the only surviving descendant and had to be saved. So Srila Prabhupada further says, the Lord wants to continue the line of pious kings to rule over the earth as his representatives for the actual progress of a peaceful and prosperous life. Lord has got a certain plan. He was supposed to candy the people after themselves and give them the privilege of the material world. Even though and the spiritual world and that is his actual personal abode, but this material world which is created for the sake of foolish rebellious living beings who want to enjoy materially against their constitutional position.540 7 Pour singer.4 hillrint for themౄм Lord creates his material world.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Vishnu as a plenary expansion of Krishna, possessing full power, and defines a pure devotee as one who renders devotional service without material desires or expectations.

Lord Krishna is described here as Vishnu and this is also significant. Why? Lord Krishna, the original personality of Godhead, does the work of protection and annihilation in his capacity of Vishnu. Krishna incarnates in this world as Vishnu for the purpose of creation, maintenance, destruction of this material world. So protection is done by him. The destruction is also done by Vishnu. Lord Krishna is also the utilized weapon used by human иг Jumping into испgie, B..., overalnbeing as only child of grave evil, to immediately take is or to came sel at golden bringer of the swords of жизнь. So Lord Vishnu is the plenary expansion of Lord Krishna. Plenary expansion means he's expansion who's having the full power. The expansion has Vishnu. Vishnu has full power of Krishna. Vishnu is no second different person now. He is Krishna himself in another form for a specific purpose for the specific function was Krishna is the unlimited Lord he can be present simultaneously in different forms for different purposes different functions different specific purposes so that is Krishna's opulence as Krishna's all-powerful personality the all-pervasive activities of the Lord are executed by him in his vishnu feature o parism present everywhere so Krishna has to be present everywhere then Krishna expands his vishnu and as Vishnu he is everywhere child parikshit is described here spotlessly by Shukla because he is an unalloyed devotee of the Lord unalloyed devotee means pure devotee meaning of pure devotee a devotee who does not have any material desires a devotee who does not render devotional service with any material motive a devotee who does not render devotional service with any expectation

**Key Quote:** "Lord desires the conditioned souls hovering in the material creation to be reclaimed go back home back to godhead lord wants us to go back to his person above because that's where we belong"
**Summary:** The speaker describes the Lord's mission to reclaim conditioned souls, highlighting the role of transcendental literature, missionaries, and spiritual masters in guiding them back to Godhead, and emphasizing the Lord's protection of pure devotees.

of in return for the service from Krishna such a devotee is a pure devotee unalloyed devotee such an alloyed devotee is of the Lord appear on the earth just to execute the mission of the Lord and what is the mission of the Lord the Lord desires the conditioned souls hovering in the material creation to be reclaimed go back home back to godhead lord wants us to go back to his person above because that's where we belong and we have a relationship with the lord so he wants us back thus he helps them by preparing the transcendental literatures like the vedas see how many ways krishna helps the living entities in this world who are stuck up here entangled by preparing transcendental literatures like the vedas which describe everything about who we are what is the way of getting out of the entanglement what are the process who can help everything is given in the vedas by sending missionaries of saints and sages you see the saintly persons they preach they enlighten they explain on behalf of lord to the ignorant people and by deputing his representative the spiritual master Guru, Sadhu, Shastra. Three ways in which the Supreme Lord helps the conditioned souls. Such transcendental literatures, missionaries and representatives of the Lord are spotlessly white because the contamination of material qualities cannot even touch them. So, Shastras are perfect. The Acharyas, the previous Acharyas, the saintly persons, they are pure and the spiritual master also is a pure devotee or should be a pure devotee. Not anybody else can be spiritual master. They are always protected by the Lord when they are threatened with annihilation. Pure devotees are always protected by the Lord personally. And the gross materialists, they sometimes threaten such pure devotees. But they cannot do anything. They cannot do anything to the pure devotees because the Lord personally protects them. So, that's the explanation why Parikshit was saved. He is a pure devotee. So, he is personally protected by the Supreme Lord and he was saved.

### Protection by the Lord, Qualities of a pure devotee, Grades of devotees

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "All the good qualities can only be found in the Supreme Lord and His pure devotees."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the protection offered by the Lord to pure devotees, contrasting it with the protection offered to others, and introduces the three grades of devotees: Mahabhagavata, Madhyama Adhikari, and Kanishtha Adhikari.

In this session we will be discussing from the 17th verse of the 12th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The birth of Emperor Parikshit. तस्मान नामना विष्णु राता इति लोके भविष्यती नसंदेहो महाभाग महाभागवतो महान। So this verse is describing the reason why this child will be well known throughout the world. So the translation of this verse: For this reason the child will be well known in the world as one who is protected by the personality of Godhead. That's the meaning of the word Vishnurata. O most fortunate one! The brahmanas are addressing King Yudhishthira. There is no doubt that this child will become a first-class devotee and will be qualified with all good qualities. Mahabhagavato: A first-class devotee, topmost devotee, pure devotee. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains this point very elaborately. Srila Prabhupada says, "The Lord gives protection to all living beings because he is their supreme leader. The Vedic hymns confirm that the Lord is the supreme person amongst all personalities. Nithyao Nithyanaam Chetanas Chetananaam." The difference between the two living beings is that the one, the personality of Godhead, provides for all living beings. All other living beings and by knowing him, one can achieve eternal peace. Eko Bahunam Yo Viddhati Kaman: The one, only one, supreme personality of Godhead. He provides for everyone else. And anybody who knows this personality of Godhead, the provider of everyone, the chief, the topmost personality, the supreme person, will attain eternal peace. Such protection is given by his different potencies to different grades of living beings. There are various potencies of the Supreme Lord that are working, always working in his service. And they provide different grades. Different grades of living beings get different protection. But as far as his unalloyed devotees are concerned, unalloyed means pure devotees, the first class devotees, he gives the protection personally. There is a difference. The living entities who are not pure devotees, they are given protection through arrangement of the Supreme Lord through his different potencies or energies. But when it comes to pure devotees, Krishna personally protects them. Therefore, Maharaj Pariksit is protected from the very beginning of his appearance in the womb of his mother. Krishna is always taken personally. And then they are always under the personal charge of his pure devotees. Always, they are under his personal protection. And because he is especially given protection by the Lord, the indication must be concluded that the child would be a first grade devotee of the Lord with all good qualities. All the good qualities can only be found in the Supreme Lord and His pure devotees.

### Kanishtha Adhikari (Materialistic Devotee), Madhyama Adhikari (Intermediate Devotee), Devotee Interactions

**Key Quote:** "Secondly, the devotees who have developed, the second class of devotees, the devotees who have developed a mentality of genuine service to the Lord, and who thus make friendships only with similar devotees, show favor to the neophytes and avoid the atheists, are called the second grade... the second grade devotees."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the characteristics of the Kanishtha Adhikari, focusing on their limited understanding and lack of respect for devotees, and then describes the Madhyama Adhikari, highlighting their genuine service mentality and differentiated interactions with others based on their spiritual advancement.

There are three grades of devotees, namely the Mahabhagavata, Madhyama Adhikari and the Kanishtha Adhikari, three grades. The topmost is the Mahabhagavata, intermediate level of devotion is the Madhyama Adhikari, intermediate level, and Kanishtha Adhikari, the lowest level, the neophyte devotee. Now Srila Prabhupada explains this, three grades of devotees. Those who go to the temples of the Lord and offer worshipful respect to the devotees, the deity, without sufficient knowledge in the theological science, and therefore without any respect for the devotees of the Lord, are called materialistic devotees or Kanishtha Adhikari, the third grade devotees, the lowest, the third grade devotees. Prakrita Bhakta, this is Sanskrit, Prabhupada translates that in English as materialistic devotees. So their conception of God is God is only in the temple and in the form of a deity. And they offer respect, they don't have proper understanding of the science, theological science, science concerning God. They don't have sufficient knowledge. And therefore, they don't have any respect for the devotees of the Lord. Their attitude is like, I am there, God is there, that's all. And what about the others? They are also there, God is there, between them and God, between me and God, that's all. Nothing to do with interpersonal exchange between different persons. Secondly, the devotees who have developed, the second class of devotees, the devotees who have developed a mentality of genuine service to the Lord, and who thus make friendships only with similar devotees, show favor to the neophytes and avoid the atheists, are called the second grade devotees. The second grade devotees, madhyama adhikari, intermediate level devotees, the second grade devotees, they recognize four classes of people in this world. The topmost, of course, four classes of personalities, I would say. First of all, they have the highest respect for the Supreme Lord. And then, they make friendship with others who are devotees, engaged in proper devotional service. And then, they are kind, and they show favor to the neophyte devotees, the beginners. And they avoid the atheists, and the agnostics, and the materialists, hardcore materialists. They avoid them. So, four categories of treatment, for four categories of personalities.

### Mahabhagavata (Topmost Devotee), Seeing the Lord Everywhere, Everything Belongs to God

**Audience:** Full-time devotees
**Key Quote:** "But those who see everything in the Lord, or everything of the Lord... this is the vision of a pure devotee."
**Summary:** This segment describes the qualities of the Mahabhagavata, emphasizing their ability to see everything in relation to the Lord and use everything in His service, clarifying that seeing the Lord everywhere doesn't mean everything is God, but rather that everything belongs to God.

This is the second grade devotee. They have developed a genuine service mentality. That means they are properly engaged, under guidance, under clear guidance, in devotional service of the Supreme Lord. And they are in knowledge. They have proper knowledge of who is God, who is a devotee, who are the neophytes, who are the atheists. They have clear knowledge, clear understanding. Then, the first grade devotee. This is now described by Prabhupada. But those who see everything in the Lord, or everything of the Lord, two different things. But this is the vision of a pure devotee. And also see in everything, an eternal relation of the Lord. It may sound like difficult to understand, but the fact is, in the whole existence, the Lord is there, and His energies are there. And the Lord is the possessor, owner, and enjoyer, and controller of all His energies. So the energies belong to the Lord. But in another sense, the Lord and His energy are not different. So, because the Lord and His energy are not different, therefore, a pure devotee sees everything in the Lord, and sees everything belonging to the Lord. Everything belongs to the Lord. And also, anything we take, it has a specific relationship with the Lord. It has a specific relationship. Now, based on this understanding of relationship, the treatment for that thing will also be different. Each item, each thing. It's not the same treatment for everything. Now, such pure devotees, for them, there is nothing within their purview of sight except the Lord. They see the Lord everywhere. Now, seeing the Lord everywhere doesn't mean that everything is God. No. Everything is not God. God is God. Everything belongs to God. Everything is God's property, is God's proprietorship. So, everything has to be used in God's service. Everything belongs to God, so use everything in God's service. So, because they recognize everything belonging to God, therefore, they only see God. Very simple way to put it is, they don't see just the creation, they see the creator. Creation means there is a creator, and creation also means they can see the creator everywhere. It's a consciousness that is saturated with God. So, they are fully God conscious, fully Krishna conscious. And they are called the Mahabhagavatas, or the first great devotees of the Lord. Such first great devotees of the Lord are perfect in all respects. A devotee who may be in any of these categories is automatically qualified by all good qualities. And thus, a Mahabhagavata devotee like Maharaj Pariksit

is certainly perfect in all respects. And because Maharaj Pariksit took his birth in the family of Maharaj Yudhishtira, he is addressed here in this Mahabhagavata, the greatest of fortunates. The family in which a Mahabhagavata takes his birth is fortunate because due to the first great devotee taking birth in the family, in a particular family, the members of the family, past, present and future, up to 100 generations, become liberated by the grace of the Lord out of respect for his beloved devotees. So, that is the greatest thing that can happen to anybody. So, the greatest service one can do to one's family is simply to become a pure devotee of Krishna. That's all. I'll stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna. So, that's the explanation why Pariksit was saved. He is a pure devotee. So, he is personally protected by the Supreme God who saved him. And that's how, actually, this Pariksit was born as the only surviving descendant of the royal dynasty. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains the qualities of saintly kings (Rajarshis) and the positive impact they have on their citizens.

So this verse is a question. This is a question by King Yudhishthira to the Brahmins. So Shri La Pravapara explains in the purport to this verse. The forefathers of King Yudhishthira were all great saintly kings. Rajarsheen. The term used is Rajarsheen. They are Raja, they are kings, but they are also Rishi, they are saintly, saintly kings. It's a rare combination. And all of them are pious and glorified by their great achievements. They are all pious, because they strictly follow the scriptures, and they are glorified by their great achievements. Their achievements are noteworthy, even for kings. They are future generations. So they are all recorded in the Vedic scriptures. And they are glorified, and their example is cited again and again and again. They are the ideal for everyone else in the society, even in future. So their example is a timeless example. They don't go out of relevance, because there may be some very ancient examples of a different time, of a different era. Because the nature of a person is essentially spiritual, and that spiritual nature doesn't change with the change of time, change of era, change of yuga, change of place, change of circumstances. The spiritual nature does not change. So further Srila Prabhupada says, they were all saints on the royal throne. They are sitting on the royal throne. They are ruling. They are powerful. And they can be very, very tough in dealing with miscreants. But they are saints. They have all the qualities of a sadhu, of a saintly person. And therefore, as a result of such people ruling, what is being described here, please hear. Therefore, all the members of the state, all the citizens, were happy, pious, well-behaved, prosperous, and spiritually enlightened.

**Summary:** The lecture details five benefits citizens receive under the rule of saintly kings: happiness, piousness, good behavior, prosperity, and spiritual enlightenment.

Five things Prabhupada says about the citizens who are under the care of great saintly kings, Rajarshis. First of all, people are happy. This is a primary characteristic of a saintly person ruling a kingdom, or a state, or a province, or a country, or even the whole world. All the people are happy. Why? Because of his perfect rule, there is plenty of supply of all necessities by Mother Earth. Plenty of supply. So there is no scarcity of anything, for anyone. So naturally people will be happy. And then people are also, they are pious, because the saintly kings enforce the scriptural directions to be followed by everybody for their own good, for the good of the whole country, for the good of the whole world. So there are no clashes between different sections of people in the society. People can live in harmony, peacefully. And because of the prosperity, they are all happy. Everyone is having everything they require. And people are well behaved. They are well behaved because they are all trained up to follow their respective duties, to perform their respective duties.

**Key Quote:** "So the four social classes are the Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the four social classes in Vedic culture (Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras) and their respective duties and contributions to society.

So the four social classes are the Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras. So they have a certain nature, acquired nature. Accordingly, they are trained and they are engaged in occupational duties. So everyone contributes to the society positively. And the others acknowledge, I may be inclined to work like a Brahmana. So I give my contribution to the society in terms of giving guidance to the people, in terms of educating them, in terms of teaching them how to worship God, in terms of giving them guidance about their own responsibilities, duties, like that. So, I do my duty and the Kshatriyas, they do their duty giving protection to the citizens, collecting taxes, spending the tax money for the public welfare. Then the Vaishyas, they do economic development by trading, commerce, by growing food grains, by giving cow protection, so plenty of milk, milk products, plenty of grains, plenty of minerals, everything. The Vaishyas cultivate the land, they engage in business, trading the excess grains or excess silk or excess of metals, minerals, everything. So, the Vaishyas do their work, they give taxes to the government and the government spends it for public welfare. The Shudras are engaged according to their proclivities to do a particular type of menial work because they cannot work as a Vaishya or a Kshatriya or a Brahmana. They don't have the necessary intellectual development. Their nature is not suited for using their intelligence in a Vaishya way or a Kshatriya way or a Brahmana way. So, they just are humble, they do whatever they can do as menial service and even for that they are trained up, even in that menial service they are trained up like carpenters, sculptors, the tillers in the land, or the workers who work in a Goshala or workers who work in the in the government, in the military. They are trained up to do one specific type of work without trying to use their intelligence in in in understanding some philosophy or some theory, nothing, they just follow. That is the level of the Shudra. And they are provided with all their needs, they are provided with all their needs by whoever engages them in a respective menial service.

**Key Quote:** "People are well behaved because they are trained up, they are taught and they have ideals in the society, the saintly persons, the brahmanas, and the rishis, the sages."
**Summary:** The lecture continues to explain how citizens are well-behaved, prosperous, and spiritually enlightened under saintly rule, emphasizing the importance of spiritual knowledge and Bhagavata Dharma.

So, in this way people are well behaved, people are well behaved because they are trained up, they are taught and they have ideals in the society, the saintly persons, the brahmanas, and the rishis, the sages. They have ideal examples to follow and people are prosperous because they have plenty of everything. There is no scarcity. Why? Because Mother Nature provides, Mother Earth provides. When there is a saintly person, a saintly king ruling, Mother Earth provides plenty. Everybody does their duty, therefore there is yajña, yajña karma samudbhava. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita. And, above all, people are spiritually enlightened. There is systematic dissemination of spiritual knowledge, which is most essential in human society. It cannot be like the government is not concerned with people's spiritual development. No. Government should be concerned. Should be concerned. People should understand that they are not the body or at least even if they don't understand philosophically, they should follow the scriptural directions for spiritual advancement by performing some spiritual activity, by performing some spiritual activity. They should. Everyone should. That is not a matter of somebody's belief system. Spiritual life is not a matter of belief system. So, everybody has to understand there is only one supreme Lord. And, everyone else other than the supreme Lord is actually under the control of the one and only one supreme Lord. There is no question of different religious faiths. They say there are different religions in the world because there are different religions. There are different religions in the world because there are different religions in the world. There are different religions in the world because there are different religious faiths. This is a misunderstanding of what is eternal religion. It's called Bhagavata Dharma. That's what Bhagavatam proclaims. And, a king actually enforces Bhagavata Dharma. A Rajarshi introduces or enforces Bhagavata Dharma. Universal. Universal system of Dharma. Religion.

It is not dependent on people's faith. No. Just like all human beings. Why human beings? Even all living creatures. They require food. And, who provides the food? The supreme Lord. The one and only one supreme Lord provides the food for every living being. So, this is universal Dharma. Universal Dharma. So, this way the Rajarshi enforces Bhagavata Dharma. And, this way people become spiritually enlightened. So, this is being mentioned by Yudhishthira Maharaj that all the forefathers of Yudhishthira Maharaj in this dynasty were all great personalities. Now, will this child also be as great as those forefathers of our dynasty? That's the question he's asking.

**Key Quote:** "Actually the living being has no birth and no death but because of his separation from the service of the lord and due to his desire to lord it over material nature he is offered a suitable body to satisfy his material desires"
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing the eternal nature of the soul, its separation from the Lord due to material desires, and the awarding of a material body to fulfill those desires.

So, in a very elaborate purport by Srila Prabhupada for this verse. Maharaj asked a question, will he be as glorious as his forefathers in his dynasty? So the Brahmanas replied, yes, he will have all the good qualities of all the great persons and that will be described in the next 10 to 15 verses of this chapter. So very, very promising child has taken birth as the grandson of Arjuna, the only surviving descendant of the Kuru dynasty. Everyone else has died in the battle of Kurukshetra. So a very qualified and exceptionally great personality has taken birth because this is a person's birth. pure devotee taken birth and it's a lord's arrangement for the good of this entire world so srila prabhupada elaborately explains in the purport praja means the living being who has taken his birth in this material world praja actually the living being has no birth and no death but because of his separation from the service of the lord and due to his desire to lord it over material nature he is offered a suitable body to satisfy his material desires so a very fundamental understanding of who we are and we are actually spirit soul spirit soul does not have birth does not have death the soul itself is not born or does not die but it is the body body has got birth and body has got death and this body is awarded to us to the spirit soul particular spirit soul to satisfy the material desires of the spirit soul.

**Key Quote:** "Spirit soul does not belong to material world spirit soul belongs to the spiritual world"
**Summary:** The lecture continues to elaborate on the soul's misplaced position in the material world, driven by the desire to dominate, and how this leads to the transmigration of the soul through various bodies based on karma.

The soul and material desires don't go together actually, but because we are separated from the service of the lord, why are we separated from the service of the lord? Because we want to desire to lord over material nature, we want to enjoy materially. So this is the reason we are placed in the material world where we don't belong. Spirit soul does not belong to material world, spirit soul belongs to the spiritual world. But then in this material world, if a spirit soul has to live in the material world, spirit soul has to get a material body, only then we can live in the material world, we can attempt to lord over material nature, we can attempt to satisfy material desires. So therefore, Shloka Prabha says the spirit soul, the actual person, the living being is offered a suitable body. So the varieties of bodies are there. In doing so, one becomes conditioned by the laws of material nature and the material body is changed in terms of his own work. Condition means we are subject to the control, the influence of material nature. We cannot act in any way different from the influence and whatever work we do exactly according to that work we get our next body. So if our work is possible we can move it, we can change it and we can change the world in terms of devotional service, we get a spiritual body, we revive our spiritual form. Otherwise if you don't do devotional service, we keep changing our body according to our work in different species in different places or planets in different the living entity thus transmigrates from one body to another in 8 million 400 thousand species of

**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of transmigration, comparing it to the continuous changes within a single lifetime, emphasizing that the body is constantly changing even though we perceive it as the same.

life. Transmigration, that means we are changing body, but we don't appear to be changing body, especially when in this very body, in this very life, what we understand is life between birth and death. In this life, we are changing body from childhood to youth to old age, but we are not thinking that our body is changing, we think our body is growing, we think our body is the same body which is become bigger or which has become older, but that's not a fact. The body is material and matter doesn't grow. For example, this table, will this table ever grow? No, never. Nothing material ever grows. So therefore, this body appears to grow, but because it is material it will not grow, it doesn't grow. Then what happens? I was a child, now I have somebody has a body of a youth and I had a body of old man. So what happened actually? The old body we give up to accept a new body and this happens in such a way that we don't realize that continuously, changes are taking place in this body. After all, this body is made up of so many cells, right? And some cells are dying and they are replaced with new cells. Old cells are replaced with new cells.

**Key Quote:** "So, nature has actually fashioned 8,400,000 types of bodies."
**Summary:** The lecture delves into the variety of bodies available in different species, explaining that each body is suited to fulfill specific desires for enjoyment.

Continuously, this is happening. And it's so very gradual. If you are continuously in touch with another person, we don't notice how the person is changing body. We don't notice that. And as long as there is a resemblance between one body, the previous state of my body and the next stage of my body, because there is a resemblance, we think, oh, the same person, same body. Same person, yes, but not the same body. It's not the same body. It's a similar body. It's a similar body. So, therefore, this is called transmigration. Dehantara. In the Bhagavad Gita, it is explained. Dehino samsara. So, this transmigration from one body to another happens in different species of life to accommodate different types of desires for enjoyment. Everybody doesn't have the same desire to enjoy. Just like in the human body, nobody enjoys eating stool. Rubbish. But there is a particular body for enjoyment. For those who have such desires, the pig's body, the hog's body, somebody likes to enjoy eating, drinking fresh blood. Then they have to get the body of a tiger. A tiger pounces on its prey, kills it, and sucks the blood and eats the flesh. So, there is a suitable body. There is a body for that. The body of a tiger. Or the body of a lion. So, there are varieties of bodies. There are some birds which eat stone. So, somebody has a desire to eat stone. They have to get that particular type of body for which it's food and it is relishable. So, nature has actually fashioned 8,400,000 types of bodies. They are called species of life. And every person gets a suitable body according to the desires the person has to enjoy.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is the whole creation and we are just one insignificant tiny atomic particle of spirit."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that every soul is a part and parcel of Krishna, inherently dependent on Him for maintenance and protection, and that the illusion of independence is a mistake.

But due to his being the part and parcel of the Lord, every soul, every living being, you, I, every living being, is actually part and parcel of God. This many times it has been mentioned in Srila Prabhupada's books and writings, but please understand part means we are a tiny part, a tiny amsa of God, of Krishna. Krishna is a complete whole, we are a tiny part and we are very, very, very, very, very small. It's just like an atom compared to an entire universe, entire universe, compared to the universe, whole universe as a whole, compared to that what is an atom in that universe, like that. So, Krishna is the whole creation and we are just one insignificant tiny atomic particle of spirit. Part and parcel. Parcel means we cannot be disconnected from Krishna. We cannot be independent of Krishna. We are always connected through the relationship of we are maintained and Krishna is the maintainer. Krishna maintains us. Krishna provides for us. we cannot independently get our necessities independent of Krishna supply we cannot get in necessities so to think that somebody other than Krishna is my maintainer or provider or my master is actually a mistake is a mistake under the illusory energy mistake under illusion Krishna only is the provider Krishna only is the maintainer of everyone there is a statement in the Kathopanishad Eko Bahunam Yo Vidhati Kama so therefore because we are part and parcel of the Lord we are maintained by the Lord with all necessities of life you are part and parcel of the Lord we are maintained by the Lord with all necessities of life and we are also protected by the Lord and his representatives the saintly kings.

**Key Quote:** "This body is actually a prison house."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that taking birth in the material world is like imprisonment, where the body imposes limitations on the spirit soul, and saintly kings provide protection to all living beings to fulfill their duties and terms of imprisonment.

So in the previous session we discussed what is the meaning of the word Praja, those who have taken birth in the material world. And Prabhupada explained why we take birth in the material world. What does it mean to take birth in the material world and how a saintly king as a representative of Krishna, who is the maintainer of everyone, a saintly king as a representative of Krishna gives protection to all those born in the land where he is ruling. So Sri Laprabha is explaining about the saintly kings, because Yudhishthira Maharaj made a reference to saintly kings of the past, and it is foretold that this Pariksit, who has just taken birth, will also be a saintly king like the forefathers of this dynasty. So Prabhupada says, these saintly kings give protection to all the Prajas, or living beings, to live and to fulfill their duties. But, in fact, they are both priests who issue their terms of imprisonment. This body is actually a prison house, because this body is imposing so many limitations on this spirit soul, which has got FREEDOM, just like every spirit soul is free to travel across hemos cre grantos, and repel spiders and dubies, at will in any part of the Lord's creation. We have to remember that we areżeniae of this body, but we should remember that moment we are inside this body, iber, My body imposes limitation on my mode of travel and where I can go and where I can survive, what atmosphere I can survive in, in this body. See the soul as far as I am concerned, as spirit soul, I have no death. But then if I go to a place which is not suited for my body, then the body will die, body will perish, body cannot survive. So therefore there is a need for giving protection to living beings, all the prajas.

**Key Quote:** "Cows also require protection."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of protecting all living beings, including cows and trees, and criticizes the modern tendency to prioritize only human beings.

To fulfill their terms of imprisonment. When I get this body, there is a certain duration I have to live in this body according to my karma of the past. Only then my desire to enjoy in a particular way, materially enjoy, will be fulfilled in this body. So the saintly king, they gave this. They gave protection to all living beings, without exception, to live. To live, not that unnecessarily somebody is killed and the king is a mute spectator. Just like nowadays, so many cows are being killed and they have a right to live. Why are they being killed? So therefore, Cows also require protection. Trees are being cut indiscriminately. So that is also against the principle of the scriptures that even the trees require protection to be given by the king or the ruler or the government. The trees also, they have to live within the tree body for whatever their duration. So this is very very important point, that the saintly kings used to give protection to all varieties of living beings in their kingdom. Not just only human beings. Today the understanding is only human beings have to be protected. For the government, concern is protect only human beings. What about animals? What about the trees? They also require protection.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "From the scriptures we understand there are different varieties of bodies."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that all living beings, including animals and trees, have a spirit soul and a right to live, and those who violate this right will be punished by the laws of nature.

That's why spiritually enlightened people understand that there is spirit soul in the cow's body. There is spirit soul in the tree body. There is also spirit soul in the human body. Some religious faiths, they say, Oh, there is no soul in animal body. There is only soul in human body. This is wrong. This understanding is completely wrong. From the scriptures we understand there are different varieties of bodies. Different varieties of species of life. This is the correct understanding. This is the scientific fact. So, Srila Prabhupada explains, Maharaj Pariksit was actually an ideal saintly king because while touring his kingdom, he happened to see that a poor cow was about to be killed by the person. He was about to be killed by the personified Kali whom he at once took to task as a murderer. See, Prabhupada is giving an example. This will be explained later. How Pariksit Maharaj dealt with Kali Purusha, the personification of this age, we are living in Kali Yuga. Kali Purusha, he was about to kill a cow. When Pariksit Maharaj reached that spot, immediately he took out his sword and said, How dare you harm a cow. I am going to kill you for even attempting to kill a cow. So, Srila Prabhupada says, This means that even animals were given protection by the saintly administrators, not from any sentimental point of view, but because those who have taken their birth in the material world have the right to live. You see, that way some people have sentiment, no? Oh, poor dog, poor cat, poor mouse, or poor some creature. Different people have different sentiments towards different creatures. But this is not a king who sentimentally feels for some other birds or animals, no. It is a scientific fact that every living being has a right to live. Has a right to live, having taken birth in this world by the arrangement of the Supreme Lord. They have a right to live. And if their right is violated, then those who violate that are punishable. If they are not punished by the king, then they are going to suffer punishment in the future by the laws of nature.

**Key Quote:** "It's only in the Vedic literature you find the facts explained about Who am I?"
**Summary:** The speaker highlights the importance of Vedic literature in understanding the nature of all creatures and emphasizes that every living being has feelings that originate from the spirit soul within the body.

By the laws of nature they will be suffering. So therefore, it is said here, animals are also given protection by the saintly administrators because the animals also have a right to live. All the saintly kings, beginning from the king of the sun globe down to the king of the earth, are so inclined by the influence of Vedic literature. See, this Vedic literature is very important. It's only in the Vedic literature you find the facts explained about Who am I? What is this world? What is the nature or constitution of all the other creatures? Those who are also living. The animals, the birds, the insects, the reptiles, the plants, the trees. Who are they? They are also spirit souls. They also have a right to live. They also feel pain when they are hurt. Of course, we can hear them cry and when they are harmed, when they are injured, they also bleed. But there may be some creatures who don't show such symptoms of pain. But there have been experiments done on some trees or some plants that they also respond to different kinds of treatment and they show symptoms. They show symptoms of pain. They show symptoms of life by which they respond to different kinds of treatment. So, according to the Vedic literature, every living being has feelings that originally belongs to whom? To the spirit soul within the body.

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "If I give pain to somebody else, I'll be punished by the laws of nature that I also have to suffer similar pain in future."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of a child who cannot express their pain, the speaker explains that all living beings feel pain, even if they cannot express it, and inflicting pain on others will result in punishment according to the laws of nature.

The body may not be having the facility to express. Just like a child. If it is having stomach pain, it cannot exactly tell its mother, my stomach is paining. So what will the child do? Just cry. That's all. So the mother has to figure out why is the child crying. Is it crying because it's hungry? Is it crying because it has stomach pain? Is it crying because the aunt is biting its toe? The mother has to figure out. The child cannot express. So does it mean the child cannot express therefore it doesn't have any specific requirement? No, it has, but it cannot express. Similarly, the plants, they feel pain. But just because they cannot cry, so does it mean they don't feel the pain? So this is the mistake of the modern civilization, who are uneducated, who don't have proper knowledge, and who are unaware that if I give pain to somebody else, I'll be punished by the laws of nature that I also have to suffer similar pain in future. Therefore, when the king gives punishment, then the king is doing a great favor to that soul or the person who is inflicting the pain. He gets the lesson that I should not unnecessarily give pain to others because then I will be punished. Then I have to suffer pain. Atmavat sarva bhuteshu If I suffer pain and I don't want to suffer, similarly others also suffer pain, they should not be given pain. They should not inflict suffering on anyone else, any other living creature. So this is the philosophy of life.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the philosophy of 'live and let live' taught in Vedic literature and explains how knowledge is passed down through disciplic succession, using the example of Krishna teaching the Bhagavad Gita to the Sun God, who then taught it to his son Manu, and then to Ikshvaku.

This is the philosophy of life. The Vedic literatures educate us in this philosophy of life. Live and let live. The Vedic literatures have taught in higher planets also, as there is reference in the Bhagavad Gita about the teachings to Sun God Vivasvan by the Lord, Supreme Lord Krishna. And such lessons are transferred by disciplic succession as it was done by the Sun God to his son Manu. imam vivasvate yogam proktavanam abhyayam vivasvan manave praha vivasvan, the Sun God, he has a son by name Manu, vaivasvata Manu. That vaivasvata Manu is ruling in this vanvantara, the human beings. And he was taught, first of all Krishna says he taught the Bhagavad Gita to the Sun God. Sun God means the the controller of the Sun planet, the ruler of the Sun planet. And the Sun God taught it to his son Manu, vaivasvata Manu. The same lessons which Krishna taught to Vivasvan, Sun God, same lessons Vivasvan taught it to vaivasvata Manu. And from Manu to Ikshvaku, Ikshvaku, Ikshvaku is the first king in the in this earth planet, in this vanvantara, Ikshvaku. So Ikshvaku's name is mentioned here. Like Ikshvaku, this child will be maintaining everyone perfectly whoever has taken birth in the land, like Ikshvaku. Ikshvaku was famous. As a saintly king, like him, this Pariksit also will be a saintly king. So I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the role of saintly kings in protecting all living beings and discusses the parampara (disciplic succession) through which the knowledge of Bhagavad Gita was transmitted, starting from Krishna to Vivasvan, Manu, and Ikshwaku.

the son of Manu, Maharaj Dasaratha. So in the purport, we were discussing that saintly kings, they give protection to all the prajas, all the living beings who are taken birth in a particular land or the kingdom, irrespective of whether that living being is a cow, or a tree, or a human being. So they don't discriminate between giving protection for humans and non-humans. No, there is no such discrimination. Everyone has the right to live. So it was explained in the past two sessions, how the kings in the former times, they were trained up to actually represent Krishna, who is the ultimate protector and maintainer of everyone, to actually give protection to all the creatures who are all living beings. So we had discussed up to the point that Bhagavad Gita was first spoken by Krishna to Vivaswan, the sun god, millions of years back. And the sun god, he spoke that same science of yoga, the Bhagavad Gita, to Vaivasvata Manu. Vaivasvata Manu is the current Manu who is ruling the human being. And his name is Vaivasvata Manu, his name is Shraddha Deva actually. And this Vaivasvata Manu's son, Ikshwaku, Maharaj Ikshwaku, Maharaj Ikshwaku was the emperor of this earth planet at the beginning of this Manvantara. In a day of Brahma, there are 14 Manus. And the Manu referred here is the seventh Manu, the one who is the present Manu. So Shraddha Prabhupada says this Vaivasvata Manu had 10 sons. And Maharaj Ikshwaku is one of the 10 sons of Vaivasvata Manu. Maharaj Ikshwaku learned Bhakti Yoga, as taught in Bhagavad Gita from his father, Vaivasvata Manu. Now this Vaivasvata Manu learned it from his father, Vivasvan. And Vivasvan learned it directly from Krishna, when Krishna instructed Vivasvan.

**Key Quote:** "All the Vedic literatures are current from the very beginning of creation of the material world."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the breaking of the Rajarshi parampara, the eternal nature of Vedic literatures, and further details about Maharaj Ikshwaku, including his lineage and his prohibition of meat-eating.

So the teaching of Bhagavad Gita is coming down in parampara, in disciplic succession, in the parampara of Rajarshis, the saintly kings. In course of time, this parampara of Rajarshis, where the knowledge of Bhagavad Gita is transmitted without change from one king to the next king, that chain was broken. And therefore, again Krishna had to speak the same Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. So, Srila Prabhupada explains, all the Vedic literatures are current from the very beginning of creation of the material world. And thus the Vedic literatures are known as Apavrushaya, not made by any man, not creation of any created being of this world. No, it is coming from Krishna to Brahma down. And the Vedic knowledge... Krishna is first heard at the very beginning of creation by Brahma, the first created being within the universe, directly from Krishna. Then, about Maharaj Ikshwaku, Srila Prabhupada says, he is one of the sons of Vaivasvata Manu, as it was mentioned earlier. Vaivasvata Manu had ten sons, so one of them was Maharaj Ikshwaku. And Maharaj Ikshwaku had... He had one hundred sons. He prohibited meat-eating, and his son, Shashada, became the next king after his death.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Pariksit will be like Ikshwaku in maintaining everyone and highlights the importance of a king receiving knowledge in parampara and possessing specific qualifications to be a proper protector.

So, since the reference is made in this verse, that this child, Pariksit, shall be exactly like King Ikshwaku in maintaining all those who are born. So, maintaining those who are born, the king is able, capable, it's possible for him to maintain all those who are born in a particular land in his kingdom, if he is receiving the knowledge in the parampara, and he is a strict follower of those principles, explained in the authentic scriptures and that way the king will be a perfect representative of the Supreme Lord who is the ultimate maintainer of all living beings taking birth in this material world so for the king to be a perfect representative and therefore a proper protector of the Praja he has to be qualified he has to be trained he has to be knowledgeable he has to be having the

But in the beginning of the creation, only Brahma was there. Brahma created the Prajapatis. The Prajapatis created the first of each species. And then the species multiplied and the population increased. The whole universe was populated. All the plants were populated with different varieties of species of living beings.

**Key Quote:** "Pariksit will be like Ikshwaku in maintaining everyone perfectly."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the Matsya Avatar's appearance during Vaivasvata Manu's reign, the principles of Bhakti Yoga taught to Manu, and how Ikshwaku ruled perfectly, emphasizing that Pariksit will emulate Ikshwaku in providing perfect protection.

So it is explained here, the Lord's incarnation of Matsya Avatara, the gigantic fish, was invented during the beginning of Vaivasvata Manu's reign. Vaivasvata Manu began ruling as the Manu, the mankind, at the beginning of the creation of Brahma. At the beginning of his term, the seventh Manvantara, of which now 28 Mahayugas have already exhausted. In one Manvantara, there are 71 Mahayugas. What is the meaning of Mahayuga? You have heard of Satyavyuga, Treta Yuga, Dwapar Yuga, Kali Yuga, each of different durations. So a cycle of these four yugas on the earth together is called a Mahayuga. So one Mahayuga, like that 28 Mahayugas are already over in this Manvantara. 28 Mahayugas are already over. Totally, a Manvantara consists of 71 Mahayugas. So the beginning of this Vaivasvata Manu's reign, that is 28 Mahayugas before the present time, the Lord incarnated as the gigantic fish, Matsya Avatar. And the Lord, in the Matsya Avatar form, he instructed this Vaivasvata Manu in principles of Bhakti Yoga. And this Vaivasvata Manu also learned the principles of Bhakti Yoga from his father, Vivasvan, who was taught the principles of Bhakti Yoga by Krishna himself. And it is further said, that this Vaivasvata Manu, he instructed the same Bhagavad Gita, the science of Bhakti Yoga, to his son Ikshwaku. And Ikshwaku was perfectly ruling in maintaining all those who are born in the land. So Pariksit will be like Ikshwaku in maintaining everyone perfectly.

**Key Quote:** "Lord Rama appeared as the son of his pure devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker transitions to the comparison with Lord Rama, highlighting his adherence to Brahmanical principles and truthfulness, and describes Rama's appearance as an incarnation of the Supreme Lord with his plenary portions.

That is what is being foretold here. Now the next comparison is made to Lord Rama. How this Pariksit will be especially following the Brahmanical principles in being true to his promise, like Lord Rama, who ruled millions of years back, the son of Maharaj Dasharatha. So Srila Prabhupada in the purport describes briefly about Lord Rama. Lord Rama appeared as the son of his pure devotee. Lord Rama is the Supreme Lord himself. Sakshat Bhagavan from the spiritual world is coming and descending and incarnating as Rama, son of Maharaj Dasharatha. When the Lord comes in this world, he appears as the son of his devotee or appears in an extraordinary way. So his birth is not ordinary or his appearance is not ordinary. It is extraordinary appearance. He is not bound by any laws of material nature. He does not accept the material body. He comes in a spiritual form, and his form is completely transcendental to all material modes of nature. So Rama appeared along with his plenary portions who appeared as his younger brothers. Rama had three younger brothers: Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna. And all of them are the personality of Godhead, different plenary portions. Just like Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha appeared as Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna.

**Summary:** The speaker recounts Lord Rama's acts of protecting sages and killing demons, emphasizing his role in providing perfect protection, and reiterates that Pariksit will also offer similar protection before concluding the session.

That's what is explained elsewhere in the Bhagavatam. When this Rama was a young boy, he helped the great sage Vishwamitra by killing one Subahu, one big demon. And these demons were disturbing the sages who were performing yajna for the welfare of the people of the world. So Rama actually killed this Subahu and also he killed 14,000 Rakshasa associates of Ravana. And he specifically also killed Ravana on the request of the devatas. So Rama was known for giving perfect protection to all the people of Prajna, all the living beings in his kingdom. Similarly Parikshit also will give protection. That's what is told. So I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the qualities of a qualified king as mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita, emphasizing the king's responsibility to ensure the happiness and ultimate liberation of the people.

The two comparisons are made. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport: A king becomes famous by his acts of charity, performances of yajnas, protection of the surrendered, etc. So three different aspects are specifically mentioned about Pariksit Maharaj when he grows up to be the king. Emperor, he will be famous for his acts of charity. A king, if he is qualified as mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita, he should have the qualifications after having been trained and after having assimilated the knowledge, the skill, the proper understanding, and such a king is able to rule the people, the whole kingdom in such a way that people will be happy when the king is ruling, and at the end, people will be able to get liberation from material bondage.

**Key Quote:** "At the same time he has to also engage the people in acts of sacrifice so that they are ultimately liberated form material bondage"
**Summary:** The speaker continues to describe the duties of a king, including engaging people in spiritual activities and protecting the surrendered souls.

That is the responsibility of a ruler. Not only he should ensure that people are happy and there is peace and there are no miscreants disturbing saintly persons or weaker sections of society, at the same time he has to also engage the people in acts of sacrifice so that they are ultimately liberated form material bondage. Otherwise, if there is no such endeavor for engaging in spiritual activities, then people simply continue the cycle of birth and death and continue to suffer life after life after life. So it is a king's responsibility as the representative of the Supreme Lord. So here it is said that Srila Prabhupada [mentions] three specific qualifications of an ideal king. He should be well trained to perform acts of charity, dana. He should perform yajna. He should himself perform yajna for the welfare of the whole kingdom and he should engage others in performing yajna according to their position, according to their duty as enjoined in the scriptures and as taught by the scriptures. The Supreme Lord and his representatives, the bona fide spiritual masters, and the king should also give protection to the surrendered souls.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Lord is all-powerful and true to his word and therefore he never fails to give protection to his different devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the concept of 'Ishwara Bhava' (attitude of the Lord) in a king, emphasizing the importance of protecting surrendered souls and relating it to the Lord's promise of protection to his devotees.

This is also a king's duty, responsibility, it's one of his qualifications. Now Srila Prabhupada particularly says here, a Kshatriya king is proud to give protection to the surrendered souls. And this is specifically mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita. This attitude of a king is called Ishwara Bhava. Ishwara Bhava is mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita in the 18th chapter. So Ishwara Bhava means factual power to give protection in a righteous cause when the citizens are upright in their behavior, in their conduct. Then there should be protection by the king to such righteous people for a righteous cause. They should not be overpowered by miscreants, by demons, by materialists, by all kinds of ruffians. No. Then the king is not a capable person, neither he is doing his duty, nor he is going to help the people in ultimately attaining liberation. So in the Bhagavad Gita, Lord instructs living beings to surrender unto him, and the Lord promises all protection. The Lord is all-powerful and true to his word and therefore he never fails to give protection to his different devotees.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the example of Maharaj Shibi as a king famous for giving protection to the surrendered, setting the stage for narrating a story about him.

The Lord never fails to give protection to his different devotees. He says Kaunteya Pratijaanihi Name Bhakta Pranasyati. My devotee is never going to be vanquished because I will always protect my devotee in all circumstances. So Srila Prabhupada particularly points out here, the king being the representative of the Lord, he must possess this attitude of giving protection to the surrendered souls at all risk. The king must give protection to the surrendered souls at all risk. And this was very nicely demonstrated by one former king, Maharaj Shibi, he is famous for giving protection to the surrendered. So that particular instance from the scriptures is narrated by Srila Prabhupada in the purport. Maharaj Shibi was the king of Ushinara, a particular province. And Maharaj Jayati was the intimate friend of Maharaj Shibi. Jayati was a famous king in the former times, same time.

**Key Quote:** "The pigeon while being chased by the eagle took the shelter of the lap of Maharaj Shibi."
**Summary:** The speaker begins to narrate the story of Maharaj Shibi, Indra (as an eagle), and Agni (as a pigeon), focusing on the pigeon seeking shelter with Shibi.

And Maharaj Jayati was able to reach the heavenly planets along with Maharaj Shibi. So the scriptures describe how. Well, in the Mahabharata it is mentioned that Maharaj Shibi was aware of the heavenly planet where he was to be transferred after his death. And, the description of this heavenly planet where Maharaj Shibi transferred himself is described in the Mahabarata, Adiparva, 96th chapter verses six to nine. It is particularly mentioned in the Mahabharata that Maharaj Shibi was so charitably disposed because the scriptures say king should be charitable. He would be famous for acts of charity, dana. So Maharaj Shibi was very famous for giving charity that he wanted to give over his acquired position in heavenly kingdom to Yayaati. He was so charitably disposed. But Yayaati did not accept this charity by Shibi. So this Shibi he became a very famous king as a protector of surrendered souls and as a donor of charities. So it is said here that the king of heaven Indra once took the shape of the whole and the form of this kalkin social was the character of Ragamkar as well. So Maharaj Shibi once accepted him as aителя as the arch zoys to make матери sense this family. of a pigeon hunter bird, an eagle. Indra took the form of an eagle. And Agni, the fire god, took the shape of a pigeon. So, eagle and pigeon, actually they are disguised. Indra is disguised as eagle and Agni is disguised as pigeon. The pigeon while being chased by the eagle took the shelter of the lap of Maharaj Shibi. The pigeon came and landed on Shibi's lap. And the hunter eagle wanted the pigeon back from the king. So, King Shibi, since this pigeon had taken shelter of King Shibi, the king did not want that eagle to take away this pigeon.

**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of Maharaj Shibi, highlighting his willingness to sacrifice his own flesh and eventually his entire body to protect the pigeon, leading to the revelation of Indra and Agni and their blessings.

Kill it and eat the flesh. So, the king wanted to give some other meat to eat for the eagle. And he requested that eagle, please do not kill this pigeon because it has taken shelter of me. I should be giving it protection. So, do not kill this pigeon. You want some flesh, I will give you some other flesh. Now, this hunter bird, the eagle refused to accept the king's offer. The eagle refused to accept this offer by King Shibi. And later on it was settled that the eagle would accept flesh from the body of the king, and it would accept flesh from the body of the king equivalent to the weight of the pigeon. So the king agreed for that, okay, you want my flesh, I'll give you, but don't kill this pigeon. So he was so generous in giving charity. But now listen what happened. The king began to cut flesh from his body to give a weight of his own flesh equivalent to the pigeon's weight. So there was a balance and one side the pigeon was kept in the balance, other side Shibi's flesh was being put in the balance to match the weight of the flesh that was to be given to this eagle, the hunter bird. But what happened when this weighing was going on, the mystic pigeon always remained heavier. How much ever Shibi was cutting his flesh and putting in the balance in the pan of the balance. So then what did Shibi do? How much will I cut? I myself will sit on the pan. I'll offer my entire body because any amount of flesh I am cutting off and putting it doesn't seem to be balancing the weight of the pigeon. So when he put himself in the balance, I will offer my entire body because any amount of self on the balance to equate with the pigeon, the devatas were pleased with him. So charitable, [he] sacrificed his own life even for the sake of saving the pigeon which has surrendered to him, so protector of the surrendered. So then Indra and Agni disclosed their identity and the king was, Shibi was blessed by them. Devarshi Narada also

glorified Maharaj Shibi for his great achievements in specifically giving charity and protection to the surrendered. It is also said this Maharaj Shibi sacrificed his own son for the satisfaction of human beings in his kingdom. So that's another story in the scriptures. So in this way, Shibi was very famous for giving charity and sacrificing his personal interest for the sake of giving protection to somebody else who is a surrendered soul. So therefore, it is said here, this child Pariksit would be as generous in giving charity and as perfect in giving protection to surrendered souls like Shibi. So he was to become a second Shibi in charity and protection. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

First of all, Srila Prabhupada says, "There are many Bharatas in history, of which three are very famous." Three Bharatas are famous. Who are the three Bharatas who are very famous? The first one is the Bharata who is the brother of the king, the brother of Lord Ramachandra, who is actually the son of Dasharatha Maharaj, that Bharata. You can say Dasharathi Bharata. The second Bharata who is famous in history, Vedic history, is Bharata, the son of king Rishabha. The Lord appeared as Rishabhadeva, king Rishabhadeva, emperor of the world, and he had one hundred sons. Of these one hundred sons, the eldest one was Bharata Maharaj. That Bharata Maharaj, he renounced his kingdom at a very young age, practiced very nice austerities, and became advanced spiritually. But towards the end of his life, when he was performing tapasya, after retiring from his kingdom, he got attached to a deer, and he had to take a deer's body in his next life, even though he was spiritually very advanced, and he was given remembrance of his spiritual activities by Krishna within his heart, even in the body of a deer. And he was very, very cautious not to get misled by any material, even in the body of a deer. And then he was again given a chance to take birth in a brahmana family, and in that life, third life, he perfected himself and went back to God. So that Bharata is also famous, the second Bharata. And the third Bharata who is famous is mentioned in this verse: Bharata, the son of Maharaj Dushyanta. He is also very famous.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the comprehensive knowledge of Vedic scriptures with the limited scope of modern-day knowledge, emphasizing the vastness of universal history described in the Vedas.

So, all these Bharatas are historically known to the universe. See, the scriptures describe universal history. And nowadays, the discussion about history is only about some incidents that happened on this planet in the past. But various literature are describing to us the history of the universe. There are millions of planets in one universe. There are millions of universes in this material creation. And apart from this material creation, there is spiritual world which is not created, which is eternal. So all these are described in the Vedic literature, the Vedic scriptures. So the Vedic scriptures give us knowledge which is comprehensive and vast as compared to the body of knowledge that we have in our modern day. The Vedic scriptures give us knowledge which is very, very limited and tiny and incomplete, imperfect knowledge.

**Summary:** The lecture explains how the earth planet came to be known as Bharata Varsha due to King Bharata, the son of Rishabhadeva, while also highlighting the importance of Bharata, the son of Maharaj Dushyanta.

So, the three Bharatas are historically known to the universe. This earth planet is known as Bharata, Bharata Varsha. Bharata Varsha is known as Bharata Varsha due to King Bharata, the son of Rishabhadeva, the second Bharata I mentioned. After Rishabhadeva's son Bharata was ruling, this earth planet became famous Bharata Varsha. Before the reign of this Bharata, king of this earth planet, and all the various planets created, Bharata became the son of King Rishabha. This land was known as Ilaavrita Varsha, and just after the coronation of the King Bharata, who was the son of Rishabha, this land became famous as Bharata Varsha. Now Srila Prabhupada says, even though the second Bharata is very famous because the land itself, the planet earth itself, is famous as Bharata Varsha, nonetheless Bharata, the son of Maharaj Dushyanta, was no less important. He was also a very great personality, and his history is also recorded in our scriptures.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Bharata's birth to Shakuntala and Maharaj Dushyanta, and his extraordinary strength as a child growing up in the forest, even comparing him to Tarzan.

He is the son of the famous beauty Shakuntala. So it is described elsewhere, Marnellos themselves fell in love with Shakuntala in the forest, and Bharata was conceived as the son of Maharaj Dushyanta and Shakuntala. Now this Maharaj, he forgot his wife Shakuntala by the curse of one Kanvamuni. The details are given elsewhere. Here Prabhupada mentions briefly the history, and therefore this child Bharata was brought up in the forest by his mother, son of a Kshatriya king, and this child was raised by the mother in the forest itself. Now this child Bharata, even in his childhood, he was so powerful that he challenged the lions and elephants in the forest and would fight with them as little children play with cats and dogs. This much powerful this Bharata, the son of Maharaja Dushyanta, was even when he was a young boy raised in the forest by his mother Shakuntala. Now it is said because of the boys becoming so strong, single-handedly he could combat elephants and lions in the forest, so he became so strong, more than the so-called Tarzan. There are fictitious characters created nowadays who are actually not real people who have got any strength.

**Key Quote:** "This boy Bharata is not a fictitious character created by some imaginative story writer. No he is a real person and as a boy he was even more powerful than the so-called Tarzan."
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the reality of Bharata's character and his strength, explaining why he was called Sarva Dhaman and how the Pandavas are addressed as Bharata due to their lineage.

They are characters created for the sake of some entertainment for children. So one such character Prabhupada mentions, Tarzan. This boy Bharata is not a fictitious character created by some imaginative story writer. No, he is a real person, and as a boy he was even more powerful than the so-called Tarzan. Therefore the rishis in the forest, they called him Sarva Dhaman. This means one who is able to control everyone else is so powerful, Sarva Dhaman, they called him like that. And Srila Prabhupada says this Maharaja Bharata, son of Dushyanta, is fully described in the Mahabharata Aadi Parva. Now the Pandavas or the Kurus are saying that his son was a boy, are sometimes addressed as Bharata. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna addresses Arjuna as Bharata.

**Key Quote:** "There is a cycle that is operating in this earth planet."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the importance of performing sacrifices (yajña) for the welfare of the kingdom, highlighting the natural cycle of food production, rainfall, and the role of yajña in maintaining this balance.

So that is because the Pandavas are born in the dynasty of the famous Maharaj Bharata, who was the son of King Dushyanta. That's why the Pandavas are called Bharata or the members of the Kuru dynasty also. Even Dhritarashtra is addressed as Bharata by Sanjaya in the Bhagavad Gita. So that name Bharata for the descendant of Bharata, the son of King Dushyanta. So this Bharata was famous for performing many many sacrifices. A king should perform sacrifices for the sake of the welfare of the whole kingdom, because in the Bhagavad Gita it is explained that annad bhavanti bhutani parjanyad anna sambhavah yajnyad bhavati parjanyo yajna karma samutbhavah.

### Food Production, Rainfall, Yajna, Prescribed Duties

**Key Quote:** "So production of grains, sufficient quantity of grains for all creatures, humans and the animals and the other birds etc. depends on proper rainfall."
**Summary:** The lecture elaborates on the dependence of food production on rainfall, which in turn is dependent on the performance of yajña, emphasizing the importance of prescribed duties for the welfare of all beings.

There is a cycle that is operating in this earth planet. What is that? That all living beings subsist on food grains directly or indirectly. The vegetarians directly subsist on food grains, but the non-vegetarians they subsist on animals who subsist on food grains. So therefore directly or indirectly all living beings are dependent on food grains. And the food grains are due to rains, proper rainfall. We know that when there is excessive rain or there is scarcity of rain then there is no proper production of grains. So production of grains, sufficient quantity of grains for all creatures, humans and the animals and the other birds etc. depends on proper rainfall, because we cannot manufacture food grains in factories and industries and all kinds of scientific research. We cannot manufacture food grains. It has to be grown on the land, fertile land. And even if the land is fertile, unless there is proper rainfall, you cannot get sufficient grains production. So now the rains are dependent on yajñād bhavati parjanyo. Parjanyo means rainfall. Rainfall is dependent on proper performance of yajña. So yajña performance by the human beings ensures adequate rainfall, not too much, not too little. And if there is proper rainfall, there is plenty of grain production, and that grain production will nourish all creatures on this earth planet, human beings and the lower creatures also, everyone. And this is the arrangement of the Supreme Lord. Yajña karma samudbhavaha. Yajña means to perform prescribed duties, not self-assumed duties.

**Key Quote:** "Duty is something that is prescribed in this jastra for the overall welfare of the entire population of this world."
**Summary:** The speaker stresses that duties are prescribed for the welfare of all, and the king's role in performing yajña leads to prosperity for the entire country, foretelling Pariksit's future role.

Nowadays people think, oh my duty is something, according to what I think is my duty. No. Duty is something that is prescribed in this shastra for the overall welfare of the entire population of this world. Otherwise, by artificial means, we cannot get our necessities. Not possible. There will only be a failure of the administrators to provide for the necessities of the people of the country by artificial methods is not going to work. So Bhagavad Gita says the natural method is they should perform yajña. And the foremost person to perform yajña is the king, the ruler, the leader of all the people in the world. He should perform yajña. And when he performs yajña, there is prosperity for all the people of the country. And this Dushyanta was famous for having performed many sacrifices. Similarly, Pariksit also will perform sacrifices for the welfare of the entire kingdom, and there will be prosperity because of this child growing up to rule the whole world. That is what is being foretold by the brahmanas to King Yudhishthira.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse to be discussed, focusing on the prophecy that Pariksit will be a great bowman like Arjuna, and the qualities of a powerful king.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 21st verse of the 12th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This will be part 1 of this verse which will be discussed.

And specifically, there is mention of two Arjunas here. Arjunayor Dwayoho, two Arjunas. Prabhupada mentions in the purport, in history there are two famous Arjunas. One is Kartyavirya Arjuna, who was the king of Haihaya. And the other Arjuna is the famous grandfather of King Pariksit, who is Arjuna the Pandava. Both the Arjunas are famous for their bowmanship. And the child Pariksit is foretold to be equal to both of them, particularly in fighting. King should be a powerful fighter, yes, to subdue the miscreants, to protect the innocent, to give protection to the brahmanas, the women, the children, the saintly persons. Otherwise, if the king is not powerful enough, then these miscreants and rogues and ruffians and thieves will plunder and loot from the innocent people. There will be chaos. So, Pariksit is foretold to be equal to both these Arjunas who are very, very, very powerful in fighting.

**Key Quote:** "Arjuna is not an ordinary person."
**Summary:** The lecture details the lineage of Arjuna, his divine birth through Kunti and Indra, and the auspicious circumstances surrounding his birth.

Now, Srila Prabhupada gives a description of Pandava Arjuna, the Arjuna who is the grandfather of this Pariksit. Arjuna's son was Abhimanyu. Abhimanyu's son was Pariksit. In this way, Pandava Arjuna is the grandfather of Pariksit. So, Prabhupada mentions Pandava Arjuna is the great hero of the Bhagavad Gita. Bhagavad Gita was spoken by Krishna to Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. And that's how we know Bhagavad Gita as the most famous scripture. It gives us the essence of the Vedic wisdom. Arjuna is the kshatriya son of Maharaj. Arjuna is the son of Pandu. Queen Kunti Devi could call for any one of the demigods. And thus she called Indra, because Kunti could not beget children through Pandu. So, it is allowed in the former ages that a lady, chaste woman, chaste wife, can beget children through the husband's brother, if the husband is unable to conceive children in his own wife. So, this is called Devarayana Sutodhpakti, and this is prohibited in Kali Yuga. But they were, Kunti and Pandu were living in Dwapar Yuga. So, in Dwapar Yuga, Kunti Devi, she had one mantra given by Durvasamuni, and thus she could call any one of the devatas to conceive a child for Pandu. So, Kunti called on Indra, and Arjuna was born. So, Arjuna is therefore a plenary part of the heavenly king Indra. Arjuna is not an ordinary person. He was. Arjuna has many names. He was born in the month of Phalguna. Therefore, he is also called Phalguni. When he appeared as the son of Kunti, his future greatness is proclaimed by air messages. This is the fame of Arjuna. Even at the time of his birth, it is declared through air messages that he is a great personality who has taken birth. And all the important personalities from different parts of the universe, such as the devatas, the demigods, the Gandharvas, the Adityas from the sun globe, the Rudras, the Vasus, the Nagas, the different Rishis of importance, the Apsaras, all attended the ceremony of the birth of Arjuna.

So, very important personality in the whole universe, Arjuna. The Apsaras pleased everyone by their heavenly dances and songs. Vasudeva, the father of Lord Krishna, and the maternal uncle of Arjuna. Arjuna's mother is Kunti. Kunti's brother is Vasudeva. Therefore, Vasudeva, the father of Lord Krishna, is actually the maternal uncle of Arjuna. Vasudeva sent his priest, representative Kashyapa, to purify Arjuna by all the prescribed samskaras, or reformatory processes. So, Arjuna's samskaras were done by Kashyapa Muni, or Kashyapa Rishi, sent by Vasudeva. His name giving samskara, it's called Namakarna samskara, was performed in the presence of the Rishis, residents of Shatashunga. The famous Rishis. Arjuna married four wives: Draupadi, Subhadra, Chitrangada, and Ulupi, from whom he got four sons, one each from each of the wives, of the names Shrutakirti, Abhimanyu, Babruvahana, and Iravaan respectively. Means Draupadi, through Draupadi, Arjuna had a son by name Shrutakirti. Through Subhadra, Subhadra is Krishna's sister. Arjuna married Subhadra, and through Subhadra, he had a son Abhimanyu. Abhimanyu died in the battle of Kurukshetra. And Abhimanyu's son is, Abhimanyu and Subhadra's son is Parikshit. Sorry. Abhimanyu's son is Subhadra. Abhimanyu and Uttara's son is Parikshit. And Arjuna's wife Chitrangada, their son was Babruvahana. And Arjuna's wife Ulupi, their son was Iravaan. So, he had four sons through four wives.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Arjuna saving Dronacharya from a crocodile and being rewarded with the Brahma Shira weapon, emphasizing the importance of a proper guru for learning how to use such weapons.

Arjuna saved the Acharya, that is Dronacharya, from the attack of a crocodile and Dronacharya being pleased with him, rewarded him with a weapon of the name Brahma Shira. Many of these weapons are very, very powerful weapons. And unless one learns them from a proper guru, one will be unable to use those weapons. And many of them are mantra weapons. They are mantra weapons. So, the perfect chanting of the mantra as heard from the expert spiritual master only will enable a student to learn that in such a way that he can use that weapon when required.

So, then it is also mentioned that Arjuna besieged a city of the name Ahichatra, belonging to Maharaj Drupada and after taking it over, he gave it to Dronacharya. The confidential treatment of the weapon Brahma Shira was explained to Arjuna and Dronacharya was promised by Arjuna that he would use the weapon if necessary when Dronacharya personally became an enemy of Arjuna. In this way, Dronacharya forecasted the future battle of Kurukshetra in which Dronacharya was going to fight. Dronacharya was on the opposite side of Arjuna. See, the Acharya is teaching a student and he is able to foresee the future and for the sake of Arjuna to become victorious in the battle of Kurukshetra against the Kauravas, Dronacharya is teaching him in the student days, this particular Brahma Shira.

**Summary:** The speaker explores the philosophical reasons behind Dronacharya's willingness to be killed by his disciple, emphasizing detachment from the body and the glory of sacrificing for the right cause, ending the session with a promise to continue the discussion.

So, Arjuna can use this weapon to win against the Kauravas and he can even use that to kill Dronacharya himself. So, what is the secret understanding? Why Dronacharya would teach his student a particular astra, how to use which the student will use against the teacher himself? So these are all extraordinary incidents described in the scriptures as to how a learned person knows I am NOT the body, death doesn't belong to the soul, death is only for the body and the body is going to die regardless of what happens in course of one's duration of living in this material body. If I don't die by some astra, I may die by some other method or means. So death I cannot escape, but dying for the right cause, sacrificing life for the right cause makes one glorious, makes one advanced spiritually. So that is the principle we have to understand why Dronacharya was willing to be even killed by his own disciple by teaching the disciple the secret Brahma Shira astra mantra. We will continue discussing this in the next.

**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of Drupada and Dronacharya, focusing on their friendship in Gurukul and Drupada's promise to share his kingdom.

The history is that Drupada and Dronacharya, when they were young students, they studied in the same Guruko, and they were good friends in the Guruko. But this friendship was between the rich son of the rich Kshatriya. Drupada was the son of a very powerful and rich Kshatriya, and Dronacharya was the son of a poor Brahmana. So when Drupada grew up, he became the king of the province called Panchaladesha, very rich. And Dronacharya grew up, but he was just a poor Brahmana's son. So he was another poor Brahmana. Now during the Gurukul days, because they were very good friends, once Drupada, in a, on a certain occasion, he promised to Dronacharya, "When you grow up, don't worry. I will give you half of my kingdom because I am the only son of my father. So I will give you half of my kingdom. Don't worry. You don't have to suffer in poverty like your father." So Dronacharya took these words of Drupada to heart, and he always remembered, even when they went back to their own country, when they went back to their own home after completing the Gurukul education. And Dronacharya was living in utter poverty. So after he got married and he had a son, Ashwatthama, small boy, the boy one day began to cry to his mother that "I have not tasted what is real milk. All my friends say milk is very, very nourishing and very, very tasty and very nice to drink, but I don't know what is milk." So Dronacharya's wife, Ashwatthama's mother, she felt very bad that they were in such poverty stricken condition, that they could not feed their child cow's milk. So she told her husband Dronacharya that "We are so poor. We cannot even feed our child some cow's milk." So Dronacharya said, "Don't worry. I will go to my friend, my friend from Gurukul days, Maharaj Drupada, and I will beg from him in charity a cow. He has promised to give me half his kingdom, but I don't want his wealth in that way, but I will just ask for a cow donation."

So he set out from his place to visit Maharaj Drupada in Panchala Desha. And because he was a brahmana, there was no restriction for brahmanas going and meeting kings. So he was let in. And when he came in presence of Drupada, Drupada looked at him. "Who are you?" So then he said, "You don't remember me? I am your friend from Gurukul days." Then Drupada somehow, he thought it is an insult that a wretched, poor person is claiming friendship with a rich and powerful king. So then Drupada, he told Drona that "Friendship is always between equals. So you are a poor and wretched, poverty stricken person. How can you be my friend? What is my status and what is your status?" So Dronacharya was feeling very, very insulted that this Drupada has become very proud of his power and his position and his wealth. "I am going to teach him a lesson." So thinking, he did not utter a single word. He just walked back to his own place.

house shellac house into which the Pandavas were sent and before Duryodhana could set fire the Pandavas escaped through a secret tunnel they dug in the earth and when they were living incognito after escaping that is when Drupada decided to hold a Swayamvara ceremony for marrying Draupadi and he arranged Draupadi's personal selection of a groom who could pierce the eye of a fish hanging on the ceiling. This trick was made especially because only Arjuna could do it and he somehow thought that Arjuna was killed in that fire of the shellac house but actually the Pandavas had escaped. When the Pandavas heard about Drupada's deciding to hold a Swayamvara ceremony for marrying his daughter the Pandavas went there for that ceremony. Of course they were living incognito as brahmanas. They were dressed as some poor brahmanas. So they went there and when all the other Kshatriya kings were there they were dressed as some poor brahmanas. When the Pandavas heard that the Kshatriya kings failed to pass the test set by Drupada then Arjuna in the guise of a poor brahmana he passed the test and Draupadi was garlanded sorry Draupadi garlanded Arjuna though she did not know he was Arjuna. And later on Lord Krishna disclosed Arjuna's identity to Balaram and when Drupada came to know that this poor brahmana is Arjuna he was very very very happy to marry his daughter to Arjuna.

These are words spoken by the brahmanas who are preparing the horoscope of the child, newly born child Parikshit, and at such a time they read the horoscope and foretell the future of the child because Yudhishthira was anxious that this only surviving descendant of the entire Kuru dynasty, will he be alive? Will he be as worthy as his forefathers? That was his anxiety. So the brahmanas assured him this child is a highly qualified child. So he was specially protected by Krishna when he was in his mother's womb and he is going to be an excellent because somebody who is a pure devotee is qualified with all wonderful qualifications yasyasthi bhakti bhagavati akinchana sarvair gunaistatra samasate suraha.

**Key Quote:** "But we have to purify our consciousness and become free from all the contaminating bad qualities, which are a result of the material contamination in contact with material nature."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the purification of consciousness through yoga, emphasizing the removal of material contamination to reveal inherent good qualities.

This statement is in the Bhagavatam that a pure devotee has all good qualities. Actually, every living being, a spirit soul, has all good qualities, but it's only because we are covered by the material contamination that our good qualities get covered and the contamination which brings forth all kinds of bad qualities. So as spirit soul, nobody is a bad person. No living being is a bad person, a spirit soul. But we have to purify our consciousness and become free from all the contaminating bad qualities, which are a result of the material contamination in contact with material nature. So therefore the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says that by practicing yoga, Yogam Atma Vishuddhi, you purify your heart of all the dirty things, then the good qualities will shine forth from a purified heart. And the process of purification is the process of yoga. But among the yoga processes, the best process is the process of Bhakti Yoga.

**Summary:** The speaker returns to the description of Parikshit and then details the family history of Arjuna, including his four sons from four wives and the circumstances of Subhadra's marriage to Arjuna.

So the description is being given here about this child, that this child Parikshit will be as expert bowman when he grows up as the grandfather of the child. The child Parikshit will be as expert bowman when he grows up as the grandfather of the child. First is the physical body, then the spiritual body, then the spiritual body.

Parikshit is the son of Abhimanyu and Uttara. But this Abhimanyu, he was killed in the battle of Kurukshetra. And therefore Parikshit was born as the posthumous child of Abhimanyu. Then it is also described, so Prabhupada has clearly explained the four sons who were born of the four wives of Arjuna. Through Draupadi, Arjuna had a son by name Shrutakirti. Through Subhadra, he had a son by name Abhimanyu. Through Chitrangada, he had a son by name Babruvahana. And through Ulupi, he had a son by name Irawana.

**Key Quote:** "Arjuna satisfied the fire god, Agnideva, by setting fire to the Khandava forest. And thus the fire god gave him one weapon."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts Arjuna's various achievements, including obtaining weapons from the fire god and other demigods, defeating Indra, and assisting Yudhishthira.

Further it is described, Arjuna satisfied the fire god, Agnideva, by setting fire to the Khandava forest. And thus the fire god gave him one weapon. Arjuna actually was preparing for the big battle of Kurukshetra because the Pandavas were excited. They were exiled by Duryodhana when they were cheated in a gambling match. They were cheated by Duryodhana and they were exiled. So after that exile period was over, Duryodhana refused to give back their kingdom to the Pandavas. So then war was inevitable. But in the meantime, during exile, Arjuna actually was preparing. So he got one weapon from the fire god. And when the Khandava forest was set on fire, Indra became angry. And Indra, assisted by all other demigods, began fighting with Arjuna because Arjuna set fire to the forest. So all the devatas headed by Indra, they were defeated by Arjuna. And Indra returned to his heavenly kingdom after suffering defeat at the hands of Arjuna. Then Arjuna also promised protection to one Mayadanava or Mayasura. And Mayasura, being protected by Arjuna actually, he presented one valuable conch shell celebrated as the devadatta. Similarly, Arjuna received many other valuable weapons from Indradeva when Indradeva was satisfied to see the chivalry of Arjuna. When Yudhishthira was disappointed in defeating Jarasandha, then Arjuna gave assurance to Yudhishthira that Arjuna, Bhima and Krishna will go to Magadha to challenge Jarasandha. And when they went, Bhima was able to kill Jarasandha. And in that way, Yudhishthira was able to hold the Rajasuya sacrifice. Then Arjuna also underwent severe types of penances when he was rewarded by Indradeva. Shiva also once wanted to try the strength of Arjuna, and Shiva disguised as an aborigin, he met Arjuna. There is a fight between Shiva disguised as the aborigin and Arjuna, and Shiva was satisfied with Arjuna's chivalrous nature, his bravery and his skill in fighting, and Shiva disclosed his identity. So, Arjuna prayed to Lord Shiva in all humbleness, and when Shiva was satisfied with Arjuna's behavior, Shiva presented his Pashupatastra to Arjuna. In this way, Arjuna acquired many other important weapons from different devatas. He got Dandastra from Yamaraj. He got Pashastra from Varuna. He got Antaradhanaastra from Kuvera. And actually, Arjuna was fully equipped to fight that battle of Kurukshetra in order to win back Kurukshetra, win back the kingdom from Duryodhana. Even when Duryodhana was under the clutches of some Gandharvas, that time, Arjuna actually fought against the Gandharvas and released Duryodhana. And it is also described that

**Summary:** The speaker concludes the description of Arjuna's life, mentioning his role in the Bhagavad Gita, his actions after Krishna's disappearance, and his journey to Mahaprasthana, before ending the session with a thank you and Hare Krishna.

Arjuna was the one to whom the philosophical discourses on the Bhagavad Gita were spoken by Lord Krishna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. And even on the battlefield, Arjuna fought very very wonderfully against the Kauravas. And after the disappearance of Lord Krishna, the message was brought by Arjuna to Maharaja Yudhishtira. And Arjuna actually, when Vasudeva passed away after the disappearance of Krishna, then Arjuna performed the funeral ceremony of Vasudeva in the absence of Krishna. So at last, when advised by Vasudeva, all the Pandava brothers headed for Mahaprasthana. On the way, at the request of his brother, Arjuna gave up all important weapons as useless, and he proceeded on Mahaprasthana. So this is the description of the history of the Pandava Arjuna as given by Srila Prabhupada in this purport. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "One should be a lamb at home and a lion in the chase."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the comparison of Parikshit to a lion, explaining the qualities of a Kshatriya, emphasizing strength in protecting citizens and chasing enemies, but humility at home.

Wonderful qualities of the child Parikshit are being described by the Brahmanas who are performing the Jatakarma samskara for the child. Yudhishthira is hearing all this and he is very satisfied that such a qualified child has actually taken birth in his family. So in the purport Srila Prabhupada explains, "One is compared to the lion when one is very strong in chasing an enemy among the animals in the jungle. The king of the jungle or the forest is the lion because the lion is very strong in chasing an enemy. One should be a lamb at home and a lion in the chase." So this is the moral instruction that however strong one is or powerful one is, that strength or power is not shown at home. At home in front of elders, family members and other well-wishers one should be very mild and humble. But somebody... Who is a Kshatriya he should be like a lion in the chase, means he should be very strong in chasing the enemy. And Srila Prabhupada says the lion is never a failure when it comes to chasing an animal.

The battle is always fought till one of the two kings or Kshatriyas are defeated and they are killed in the battle. So a Kshatriya is never afraid of fighting an enemy, that is the courage in battle. So this Parikshit will be very very courageous and very strong in protecting the citizens and

Now Srila Prabhupada explains the speciality about Himalaya mountains. There are many mountains all over the planet earth but among them something special about the Himalaya mountains. What is special? Srila Prabhupada says the Himalaya mountains are famous for all richness. What are the different kinds of riches in the Himalaya mountains? There are innumerable caves to live in, especially the Himalayas, there are caves where anybody can live, numberless trees of good fruits to eat, plenty of fruit trees are there. If you have been to Srinagar, Srinagar is a place where you can live in the Himalayas, there is a badrikashrama, Badrinath in the Himalayas, surrounding that area there are many lychee trees and in season they give so much fruits, there are fruits which fall off the trees when they are fully ripe and the local people they just pick those fruits from the ground. So plenty of these lychee trees are there in some portions of the Himalaya mountains, there are apple trees. Like this there are numberless trees of good fruits to eat, then there are good Springs to drink water from and springs are also hot water springs, cold water springs, all kinds of springs are there but they have only one specific green aerated spring to drink from and it is there are some springs to drink from in winter, there are some springs to drink from also there are big springs to drink from on every lake and major springs to drink from, nice springs are there and they are rich in minerals so they are very very healthy and they are very satisfying there, they can quench the thirst very easily and whoever takes bath in these springs are refreshed, the water is very refreshing and there are profuse drugs and minerals to cure diseases, all kinds of minerals and herbs are available in the Himalayas. So Srila Prabhupada says any man who is not materially prosperous can take shelter of these great mountains, the Himalayan mountains and he'll be provided with everything required for shelter, there are caves for taking bath, there are nice springs even hot water springs are there and then there are nice trees with which give nice fruits and there are drugs and minerals to cure diseases, everything is available in the Himalayas both the materialist and the spiritualist can take advantage of the great shelter of the Himalayas now

**Summary:** The speaker shifts to the comparison of Parikshit to the earth, emphasizing the earth's tolerance and provision of sustenance, comparing it to a mother.

Therefore the child is described as great shelter like the Himalaya mountains. No other mountains are as rich in so many resources like the Himalaya mountains. So these Himalaya mountains are very special. Then it is also described by Srila Prabhupada. On the surface of the earth there are so many disturbances caused by the inhabitants. In the modern age the people have begun to detonate atomic weapons on the surface of the earth. And still the earth is forbearing to the inhabitants like a mother who excuses her little child. Earth is called mother earth. In the Vedic conception there are seven kinds of mothers: Atmamata, Gurupatni, Brahmani, Rajapatnika, Dhenu, Dhatri, Prithvi. These are the seven mothers. Prithvi, mother earth. So because the earth provides all our necessities. We grow grains on the surface of the earth in rich fertile places. Then we cannot manufacture these grains in some factories. Not possible. We can only grow them on the surface of the earth. Then there are so many trees, fruit bearing trees. And then in the earth there are minerals and metals. We can mine the earth for so many minerals and metals. Like that the earth provides everything for our sustenance.

Like even though people are doing so many destructive activities. But earth never fails to provide for the inhabitants of this planet. Whatever their basic needs are.

So Srila Prabhupada says, "Parents are always tolerant to children for all sorts of mischievous activities the child may perform." An ideal king may be possessed of all these blessings.

**Key Quote:** "In both cases, the comparison is equally good because both of them are recognized representatives of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the comparison of Pariksit to Yudhishthira and Brahma in terms of mental equanimity, explaining their roles in welfare work and how they represent the Supreme Lord.

So Srila Prabhupada has explained little elaborately in the purport how these personalities who are referred to are well known for their specific extraordinary qualities. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, mental equanimity refers both to Maharaj Yudhishthira and to Brahma, the grandfather of all living beings. According to Sridhar Swami, one of the commentators on the Bhagavatam, one of the previous Acharyas, the grandfather referred to is Brahma. How is Brahma the grandfather of all of us? Brahma's son, Swayambhuva Manu, that Swayambhuva Manu is the father of mankind. So all human beings have Swayambhuva Manu as their father and Swayambhuva Manu's father is Brahma. Therefore Brahma is the grandfather of all human beings. In that way, Brahma is referred to as the grandfather in this particular comparison, Pitamaha Samaha Samye. And then according to Srila Vishwanachakruti Thakur, another great Acharya, previous Acharya in our Sampradaya, he has written a commentary on the Bhagavatam. Srila Vishwanachakruti Thakur says, the grandfather referred to here is Maharaj Yudhishthira himself. Now Srila Prabhupada says, of course Yudhishthira is the grandfather of Pariksit. Pariksit's father is Abhimanyu. Abhimanyu is the son of Arjuna and Arjuna's brother, Yudhishthira. So therefore Yudhishthira is in the position of the grandfather of child Pariksit. Now Srila Prabhupada says something very interesting. In both cases, the comparison is equally good because both of them are recognized representatives of the Supreme Lord. Both Brahma and Yudhishthira are recognized representatives of the Supreme Lord. Thus both of them have to maintain mental equanimity being engaged in welfare work for the living being.

**Key Quote:** "Anyone in a position of responsibility has to have that equanimity of mind to do the welfare work in spite of criticism from the very people whom they are trying to do welfare activity."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the challenges of welfare work, using the example of Brahma being criticized by the gopis for creating eyelids, and emphasizes the importance of mental equanimity in the face of criticism.

Brahma is engaged in the welfare of all the living beings in the whole universe. That is Brahma's position. And Yudhishthira, as the emperor of the world, he was always engaged in welfare work of the citizens of the whole world. So Srila Prabhupada says, to be able to do welfare work, any responsible executive agent at the top of administration has to tolerate different types of onslaughts from the very persons for whom he works. Example is given by Srila Prabhupada. Brahma was criticized even by the gopis, the highest perfectional devotees of the Supreme Lord Krishna. The gopis were divided. The gopis were dissatisfied with the work of Brahma because Brahma as creator of this particular universe created eyelids which obstructed their seeing Lord Krishna. How were the eyelids obstructing our seeing? That Prabhupada explains, they could not tolerate, the gopis could not tolerate a moment's blinking of the eyes for it kept them from seeing their beloved Lord Krishna. When you blink, you have to keep blinking the eyes. So when you blink, for a moment, we are not able to see the object of affection. So the gopis felt that why has Brahma created these eyelids which momentarily stop us from seeing Krishna. So what to speak of others who are naturally very critical of every aspect of life, the action of a responsible man. Even the gopis, the perfectional devotees, they criticise Brahma for making these eyelids which block their vision of Krishna. So what to speak of others? So the conclusion is that anyone in a position of responsibility has to have that equanimity of mind to do the welfare work in spite of criticism from the very people whom they are trying to do welfare activity. Similarly, Maharaj Yudhishthira had to cross over many difficult situations created by his enemies and he proved to be the most perfect maintainer of mental equanimity in all critical circumstances. So, both are fitting comparisons

**Key Quote:** "Lord Shiva is a celebrated demigod who awards gifts to beggars."
**Summary:** The speaker transitions to the comparison of Pariksit to Lord Shiva in terms of munificence, describing Shiva's generosity and using the example of Ravana to illustrate how easily obtained gifts can be misused.

for equanimity of mind. The next, Lord Shiva is described. Lord Shiva is a celebrated demigod who awards gifts to beggars. His name is therefore Ashutosh or one who is very easily pleased. He is also called Bhutanatha or the lord of the common folk who are mainly attached to him because of his munificent gifts even without consideration of the after effects. Shiva is liberal in giving gifts to whoever approaches him and begs for some particular benediction. Shiva liberally gives that. So, it is described here by Srila Prabhupada that Ravana was very attached to Lord Shiva and by easily pleasing him, Ravana became so powerful and he wanted to challenge the authority of Lord Rama. By Ravana's grace, Ravana became very visible and powerful. Lord Rama's grace was so great that Ravana became powerful. And he misused this power in challenging Lord Rama. Ravana was never helped by Lord Shiva when Ravana was fighting against Rama, because the Supreme Lord is not only Lord of everyone, he is also the Lord of Shiva. So when the battle was going on between Ravana and Rama, Shiva could not help Ravana. Then once Shiva awarded a benediction to one Asura by name Vrikasura. And this benediction was an awkward benediction and it was also very disturbing. Vrikasura became empowered by the grace of Lord Shiva to vanquish Ravana.

**Key Quote:** "Lord Shiva never denies anyone any sort of gift. He is very liberal."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the discussion of Lord Shiva's generosity with the story of Vrikasura, who received a dangerous benediction from Shiva and was ultimately stopped by Vishnu, highlighting the potential downsides of indiscriminate giving.

Anyone's head simply by touching the head. This is the benediction that Vrikasura asked Shiva: whosoever head I touch, that person's head should immediately get cut off, just by its touch. So Shiva knew that this Asura is going to misuse this benediction. So when Shiva was refusing to give such a horrible benediction, then Vrikasura became very very restless, and he started cutting off the portions of flesh, his own flesh, and offering it to Shiva in sacrifice. So Shiva took compassion upon this foolish Asura and stopped him from killing himself in that way. And then Shiva had to give this stubborn Asura, Vrikasura, the benediction he wanted. Then what did he do? What did this fellow do, this Vrikasura, after he got the benediction? Although Shiva was the one who gave him the benediction, this cunning Asura, he wanted to make an experiment of the power of this benediction by touching the head of Lord Shiva. Thus Lord Shiva had to take shelter of Vishnu to save himself from this trouble. And Lord Vishnu, what did Vrikasura do? When Vrikasura went chasing, then Shiva took shelter of Vishnu and Vishnu confronted this Vrikasura. And by the illusory energy called Yogamaya, Vishnu was able to ask Vrikasura to make an experiment of this benediction by touching his own head. And so, Vrikasura under the illusion, he touched his own head to test whether the benediction is actually working or not. And in this way, Vishnu saved the whole world from the trouble being created by this cunning beggar of the demigods. So, why Prabhupada is narrating all this is because Lord Shiva never denies anyone any sort of gift. He is very liberal. He is therefore the most generous among the givers of benediction. Shiva is the most generous.

### Lord Vishnu, protection, goddess of fortune, economic development, illusion

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Instead of seeking directly the protection of the goddess of fortune, one should seek the protection of Vishnu."
**Summary:** The speaker moves to the comparison of Pariksit to Lord Vishnu, emphasizing Vishnu's role as the maintainer of all living beings and the ultimate source of protection, even for the goddess of fortune, and contrasting this with the illusory nature of material economic development.

Although, sometimes some kind of mistake also happens in granting benediction. Then the next description is about Lord Vishnu. It is described here, Rama means the goddess of fortune, Yatha Devo Rama Shrayah, and her shelter, Rama Devi or Lakshmi Devi, her shelter is Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu is the maintainer of all living beings. There are innumerable living beings, not only on the surface of this planet, but also in all other hundreds of thousands of planets in this universe. All of them are provided with all necessities of life for the progressive march towards the end of self-realization. The Upanishads say, Eko bahunam yo vidadhati kaman. That is the position of the Supreme Lord Vishnu or Krishna, that it is only the Supreme Lord who maintains all living beings. But, in spite of this protection by the Lord, Srila Prabhupada says, on the path of sense gratification, these living beings are put into difficulty by the agency of Maya, the illusory energy. When we violate the laws of nature or laws of God, and we encroach on somebody else's property, or we give trouble to others unnecessarily, then the illusory energy actually punishes such wrongdoers. And it's only under illusion that the living beings who are desirous of enjoying this material world, they are traversing the path of a false plan of economic development. Such economic development is never successful because it is illusory. So, instead of seeking directly the protection of the goddess of fortune, one should seek the protection of Vishnu.

Because, even the goddess of fortune is sheltered by Vishnu. And therefore, Srila Prabhupada says, only Vishnu or his pure devotee can give protection to everyone. And therefore, it is predicted that Pariksit Maharaj, who was protected by Vishnu, himself would give all protection to people who wanted to live under his rule. In this way, it is being predicted about Pariksit.

So three comparisons have been made in this particular verse. This comparison is being made by the brahmanas who are performing the jatakarma samskara of child Parikshit, just after his birth. And brahmanas are addressing Maharaj Yudhishthira, who was inquiring from the brahmanas, "Will this child be having good qualities when he grows up, and will he be a proper successor for me?" That's the enquiry made by Yudhishthira. And in response to that, the brahmanas are describing this child is going to grow up to be a great devotee, a pure devotee of the Lord, and he'll have wonderful qualities. And they're mentioning specifically those, what are those qualities.

**Key Quote:** "Sarva dharman parityajya mam ekam sharanam vraja."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada's explanation of Krishna's final instruction in the Bhagavad Gita, emphasizing the importance of surrendering to Krishna and the difference between intelligent and less intelligent people in following this instruction.

So, as good as Lord Krishna by following in his footsteps. This is explained by Prabhupada in the purport. Srila Prabhupada says, the last instruction of Lord Sri Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita is that, one should give up everything and should follow in the footsteps of the Lord alone. Sarva dharman parityajya mam ekam sharanam vraja. This is Krishna's final instruction in the Bhagavad Gita, 18th chapter, 66th verse. Then further Srila Prabhupada says, less intelligent persons do not have the power to do good deeds. Less intelligent persons do not have the power to do good deeds. He said that, those who do not agree to this great instruction of the Lords, as ill luck would have it. So Srila Prabhupada is telling, unfortunately people don't agree to follow this instruction of Krishna. But, one who is actually intelligent catches up this sublime instruction and is immensely benefited. So, in this saying, spoke about, world there are two classes of people: intelligent people and not so intelligent people. So the less intelligent don't care to follow this particular instruction of Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, the intelligent ones they agree to follow this great instruction of Krishna, the final instruction and they get immense benefit. So what is the benefit they get? That Prabhupada explains further: foolish people do not know that association is the cause of acquiring qualities. Association is the cause

of acquiring qualities. If I want to develop good qualities or acquire good qualities, I should associate with people or a person who has got all good qualities. Now who is the one who has got all good qualities? Two different classes of people have all good qualities. One is a pure devotee of the Lord. One class of persons who has all good qualities is a pure devotee of the Lord. Yasyasti bhaktir bhagavati akinchana sarvair gunai sthatra samasate surah, the statement of the Bhagavatam fifth canto: a pure devotee has all the good qualities that are to be found in the devatas, in the divine persons, divine qualities, all good qualities. And the second category is obviously the Supreme Lord who has unlimited good qualities. Samasta guna Gana dhama, this is the statement of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur that the Supreme Lord is full of all wonderful qualities.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Association with fire makes an object hot."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of fire to explain how association with Krishna leads to acquiring His qualities, mentioning that a jiva can attain 78% of the Lord's godly qualities through intimate association.

So this is further explained by Srila Prabhupada. How does it work? Prabhupad says association with fire makes an object even in the material sense proper. He is explaining how does it work. He gives an example: any object you bring it in contact with fire, the object becomes hot. Therefore association with the supreme personality of Godhead makes one qualified like the Lord. Since the Lord is full of all good qualities, if we associate with Krishna, the Supreme Lord, we also get all the good qualities of Krishna. Now as regards getting the good qualities, Srila Prabhupada specifically says here, now as we have discussed previously, this is discussed earlier in one earlier purport, one can achieve 78 percent of the godly qualities by the Lord's intimate association. Close association is required with the Lord to get 78 percent of godly qualities which are there in the Lord. Now why 78 percent? Why not hundred percent? So that's a different subject, we don't have time to discuss that. A jiva can get maximum of 78 percent of the qualities of the Lord's intimate association, emits of the Lord in a very, very, very, very minute quantity because we're tiny, the Lord is unlimited, we are infinity simile, Lord is infinite. So he has infinite qualities, but of them the common qualities that are we found among various categories of personalities in the whole cosmic manifestation, 78 percent of the utilities of Jesus are put in theıyı about the déjà vu etc. So the idea is to get the qualities or qualities we see can arrive from the Lord daaráne rú lo såoy球ês Toryácus venus101 values that are 고양 zú qualitas men zú lar Shield of the Prophets Thehee yoSLah of Her eаяă truths and great qualities 78% of the Lord's godly qualities can be acquired by a human being

**Summary:** The speaker explains that following the instructions of the Lord is equivalent to associating with Him due to the absolute nature of the Lord and His instructions (Advayagyana).

by intimate association with Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now how to associate with the Lord? If that question is asked, Srila Prabhupada says, to follow the instructions of the Lord is to associate with the Lord. Why? Why is it said like this? Because the Lord is absolute. There is no difference between the Lord, His name, His form, His qualities, His instructions, there is no difference. Both are, all are absolute. Advayagyana, this is called Advayagyana. So there is no difference between the Lord and His instructions.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord is present everywhere and at all times."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that associating with Krishna is not about physical contact but about understanding His transcendental nature and omnipresence.

So to follow the instructions of the Lord means to associate with the Lord. Now, Srila Prabhupada also says that we should not mistakenly think to associate with Krishna is something like, a material presence. The Lord is not a material object whose presence one has to feel for such association. Like in our ordinary day to day dealings, material dealings, to associate means we think in terms of physical association, physical contact. But no, the Lord, you cannot have association with Krishna with krishna by physical contact, not possible. It's not possible because God is not at all having any material attributes, he does not have any material qualities or material characteristics. So with these material eyes we cannot see the transcendental form of the Lord, with our material senses we cannot perceive the presence of the Lord who is always transcendentally present, transcendentally available like that. And further Srila Prabhupada says the Lord is present everywhere and at all times. He is present everywhere because he is all-pervading and uh this is described in the Bhagavad-Gita, mayatatam idam sarvam jagat avyaktam i am all-pervading everywhere i am present krishna says in Bhagavad-Gita.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord can be present everywhere simultaneously."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the limited presence of jivas with the Lord's omnipresence as Brahman and Paramatma, reiterating that association with Him is possible by following His instructions.

So Lord is present everywhere and at all times eternally he is so always always is present he is not limited by time or space unlike us every jiva in this material world at least and even in the spiritual world we are present only in limited space and we are present in limited time even brahma even though he's got a fantastic long life span he also has to die with the divine presence with the dissolution of the entire universe at the end of brahma's lifespan case to die so nobody can remain in their material body forever neither even for the limited duration of time according to our lifespan we cannot be present everywhere simultaneously the lord can be present everywhere simultaneously not can he is he is present everywhere he is present everywhere as brahman and he is present everywhere as paramatma in this material world and therefore sheila prabhapa says it is quite possible to have his association simply by following his instruction

**Summary:** The speaker returns to the topic of Parikshit, explaining how his association with Krishna began in the womb when Krishna saved him from the Brahmastra.

because the Lord and his instruction are all identical with him, being absolute knowledge, Advaya Gyan. Now, regarding Parikshit, what is being told here? Parikshit, it was told that this child will be almost as good as Lord Sri Krishna by following in his footsteps. So, it is said here that Maharaj Parikshit associated with the Lord even from the womb of his mother up to the last day of his valuable life. We discussed this earlier, when Parikshit was in his mother's womb, one Ashwatthama, son of Dronacharya, he attempted to kill this last surviving descendant of the Pandavas. And he was killed by releasing one Brahmastra. Now, Brahmastra, it goes and strikes the target wherever the target is. And only the target, nothing else. But, Parikshit was saved from this attack of Brahmastra by Krishna personally. And Krishna entered the womb of Parikshit's mother, Uttara, Abhimanyu's wife. So, Krishna entered personally and protected the child.

**Key Quote:** "Even though I am equal to everyone, but I am specially inclined to my pure devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing Krishna's special interest in His devotees and how Parikshit continued to associate with Krishna until the end of his life, ultimately acquiring all good qualities, ending with Hare Krishna.

Because Krishna has interest in the pure devotee, special interest. Ye bhajan titumam bhaktya maite teshu chaapyaham. Krishna says this in the Bhagavad Gita. Even though I am equal to everyone, but I am specially inclined to my pure devotees. That's what Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita. So, accordingly, Krishna entered the womb of Mother Uttara, when Parikshit was present in that womb. And Krishna neutralized the Brahmastra and Parikshit was saved. And since that time, his association with Krishna began till the end of his life. The whole Bhagavatam is about Parikshit being cursed when he was ruling. He was cursed to die untimely, to die within seven days. And he accepted to quit the body after seven days. But he wanted to prepare. And he decided to go to holy place. And actually, Krishna prepared himself for quitting the body. And he had association of saintly persons, specially Srila Shukadeva Goswami, from whom he heard the Bhagavatam. So, till the end, he had association of Krishna in that way. And he acquired all good qualities of Krishna in all perfection. So, I will stop here. Thank you very much.

The 1st comparison to Lord Krishna we discussed in the previous session. This present session, we will discuss about the 2nd comparison: In magnanimity, he will be as great as King Rantideva. So, something about Rantideva. Srila Prabhupada says in the purport: An ancient King prior to the Mahabharata period, referred to by Narada Muni while instructing Sanjaya as mentioned in Mahabharata Dronaparva 67th chapter. Rantideva was a great King, liberal for hospitality and distribution of foodstuff. This is reference to an ancient King. Rantideva was a great King. He was a great king. All the kings mentioned in the Bhagavatam and the scriptures generally, they are great personalities, who are generally devotees of the supreme lord krishna, rajarshi. They are raja, they are kings, but they are rishi, they are saintly in their character, saintly kings, rajarshi. So, Rantideva was a saintly king.

**Summary:** The speaker continues to describe Rantideva's virtues, including his acts of charity, hospitality, and adherence to religious principles, noting that he never ate flesh.

He was blessed by the great Vasishtamuni for supplying him cold water, and thus he achieved the heavenly planet, to be elevated to heavenly planet, just by being a king but acting properly by giving charity. Danam is one of the qualities of a kshatriya, ideal qualities of a kshatriya, and hospitality to receive the guests who come uninvited, unannounced, to receive them respectfully, properly, according to religious principles, to honor them, that is hospitality. So, Rantideva was famous for this. Although a kshatriya by birth, he never ate flesh in his entire life. The scriptures say kshatriyas under exceptional circumstances, they may eat a flesh of an animal, but Rantideva was a saintly king who never touched flesh of animal, never whole life he never did that. He is one of those pious kings whose names are remembered in the morning and evening.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Rantideva didn't strive for material gain but accepted what came through providence, but he always gave everything to guests, even undergoing suffering.

So, about Rantideva, in another part of the Bhagavatam, it's explained he never endeavored to earn anything, but he would enjoy whatever he got by the arrangement of providence. In the Bhagavad-Gita, Krishna says this is a characteristic of a yogi. Yogi means a devotee. So, Krishna says a devotee never endeavors for acquiring many things for his material subsistence, but he is satisfied with whatever is coming to him by arrangement of providence. Providence means higher arrangement. But still, there was an exception to this behavior Ranthideva. What is that? When guests came, he would give them everything he wanted had. Thus, he underwent considerable suffering along with his members of his family. On one occasion indeed, he and his family members shivered for want of food and water, yet Ranthi...

**Key Quote:** "because Ranthi Deva is perceived the presence of the supreme Godhead everywhere and in every living entity he received guests with faith and respect and gave him a share of the food"
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Rantideva breaking his 48-day fast and offering food to a Brahmana guest, demonstrating his unwavering hospitality and spiritual vision.

About Ranthi Deva, once after fasting for 48 days, in the morning Granthi Deva received some water and some foodstuffs made with milk and ghee. But when he and his family were about to eat, a Brahman and his family were about to eat a Brahman and his family were about to eat a Brahman, a guest arrived. Here the word used in Sanskrit for guest is atithi. Atithi means one who comes without invitation, without prior arrangement, without any intimation to the host, suddenly arrives. So, just Ranthi Deva is about to break his fast after 48 day fasting and the Brahmana guest is arrived. Because Ranthi Deva perceived the presence of the supreme Godhead everywhere and in every living entity, he received guests with faith and respect and gave him a share of the food. The Brahmana guest ate his share and then went away. So, the Brahmana guest was received properly even though Ranthi Deva was about to break the fast his faster 48 days. He remained sober. He never became disturbed, agitated. Properly received the guest, fed.

**Summary:** The story continues with Rantideva offering food to a Shudra guest, highlighting his spiritual vision of seeing everyone in relation to Krishna and demonstrating true equality.

Having divided the remaining food with his relatives, Ranthideva was just about to eat his own share when a Shudra guest arrived. So after feeding the Brahmana whatever was left he gave to all the relatives who were also fasting, his family members. And then he share he was about to eat. When a Shudra guest arrived is said, seeing the shudra in relationship with the supreme personality of godhead king rantideva gave him also a share of the food. See the magnanimity of rantideva how is he seeing? He's seeing everyone as spirit soul. This is the equality, not artificial equality that in terms of body trying to equalize everyone. No, body cannot be equalized, but within the body, the resident of the body, they he, not they ha not the body, they he, the occupant of the body, the resident of the body, the spirit soul within the body, that spirit soul is equal as part and parcel of Krishna. And therefore there is always a relationship between every living being and Krishna. So, Rantideva was enlightened spiritually, so he could see the relationship of every living being with Krishna and therefore he also gave this shudra guest a share of the food.

**Key Quote:** "rantideva offered the balance of the food to the dogs and the master of the dogs would come as guests the king offered them all respects and obeisances"
**Summary:** The speaker describes Rantideva offering food and respect to a guest with dogs, clarifying that this is based on spiritual vision and should not be imitated superficially, emphasizing the importance of cleanliness and proper discrimination.

When the shudra went away, another guest arrived surrounded by dogs and said, oh king, I and my company of dogs are very hungry, please give us something to eat. Now with great respect, Rantideva offered the balance of the food to the dogs and the master of the dogs would come as guests. The king offered them all respects and obeisances. Now offering obeisances to the master of the dogs is okay, but what about offering obeisances to the dogs? This is again seeing the spirit soul within the dog's body or the shudra's body or the master of the dog's body in relationship with Krishna. It is not to be imitated artificially by somebody who doesn't have a spiritual understanding. So people sometimes think that we can have the dog in our house by giving it a special protection. No, the dog can be given some food, but it has to wait outside your door and maybe it will do some service as guarding your house, that's okay, but not that you fondle the dog, make it sleep next to you in your own bed and allow it to roam everywhere in your and make your whole house unclean. Dog is the most unclean animal. So one should never allow a dog inside one's house to maintain cleanliness, but that doesn't mean one has to be cruel to the dog or negligent of the dog. No, a dog which requires some food you may give it food, but it has to wait outside your door. So, Ranthi Deva offered respect to the dog recognizing the living being inside, a spirit soul part and parcel of Krishna, not the dog's body or not the dogs consciousness, no not that. See this is a difference between Ranthi Deva treating equally all living beings and foolish people who want to imitate equality of all living beings by being particularly attached to a dog or a cat even though they seem to be very compassionate to some dog or cat, but they don't offer the same hospitality or treatment to another fellow human being who may be in need of.

**Summary:** The story culminates with Rantideva offering his last portion of water to a Chandala, expressing his desire to alleviate the suffering of all beings, showcasing his ultimate magnanimity.

Thereafter, so he offered the balance of the food to the dogs and the master of the dogs and then only the drinking water remained, his share, Ranthi Deva share after fasting 48 days and there is only enough to satisfy one person. When the king was just about to drink that water, a chandala appeared and said, Oh King, although I am lowborn, kindly give me some drinking water because I am very thirsty. See how Ranthi Deva has being tested. And then agree that hearing the pitiable words of the poor fatigue chandala Maharaj ranthi deva spoke the following nectarian words. What did he say? I do not pray to the Supreme Personality of God it for the eight perfections of mystic yoga not for Salvation from repeated birth and death I want to only stay out of the difamento der 愛 hablar dasi ben beber stay a little bit of rest will bring Allah to those living beings but as long as you live to see being healed by the highest self and remembrance of the یا among all the living beings and suffer all distress on their behalf so that they may be freed from suffering. See how very magnanimous and there is a comparison ranthi deva eva udara is as magnanimous he'll be as magnanimous this pariksit as ranthi deva. Ranthi Deva had that feeling that I don't want to see anybody else suffer and I want to remain among them and actually suffered distresses on their behalf so that they may be freed from suffering. This is very very very magnanimous quality. Having spoken thus, Ranthi Deva although on the verge of death because of thirst gave his own portion of water to the chandala.

**Summary:** The demigods reveal themselves, pleased with Rantideva's generosity, and Rantideva prays for devotion to Lord Vishnu, reinforcing the theme of magnanimity and its connection to spiritual realization; the speaker concludes by reiterating that Parikshit will be as magnanimous as Rantideva.

And soul and then what happened? The demigods like Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva, they had disguised themselves and appeared as the brahmana, the shudra, the master of the dogs and the chandala. They disclosed their identity and they said we are very pleased with your generosity, with your magnanimity, kindly ask us any benediction.

So this is the magnanimity of Ranthi Deva and child Pariksit is foretold to be as magnanimous.

**Summary:** The speaker begins to narrate the history of Maharaja Yati, focusing on his early life, his lustful desires, and his relationship with Devayani, the daughter of Shukracharya.

part, we will discuss the comparison with Maharaja Yati. So, Srila Prabhupada in the purport gives a brief history of this great King Yati. The great emperor of the world and the original forefather of all great nations of the world who belong to the Aryan and Indo-European stock. Yati is a great forefather of all races in this world. He is the son of Maharaja Nahusha, and he became the emperor of the world due to his elder brothers becoming a great and liberated saintly mystic. He ruled over the world for several thousands of years and performed many sacrifices and pious activities recorded in history. This is the greatness of this Maharaja Yati. He was Dharmikaha. He was a strict follower of religious principles. For a king, the most important religious principle is to perform sacrifices as prescribed for a Kshatriya or a king in the scriptures and ensure the welfare of the entire kingdom or the entire planet of all the people. So, because in the Bhagavad Gita it is said all necessities are provided by the Supreme Lord. If people perform sacrifices, especially the King, the leader of all the people in this world, the ruler, if he performs sacrifices, then people will get their necessities without any difficulty. Now regarding Yati, there is a mention here by Srila Prabhupada, even though he's famous for having performed a lot of sacrifices and many pious activities. In his early youth, he was very lustful and full of lusty desires for enjoying young girls. He fell in love with Devayani, the most beloved daughter of Shukracharya. Who is Shukracharya? Shukracharya is the spiritual master of the demons, the Asuras. And he was a Brahmana, qualified Brahmana, Shukracharya. His daughter Devayani somehow. That is explained in another part of the Bhagavatam. I will try to say

**Key Quote:** "Sharmishta threw her, threw Devayani into a well and left her there and went away with her other friends."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story, detailing the incident where Sharmishta throws Devayani into a well, leading to Yayati rescuing her and the subsequent conflict involving Shukracharya.

in brief, narrate in brief. Shukracharya's daughter, Devayani, had a girlfriend named Sharmishta before her marriage with Yayati. Now, this Sharmishta, the friend of Devayani, was the daughter of one king Vrishapurva. Once it so happened, Sharmishta was sporting in the water with thousands of her girlfriends, and Devayani was also there with Sharmishta, sporting in the water. When the young girls saw Lord Shiva seated on his bull carrier with Uma or Parvati, they immediately dressed themselves because they were sporting in water, they had left their dress outside the bank of the water reservoir. Suddenly they saw Shiva, and to respect him, immediately they covered themselves. But Sharmishta mistakenly put on Devayani's clothes because they were in a hurry. Now Devayani became very angry at Sharmishta and rebuked her. Now Sharmishta responded by rebuking Devayani, and not only did she rebuke her, but Sharmishta also threw her, threw Devayani into a well and left her there and went away with her other friends. She was the daughter of the king, so she was very proud of her special position. So she ill-treated Devayani. By chance, when Devayani was trapped in that well, King Yayati came on a hunting expedition, and he came searching for water. By chance, he found Devayani and rescued her, and in this way, Devayani accepted Maharaj Yayati as her husband. But before accepting Yayati as husband, Devayani crying loudly told her father Shukracharya about Sharmishta's behavior. But before accepting Yayati as husband, Devayani crying loudly told her father Shukracharya about Sharmishta's behavior.

Now Shukracharya was very angry at Sharmishta, and he went to King Vrishapurva and complained that your daughter has insulted my daughter. Now Shukracharya was very angry at Sharmishta, and he went to King Vrishapurva and complained that your daughter has insulted my daughter. Now Shukracharya was very angry at Sharmishta, and he went to King Vrishapurva and complained that your daughter has insulted my daughter. And he went to King Vrishaparva and complained that your daughter has insulted my daughter.

**Key Quote:** "Shukracharya again became angry against Maharaja Yati and he cursed Yati to become old."
**Summary:** The story progresses with Shukracharya cursing Yati to become old due to Devayani's envy and anger over Sharmishta's pregnancy.

So because Shukracharya was the Brahmana advisor to the king, the king was very afraid that Shukracharya would leave and go away. So he pacified and said, "My daughter Sharmishta will actually become the maidservant of your daughter Devayani." So then Shukracharya was satisfied. He did not chastise Vrishaparva or Vrishaparva's daughter Sharmishta. So then Sharmishta, after the marriage of Devayani with Maharaja Yati, went with Devayani as Devayani's maidservant to Maharaja Yati's palace. Now, when Sharmishta found that her friend Devayani had a son through Maharaja Yati, she also desired to have a son, and she requested Maharaja Yati for sex. And when Sharmishta became pregnant, Devayani became very envious. Devayani became very envious of her maidservant becoming pregnant, and in great anger, she left Maharaja Yati and went away to her father's house and narrated everything that happened to her father, Shukracharya.

**Key Quote:** "These material desires for enjoyment of lust are like a fire."
**Summary:** Yati exchanges his old age with his son Puru, enjoys material life, and eventually becomes disgusted, using the analogy of a goat to illustrate the insatiable nature of lust.

And then Yati became very, very morose naturally, that he had lost his youth when he had not actually grown sufficiently by age. So he begged Shukracharya, "Do something about my youth. How can I regain youth? I have not yet satisfied my desires for enjoyment, material enjoyment. Kindly give me back my youth." So then Shukracharya gave him the benediction that he could transfer his old age to someone else, some young man, and thereby get back the youth. So Yati exchanged his old age for his youngest son, Puru. So Yati exchanged his old age for his youngest son, Puru, and thus he was able to enjoy with young girls. Now after many, many years of enjoyment in the material world, Yati finally became disgusted with this material enjoyment. When satiated, he devised his story corresponding to his own life and narrated that story before his beloved wife Devayani. and narrated that story before his beloved wife Devayani. and narrated that story before his beloved wife Devayani. The story is described in the Bhagavatam as follows. Once upon a time, this is Yayati telling Devayani this story. Once upon a time, there was a goat who was searching in a forest for different types of vegetables to eat, and by chance, this goat came to a well. And in that well, the goat saw a she-goat. He became attracted to the she-goat and somehow or other delivered her from the well, and they were united. Thereafter, when the she-goat saw the he-goat enjoying sex with another she-goat, she became angry, abandoned the he-goat, and returned to her brahmana owner to whom she described. The brahmana became angry and cursed the he-goat to lose his sexual power. Thereupon, the he-goat begged the brahmana's pardon and was given back the power for sex. Then the he-goat enjoyed sex with the she-goat for many years, but still, he was not satisfied. If one is lusty and greedy, even the total stock of gold in the entire world cannot be sold. The he-goat cannot satisfy one's lusty desires.

**Key Quote:** "King Yayati, however, renounced worldly life and divided his property among his sons."
**Summary:** Yati renounces worldly life, engages in devotional service, and the speaker concludes by comparing Pariksit to Yati in terms of religiousness and charity.

This is the conclusion of Maharajayati. He says, "These material desires for enjoyment of lust are like a fire. One may pour clarified butter on a blazing fire, but one cannot expect the fire to be extinguished because of pouring clarified butter. Such a fire, one must adopt a different process." The shastra therefore advises that by intelligence one renounces the life of enjoyment. So, now those who are not sufficiently intelligent, they cannot give up sense enjoyment because a beautiful woman bewilders even the most learned woman. because a beautiful woman bewilders even the most learned woman. King Yayati, however, renounced worldly life and divided his property among his sons. He personally adopted the life of a mendicant, giving up all attraction to material enjoyment, and engaged himself fully in devotional service to the Lord. Thus he attained perfection. So, this is the history of Yayati described in the Bhagavatam. This Yayati, even while he was ruling, he performed many sacrifices and ensured the prosperity for everyone in his kingdom, and he was also engaged in very many pious activities by which he gave a lot of charity. So, in this respect, Pariksit is compared to King Yayati that Pariksit will be as magnanimous, sorry, as religious and as charitable as Maharaj Yayati, who is famous in history for being very religious minded.

**Key Quote:** "This child will be like Bali Maharaj in patience, a staunch devotee of Lord Krishna like Prahlad Maharaj, a performer of many Ashwamedha sacrifices, and a follower of the old and experienced men."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 25th verse of the 12th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on the qualities of Pariksit, particularly his patience compared to Bali Maharaj, who is one of the 12 authorities in devotional service.

In this session we will be discussing from the 25th verse of the 12th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This will be discussed in two parts. So in this session we will discuss part 2. The verse, 25th verse is as follows. The meaning of this verse is: This child will be like Bali Maharaj in patience, a staunch devotee of Lord Krishna like Prahlad Maharaj, a patient devotee of Lord Krishna like Prahlad Maharaj, a performer of many Ashwamedha sacrifices, and a follower of the old and experienced men. Four different qualities are glorified about Pariksit by the brahmanas while foretelling about the greatness of the child when he grows up. So the first comparison is made that this child will be like Bali Maharaj in patience. So the history of Bali Maharaj is described as this, described again in the Bhagavatam in detail, great detail in the 8th canto, in connection with the pastime of Lord Vamanthi. So Srila Prabhupada says, one of the 12 authorities, Bali Maharaj is one of the 12 authorities in devotional service of the Lord, Mahajana Dvadash Mahajana. Bali Maharaj is a great authority in devotional service because he sacrificed everything to please the Supreme Lord and relinquished the connection with the Lord. He sacrificed everything to please the Supreme Lord and relinquished the connection with the Lord. He has a close connection with the so called spiritual master who obstructed him on the parts of risking everything for the service of the Supreme Lord. Now in the brief history of Bali Maharaj, because the comparison is made, how great was Bali Maharaj in being very, very patient, being very patient, that's how this Pariksit will also be very patient.

**Key Quote:** "So, Vaman Dev was received very respectfully by Bali Maharaj as a Brahmachari boy."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Vamanadeva's appearance as a Brahmachari and his visit to Bali Maharaj's sacrificial arena, highlighting Bali's respectful reception and offer of charity.

So the description is, so the description is that the Supreme Lord appeared as Vaman Dev, as the son of Aditi and Kashyapa and he particularly came on the request of Aditi. So, Vaman Dev wanted to satisfy Aditi's desire that Aditi's sons headed by Indra who had lost their kingdom to Bali Maharaj, they get back their kingdom. So, Vaman Dev came to actually restore Indra's kingdom by taking it away in a way of tricking Bali Maharaj and Vaman Dev took away from Bali Maharaj by trickery and gave it to Indra. So, what was Bali's reaction to all this? That is very nicely described here. So, Vaman Dev as soon as he appeared, he disguised himself as a small Brahmachari boy and visited the sacrificial arena where Bali Maharaj was performing sacrifices. Now, Vaman Dev appeared in the sacrificial arena of Bali Maharaj with his transcendentally effulgent form. Because he is the Supreme Lord, his form is full of transcendental effulgence called Brahmajyoti. So, normally the Lord in the material world will not display his Brahmajyoti. Then nobody will be able to see him. So, he partially displayed his transcendental effulgence and all the priests in that sacrificial arena they stood up from their seats and offered all respects and prayers to this Brahmachari. Of course, they didn't know it is Vaman Dev. So, they thought some very, very, very austere Brahmachari, some great personality. We do not know who he is. He has appeared with this effulgence which is very, very dazzling. And they stood up in respect and offered prayers to him. Now, so Vaman Dev was received very respectfully by Bali Maharaj as a Brahmachari boy. And Bali immediately washed the feet of this Brahmachari who is Lord himself as Vaman Dev and sprinkled that water that washes the feet of the Brahmachari on his head. And then Bali Maharaj inquired Vaman Dev that you may ask me for some dana. Either you may ask for some money or jewels or anything else you might desire. Because I am the emperor of the world. So, you may ask me anything that you desire.

**Key Quote:** "Even if this Brahmachari is Vishnu. And even if he is going to take away everything I possess still, I do not want to go back on my promise."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story, describing Vamanadeva's request for three paces of land, Bali Maharaj's willingness to grant it, and Shukracharya's warning, followed by Bali's decision to uphold his promise despite the potential consequences.

Now, Vaman Dev praised Bali Maharaj. And Vaman Dev actually asked Bali Maharaj that I will be satisfied with just three paces of land measured by my footprint. A small Brahmachari boy, how much will his footprint be? So, Bali Maharaj thought this Brahmachari, even though he is so bright and effulgent and very, very, very austere, he does not have sufficient experience what to ask. So, Bali Maharaj said I can give you something much more than that. And he offered to give more. But Vaman Dev described to Bali Maharaj that one should be satisfied with the minimum necessities. Otherwise, there is no end to one's desire for possessing more and more and more. So, then Bali Maharaj hearing this enlightening words from this Brahmachari, he became very impressed and said, Oh, you are very, very learned and even realized. Okay, according to your desire, whatever you want, I am ready to give you, offer you in charity. I will give you three steps of land measured by your footprint. So, then when he is about to accept to give, agree to give, immediately Shukracharya stopped him. Stop. My dear King, please stop. What is the matter? So, then Shukracharya said, You do not know who this Brahmachari boy is. He is actually Vishnu disguised as a Brahmachari boy. He has come here on behalf of the devatas, our enemies. And he has come to take away your entire kingdom, on the plea of taking three steps of land in charity, he is going to take away your entire kingdom. So, beware, do not give what he is asking for in charity, because he has come to cheat you. So, then Bali Maharaj heard Shukracharya and he considered that Bali Maharaj thought it is the duty of a householder to maintain the principles of religion. And he thought it improper to withdraw his promise to the Brahmachari. Even if this Brahmachari is Vishnu. And even if he is going to take away everything I possess still, I do not want to go back on my promise, because lying is a sinful activity. So, I should not go back on my promise. And therefore, I want to give this Brahmachari whatever I have promised.

He has got a form called the universal form. So, he displayed that universal form of his, means as big as the whole universe. And Bali Maharaj could see that the Lord is all pervading and everything resting in his body. And then Bali Maharaj could also see that this gigantic form the Brahmachari is displaying is actually the form of Lord Vishnu. Because Vishnu's mark of Srivatsa and his Kaustubha jewel and his crown and his ornaments and flower garland and everything that is decorating his body, Bali Maharaj could clearly see. So, what did Vaman Dev do after expanding himself into a universal body? He covered the entire surface of the world by extending his body and covered the entire sky. So, with one step he covered the earth and all the lower planets completely. And then with his second footstep he covered the entire upper planetary system. And there was no vacant place where he could place his third footstep. Then what happened? The Devatas headed by Brahma they certainly were very much attracted by the wonderful form of the Lord and his wonderful pastime of covering everything in the universe by his two footsteps. So, Brahma accompanied by great sages offered humble prayers to worship the Supreme Lord. They could recognize here is the Supreme Lord and he has appeared for the sake of favoring Indra.

**Key Quote:** "Look at the patience of Bali Maharaj. He is completely bereft of all his possessions... and still he is offering his own self."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes the story of Vamanadeva and Bali Maharaj, emphasizing Bali's patience and complete surrender to the Lord, even offering his own head as the third step, and highlighting how this pastime glorifies Bali Maharaj's devotion. The lecture ends by connecting Bali's patience to the future patience of Pariksit.

So, then when Bali Maharaj was deprived of all his possessions then all the associates of Bali Maharaj became angry at this Brahmachari boy who cheated Bali. And they wanted to attack this Brahmachari boy who is now in this form, universal form. And they attempted but immediately Vishnu's associates defeated all the associates of Bali Maharaj and sent them to the lower planets. And then Bali Maharaj was arrested by the ropes of Varuna by Garuda the carrier of Lord Vishnu. But when Lord Vishnu said to Bali Maharaj you have not fulfilled your promise to give me three steps of land. Where do I place my third step? So, then Bali Maharaj, he explained to Lord Vamana, Lord Vishnu that I have given away whatever is my possession. But I am still there. So, I will give my head in charity as the place for Lord Vishnu's third step. Now, that was very very pleasing to Lord Vishnu. Look at the patience of Bali Maharaj. He is completely bereft of all his possessions. He has been taken, all his possessions have been taken away and he is nothing. And still he is offering his own self, Atma Nivedanam. Of course, Bali Maharaj is a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord. So, the Lord performed this pastime to glorify Bali Maharaj and show to the whole world that my devotees are so very dedicated to my seva, that they are willing to give up everything just to please me, to satisfy me, to serve me. In this way, Bali Maharaj proved to be very very successful in his conduct as giving charity. So, his patience was tested by Lord Vamana Dev and he became successful. So, similarly Pariksit also will be very very patient. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Prabhupada says a perfect devotee of Lord Krishna, his father, Prahlad's father, Hiranyakashyapu, chastised him severely when he was only five years old, for his becoming an unalloyed devotee of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker begins narrating the history of Prahlad Maharaj, highlighting his devotion to Lord Krishna and the opposition he faced from his father, Hiranyakashipu.

So, in a purport, Srila Prabhupada says about Prahlad Maharaj, he gives a brief description of the history of Prahlad Maharaj. Prabhupada says, "A perfect devotee of Lord Krishna, his father, Prahlad's father, Hiranyakashyapu, chastised him severely when he was only five years old, for his becoming an unalloyed devotee of the Lord." This is the history of Prahlad Maharaj. So, the details of Prahlad Maharaj's history is given in the seventh canto of the Bhagavatam. So, I will try to narrate in brief some more details about the history of Prahlad Maharaj. It is said in the seventh canto that by severe austerities, this demon Hiranyakashipu satisfied Lord Brahma and obtained the benedictions he desired. Nonetheless, he continued to be envious of Lord Vishnu. He conquered the three worlds. He brought all living entities, both demigods and asuras, under his control. All the demigods except Lord Vishnu, Lord Brahma, and Lord Shiva came under his control and began serving him. Practically, Hiranyakashipu terrorized the whole universe. Since Hiranyakashipu was the oppressor of all the demigods and envious of the Supreme Lord, he would naturally be killed. Hiranyakashipu had four sons, of whom the eldest, Prahlad, was a Mahabhagavata. Hiranyakashipu's spiritual master, Shukracharya, had two sons, Shanda and Amarka. Now, Prahlad Maharaj was entrusted to Shanda and Amarka for education.

**Key Quote:** "Prahlad taught the teachers that the mentality of ownership is false and that he was therefore trying to become an unalloyed devotee of the Lord Vishnu."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Prahlad's disinterest in material education and his continued devotion to Krishna, even teaching his teachers about the falsity of ownership.

Although the teachers tried to educate the boy Prahlad Maharaj in politics, economics, and other material activities, he did not care for their instructions. Instead, Prahlad continued to be a pure devotee. Prahlad never liked the idea of discriminating between one's friends and enemies, because he was spiritually inclined, he was equal to everyone. Once upon a time, Hiranyakashipu inquired from his son Prahlad what was the best thing that Prahlad had learned from the teachers. So, Prahlad Maharaj replied that a man engrossed in material consciousness of duality, thinking this is mine and something else belongs to an enemy, such a person should give up his householder life and go to the forest to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When Hiranyakashipu heard this from his son, speaking about devotion and service, Hiranyakashipu decided this small boy has been polluted by some friend in school. So, he advised the teacher to take care of the boy so that he would not become a devotee of Krishna. However, when the teachers inquired from Prahlad why he was going against their teachings, Prahlad taught the teachers that the mentality of ownership is false and that he was therefore trying to become an unalloyed devotee of the Lord Vishnu.

**Key Quote:** "Since Prahlad was so treacherous that he had become a devotee of Vishnu, who had killed his uncle Hiranyakashipu, Hiranyakashipu asked his assistants to kill him."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the escalating conflict between Prahlad and Hiranyakashipu, including Hiranyakashipu's attempts to kill Prahlad due to his devotion to Vishnu.

The teachers, being very angry, chastised and threatened the boy with many fearful conditions. They taught him to the best of their ability and then brought him before his father. So, Hiranyakashipu affectionately took his son Prahlad on his lap and then inquired from him what was the best thing that he had learned from his teachers. As usual, Prahlad Maharaj began praising the nine processes of devotional service such as Shravanam and Kirtanam, Vishnu. The king of the demons, Hiranyakashipu, being extremely angry, chastised the teachers, Shanda and Amarka, for having wrongly trained Prahlad Maharaj. The so-called teachers informed King Hiranyakashipu that Prahlad Maharaj was automatically a devotee and did not listen to their instructions at all. When they proved themselves innocent, Hiranyakashipu inquired from Prahlad, where have you learned about Vishnu Bhakti? Prahlad Maharaj's reply was very profound. Prahlad Maharaj said, those who are attached to family life do not develop Krishna consciousness, either personally or collectively. Instead, they suffer repeated birth and death in the material world and continue simply chewing the chewed. Prahlad explained that the duty of every man is to take shelter of a pure devotee and thus become eligible to understand Krishna consciousness. Hiranyakashipu became angry. He was very, very angry hearing this answer. He threw this small boy down from his lap. Since Prahlad was so treacherous that he had become a devotee of Vishnu, who had killed his uncle Hiranyakashipu, Hiranyakashipu asked his assistants to kill him.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Prahlad's divine protection despite Hiranyakashipu's relentless attempts to harm him, highlighting Hiranyakashipu's lack of understanding.

Now, the assistants of Hiranyakashipu struck Prahlad with sharp weapons, threw him under the feet of elephants, subjected him to hellish conditions, threw him from the peak of a mountain, tried to kill him in thousands of other ways, but were always unsuccessful. Hiranyakashipu therefore became increasingly afraid of his son Prahlad and arrested him. Can you imagine? A small five-year-old boy, he is just innocently practicing bhakti, Vishnu bhakti, and his father is so angry, he is trying to kill the boy. And even after being unsuccessful, nothing is striking him that this boy is completely protected. Nobody can do anything to the boy because he is protected by the Supreme Lord. Hiranyakashipu is not understanding this point. But the sons of Shukracharya, Chandana Marka, or the teachers of Prahlad, they pacified Hiranyakashipu and told, "We will still try to change his mind. He is after all a small boy. He is speaking based on whatever he knows from the past. So we will try to change his mind as he grows up. Don't worry."

So, while the teachers were absent from the classroom, Prahlad began to preach Krishna Consciousness to the classmates. And following the instructions of Prahlad, all the sons of the demons who were Prahlad's classmates became attached to Lord Vishnu. When this attachment became pronounced, Shanda and Amarka were very afraid that the boys would become more and more devoted to Lord Vishnu. In a helpless condition, they approached Hiranyakashipu and described in detail the effect of Prahlad's preaching. After hearing of this, Hiranyakashipu decided to kill his son Prahlad personally. Hiranyakashipu was so angry that Prahlad Maharaj fell down at his feet and said things like, just to pacify him. But Prahlad was unsuccessful in satisfying his father. Hiranyakashipu, as a typical demon, began to advertise himself as being greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead Vishnu. But Prahlad Maharaj challenged him saying that Hiranyakashipu was not God. And Prahlad began to glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Vishnu, declaring that Lord Vishnu is all-pervading. Everything is under his control. No one is equal to or greater than Lord Vishnu. Thus he requested his father, please be submissive to the Omnipotent Supreme Lord. The more Prahlad glorified Vishnu, the more angry and agitated

Suddenly, there issued a tumultuous sound and the Supreme Lord in his wonderful form of Narasimha, half man, half lion, came out of the pillar. And Hiranyakashipu could understand that this form of the personality who had appeared out of the pillar was actually meant for his death. And he began to fight with Lord Narasimha. The Lord performed some pastime of fighting with the demon for some time. And in the evening, the border between day and night, the Supreme Lord captured the demon, threw him on his lap, and killed him by piercing his abdomen with his nails and tearing apart his body into pieces. Then the associates of Hiranyakashipu came to attack Lord Narasimha, but Lord Narasimha easily killed every one of them. When there was no one else to fight, the Supreme Lord sat on Hiranyakashipu's throne and then the whole universe was relieved of the rule of Hiranyakashipu and everyone was jubilant with transcendental bliss.

**Key Quote:** "The wisest man in the world is a devotee of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the wisest person is a devotee of the Lord and discusses the lineage of wise kings in Maharaja Yudhishthira's family.

The wisest man in the world is a devotee of the Lord. Ye Krishna bhaje se bada chatura. Also Krishna says, Tesham satata yuktaanam bhajatam pritipurvakam dadami buddhi yogam tam. So the wisest man is always a devotee of the Supreme Lord. The sages are called wise men and there are different types of wise men for different branches of knowledge. Unless therefore the king or the head of the state is the wisest man, he cannot control all types of wise men in the state. So Prabhupada is explaining what is the necessity for the king to be the wisest because he is to control different types of wise people in the state. In the line of royal succession in the family of Maharaja Yudhishthira, all the kings without exception were the wisest men of their times. And so also it is foretold about Maharaja Pariksit and his son Maharaja Janamejaya who was yet to be born. Such wise kings can become chastisers of upstarts and uprooters of kali or quarrelsome.

As will be clear in the chapters ahead, the later chapters of this canto, Maharaja Pariksit wanted to kill the personified kali who was attempting to kill a cow, the emblem of peace and religion. Kali Purusha, personified kali, was trying to enter the kingdom of Pariksit Maharaj. When Pariksit Maharaj is ruling, that is going to be described in the next few chapters. And this Kali Purusha was chastised severely by Pariksit Maharaj. Why? Because this Kali Purusha was trying to kill a cow. It was unheard of, unknown during Pariksit Maharaj's time. Nobody would even hurt a cow in any minor way. Forget about killing a cow, that was unknown. But in such a place, at such a time, Kali Purusha attempting to kill a cow was intolerable.

**Key Quote:** "The symptoms of kali are wine, women, gambling and slaughterhouses."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the symptoms of Kali Yuga and contrasts them with the four pillars of Dharma in Satya Yuga, explaining how irreligion destroys these pillars.

And Srila Prabhupada says further, the symptoms of kali are wine, women, gambling and slaughterhouses. Four symptoms of kali yuga. What are they? Wine, women, gambling, slaughterhouses. This is explained very nicely in the later chapter that in the Satya yuga, as opposed to kali yuga. The four legs of dharma were established by the four principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. The Sanskrit words are Tapa, Shaucha, Daya, Satya. Tapa means austerity, Shaucha means cleanliness, dhaya means mercy and Satya means truthfulness. So, religion stands on four legs of four pillars. These are the four pillars. And these four are destroyed by rampant irreligion in the form of pride, lust for women, intoxication and...

**Key Quote:** "With the progression of the age of Kali people are becoming very proud they are becoming attached to women and they are attached to intoxication"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on how pride, lust, and intoxication are rampant in Kali Yuga, leading to corruption and moral degradation.

with the progression of the age of Kali, people are becoming very proud, they are becoming attached to women and they are attached to intoxication. So Srila Prabhupada gives example, by the influence of the age of Kali even a pauper is proud of his penny. People may have very little wealth but they think they are very, very rich or they're very, very wealthy. The women are always dressed in an overly attractive fashion to victimize the minds of men and of course there are lusty people, the men who want to exploit and enjoy women, but still women also, they are, though at least the ones who are not conducting themselves in the outside world properly, they are also inciting the lasty men to actually attack them. And people are addicted to drinking wine, they're addicted to smoking, they are addicted to drinking tea, chewing tobacco, etc. This is their addiction to intoxicants, different varieties. All these habits are so-called advancement of civilization are the root causes of all irreligiousity. Why are people becoming indifferent to religion? Why are they not following religious principles? Because they are victims of habits, bad habits, particularly these bad habits in Kaliyuga. So you can't explain such people to have good behavior, you can't expect them to have good moral character, you can't expect them to be civilized, no, that's not possible. And because of irreligiosity it is not possible to check corruption, bribery and...

**Summary:** The speaker suggests that the solution to these problems lies in promoting Brahmanical culture and the principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness.

consequently they resort to taking bribes, cheating, plundering, becoming corrupt and earning money by dishonest means like that. So Prashula Prabhupada says, man cannot check all these evils simply by statutory acts and police vigilance, but the people can be cured of these evils by advocating the principles of Brahmanical culture or the principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness, Tapa, Shaucha, Daya, Satya. So actually Srila Prabhupada says that religion is not based on some sentiment or some feeling that I belong to such and such a community or some caste, no, that is not real religion. Real religion is based on these four factual principles. It doesn't matter where one has taken birth or it doesn't matter whether somebody claims to be a Hindu or a Christian or a Muslim or a Atheist. These things don't matter. It is actually based on these four...

**Summary:** The speaker criticizes modern civilization for creating poverty and irreligion, advocating for a new society based on God consciousness.

Only then in the society there will be peace, there will be prosperity, there will be harmony or it's not possible. So Srila Prabhupada says modern civilization and economic development are creating a new situation of poverty and scarcity with the result of blackmailing the consumer's commodities. This is the effect of so-called advancement of civilization. People are becoming more and more addicted to these bad. They are becoming more and more irreligious which means they don't follow the principles of austerity, tenderness, mercy and truthfulness. So the whole atmosphere is surcharged with all bad qualities. So how can you expect peace and prosperity in such an atmosphere? So Srila Prabhupada says the solution to this problem is to create a new society. The solution to these problems is that the leaders and rich men of society should spend 50% of their accumulated wealth mercifully for the misled mass of people and educate them in god consciousness, the knowledge of Srimad Bhagavatam so that Kali will be defeated in its attempt to trap the conditioned souls.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of Sankirtana and following the example of Maharaj Pariksit to maintain peace and morality, ending the lecture with Hare Krishna.

Therefore, Srila Prabhupada says wise rulers of all states should take lessons from Maharaj Pariksit in how to maintain peace and morality by subduing the upstarts and quarrelsome people who indulge in wine, illicit connection with women, gambling and meat eating supplied by regularly maintained slaughterhouses. This has to stop. It's not that there was no meat eating in the former times, but it was restricted, highly restricted, and there was no mass killing of animals, open sale of meat or liquor. No, this was never there in the former times. So some few people would indulge in these very, very... A hidden way. So that was the situation in the former times. But now it has become very much rampant in the society and openly they're selling, advertising, making propaganda. Come, enjoy, eat, drink, be merry. The hedonistic philosophy, which is going to ruin the whole society. So therefore we should adopt the principles followed by Maharaj Pariksit and thereby create a good atmosphere of peace and prosperity through the method suggested here by Srila Prabhupada. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 27th verse of the 12th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Takshakad Atmano Mrtyum Dvija Putropasarjithat Prapatsyata Upashrutya Muktasangapadam Harehe. The meaning of this verse is: After hearing about his death, which will be caused by the bite of a snake bird sent by a son of a brahmana, he will get himself freed from all material attachment and surrender unto the personality of Godhead, taking shelter of Him. So, this foretold about this child Parikshit that he will know about his death in advance. 7 days before his death, he will come to know about his death because he will come to know that he has been cursed by a brahmana boy to be bitten by a snake bird. And upon hearing of his death, what will be his reaction? He will free himself from all material attachment and surrender to the Supreme Lord, taking complete shelter of the Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "Material attachment means ignorance of transcendental happiness under the shelter of the Lord taking shelter of the Lord means one will be completely in spiritual bliss they'll not care for anything material"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the incompatibility of material attachment and taking shelter of the Lord, emphasizing the bliss of spiritual life.

So, you can see this story from here. For preparing to quit the body and go back to Godhead, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport: material attachment and taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord don't go together. I mean, they don't go together. If somebody is materially attached, they cannot take shelter of the Supreme Lord's lotus feet, and one who has taken shelter of the Lord's lotus feet cannot have any material attachment. So, material attachment means ignorance of transcendental happiness under the shelter of the Lord. Taking shelter of the Lord means one will be completely in spiritual bliss. They'll not care for anything material. They'll never seek any material happiness. They'll understand that material happiness is illusory, insignificant, momentary, worthless. So, a factual devotee who has tasted even a glimpse of what is spiritual happiness, transcendental bliss, never will turn towards anything material.

**Key Quote:** "Eternally we are related to Krishna as this part and parcel, inseparable part."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the practice of devotion, our eternal relationship with Krishna, and how it leads to freedom from material attachment, highlighting Parikshit Maharaj's early Krishna consciousness.

So, devotion to material happiness is not a material happiness; it is a spiritual happiness. So, the unconditional service to the Lord while existing in the material world is a way to practice one's transcendent relation with the Lord. I am explaining what is this position of a practicing devotee who's not yet pure. It is a way to practice one's transcendent relation with the Lord. One has got an eternal connection or relationship to the one which links you with Krishna, every living being. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita: mamayivamsho jeevaloke jeevabhutasanatanah. Eternally, we are related to Krishna as His part and parcel, inseparable part. When one's practice of bhakti is matured, one gets completely free from all material attachment and becomes competent to go back home, back to Godhead. So, Maharaj Pariksit, being especially attached to the Lord from the beginning of his body, from the beginning in the womb of his mother, was continuously under the shelter of the Lord, even before he came to know of his death, right from the time he was in the womb of his mother. You have heard this earlier, but I will repeat, that when he was in the womb of his mother, Ashwatthama attempted to kill this child in the womb itself by releasing one's brahmastra to strike the target of the child in the mother's womb, Pariksit, to kill the last surviving descendant of the Pandavas. Ashwatthama attempted this, but Ashwatthama was completely unsuccessful because Krishna personally entered the womb of Pariksit's mother and saved the child by

neutralizing that brahmastra. At that time, Pariksit had darshan. For a brief moment, he had darshan of the Supreme Lord. And ever since, he became so much attached and attracted to that beautiful form of Krishna which he saw in his mother's womb, and he was always searching, where is this person or this beautiful personality I have seen? I want to see him. I am searching for him, searching, searching. So, he became known as the examiner, Pariksit. That's how he got that name, Pariksit, examiner. He is examining everybody. Are you the person I have seen? Are you the person I have seen? Are you the person I have seen? So, he is searching for Krishna, because Krishna is so attractive. So, being in the womb of the Supreme Lord, being an examiner, always he was Krishna conscious. So, he was always continuously Krishna conscious and therefore under the shelter of Lord Krishna, even before he got notice of death. But when he got the warning of his death within seven days, that was the end of his life. That curse of the Brahmana proved to be a boon to him, to enable him to prepare himself to go back to Godhead. Now, briefly I will just mention what happened.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the incident of Parikshit Maharaj insulting Shamika Rishi and his subsequent repentance.

As regards the curse by the Brahmana boy, Pariksit, as the emperor of the world, he was ruling from his capital city, Hastinapura. He once went hunting, because the Kshatriyas had to practice killing to keep themselves fit for giving protection to the citizens. So, he went hunting and he became thirsty. He started searching for water. He came across the ashram of one Shamika Rishi. He went inside that ashram and he saw that there was a sage sitting there, half-closed eyes. The sage was in meditation. So, the sage was not conscious of his externals. But Pariksit, being very thirsty, not finding water, not being welcomed by this sage, he mistook the sage to be feigning to be meditating in order to avoid receiving the king. So, Pariksit became angry. He took one dead snake that was just lying outside the ashram of that Shamika Rishi, garlanded the sage who was sitting in the meditation room with that dead snake, and walked away from that place. As he was going away, Pariksit reflected on what he did. Then he began to consider, maybe the sage was actually in trance. He was not externally conscious. So, how could he have received me properly? How could he have even noticed me entering his ashram? And why did I insult the sage in that way? He doesn't deserve to be insulted in that way at all. So, reflecting on his action, Pariksit began to feel very, very repentant for having insulted that great sage. And he began to think, may the sage's wrath or anger burn me and my entire kingdom to ashes immediately now. I deserve the worst kind of punishment

That news of the king garlanding the Shamika Rishi with a dead snake reached the boy, Sringi, who was the son of Shamika Rishi, playing outside with his friends. Shamika Rishi's son, Sringi, when he heard this, he became very angry against that king. And he said, how dare the king insult my father, who is a Brahmana, who is a Tapasvi. So, let me teach this king a lesson. Eight-year-old boy, who was actually very powerful, because he was trained by his father in Brahmanical practices. So, he decided, I'm going to curse this king to die. Instantly, he decided. He took some water and purified himself and uttered a curse: May that king, who insulted my father, die within the next seven days by a snake bite. And after uttering this curse, this boy, Sringi said, I'm going to curse this king to die.

by a snake bite. And the father, when he came out of trance, first thing he noticed, the dead snake round his neck. He just took that dead snake and threw it away. And he looked at his son and said, my dear son, why are you crying, what happened? Then the boy narrated whatever happened. And then the sage said, my dear son, for a very, very small mistake, you have wrongly punished the king who is the protector of all saintly persons. He himself is a Mahabhagavata. You shouldn't have cursed him to die. It is completely wrong on your part to have given a severe punishment for a minor mistake. It's not proportionate. So anyway, the sage, Shamika Rishi, sent word to Pariksit that Pariksit has been cursed by this immature, a foolish boy misusing his Brahmanical power. And Shamika Rishi begged forgiveness from the Supreme Lord to excuse this foolish boy and also sent word to Pariksit that Pariksit has been cursed and Pariksit may take appropriate steps to counteract this curse.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes the story by describing Parikshit Maharaj's acceptance of the curse, his renunciation, and his preparation for death on the banks of the Ganga.

Now Pariksit, when he received the news, he thought that Pariksit was a fool. He thought that I deserve to die by this thing, right? So thinking, Pariksit, even though he could have counteracted the curse, he actually renounced his kingdom, handed over charge to his son to rule the kingdom, and went away to a sacred spot on the bank of the river Ganga and sat there and began to pray. And he began to fast the next seven days and began to inquire from the saintly persons, how should I prepare for quitting my body when I'm going to be bitten by a snake bird due to a curse? So the saintly persons tried to advise him in different ways, but none of them were able to assure him of achieving perfection in the next seven days by practicing whatever they were recommending. Till Sukhadeva Goswami arrived in that assembly, he was not able to do anything. He was unable to do anything, not even for one day. And he was experiencing a state that was stylized, and he experienced a state that was so strong, and he is allied, and he is going to die soon. And he was going to die long ago. He was going to die soon. But, he was in that state for a long time. So in a way, he was able to express himself that he was a saint, and he was part of the village. He was able to go to the village and have food, and he was able to read the sun. He was able to learn the language, and he was able to pray. And he was able to perform those rituals. So he was able to attain the divine wisdom, he went back to Godhead, quit his body and went back to Godhead. So that's the description in the

So Srila Prabhupada explains this is the foretelling about what will happen when he is cursed to die within seven days. He will renounce all material attachments and he will go to the sacred place on the bank of the river Ganga, and he will inquire about proper self-knowledge from the son of Vyasa Deva, from Shukadeva Goswami, Vyasa Sutta, and he will achieve a life of fearlessness. So what is that life of fearlessness? Prabhupada explains in the purport: Material knowledge means ignorance of the knowledge of one's own self. The self is spirit, spirit soul, spiritual nature, same nature as the Supreme Lord, not this material body or material nature, not material, not matter, but spiritual reality won't be there. An interior body is just Watson course of this reading so...

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the importance of self-realization and the need for proper guidance from a self-realized soul to avoid speculative philosophy.

you will also become an interior body full of spiritual types, not material, released which plays aší dot accumulations of the leadership powers to create a spiritual nature. The message now in the opposite of matter, so Srila Prabhupada says philosophy means to seek after the right knowledge of one's own self or the knowledge of self-realization. We are born into ignorance, so in ignorance we do not know who we are. We think I am this body, or we may think I am this mind, but we are neither the body nor the mind. We are not even at the intelligence, but we are spirit soul. So this correct understanding of our real self as spirit soul is called self-realization. So Srila Prabhupada says about self-realization, without self-realization, philosophy is dry speculation or a waste of time and energy. There are many philosophers in this world and they have the ability to think about what is the absolute truth, what is this world, who am I, or what is the ultimate reality. They can think about it, but if they don't take proper guidance from a self-realized soul, from an enlightened person, then they simply speculate and waste time and energy. So Srimad Bhagavatam gives the right knowledge of one's own self. Bhagavatam gives the right gift.

So distinctly Bhagavatam tells us there is a world we are living in, which is the world of fear, and there is a spiritual world, which is the world where there is fearlessness, there is no fear, akutobhayam. So we are meant to prepare ourselves by becoming free from all material attachment and thereby keeping the goal of life as entering into the kingdom of fearlessness, the kingdom of God. So Srila Prabhupada says this material world is fearfulness, spiritual world is fearlessness, material world is fearfulness.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the material world as a prison house filled with fear and anxiety, even for those who try to follow the laws of nature.

its prisoners are always fearful as within a prison house. This material world has been discovered as a prison house in the- just like in a prison house no one can violate the jail rules and regulations, and if they do violate, that means another term for extension of prison life. Similarly, in this material existence, we are always fearful. Somebody may say, I'm not afraid of death, I'm not afraid of anything, I'm a bold person, courageous person. Somebody may say that, but as soon as there is some danger to his life, immediately he starts becoming fearful. Till there is no danger or there's no apparent difficulty or problem, people may speak so many things, but they stop speaking all this rubbish when there is actual danger for their life. Actually, the fearfulness in this material world is called anxiety. Everyone in material life, in all species and varieties of life, is full of anxiety, full of anxiety. You either by breaking or without breaking the laws of nature. Some people they break the laws of nature because they are sinful, and some people are avoiding sin, so they adhere to the laws as far as possible, but both the categories of people have got one common desire for sense gratification, material enjoyment. So such people anyway are always in anxiety.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that liberation means freedom from anxiety, which arises from false identification with the material body.

So therefore, Srila Prabhupada says liberation or mukti means getting relief from these constant anxieties. These anxiety is described in the Bhagavatam: Sada Samudvigna Dhyam A-sat-grahat. Life in the material world means Sada, always Samudvigna Dhyam, always being in peace, all your entire race, all the various events are connected to you and your starting point are connected to God which means you are conscious of the two dispfta and zodiac so that is the 뭐라사 자기 사 progressed av bins 싶은 첫 superfic sinister어 Life in the material world means Sada, always Samudvigna Dieam meritorious relations is there between you and your opponent any based on your limits of knowledge and passion always bewildered in one's own mind, always filled with anxiety because Asad Grahat have accepted something false as real. It's like we accept this body as the self, but this body is not the self. This body is simply an external covering of the real self. So therefore, as long as we are not enlightened about our real self, we will always be in anxiety with false understanding of our actual self as this material body.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that relief from anxiety is possible through devotional service and enlightenment about one's real self, emphasizing the unique guidance of Shukadeva Goswami.

And this material body is always subject to disease, old age, death, misery, suffering. So always in anxiety, always in anxiety. So how is it possible to get relief from all anxieties? That is possible only when the anxiety is changed to devotional service of the Supreme Lord. We should not simply try to counteract anxiety by some material methods, which we generally do. No, that's not going to be successful. We should turn to devotional service of Krishna. Only way to become completely free from all anxieties. So Srila Prabhupada says, Srimad Bhagavatam gives us the chance to change the quality of anxiety from matter to spirit, to become the true self. So this is possible only when we are not enlightened about our real self. How is this done? This is done in the association of a learned philosopher like the self realized Shukadeva Goswami, the great son of Sri Vyasadeva. Shukadeva Goswami instructed Parikshit Maharaj, what should Parikshit actually do to prepare for death and achieve perfection, going back to Godhead after quitting the body. Other saintly persons could not give this assurance to the entire world. What is the difference to Parikshit?

That means all other methods, other than the methods suggested by Shukadeva Goswami, are not effective in helping us to prepare for death in such a way that at the end of this life, we can go back to Godhead. So Shukadeva Goswami recommended to Parikshit Maharaj that you become Krishna conscious by hearing about Krishna, by hearing about Krishna's activities, Krishna's names, Krishna's forms, Krishna's pastimes, Krishna's devotees, Krishna's paraphernalia, Krishna's creation. Everything in connection with Krishna. Krishna Katha. You hear Krishna Katha. Absorb your mind in Krishna Katha and become completely transcendental to everything material. And in that way, if you are situated at the time of death, then you straight go back to Godhead.

And that's exactly what Parikshit did. So Srila Prabhupada says, Maharaj Parikshit, after receiving warning of his death, took advantage of this opportunity by association with Shukadeva Goswami and achieved the desired result. This is Parikshit Maharaj's good fortune that he was very anxious when he was sitting for, preparing for death. He was very anxious to somehow hear about Krishna, think about Krishna, talk about Krishna, engage in devotional service to Krishna. And when he got the association of Shukadeva Goswami, he took full advantage of hearing about Krishna and getting to know about Krishna properly, and thereby becoming attached to Krishna, automatically detached from everything material. And he developed that attraction for Krishna by which he straight went back to Godhead

after quitting the present body. Srila Prabhupada warns that because Shukadeva Goswami spoke for seven days the stream of Bhagavatam to Parikshit Maharaj, other people are imitating Shukadeva Goswami by speaking Bhagavatam for only one week. They call it Bhagavata Saptaha. But this Saptaha is not at all effective. We can clearly see. So, for us to be successful in preparing ourselves to go back to Godhead, we should not only hear seven days but we should hear every day for rest of the life, the Srimad Bhagavatam. That is the recommendation of Bhagavatam: Nityam Bhagavata Sevaya. And in that way we can prepare ourselves to go back to Godhead. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "We cannot be completely free from all suffering in material existence, simply by performing pious activities, materially pious activities."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the four fundamental miseries (janma, mrutyu, jara, vyadhi) and three kinds of other miseries (adhi daivika, adhyatmika, adhibhautika klesha) inherent in material existence, emphasizing that pious activities alone cannot eliminate suffering.

implicated because of which we can lead a happy, healthy, prosperous life in this world. While that is partially correct, it is not the complete truth. Under the influence of illusion, we don't take note of the fact that there are four fundamental miseries and three kinds of fundamental other miseries which are imposed upon everyone in the whole material creation, beginning from Brahma down to the most insignificant creature. Brahma, situated in the highest mode of goodness, even he is a father of all good things, and he is afraid of death. Even he is in anxiety. Even he ran, as Paula terrorized the whole universe. So nobody is freed from fear, anxiety, sadhassa mudbhikta GnadiBS asad grahat. You accept material existence via this material body and you're forced to suffer four fundamental miseries, janma, mrutyu, jara, vyadhi, dukkha, dosha, anu, darshanam. I mentioned this several times in the past, and also the three impositions of material nature, adhi daivika klesha, adhyatmika klesha, adhibhautika klesha. Everyone suffers this throughout the universe.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the importance of spiritual knowledge from the Vedas, particularly the Bhagavad Gita, in understanding oneself as a spirit soul and achieving eternal bliss through Krishna consciousness.

So, we cannot be completely free from all suffering in material existence simply by performing pious activities, materially pious activities. So, that is particularly highlighted in the spiritual knowledge given in this book, in the Vedas. While people are engrossed in the material knowledge, either given by modern books of knowledge, or given by the Vedas, they forget the ultimate reality of material existence, which in essence is simply suffering. All those who have born, have to die. In the Bhagavad Gita, second chapter, Krishna says, of one who has taken birth in this material world, it is certain that such person will have to die. And the example is in the Bhagavatam, here are Nikashipa who wanted to be immortal in that very body that he had taken birth, and Brahma said, no, you cannot be immortal in this body, nobody can be immortal, even Brahma cannot be immortal in the same body in which he has taken birth, even he has to leave his body. Therefore, the Vedas instruct us, especially Bhagavad Gita, which gives the essence of the Vedic wisdom, the spiritual wisdom in the Vedas, that you are spirit soul, and as spirit soul, you are entitled to spiritual bliss, eternal life of spiritual bliss and spiritual knowledge, Satchidananda, state of existence, and that is possible by realizing yourself as spiritual by nature, same quality as Krishna, the Supreme.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Vedic knowledge guides individuals towards both material needs and spiritual salvation, emphasizing that merely becoming free from material bondage without realizing one's spiritual self is imperfect because the soul is always active.

And such realization is perfected by Krishna consciousness, by bhakti yoga, not by any other method. Therefore, Srila Prabhupada says, the knowledge of the Vedas ultimately aims at perfection of self-realization. In other words, Srila Prabhupada says, the Vedas are the guides for the civilized man in every respect, since human life is the opportunity to get free from all material miseries, it is properly guided by the knowledge of the Vedas in the matters of both material needs and spiritual salvation. Material needs and spiritual salvation. Material necessities are there of the body, but that is very easy, taken care of by following the Vedic directions and most importantly if we follow the Vedas then we can also achieve spiritual salvation, spiritual liberation. There is a material conception of liberation where one merely thinks that let me become free from all material problems or material miseries or material bondage, but merely becoming free from all material bondage without realizing one's own spiritual self is imperfect, why? Because as spirit soul we are, we are always active. We are always active. We cannot be inactive. We cannot be without activity, a spirit soul. So those who become free from

longevity and physical liberation because they are free from the mind-mental appetite, they can innately become free from their inner activity, they can become free from everything, they feel free from death and all physical and material self. It is one of the most important aspects that life libretto lives are Graveос in mining and efflores advisory services a month prior to their mark from material bondage by any process other than bhakti, but do not realize their spiritual self, they actually do not sustain their state of freedom from material bondage because they do not know about the activities after becoming free from material bondage. If they are not engaged in pure devotional service to Krishna, so pure devotional service to Krishna is not only freedom from material bondage but also engagement in the spiritual state of existence, active service to Krishna, spiritual state of existence. So therefore we need not only to fulfill the demands of this body, the material needs, but also work for attaining the spiritual state of existence beyond this material existence.

**Key Quote:** "By birth everybody is ignorant."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the intelligent class of men devoted to the Vedas, called vipras, and explains that everyone is born ignorant, even in a brahmana family, requiring purification through samskaras.

And that is possible only by bhakti, bhakti yoga. Further, Srila Prabhupada says, the specific intelligent class of men who were devoted particularly to the knowledge of the vedas were called the vipras or the graduates of the vedic knowledge. There are four stages of this development in terms of the brahmanical culture. What do the scriptures say? Janmana jayate shudra, by birth everybody is ignorant. Shudra here means one is born ignorant. Please explain in the Bhagavad-Gita also, icha dvesha samuthena dvandva mohena bharata sarva bhutani sammoham sargayanti parantapa. Everyone is born into ignorance in this material world, even if one takes birth in a brahmana family with good parents, very nice cultured family, very nice, one may have a very nice upbringing, but it is necessary to actually undergo samskara, purification, cultural purification, even after taking birth in a brahmana family. And that's what exactly Yudhishthira Maharaj is doing. He is doing this samskara called jatakarma for the child Parikshet which is performed by qualified brahmanas and the vedas further say, janmana jayate shudra samskara vijam ucyate.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of a second birth through cultural purification (samskaras), highlighting jatakarma and upanayana (sacred thread ceremony) as essential for spiritual progress.

One gets a second birth. The first birth is by the parents, the mother and father who conceive a child. The second birth is by cultural purification, samskara. There are ten kinds of samskara, dashavida samskara and jatakarma is one of them. So samskara vijam ucyate, the particular samskara which actually gives one the status of being twice born, second birth is called upanayana, the sacred thread ceremony. So this samskara is required for advancement or progress on the spiritual path in the human form of life. So I'll stop here, we'll discuss more in the

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam about Maharaj Pariksit and Sukadev Goswami, emphasizing the mutual benefit of hearing and chanting.

In this session we will be discussing from the third verse of the twelfth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This chapter describes birth of Emperor Pariksit. Tad idam srotum ichchamo gaditum yadimanyase bruhina shraddadhananam yasyagyanam adachukaha The meaning of this verse is, "We all respectfully want to hear about him, that is Maharaj Pariksit, to whom Sukadev Goswami imparted transcendental knowledge, please speak on this matter." So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains Sukadev Goswami imparted transcendental knowledge to Maharaj Pariksit during the remaining seven days of his life, and Maharaj Pariksit heard him properly just like an ardent student. The effect of such a bona fide hearing and chanting of Srimad Bhagavatam was equally shared by both the hearer and the chanter.

**Summary:** The lecture expands on the nine processes of devotional service (Navavidha Bhakti), highlighting how Pariksit Maharaj and Sukadev Goswami achieved perfection through hearing and chanting.

Both of them were benefited. Elsewhere it is explained that there are nine different ways of executing devotional service, Navavidha Bhakti, and nine different personalities, they attained perfection of self-realization simply by adopting one of the nine ways of doing self-realization. And in that description it is said Pariksit Maharaj attained perfection simply by hearing properly the Srimad Bhagavatam as was spoken to him by Sukadev Goswami. Then it is said Sukadev Goswami attained perfection of self-realization simply by speaking Srimad Bhagavatam to Pariksit Maharaj and all the assembled saintly persons. So the benefit of speaking Bhagavatam was shared by the hearer and the chanter. Hearer was Pariksit, chanter was Sukadev Goswami. So Srila Prabhupada says both of them were benefited.

**Key Quote:** "Transcendental realization is attained by such serious hearing and chanting and not otherwise."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts genuine devotional service with bogus methods of spiritual realization, particularly criticizing the idea of transferring spiritual power through touch.

Pariksit Maharaj as well as Sukadev Goswami. Out of the nine different transcendental means of devotional service to the Lord prescribed in the Bhagavatam: Shravanam, Kirtanam, Vishnu, Asmaranam, Padusevanam, Archanam, Vandanam, Dasyam, Sukhyam, Atmanivedanam, either all of them, or some of them, or even one of them, were benefited. equally beneficial if properly discharged. Maharaj Pariksit and Shukadev Goswami were serious performers of the first two items namely the process of chanting and the process of hearing and therefore both of them were successful in their laudable attempt. Srila Prabhupada is now going to tell a very very important point for all of us to note regarding devotional service. Transcendental realization is attained by such serious hearing and chanting and not otherwise. There is a type of spiritual visualization that has made perfect sense to all of us and to wish master and disciple much advertised in this age of Kali. It is said that the master injects spiritual force into the disciple by an electric current generated by the master and the disciple begins to feel the shock. He becomes unconscious and the master weeps for his exhausting his store of so-called spiritual assets. Such bogus advertisement

So, Srila Prabhupada is talking about the bogus methods adopted by some bogus spiritualists or spiritual masters or spiritual learners. Both are bogus because nowhere in the scriptures you can find any description that the master is touching the disciple, the spiritual master is touching the disciple and some spiritual force is injected. All this is bogus. This is rubbish, nonsense. There is no such thing in the entire Vedic literature. And further you see the description here of this bogus people that some by the touch some electrical current is generated and the disciple feels some kind of shock. And suddenly the disciple becomes unconscious because of the shock. And this bogus spiritual master, he begins to cry. Oh, by touching you, my spiritual asset is completely become nil. I have lost all the knowledge that I had. This kind of advertisement is going on and it's being glorified. This is a great enlightenment of the disciple by the touch of the master.

**Key Quote:** "No such thing is there."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that authentic Vedic literature focuses on hearing and speaking, not on physical touch or miraculous experiences, reiterating the warning against false practices.

This is totally bogus. Nowhere in the entire Vedic, authentic Vedic literature you find that somebody is touching and then he becomes bereft of all his transcendental knowledge and the disciple is enlightened and the disciple is enlightened. The disciple feels shock. All these bogus things are never there in any authentic scriptures. On the other hand, we find in every Upanishad, in every Purana, we find they are sitting and hearing, asking intelligent questions and the spiritual master is speaking coherently, very, very specifically answering questions. The spiritual master is answering the question to the point without any of this kind of touching and shock and unconscious experience. None of these bogus things are there in the scriptures. So Srila Prabhupada is warning us, please don't become victim of such false propaganda. These are all for... Innocent, ignorant, poor people who do not know what is spiritual life and they are somehow attracted by some advertisement and they are cheated, completely cheated. Nothing is going to happen by somebody touching that some touch will make somebody enlightened. No such thing. No such thing. No such thing is there.

**Summary:** The speaker questions the need for extensive scriptures and commentaries if enlightenment could be achieved through touch, highlighting the importance of knowledge and the role of acharyas.

Why are there so many books? Why is there so much wealth of literature? What is the reason? If touch were to work, why there has to be so much of knowledge? Why Krishna has to speak Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna and through Arjuna to all of us? And that has to be explained. Every single word spoken by Krishna is explained by the... ...atcharyas. Nowhere we find any acharyas touching somebody and making that person enlightened. Nowhere we find like that. Why the acharyas have to write commentaries? Why they have to explain systematically? So please beware of false advertisement by such bogus spiritual masters and bogus disciples, that is Şathrâäm but that is big deal... it's total cheating I don't want to mention the name but you inquire and you will know that this is so much advertised of one so called guru and his disciple and both are worshipped and become very very popular and a big institution is today they're standing in the name of that bogus master and bogus disciple and people are glorifying this business of touching and electric current and enlightenment and unconscious experience they are

**Summary:** The speaker returns to the example of Sukadev Goswami and Maharaj Pariksit, emphasizing that ardent hearing from a bona fide master is the true path to transcendental knowledge.

glorifying this this is total cheating so Srila Prabhupada says we do not find a such folk tales in the dealings of Shukadev Goswami and his great disciple Maharaj Pariksit the sage that Shukadev Goswami recited Srimad Bhagavatam in devotion and the great king heard him properly the king did not feel any shock of electric current from the master nor did he become unconscious while receiving the knowledge from the master No such thing is described anywhere in the entire Bhagavatam one should not therefore become a victim of these unauthorized advertisements made by some bogus representative of Vedic knowledge the sages of Navamishan Ranya were very respectful in hearing about Maharaj Pariksit because of his receiving knowledge from Shukadev Goswami by means of ardent hearing very respect abiding viewers following Mr. Shreed Mector's teachings. respectfully, very attentively, very seriously, very nicely, Parikshit Maharaj sat down firmly and heard every single word spoken by Sukhadev Goswami. Ardent hearing from the bona fide master is the only way to receive transcendental knowledge and there is no need for medical performances or occult mysticism for miraculous effects.

None of these things are described anywhere in the scriptures. The process is simple but only the sincere party can achieve the desired result which means that as practitioners of Bhakti Yoga, each one of us, we have to properly hear from Srila Prabhupada or those who are speaking on behalf of Prabhupada, as a representative of Prabhupada, those who are speaking, exactly what Prabhupada has spoken or what he has taught and reasonably explaining to the hearers, to the inquisitive learners, very systematically, patiently, clearly explaining the subject matter. And the hearers also ask questions to clear doubts, to enrich themselves in the knowledge. That's why we have exclusive question and answer session where devotees, who are hearing, are asking questions to clarify certain points. We don't have any such bogus touching and enlightenment and electric current. Neither any bona fide spiritual master will ever do that. Please remember this.

In this session, we will be discussing three verses, verses 31, 32, and 33 of the twelfth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The thirty-first verse is as follows. The meaning of this verse is: as the moon in its waxing fortnight develops day after day, so the royal prince Pariksit very soon developed luxuriantly under the care and full facilities of his guardian grandfathers. So, after the foretelling of the brahmanas, the child was raised. Pariksit was raised very nicely by the grandfathers, the five Pandava brothers, the Pandavas, headed by Yudhishthira. The only surviving descendant was this Pariksit. So, therefore, this Pariksit was raised very nicely and he had good care and attention of all the grandfathers, all the five grandfathers.

**Key Quote:** "So, in order to become free from that guilt, he heard instructions of Bhishma Deva."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Yudhishthira's desire to perform the Ashwamedha sacrifice to atone for the deaths in the Kurukshetra war, and his lack of funds.

The thirty-second verse: Yatsyama. Yatsyama no ashwamedhena nyati droha jihasaya raja labdh dhano dadyau nan yatra karadandayoh. The meaning of this verse is: just at this time, King Yudhishthira was considering performing a horse sacrifice to get freed from sins incurred from fighting with kinsmen, but he became anxious to get some wealth for there were no surplus funds, funds outside of fines and tax collection. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, as the brahmanas and viparas had a right to be subsidized by the state, the state executive head had the right to collect taxes and fines from the citizens. After the battle of Kurukshetra, the state treasury was exhausted and therefore there was no surplus fund except the fund from tax collections and fines. Such funds were sufficient only for the state budget and having no excess fund, the king was anxious to get more wealth in some other way in order to perform the horse sacrifice. Maharaja Yudhishthira wanted to perform the sacrifice under the instruction of Bhishma Deva. So, the history is that after the battle of Kurukshetra, Yudhishthira was thinking that he was responsible for the massacre of such a huge number of Kshatriyas who died in the battle. So, he felt very guilty. Just for me to become the emperor, so many had to be killed. So, in order to become free from that guilt, he heard instructions of Bhishma Deva. And Bhishma Deva instructed him that you are not at all at fault because it is the dharma yudha, and even if you feel that you want to, you have become sinful somehow, you can become free from those residual sins if any, by simply performing this aswam idaiyajna. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj wanted to perform this because Bhishma Deva instructed and he had no surplus funds outside of what he considered the–

**Summary:** The speaker describes how Yudhishthira's brothers, guided by Krishna, went to collect wealth for the sacrifice, emphasizing that sacrifices are meant to please Lord Vishnu.

Whatever taxes he was collecting and fines he was imposing on the citizens and that was just enough for running the state, day to day state administration. So how will he get extra wealth? That is described in the next verse. The 33rd verse, tad abhipretam alaksya, brātaro achyuta choditāha, dhanam prahīnam ājahror, udīcchyām diṣi bhūriṣaḥ. The meaning of this 33rd verse is, understanding the hearty wishes of the king, his brothers, as advised by the infallible Lord Krishna, collected sufficient riches from the north left by king. So Yudhishthira sent his brothers, four brothers, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva, to search for wealth and collect that extra wealth and bring it to Yudhishthira so that Yudhishthira can perform this Ashwamedha yajña. Such sacrifices are performed and by kings only because it requires huge arrangements, huge amount of wealth and that is only possible to be organized or arranged by a king. And the emperor, when he performs at the scale of befitting his position as emperor of the whole world, so then he has to organize in a very big way. So for Yudhishthira to organize in a big way the Ashwamedha yajña, his four brothers went to collect riches from the north. Now they were advised by the Supreme Lord Krishna as to where they can find the wealth. Krishna is of course the Supreme Lord, who is all-knowing. But still Krishna wanted to encourage Yudhishthira to perform that sacrifice. And ultimately sacrifices are meant for pleasing Lord Vishnu. So Yudhishthira went to Yudhishthira and told him, Yajñārthāt karmaṇo anyatra lokayam karma-bandhanah tadartham karma kaunteya mukta-saṅga-samācarāt. So tadartham, the sacrifice ultimately is meant for pleasing Lord Vishnu, the act of sacrifice. So Yudhishthira Maharaj wanted to perform this sacrifice and he required wealth for arranging it. And the four brothers whom he sent for fetching wealth, they were guided by Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "He was so powerful an emperor that at the end of the day's end of sacrifice, the demigods from the other planets like Indra, Chandra and Brihaspati used to visit his palace."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Maruta Maharaj, a wealthy and powerful emperor who performed grand sacrifices and was visited by demigods.

So Prabhupāda describes the history of this Maruta Maharaj, who was a predecessor king of Yudhishthira. So Mahārāja Maruta, one of the great emperors of the world, Yudhishthira Maharaj was an emperor, so many millions of years before, Maruta Maharaj was the emperor of the world. He reigned over the world before the reign of Mahārāja Yudhishthira. He was the son of Mahārāja Avikṣit and was a great devotee of the son of the sun god known as Yamarāja. So this Mahārāja Maruta was the devotee of Yamarāja. His brother Sambhartha was a rival priest of the great Brihaspati, the learned priest of the demigods. He conducted one sacrifice called Shankara Yagna by which the Lord was so satisfied that he was pleased to hand over to him the charge of a mountain peak of gold. This peak of gold is somewhere in the Himalaya mountains and modern adventurers may try to find it there. It is there in the Himalayas, this peak of gold. He was so powerful an emperor that at the end of the day's end of sacrifice, the demigods from the other planets like Indra, Chandra and Brihaspati used to visit his palace. And the demigods generally don't come to the earth. But in exceptional cases where the emperor is a very powerful emperor or very qualified emperor or very pious Rajarishi, they visit the earth and become guests of such great emperors or great personalities on this earth. And because he had the gold peak at his disposal, he had sufficient gold in his possession, the canopy of the sacrificial altar was completely made of gold. In his daily performances of the sacrificial ceremonies, some of the inhabitants of the Vayu loka, airy planets, were invited to expedite the cooking work of the ceremony. So these kings were so powerful that they were sumptuously feeding and giving gifts to all the Brahmanas who would help them to perform the sacrifice. And they would invite even the devatas to be their guests. And in order to expedite the cooking work, because so many people would assemble, they had to prepare food for all of them, they would expedite the cooking work by taking help of the inhabitants of Vayu loka, the wind god, their assistants.

**Key Quote:** "The success of a particular type of sacrifice completely depends on the priest in charge."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of Maruta Maharaj, highlighting his pious activities and the role of qualified priests in sacrifices, contrasting it with the lack of qualified priests in Kali Yuga and emphasizing the importance of Sankirtan Yajna.

They would help in spiritual work. And the assembly of the demigods in the ceremony was led by Vishwadeva. Different categories of demigods were different powers. But it is prestigious that a king is able to get on the earth, is able to get as his guests and get assistance from demigods from the higher planets, who are expert in performing sacrifices, who are expert in making arrangements. Those people helped this Maruth Maharaj was able to perform very nice sacrifices. By his constant pious work, he was able to drive out all kinds of diseases from the jurisdiction of his kingdom. All the inhabitants of higher planets like Deva loka and Pitra loka were pleased with him for his great sacrificial ceremonies. Every day he used to give in charity to the learned brahmanas such things as bedding, seats, conveyances and sufficient quantities of gold, because he had a whole peak of gold at his disposal. Because of munificent charities and performance of innumerable sacrifices, the king of heaven Indra Deva was fully satisfied with him and always wished for his welfare. Due to his pious activities, he was able to take care of thousands of men throughout his life and reigned over the world for one thousand years, surrounded by satisfied subjects, ministers, legitimate wife, sons and brothers. Even Lord Shri Krishna praised his spirit of pious activities. He handed over his only daughter to Maharishi Angira and by his good blessings he was elevated to the kingdom of heaven. He was blessed with a great wealth of wealth. First of all, he wanted to offer the priesthood of his sacrifices to learn his prahaspati. But the demigod refused to accept the post because of the king's being a human being, a man of this earth. He was very sorry for this, but on the advice of Narada, he appointed Sambhartha to the post and he was successful in this mission. Now, Prabhupada explains a very important point. The success of a particular type of sacrifice completely depends on the priest in charge. The priest had to chant proper mantras in a fire sacrifice. Now, if they are not qualified to chant the mantras effectively, the sacrifice will not be successful, the fire sacrifice. Therefore, Prabhupada says that in this age, Kali Yuga, all kinds of sacrifices are forbidden because there is no learned priest amongst the so-called brahmanas who go by the false notion of becoming sons of brahmanas without brahminical qualifications. That's what is happening now. Somebody claims I am a brahmana because he is born in a brahmana family. Whether he has the qualification, whether he is trained up, whether he can chant mantras effectively to perform fire sacrifices, all that is not considered at all. In this age of Kali, therefore, only one kind of sacrifice is recommended, Sankirtan Yajna, as inaugurated by Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.

**Summary:** This segment explains Yudhishthira's fear and desire to perform the Ashwamedha sacrifice to atone for the sins of the Kurukshetra war.

In this session we will be discussing from the 34th verse of the 12th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. We will be covering this verse in two parts. So this session will be part 1 of this 34th verse. The verse is as follows: तेन संभृत संभारो धर्मपुत्रो युधिष्ठिरहा वाजिमेधैस् तृभिर्भीतो यज्ञेई समयजद्धरिम्. The meaning of this verse is: By those riches, the king could procure the ingredients for three horse sacrifices. Thus the pious king Yudhishthira, who was very fearful after the battle of Kurukshetra, pleased Lord Hari, the personality of Godhead. So in the previous verse it was described how Yudhishthira Maharaj sent his brothers to fetch wealth for performing this Ashwamedha sacrifice. So they were directed by Krishna to bring some gold, gold which was left behind by the brahmanas who were engaged in sacrifice by a former emperor, Maruth Maharaj. So that gold, Arjuna brought it for Yudhishthira Maharaj to procure ingredients for performing three horse sacrifices. So however good they want to crucify Yudhishthira and take away their wealth through a battle of Kurukshetra, Kanpaksara's desires became as strong as their Councill. So Ripaaprasadana introduced this 2004 shloka here, that Maharaja Yudhishthira was that ideal and celebrated pious king of the world and still he was greatly afraid after the execution of the battle of Kurukshetra, because of the mass killing in the fight, all of which was done only to install him on the throne. Yudhishthira Maharaj is very, very conscientious. He is not comfortable with his acquired position because it involved a killing, mass killing of so many millions of Kshatriyas soldiers. So he was very, very much afraid of the sinful reactions incurred due to such a massacre. He therefore took all the responsibility for sins committed in the warfare and to get rid of all these sins, he wanted to perform three sacrifices in which horses are offered at the altar.

**Key Quote:** "Sometimes the wealth is considered an impediment in spiritual progress."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the contrast between Vedic times, where people were satisfied with basic needs and focused on spiritual goals, and modern civilization, which is driven by sense gratification and material pursuits, also mentioning how wealth should be used.

Ashwamedha Yagna or Vajimedha Yagna. Such a sacrifice is very costly. Even Maharaj Yudhishthira had to collect the necessary heaps of gold left by Maharaj Marutta and the brahmanas who were given gold in charity by King Marutta. The learned brahmanas could not take away all the loads of gold, and therefore they left behind a major portion of the gift. And Maharaj Marutta also did not again collect such heaps of gold given away in charity. Once it is given in charity, it should not be taken back. Besides that, all the golden plates and utensils which are used in the sacrifice were also thrown in the dustbins and all such heaps of gold remained unclaimed property for a long time till Maharaj Yudhishthira collected them for his own purposes. You see how people were, Prabhupada will explain that, people were satisfied with the basic needs because they had a higher goal in life. The modern civilization, people are just having some immediate goal of living their life for satisfaction of the senses. But in the former times, as directed by the Vedic scriptures, people had the spiritual aim of life. And for attaining that ultimate spiritual goal of life, you don't require to have lot of wealth. Sometimes the wealth is considered an impediment in spiritual progress. Sometimes. Of course, all wealth should be utilized for yajna, for Vishnu, for the supreme personality of Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "The defect of the modern civilization is that people simply know one thing in life, sense gratification."
**Summary:** This segment explains how Yudhishthira utilized the unclaimed gold for sacrifice and contrasts the contentment of people in the past with the modern focus on industrial enterprise and sense gratification, leading to material bondage.

And that's what we will see Yudhishthira Maharaj utilizing this gold which was collected by Arjuna. It was Yudhishthira Maharaj who utilized all that gold for performing three hard sacrifices. Lord Sri Krishna advised the brothers of Maharaj Yudhishthira to collect the unclaimed property because it belonged to the king. This is the understanding, when the king is ruling a certain tract of land, then that tract of land belongs to the king. The king will also utilize it properly for the welfare of the state, the citizens. So Srila Prabhupada explains here, the more astonishing thing is that no subject of the state also collected such unclaimed gold for industrial enterprise or anything like that. Nowadays people are so busy mining for the sake of developing industry. But formerly, even if there was unclaimed gold left behind somewhere, nobody would go and touch that. How is that people were not attracted to go and fetch or take away such gold? Because they know that something that does not belong to me, if I take it, I am going to incur reactions, sinful reactions, for stealing, for taking away something that is not lawfully mine, something not properly earned by me, I cannot take that. This means that the state citizens were completely satisfied with all necessities of life and therefore not inclined to accept unnecessary productive enterprises for sense gratification. The defect of the modern civilization is that people simply know one thing in life, sense gratification, and their entire life is simply meant for such sense gratification, which is implicating them in material bondage.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of taking lessons from Yudhishthira's example, highlighting his fear of sins and his desire to satisfy the Supreme Lord through sacrifice, even for unintentional actions.

Aspirants must know the truth, precwrights should know the truth, that is, respect, caring, love, respect. One should take lessons from the acts of Maharaj Yudhishthira. He was afraid of sins committed on the battlefield, and therefore he wanted to satisfy the supreme authority. Maharaj Yudhishthira is a very, very pious king. He is son of Dharmaraja, Yamaraja, and he is perfectly aware of all the laws of karma. So in spite of being pious, in spite of being very conscientious, still he was afraid of sins committed on the battlefield, unintentionally, unknowingly. Unknowingly he will never do it. Intentionally he will never have an intention of killing anybody unnecessarily, never. But unknowingly, accidentally, unintentionally something might have happened in a battle. So he is afraid of that. This indicates that unintentional sins are also committed in our daily occupational discharges. And to counteract even such unintentional crimes, one must perform sacrifices as they are recommended in the revealed scriptures. So Shastra says, if you have committed some sin unintentionally, unknowingly, still you have to perform recommended sacrifices.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, the main purpose of performing sacrifices is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Hari."
**Summary:** This segment explains the importance of performing sacrifices as recommended in the scriptures to counteract sinful reactions and satisfy the Supreme Lord, leading to peace and prosperity.

The Lord says in Bhagavad Gita, yajñārthāt karmano anyatra loko yam karma-bandhanah. In the third chapter, ninth verse, Krishna says this, that one must perform sacrifices recommended in the scriptures in order to get rid of commitments of all unauthorized work or even unintentional crimes which we are apt to commit. Therefore, if one performs the recommended sacrifices, then they are freed from sinful reactions. And those who do not do so, those who do not perform sacrifices, but work for self-interest or sense gratification, such people have to undergo all tribulations accrued from committed sins. The laws of nature are very subtle and they are working perfectly and there is an enforcing authority, material nature itself being directed by the Supreme Lord Krishna. Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ śūyateśaccharācaram. So, intelligent people understand that any person suffering in this world is only because that person has committed sinful activities for which he is suffering the reactions in the form of miseries, troubles and dangers, diseases and all kinds of, any kind of suffering. Therefore, the main purpose of performing sacrifices is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Hari. The process of performing sacrifices may be different in terms of different times, places and persons. Kāla, Deśa and Pātra. These are Sanskrit words: Time, place and person. But the aim of such sacrifices is one and the same at all times and in all circumstances, namely, satisfaction of the Supreme Lord Hari. Only one aim of performing sacrifices as given in the scriptures, simply to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Hari. That is the way of pious life and that is the way of peace and prosperity in the world at large. So, by performing sacrifice for the pleasure of the Supreme Lord Hari, we not only are engaged in pious activity but we are also able to attain peace and prosperity by such performance sacrifices.

### sin, sacrifice, Kali Yuga

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Then we can just imagine the amount of sins committed consciously or unconsciously by the untrained population of the Kali Yuga who have no way to perform sacrifice to please the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the difficulty of avoiding sin in Kali Yuga, especially compared to the time of Yudhishthira, and the lack of means for the general population to perform sacrifices to atone for sins.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udhirayet. In this session, we will continue discussion of the 34th verse, which we began in the previous session, of the 12th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The verse I will just recite once again just to refresh your memory: Tenasamrita Sambharo Dharmaputro Yudhishthiraha Vajimedai Stribirbhito Yajnai Samayajad Harim. The meaning of this verse is: by those riches, the king could procure the ingredients for three horse sacrifices; thus, the pious king Yudhishthira, who was very fearful after the battle of Kurukshetra, pleased Lord Hari, the personality of Godhead. So continuing the purport, if Maharaj Yudhishthira is a sinner in his daily discharge of duties in royal administration of state affairs, wherein the killing of man and animals is a recognized art, then we can just imagine the amount of sins committed consciously or unconsciously by the untrained population of the Kali Yuga, who have no way to perform sacrifice to please the Supreme Lord. So those days when people were very careful when they would indulge in killing, whereas nowadays people are not trained, and the influence of Kali is such that they become indifferent to the sins they may commit. They are not worried about it, but they have to suffer. Suffering cannot be avoided simply by being ignorant or claiming that I don't know that I will be punished by doing something wrong.

### sacrifice, chanting, perfection, devotional service

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "सम्सिद्धि, सम्सिद्धि means the highest perfection, is simply possible by pleasing the Lord Hari."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the prime duty is to satisfy the Lord through occupational duty and recommended sacrifices, especially chanting the holy name of Krishna in Kali Yuga, which leads to freedom from sins and the highest perfection.

Srila Prabhupada specifically says here, in Kali Yuga people do not have a way of becoming free from the sinful reactions. Srila Prabhupada says therefore that the prime duty of the human being is to satisfy the Supreme Lord by the performance of one's occupational duty under varnashrama dharma. स्वानुष्ठितस्य धर्मस्य संसिद्धिर् हरितोषणम्. संसिद्धि, संसिद्धि means the highest perfection, is simply possible by pleasing the Lord Hari. So, should I proper further explain? Let any man of any place or community, caste or creed be engaged in any sort of occupational duty, but he must agree to perform sacrifices as it is recommended in the scriptures for the particular place, time, and person. So the occupational duty per se does not matter so much, but rather the people should perform recommended sacrifices and thereby become free from all reactions. In the Vedic literatures, it is recommended that in Kali Yuga or present age, people engage in glorifying the Lord by chanting the holy name of Krishna. In the Bhagavatam, in different places it is said that people should engage in glorifying the Lord by chanting his holy name. In the twelfth canto also it is told, kirtanadeva krishnasya muktasanga param vrajet. So people have to actually perform the sacrifice of chanting the holy name of Krishna. That is what people have to do. By doing so, one can be free from all sins and thus can attain the highest perfection of life by returning home back to Godhead. People think of the highest perfection of life is to attain liberation, but that liberation is not possible if one does not engage in devotional service. So therefore, by devotional service one can be free from all sins and can also attain the highest perfection simultaneously by practising bhakti regularly.

### Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Sankirtan Yagna, sacrifice, Kali Yuga

**Key Quote:** "Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has taught us simply perform this Sankirtan Yagna and get the highest benefit."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's teaching of Sankirtan Yagna as the most beneficial sacrifice in Kali Yuga, as it is simple and effective.

Especially in the introductory portion, by sketching the life of Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, in the beginning of this Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada has given a biography of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and it is observed that in Kali Yuga people are generally not inclined to perform sacrifice due to different reasons, but Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has taught us simply perform this Sankirtan Yagna and get the highest benefit. The Lord has declared openly in Bhagavad Gita how he becomes pleased with us, and the same process is practically demonstrated in the life and preaching work of Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Bhagavad Gita Krishna clearly says if you perform sacrifice for the sake of my pleasure, that is the proper way. So Chaitanya Mahaprabhu practically demonstrated in this life and also preaching that anyone can actually chant Hare Krishna and perfect their life. It is possible for anyone. The perfect process of performing Yagna or sacrifice to please the Supreme Lord Hari is to follow the ways of Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in this dark age of quarrel and dissension. So Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has taught a specific method of performing Yagna and that is called Sankirtanam, congregational chanting of the holy name. That is the way especially in this Yuga, Kali Yuga.

### sacrifice, economy, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, chanting

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Just suitable for the age is the method recommended by Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in terms of the Shastra."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the difficulty of performing traditional Yagnas requiring vast resources with the simplicity and effectiveness of chanting Hare Krishna as taught by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, which requires no expenditure.

Maharaj Yudhishthira had to collect heaps of gold to secure the paraphernalia for the horse sacrifice Yagnas in days of sufficiency. Those days people had lot of natural resources and all their desires easily fulfilled by the Supreme Lord, they are all pious. But in other cases, somebody may not be able to offer sacrifices to the Supreme Lord, sacrifices to the Supreme Lord the way Yudhishthira Maharaj performed. That is not possible. So people of this age can hardly think of such performance of Yagnas in these days of insufficiency and complete scarcity of gold. Where will they get gold from, so much of gold that Yudhishthira Maharaj spent? So it is not practically possible. It is not practically possible. And Prabhupada makes a remark about the modern system of economy. At the present moment, we have heaps of papers and promises of their being converted into gold by economic development of modern civilization, and still there is no possibility of spending riches like Maharaj Yudhishthira either individually or collectively or by state patronization. State never promotes and finances such Yagnas, but even people cannot spend the kind of money individually or collectively which Yudhishthira Maharaj spent. So Srila Prabhupada says just suitable for the age is the method recommended by Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in terms of the Shastra. Now what Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is recommending is not his own recommendation, though it is Supreme Lord disguised as a devotee, but he is not recommending anything which is not in the scriptures. Such a method requires no expenditure at all. What is the expenditure in chanting Hare Krishna and yet can award more benefit than other expensive methods?

### chanting, sacrifice, animal sacrifice, Vedic mantras
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/zTj7R9bpezY?t=720
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So therefore, it is recommended to chant the holy name of Supreme Lord Hari and easy, inexpensive, effective way of doing sacrifice in this age."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that animal sacrifices in Vedic times were different from modern slaughter, as the animals were rejuvenated by Vedic mantras chanted by qualified brahmanas, which is not possible today, making chanting the best sacrifice.

Somebody takes up ashtanga, sorry, the method of meditation, the method of cultivating knowledge, etc., then we cannot get more benefit in this way than what is obtained by chanting Hare Krishna in the association of devotees. The horse sacrifice Yagna or cow sacrifice Yagna performed by the Vedic regulations should not be misunderstood as a process of killing animals. Sometimes meat eaters they say that you tell us not to eat meat, but then formerly even the pious people used to perform animal sacrifices. So isn't it very difficult to eat meat? People they always took sin as soul to kill animals and eat their flesh when plenty of fruits, vegetables, and all vegetarian food stuff is available. So therefore, the proper... Now, Prabhupada says, animals offered for the yajna were rejuvenated to a new span of life by the transcendental power of chanting the Vedic hymns, the brahmanas who chant the mantras. And by the power of the mantra, the animal which was sacrificed or killed in a horse sacrifice, that animal would be revived when the priest in the sacrifice would actually chant mantras, suitable mantras. So therefore, the misunderstanding that formerly they were killing animals for the sake of performing sacrifice, now they are killing animals for the sake of feeding the slaughterhouse, but that is not the real proper understanding. The Veda mantras are all practical and the proof is rejuvenation of the sacrificed animal. So when an animal is killed for a sacrifice, then the animal is revived. But reviving such an animal requires the power of the mantra to be chanted by duly qualified brahmanas. And Srila Prabhupada says, there is no possibility of such methodical chanting of the Vedic hymns by the so-called brahmanas who preach of the present age. So therefore, it is recommended to chant the holy name of Supreme Lord Hari, an easy, inexpensive, effective way of doing sacrifice in this age.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verses from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains Srila Prabhupada's commentary on the importance of qualified brahmanas for performing sacrifices, emphasizing that birth alone is insufficient.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udeerayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 35th and the 36th Lokas, the verses of the 12th chapter of the 1st canto of Shri Madbhagavata. Ahuto Bhagavan Ragna Yajayitva Dvijayan Dripam Uvasa Katichin Masan Surudam Priyakam Yaya. The meaning of this verse is: Lord Shri Krishna, the personality of Godhead, being invited to the sacrifices by Maharaj Yudhishtira, who does behind him the noble positions of a highly ranked brahmana. Later He retrospectively says that their roles in the업bapar to receive suffering will be defined by això act as well. Lord Krishna Dvinam have the Dvija who is the demon arbitre. Sirila Prabhupāda explains powerfully that Lord Krishna is the only greedy person among the people of this route. Peti, Rajas, Sahara, and holdalword are called truestadt? caused the performance of yajnas by learned twice born brahmanas.

**Key Quote:** "Such brahma bandhus or unqualified once born skyans must be rejected for any purpose of religious responsibility"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the necessity of proper training and initiation for brahmanas, stating that unqualified brahmanas are equated with shudras and should not be entrusted with religious duties, highlighting Krishna's role in ensuring qualified individuals performed sacrifices.

Further, Shri la Prabhupada says, simply taking birth in the family of a brahmana does not make one qualified to perform yajnas. One must be twice born by proper training and initiation from the bona fide acharya. Here is a very important point: it is not enough to merely take birth in a certain family; it is very important to acquire the qualification by proper training and initiation from the proper acharya. The once-born's kinds of brahmana families are equal with the once-borns born shudras. So, the first birth is by the parents, and in this regard, whether one takes birth in a brahman family or a shudra family, it does not matter; both by birth are not qualified, and such unqualified brahmanas are actually equated with shudras. This may sound very harsh, but this is the reality. And Srila Prabhupada says further, such brahma bandhus or unqualified once born skyans must be rejected for any purpose of religious responsibility, and such unqualified brahmanas are actually equated with shudras or vedic function. If somebody is not qualified, such a person cannot be engaged for performing some yajna or some religious ritual. It's not possible. Lord Shri Krishna was entrusted to look after this arrangement, and perfect as he is, he caused the yajnas to be performed by the bona fide twice-born brahmanas for successful execution. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj took help of Krishna, and Krishna ensured that Yudhishthira Maharaj's sacrifices were actually properly performed under the guidance of qualified brahmanas. The next verse, the 36th verse.

**Key Quote:** "In Kali Yuga, only the Sankirtan Yagna is recommended."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of qualified priests for Vedic sacrifices and notes their rarity in the current age (Kali Yuga), recommending the chanting of the holy name as the primary yagna.

So, we have to understand the importance of engaging qualified brahmanas to perform a Vedic sacrifice. So, elsewhere Srila Prabhupada explains, to perform a sacrifice successfully, at least four expert priests are required. Who are the four expert priests who should be present for successfully executing a sacrifice? One who can offer, is called Hota. One who can chant, Utgata. One who can kindle the sacrificial fire without the aid of separate fire, Advaryu. And one who can supervise, Brahma. So, Hota, Utgata, Advaryu, Brahma. Four kinds of priests are required for performing a Vedic sacrifice. Such sacrifices were conducted from the birth of Brahma, the first living creature, and were carried on till the reign of Maharaja Yudhishthira. But, such expert brahmana priests are very rare in this age of corruption in India. And therefore, in the present age, only the Yagna of chanting the holy name of the Lord is recommended. The scriptures enjoin, Hare Nama Hare Nama Hare Namaiva Kevalam Kalau Nastyeva Nastyeva Nastyeva Gathiranyatha.

**Key Quote:** "O earthly gods, kindly hear us."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates a story about Krishna and Balarama sending covered boys to ask brahmanas performing a Vedic sacrifice for food, illustrating the boys' respectful approach and their explanation of their needs.

So, in Kali Yuga, only the Sankirtan Yagna is recommended. And to chant the Hare Krishna Mantra does not require previous qualification. Another place, Prabhupada says that once Krishna had gone with some covered boys. Krishna and Balarama had gone with some covered boys early morning, taking the calves for grazing. And the boys, after some time, became very, very hungry. So, they told Krishna, please arrange for some foodstuff. Krishna then told the boys that nearby this place, wherever they were, there are some brahmanas who are performing a Vedic sacrifice. So, Krishna told the boys, go to those brahmanas and ask for some charity, some dana. Then those covered boys went to those brahmanas and approached them with folded hands and fell down to the ground to offer them respect. So, what did the covered boys say? They addressed the brahmanas and they said, O earthly gods, kindly hear us, who are ordered by Lord Krishna and Lord Balarama. We hope you know them both very well, and we wish you all good fortune. Krishna and Balarama are tending cows nearby, and we have accompanied them. We have come to ask for some food from you. You are all brahmanas. You are knowers of religious principles. And if you think that you should give us charity, then give us some food, and we shall all eat along with Krishna and Balarama. The boys continued to speak to those brahmanas. You are the most respectable brahmanas within the human society, and you are expected to know all the principles of religious procedure. So, this is what the boys said to those brahmanas.

**Key Quote:** "If you associate with Krishna or his pure devotee, then automatically you are able to get enlightenment simply by performing devotional service"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that association with Krishna or his devotees leads to enlightenment and understanding of religious principles, emphasizing that the brahmanas should have immediately offered food to Krishna and Balarama.

Now, Srila Prabhupada explains, although the boys were village boys and were not expected to be learned in the Vedic principles of religion, they hinted that because of their association with Krishna and Balarama, they knew all those principles. If you associate with Krishna or his pure devotee, then automatically you are able to get enlightenment simply by performing devotional service in understanding all the religious principles, especially those which are meant to enliven us, enlighten us, without separate endeavour at studying or doing some other practice. Simply by association with the right people, you become enlightened, you become enlivened. Now, these boys, covered boys, because they were associating with Krishna and Balarama, they expressed the point of view that when the supreme personality of Godhead Krishna and Balarama were asking for food, the brahmana should immediately deliver some without hesitation, and they should actually perform yajna only for the satisfaction of Vishnu.

**Key Quote:** "The brahmanas lost that opportunity for rendering pure devotion service to Krishna"
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story, explaining the boys' understanding of when food can be accepted and highlighting the brahmanas' mistake in ignoring the request, thus missing an opportunity for devotional service.

Now, the boys continued to speak to the brahmanas. They said, Lord Vishnu, as Krishna and Balarama is standing waiting, and you should immediately deliver whatever food you have in your stock. So, the Vedic culture is no food is refrigerated, but the food may be kept, fresh food may be kept, to actually feed some guests or feed some extra people like that. Now, these covered boys, they also explained to those brahmanas that when food is to be accepted, and when food is not supposed to be accepted. The Vaishnavas generally don't perform ordinary sacrificial ceremonies, but still the devotees know very well about all the ceremonial rituals in connection with offering to Krishna. So, they began to speak to the brahmanas that we can take your food at the present stage of your ceremony. For now, it will not be prohibited. So, you can deliver us the food. We'll take it to Krishna and Balarama. Although the companions of Krishna and Balarama were so very simple in their habits, still, they were in a position to dictate to high-class brahmanas engaged in Vedic rituals of sacrifice. That is because of their association with these with Krishna and Balarama. Simply because of associating Krishna and Balarama they were able to dictate even to the high-class brahmanas. But the brahmanas being very very fruity-minded, they ignored this request of these covered boys, and the boys went back disappointed. So, the brahmanas lost that opportunity for rendering pure devotion service to Krishna.

And therefore, we should be careful in understanding that Krishna accepts either directly from the devotee or through the medium of another devotee provided it is offered with devotion. But these covered boys they were misunderstood and Krishna Krishna sorry the brahmanas who have performed sacrifice missed the central point and ignored these boys' request. So, I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "There is a need for the science of Krishna in human society for all the suffering humanity of the world."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of discussion, verse 4 of the 12th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, and emphasizes the importance of the science of Krishna for the well-being of humanity, referencing Srila Prabhupada's vision.

In this session, we will be discussing from the fourth verse of the twelfth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Suta Uvacha Apipalad Dharma Rajaha Pitruvad Rajayan Prajaha Nispraha Sarvakamebhya Krishna Padanu Sevaya. The meaning of this verse is: Shri Suta Goswami said, "Emperor Yudhishthira administered generously to everyone during his reign. He was exactly like his father. He had no personal ambition and was freed from all sorts of sense gratification because of his continuous service unto the lotus feet of the Lord Shri Krishna." So Suta Goswami is beginning to answer the point raised by Shaunaka Rishi on behalf of the sages of Naimishaharanya. Srila Prabhupada explains this elaborately in the purport. As many of you know, in our introduction, there is a need for the science of Krishna in human society for all the suffering humanity of the world. And we simply request the leading personalities of all nations to take to the science of Krishna for their own good, for the good of society, and for the good of all the people of the world. This is the vision of the Acharya.

**Key Quote:** "Srila Prabhupada as the Acharya is thinking about the well-being of every living entity in this entire world."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's concern for all living beings and how Acharyas, particularly Srila Prabhupada, share this concern and advocate for the science of Krishna to benefit the world, especially if leaders participate.

Srila Prabhupada's vision is meant for doing good to the entire world. Acharyas come to this world on behalf of Krishna. Krishna's concern is every living entity in this material world who is suffering. Krishna's concern is all such suffering souls. Krishna wants to deliver, wants to take back all the suffering souls who are suffering in this material world to his personal abode. So just like Krishna thinks of the entire world, every living being, similarly the Acharyas, and in our present times, Srila Prabhupada as the Acharya is thinking about the well-being of every living entity in this entire world. Therefore, he is suggesting, based on the Srimad Bhagavatam's recommendation, that everyone should simply take to the science of Krishna. That will do them good. And if leaders simply participate in this attempt to distribute this science of Krishna to the entire world, then it will do good to the whole world, to the entire campus, to everyone.

### Maharaj Yudhishthira, Ramachandra, Praja, ideal king

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The king represents all living beings."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the examples of Maharaj Yudhishthira and Ramachandra as ideal kings and explains the meaning of the word 'Praja' to encompass all living beings, not just humans.

So it is confirmed herein by the example of Maharaj Yudhishtira. Ramachandra was the ideal king, and all other kings or emperors in India controlled the destiny of the world for the prosperity of every living being who took birth on the earth. You see, Ramaraja is important because Lord Ramachandra ruled in such a way that there was prosperity for every living being. And Srila Prabhupada now particularly explains the word Praja. Herein, the word Praja is significant. The etymological import of the word is that which is born, Praja, that which is born. On the earth, there are many species of life from aquatics up to the perfect human beings, and all are known as Prajas. Praja doesn't mean only human beings. Praja means all living beings who take birth in this world. Lord Brahma, the creator of this particular universe, is known as the Prajapati because he is the grandfather of all who have taken birth. Thus, Praja is used in a broader sense than it is now used. The king represents all living beings: the aquatics, the plants, trees, reptiles, birds, animals, and man.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Every one of them is a part and parcel of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Bhagavad Gita to emphasize that all living beings are part of the Supreme Lord and that a true leader should provide protection to all, contrasting this with the current demoralized system of administration.

Every one of them is a part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. And this is mentioned in Bhagavad Gita, 14th chapter, 4th verse: Sarva Yoni Shukanteya Am Bija Pradapita. Krishna says, "Of all species of life, I am... I am the seed-giving father." So, every living being is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. The king, being the representative of the Supreme Lord, is duty-bound to give proper protection to every one of them. This is not the case with the presidents and dictators of this demoralized system of administration in the present times. The same then Telugu The rent which has been laid at times happened in the late mud days to the gametea, however the man fewer, better persons where the lower animals are given no protection, while the higher animals are given so-called protection. It's the animal society The man more important such that simply neglectful of the spiritual culture and they live like animals and the government is not really bothered about the real welfare of the people neither they give proper protection to the poor animals the lower animals so Srila Prabhupada says this is a great science how to give protection to all

living beings based on the scriptural directions. This is a great science which can be learned only by one who knows the science of Krishna. By knowing the science of Krishna, one can become the most perfect man in the world. And unless one is knowledgeable in the science, all qualifications and doctorate diplomas acquired by academic education are spoiled and useless. Nowadays, people claim to have done so much advancement in different branches of science and technology, but they don't have any knowledge about the science of Krishna, and therefore all their other knowledge is useless. It results in defeat of human birth, defeat of the entire civilization. Maharaj Yudhishthira knew this science of Krishna very well, for it is stated here, and by continuous cultivation of this science or by continuous cultivation of devotional service to Lord Krishna, he acquired the qualification of administering this state.

**Key Quote:** "He wants to free all the people from the shackles of material suffering."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotional service is not sectarian and is meant for every human being, highlighting Maharaj Yudhishthira's desire to free people from material suffering and his administration based on the good of the citizens.

So this is the necessity for the king or the governmental head to actually continuously cultivate this devotional service to the Supreme Lord Krishna. This is not a sectarian process meant for some believers. No, it is meant for especially every human being. The father is sometimes seemingly cruel to the son, but that does not mean that the father has lost the qualification to be a father. A father is always a father because he always has the good of the son at the heart. The father wants every one of his sons to become a better man than himself. Therefore, a king like Maharaj Yudhishthira, who was the personality of goodness, wanted everyone under his administration, especially human beings who have better developed consciousness, to become devotees of Lord Krishna so that everyone can become free from the trifles of material existence. See the lofty thinking of Maharaj Yudhishthira. He wants to free all the people from the shackles of material suffering. He wants to make them completely free from material suffering. And for that, there is a definite process recommended in the Srimad Bhagavatam. His motto of administration was all good for the citizens, for as personified goodness, he knew perfectly well what is actually good for them. He conducted the administration on that principle

**Key Quote:** "Modern day administrators they rule the world based on giving sense gratification to the people and that is demoniac."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the demoniac principle of sense gratification with the ideal of serving Krishna, explaining that serving Krishna includes serving all living beings as parts and parcels of the whole.

and not on the Rakshasi demoniac principle of sense gratification. Modern day administrators, they rule the world based on giving sense gratification to the people, and that is demoniac. It makes people degraded. It makes people selfish. It makes people cruel. It makes people envious. So that is not the proper way to rule the world or the nation or the kingdom. As an ideal king, he had no personal ambition: Nisriha Sarvakamyaipya. Personally, he had no desire for material enjoyment, and there was no place for sense gratification because all his senses at all times were engaged in the loving service of the Supreme Lord, which includes the partial service to the living beings who form the parts and parcels of the complete whole. So when Yudhishthira Maharaj is serving the Supreme Lord Krishna, that means he is also engaged in serving the living beings who are part of Krishna. Those who are busy rendering service to the parts and parcels, leaving aside the whole, only spoil time and energy as one does when watering the leaves of a tree without watering the root.

**Key Quote:** "When one renders service to Krishna who is the complete whole, then all the parts and parcels, the living entities, they are automatically served."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of watering the root of a tree to explain that serving Krishna automatically serves all living beings, emphasizing that Yudhishthira Maharaj's administration ensured both comfort in this life and progress in the next, concluding the lecture with thanks and Hare Krishna.

This is the example given in the Bhagavatam. As when watering the root of a very big tree, all the branches, the leaves, the twigs, every other part of the tree is completely nourished by the watering of the root of the tree. Exactly like that. When one renders service to Krishna who is the complete whole, then all the parts and parcels, the living entities, they are automatically served by this one action of serving Krishna. If water is poured on the root of the tree, the leaves are enlivened perfectly and automatically. But if water is poured on the leaves only, the whole energy is spoiled. Maharaj Yudhishthira therefore was constantly engaged in the service of the Lord, and thus the parts and parcels of the Lord, the living beings, under his careful administration, were perfectly attended with all comforts in this life and all progress in the next. That is the way of perfect management of state administration. See, not only this life, when Yudhishthira Maharaj was doing administration, their next life was also safeguarded. It was the best preparation for the people for the next life by rendering service to Lord in this life. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskutya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudhirayet. In this session, we are discussing from the 5th verse of the 12th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Sampadakratavo Loka Mahishi Bhrataro Mahi Jambudvipa Adhipatyamcha Yashascha Tridivam Gatam. The meaning of this verse is, news even reached the celestial planets about Maharaj Yudhishthira's worldly possessions, the sacrifices by which he would attain a better destiny, his queen, his stalwart brothers, his extensive land, his sovereignty over the planet earth, and his fame etc.

**Key Quote:** "Yudhishthira was so perfectly ruling...in accordance with the instructions given by Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on King Yudhishthira's perfect rule and how his good administration was so exceptional that it garnered attention even in the heavenly planets, where they usually don't pay attention to earthly affairs.

So this is the wonderful description about King Yudhishthira Suta Goswami is describing. So Srila Prabhupada elaborates in the purport: Only a rich and great man's name and fame are known as the name of the great man all over the world, and the name and fame of Maharaj Yudhishthira who reached the higher planets because of his good administration, worldly possessions, glorious wife Draupadi, the strength of his brothers Bhima and Arjuna, and his solid sovereign power over the world known as Jambudvipa. You see, Yudhishthira was so perfectly ruling. He was the emperor of the entire earth planet, and he was so perfectly ruling in accordance with the instructions given by Krishna and confirmed by the saintly advisors in his kingdom. So he was ruling perfectly, and therefore his administration became very famous, that news reached the heavenly planets. We should always remember in the heavenly planets, they don't really bother much about what's happening on earth except when such an excellent devotee is ruling the entire earth planet perfectly. Except in such cases, the heavenly residents do not bother about what's happening on the earth.

**Key Quote:** "There is life on each and every planet in this universe."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the significance of the word 'loka' and emphasizes that life exists on every planet in the universe, contrary to the modern scientific view, and that Vedic literature provides accurate descriptions of these higher planets.

So, here the word lokāha is a significant word that is used in this fifth verse: Sampadaha kratavo lokāha. Why this word is significant? Śrīla Prabhupāda says there are different lokas or higher planets scattered all over the sky, both material and spiritual. The inhabitants of this earth planet, especially the scientists and some philosophers, in the modern days they tend to think there is life only on the earth planet, and this is completely wrong. There is life on each and every planet in this universe. Every planet there is life. And there are millions and billions of planets, and the living conditions on the planets are variegated. There are much better planets in terms of the facilities provided to the residents of those planets, as described in the scriptures called Svarga loka, Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, Satyaloka, Cetaloka. To each planet there are lives. So, whatever are the problems, they are not for everyone. For the one who lives and lives, every planet lives. And there are millions and billions of planets. And the Satyaloka, these are unknown to the so-called scientists and modern-day educated class of people, they do not know about this, but there is complete, very accurate and perfect description of these lokas in the Vedic literature.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Those who worship Krishna they are eligible to be transferred to Krishna's planet."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the different destinations one can attain after death based on their worship, referencing Bhagavad Gita 9.25, and clarifies that one cannot forcefully enter the higher planets without following natural laws and qualifying oneself.

A person can reach them, that is the higher planets, by dint of his work in the present life as stated in Bhagavad Gita 9.25. What is the verse? yanti deva vrata devan pitrin yanti pitr vrataha bhutani yanti bhute jya yanti madhyajino pimam. Four different destinations are described for four different classes of people in this world. What is that? Those who worship demigods, they reach the planet of the demigods in their next life. Those who worship the pitris, the ancestors, they go to the planet of the ancestors in their next life. Those who worship ghosts and spirits, they attain the above the ghosts and spirits, and those who worship Krishna, they are eligible to be transferred to Krishna's planet, the top most planet, the spiritual planet. So this is the way worship according to the recommendation in the Shastra. So Srila Prabhupada clarifies here further, just like Srila Prabhupada says, the tiny material scientists and engineers who have discovered vehicles to travel over a few thousand miles in outer space will not be allowed entrance into the higher planets. Will not be allowed entrance. Why? Because they are all governed by natural laws. If we don't follow those laws, we cannot enter any of those upper planets. That is not the way to reach the better planets. They have some sputnik, they have some space vehicle and they think by simply travelling they are going to forcefully enter. No, never possible.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "One must qualify himself to enter into such happy planets by sacrifice and service."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of sacrifice (Yajna) and service (Seva) to qualify for entering the higher planets, highlighting that these planets are free from sinful activities.

One must qualify himself to enter into such happy planets by sacrifice and service. Yajna and Seva, Bhakti Seva. Yajna means authorised sacrifice given in the scriptures. Those who are sinful in every step of life can expect only to be degraded animal life, to suffer more and more the pangs of life, material existence. And this is also stated in the Bhagavad Gita, in the 16th chapter 19th verse. It is stated there in the 16th chapter 19th, word of the Bhagavad Gita, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by me into the ocean of material existence into various demoniac species of life. So demons degrade themselves. They cannot forcefully enter the upper planets. That's not possible. Maharaj Yudhishthira's good sacrifices and qualifications were so lofty and virtuous that even the residents of the higher celestial planets were already prepared to receive him as one of them. So the residents of the higher planets are all pious beings and they are engaged in sacrifice. They are engaged in seva, in service. They are free from sinful activities. Sin is unknown in the upper planets.

**Key Quote:** "So this is not at all proper for such people to think that they can travel by some spacecraft to the higher planets where the standard of living is thousands and millions of times better than the best standard of living on the earth."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the sinful activities on Earth, particularly animal killing, with the purity of the higher planets, emphasizing that one cannot reach those planets through mere technological advancement but through scriptural recommendations.

On the other hand, we see on the earth so many people committing sin by killing animals just for the sake of satisfying their tongue to eat some flesh, animal flesh. So this is not at all proper for such people to think that they can travel by some spacecraft to the higher planets where the standard of living is thousands and millions of times better than the best standard of living on the earth. So the method is sacrifice, service, worship, as recommended in the shastra, not concocted worship, not concocted yajna, but as recommended in the shastra.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "It's not going to work."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that King Yudhishthira's proper execution of duties led to earthly abundance and reiterates that forceful entrance into higher planets through space travel is not possible, as it's driven by sense gratification.

So the scriptures are giving perfect knowledge about this process. Yanti deva vrata deva. Now Maharaj Yudhishtira, he was carrying out his duties as given in the shastra. But the result of Yudhishtira Maharaj doing his duties properly is that he was able to cultivate the earth in such a way that the earth was providing everything in plenty. That was described in the earlier chapter. So this is possible not because of forceful entrance into the upper planets by means of some space vehicle or some kind of spacecraft. It's not going to work. As Prabhupada says, they may go some few thousand miles into outer space, but they cannot land anywhere. That's why they are always coming back. If they really were to go to upper planets where standard of living is millions of times better, why will they come back to this earth planet which is filled with misery? Why will they come back to this situation? It's because they are not going anywhere into outer space. Neither they are actually able to land in any particular place, suitable place. They are simply engaged in

**Key Quote:** "It's the worst kind of sin, the greatest sin."
**Summary:** The speaker condemns cow killing as the greatest sin, describing the severe punishment awaiting those who commit it, and offers Krishna consciousness as a means of relief from sinful reactions.

sense gratification, giving trouble to lower animals and committing so many sinful activities, especially killing the cow. It's the worst kind of sin, the greatest sin. What do the shastras say about cow killing? The killers of the cow, they will be punished in hell for as many years as there are hair on the body of the cow. Can you count the body of the cow having how many hair? Impossible. So that is the fate that is awaiting all these sinful people. Their future is very, very bleak. Of course, if they take to Krishna consciousness, then they can be relieved of all the sinful reactions. That's possible if they take to Krishna consciousness, not otherwise.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "even such opulences cannot bewilder a pure devotee, because the pure devotee's mind is fully absorbed in devotional service to Krishna."
**Summary:** This segment explains that a pure devotee, absorbed in Krishna's service, remains unaffected by material opulence, even those that enchant heavenly beings.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 6th verse of the 12th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Kimte Kama Suras Parha Mukunda Manasodvijaha Adhijakhrur Mudham Ragnaha Shuditasya Yathetare. The meaning of this verse is, O Brahmanas, the opulence of the king was so enchanting that the denizens of heaven aspired for it. But because he, the king, Yudhishthira, was absorbed in the service of the king, nothing could satisfy him except the Lord's service. So this clearly explains the position of a pure devotee, even though he may be emperor of this world, with opulences which are able to bewilder even the heavenly residents, even such opulences cannot bewilder a pure devotee, because the pure devotee's mind is fully absorbed in devotional service to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Constitutionally means the way we are made. We are meant to simply serve, serve, serve."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the constitutional position of the living being as a servant, contrasting it with the illusion of being the served, and highlighting how people are often servants of their senses.

So Srila Prabhupada explains very nicely in the purport, there are two things in the world which can satisfy living beings, this world. When one is materially engrossed, he is satisfied only by sense gratification. But when one is liberated from the conditions of the material modes, he is satisfied only by rendering loving service for the satisfaction of the Lord. This means that the living being is constitutionally a servitor. The way we are made. Constitutionally means the way we are made. We are meant to simply serve, serve, serve. And we are never the one who is served. Krishna is the only one who is always served by everyone else. Everyone else is a servant, a servitor. Being illusioned by the conditions of the external energy, material energy, illusory energy, maya, one falsely thinks himself to be the served, but actually he is not served. He is servant of the senses like lust, desire, anger, avarice, pride, madness, and intolerance. Even people who are very, very powerful, very rich, very nicely educated, very influential, but ultimately they are all servant of their senses. When it comes to them becoming victim of lust, desire, anger, pride, madness, intolerance, they cannot control themselves. When one is in his proper senses by attainment of spiritual knowledge, he realizes that he is not the master of the material world, but is only a servant of the senses.

**Key Quote:** "Happiness in the service of Krishna is real happiness."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the realization of one's position as a servant through spiritual knowledge, leading to happiness through devotional service to Krishna, contrasting it with illusory material happiness.

To realize this requires spiritual understanding. At that time, that is when one comes to understand his position as a servant, as a saint. He begs for the service of the Lord, and thus becomes happy, without being illusioned by so called material happiness. Material happiness is not real happiness. Happiness in the service of Krishna is real happiness. Maharaj Yudhishthira was one of the liberated souls. How is that? Because, pure devotee and therefore for him there is no pleasure in a vast kingdom, good wife, obedient brothers, happy subjects, and prosperous world. None of these things could give him real happiness. These blessings automatically follow for a pure devotee even though the devotee does not aspire for them. That means a devotee may be blessed with a vast kingdom, any material opulences, he does not aspire for them. The example set herein is exactly suitable. What are the example? It is said that one who is hungry is never satisfied by anything other than food. Can hunger be satisfied by anything else other than food? Nourishing, relishable, palatable food is the only thing that can satisfy hunger. Similarly, a devotee's heart is only satisfied by devotional service to Krishna.

**Summary:** This segment explains that the material world is full of living beings hungry for spiritual satisfaction, which is often misrepresented as material hunger for food, shelter, and sense gratification, even among the materially satisfied.

And not by anything else. Now Srila Prabhupada explains a very, very important point that we should carefully note. The whole material world is full of hungry living beings. There is no exception to this reality, fact of life. The whole material world is full of hungry living beings. The hunger is not for good food, is not for shelter, is not for sense gratitude. The hunger is for the spiritual atmosphere. Why? Because we are spirit soul. We are not the body. We are not a material product. Due to ignorance only, they think that the world is dissatisfied because there is not sufficient food. Due to ignorance only people think the world is dissatisfied. The world is dissatisfied because there is no sufficient food or no sufficient shelter, defense, and objects of sense gratification. Ahara, nidra, bhaya, maithu, namcha. These are four demands of the body. Every living entity's body demands these four things. And people think there is some scarcity of one or more of these four things. That's why people are dissatisfied. But that's not the real fact. This is called illusion. To think that people are dissatisfied because of the scarcity of one of these four things, ahara, nidra, bhaya, maithu, namcha, is actually due to illusion. When the living being is hungry for spiritual satisfaction, he is misrepresented by material hunger. But the foolish leaders cannot see that even the people who are most sumptuously, materially satisfied are still hungry.

**Key Quote:** "This hunger is actually for spiritual food, for spiritual shelter, for spiritual defense, and spiritual sense gratification."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the concept of spiritual hunger, explaining that the true need is for spiritual food, shelter, defense, and sense gratification, which can be found in association with Krishna.

Even the people in rich nations, in rich households, in very powerful, influential, opulent positions, even they are hungry. So hunger is not for any of those four material needs. And what is their hunger and poverty? This Prabhupada explains. This hunger is actually for spiritual food, for spiritual shelter, for spiritual defense, and spiritual sense gratification. There are two things. There is something called material hunger, material food, material shelter, material defense, material sense gratification. This we all know. We have experience of this. But there is something else we do not know. What is that? Spiritual food, spiritual shelter, spiritual defense, spiritual sense gratification. This is something we have to learn from the Bhagavatam. These can be obtained in the association of the Supreme Spirit, Lord Sri Krishna. And therefore, one who has them cannot be attracted by so-called food, shelter, defense, and sense gratification of the material world, even if such material food, shelter, defense, and sense gratification are relished by the denizens of the heavenly planet. We may see that somebody else in a relatively higher material position may be relishing something, apparently, better than what we have with us in terms of material food or material facilities. But the reality is all living beings in every position in this material world are hungry for spiritual atmosphere, for spiritual food, spiritual shelter, spiritual defense, spiritual sense gratification.

### liberation, eternity, devotional service

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Even Lord Shiva, Lord Brahma, any devata, anybody belonging to this material world cannot give you liberation from material existence."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the limitations of material existence, even in the highest planets like Brahmaloka, and emphasizes that true satisfaction and liberation can only be attained through devotional service to Vishnu/Krishna.

Therefore, in the Bhagavad Gita 8.16, it is said by the Lord that even in the topmost planet of the universe, namely the Brahmaloka, what is the situation in Brahmaloka? In Brahmaloka, the duration of life is multiplied by millions of years by earth calculation. Sahasra yuga pariyantam aharyat brahmano vidhu. That twelve hours of Brahma, Brahma loka, the residence of Brahma loka, where Brahma lives, is equal to one thousand maha yugas of this world. This earth planet. That comes to some four billion years of our calculation. Twelve hours of Brahma, half a day of Brahma, is four billion solar years on the earth. So, in that Brahma loka also, one cannot satisfy his hunger by any material food, material arrangements, no. Such hunger can be satisfied only when the living being is situated in immortality. Asatoma saggamaya. This is one of the statements in the original Vedas. Don't remain in asat, in material existence. Come to spiritual existence. Satgamaya. Eternity. Come to eternity. Come to eternality. This immortality is attained in the spiritual sky, far, far above Brahma loka, in the association of Lord Mukunda. The Lord, who awards his devotees, the transcendental pleasure of liberation. Lord Mukunda. There are so many verses that describe. Mukunda means the giver of liberation. Mukti pradata sarveshaam vishnur eva na samshayah. Lord Shiva says that, Mukti, if you want liberation from this material existence, then that it can be only given by Vishnu or Lord Krishna or Mukunda, one who can give liberation, one who gives liberation, one who factually gives liberation. Even Lord Shiva, Lord Brahma, any devata, anybody belonging to this material world cannot give you liberation from material existence.

So this we have to always remember. And, to whom does the Lord give liberation? He gives liberation to those who are engaged in his devotional service. And not to anybody else who may be doing so many other things other than devotional service. They don't get liberation. They are only given relative material facilities. That's all.

### Brahmastra, Mantra Astra, Rebirth, Womb Experience

**Key Quote:** "After seven months, a child in the womb of a mother comes to external consciousness."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the nature of mantra weapons, the process of rebirth, and the uncomfortable experience of a child within the womb after seven months.

Something extraordinary happened at the time when Pariksit was in his mother's womb and Ashwathama attempted to kill this child by releasing a Brahmastra targeted at this child only. Unlike the modern weapons, the mantras which are used as weapons, mantra, astra, they can be directed towards a very specific target and they will go searching for the target wherever the target may be and destroy the target, attack the target. So that is explained by Prabhupada in the purport. Death generally involves remaining in trance for seven months. A living being, according to his own action, is allowed to enter into the womb of a mother by the vehicle of a father's Samina, semen, and thus he develops his desired body. This is the law of birth in specific bodies according to one's past actions. When he is awake from trance, he feels the inconvenience of being confined within the womb. After seven months, a child in the womb of a mother comes to external consciousness, awakens from something like sleep. When the child enters the womb as a soul, transfer from one body to the next body, a human body, then he enters a human mother's womb. And then for seven months the child is lying, lying as if unconscious, or as if sleeping. But he awakens after the seventh month, and in the seventh month when he awakens, he is like in a mother's womb, in an airtight bag, in a very uncomfortable position, feels the inconvenience of being confined in that airtight bag called the womb of the mother, and also experiences the surroundings are full of all kinds of secretions in the mother's womb, all kinds of urine, pus, mucus, blood, stool, all kinds of obnoxious things, and thus he wants to come out of the mother's womb.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Pariksit while in the womb of his mother was struck by the Brahmastra released by Ashwatthama and he was feeling the burning heat, but Maharaj Pariksit is no ordinary soul."
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes Pariksit's devotion, Krishna's personal intervention to protect him from the Brahmastra, and Pariksit's ability to endure the heat due to his nature as a great fighter.

And sometimes, fortunately, such a soul prays to the Lord for such liberation. I want to get out, please, my dear Lord, help me. Maharaj Pariksit, while in the womb of his mother, was struck by the Brahmastra released by Ashwatthama, and he was feeling the burning heat. But Maharaj Pariksit is no ordinary soul. He is described here because he was a devotee of the Lord. The Lord at once appeared himself within the womb by his all-powerful energy, and the child could see that someone else had come to save him. Pariksit is bold enough to face the Brahmastra, but still, even though he is bold, because he is a devotee, Krishna personally entered the womb of his mother to save the child. Krishna has a personal interest in that devotee, and Pariksit could see someone else has come into the womb, into this place, even at a helpless condition. The child Pariksit endured the unbearable temperature due to his being a great fighter by nature, and for this reason the word Viraha has been used. Pariksit has been described as Matur Garbhagato Viraha. Viraha is a very powerful fighter, brave, bold, able to tolerate the extraordinary heat of the Brahmastra released by Ashwathama.

**Key Quote:** "It is said in the Brahma Samhita that the Supreme Lord Govinda by his one plenary portion enters into the hallow of the universe and distributes himself as Paramatma of the Supersoul."
**Summary:** The lecture delves into the Lord's all-pervading nature as Paramatma, referencing the Brahma Samhita and explaining how Maha Vishnu enters the universe in seed form and expands.

The meaning of this ninth verse: The Lord was enriched with four hands, Chaturbahum, earrings of molten gold, Kanchana kundalam, and eyes blood red with fury, Chatajaksham, and as he loitered about, his club constantly encircled him like a shooting star. Krishna was carrying the club in his hand, Gadapanim, Bhramayantam, holding his gada, he was just encircling like a shooting star, Ulkabham. Srila Prabhupada says in the purport that it is said in the Brahma Samhita that the Supreme Lord Govinda, by his one plenary portion, enters into the hallow of the universe and distributes himself as Paramatma of the Supersoul, not only within the heart of every living being, but also within every atom of the material elements, Andantarastaparamanuchayantarastam. He enters into the Anda. Anda means the egg, egg-shaped universe, universal shell. This is the beginning of creation, that Lord Maha Vishnu, he lies on the Karna ocean, he breathes out universes. They come in seed-like form, but that seed-like form of the universe, into that, Maha Vishnu expands as Garbhodakshayi Vishnu and enters into it. Vishnu means one who enters. So as Vishnu he enters, first of all the material dormant material energy, and then that material energy develops into universes, seed-like form, into each seed-like form of the universe.

**Key Quote:** "Thus the lord is all pervading by his inconceivable energy."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain the Lord's presence in every atom and living being, emphasizing his inconceivable energy and connecting it to his ability to enter Uttara's womb to protect Pariksit.

Lord expands and enters the second Vishnu, Garbhodakshayi Vishnu, and it begins to develop. So entering into that universe, it is described, in the universe, he enters, and then it develops, and he also, as the development happens and living entities are produced, the whole material world is created. Every atom of the universe, material atom also, he enters as Paramatma, Antantarasta, Paramanu chayantarastam. Paramanu means the material atoms, the whole universe. Thus the Lord is all-pervading by his inconceivable energy. Who can conceive the Lord in his form as Paramatma has entered the hollow of the universe? He has entered into the heart of every living being, every living being is entered into the inside every material atom. Who can conceive this? It's inconceivable, achintya. And he also entered the womb of mother Uttara to save his beloved devotee Maharaj Parikshit. If he can enter into every material atom, he enters into every universe, he enters into the heart of every living being, why can't he enter the womb of mother

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Lord assured everyone that his devotees are never to be vanquished."
**Summary:** The lecture highlights the Lord's promise to protect his devotees, referencing Bhagavad Gita 9.31, and uses Ravana as an example of someone who couldn't be saved when Krishna desired his demise.

Uttara for the sake of his devotee, to save his devotee from the attack of the Brahmastra? So in the Bhagavad Gita, again Srila Prabhupada is quoting the Bhagavad Gita 9.31, 9th chapter, 31st verse, the Lord assured everyone that his devotees are never to be vanquished, Kaunteya pratijaanihi na me bhakta-pranasyati, my devotee, mad-bhakta na pranasyati, is never vanquished. So no one can kill a devotee of the Lord because he is protected by the Lord, and no one can save a person whom the Lord desires to kill, maare Krishna rakshake ke, rakshake Krishna maare ke. If Krishna wants to protect a devotee, nobody can kill that devotee, and if Krishna wants to kill some Asura or demon or some miscreant, nobody can protect that miscreant. And that's what happened to Ravana. He was a devotee of Shiva, and he is praying to Shiva, kindly protect me when Rama came to attack Ravana, and Shiva said, Rama, the Supreme Personality of God, wants to kill you, who can protect you? Nobody can save you. And if Krishna wants to protect Parikshit Maharaj, no brahmastra, no person, no weapon, nothing can destroy

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating the Lord's unlimited power, his ability to manifest in any size, and his merciful darshan to Pariksit, emphasizing his grace upon pure devotees.

The Pariksit Maharaj devotee. The Lord is all-powerful, and therefore he can both save and kill as he likes. He became visible to his devotee Maharaj Pariksit, even in that awkward position in the womb of his mother, in a shape just suitable for his vision. Lord gave him darshan. And Srila Prabhupada explains, the Lord can become bigger than thousands of universes, Mahavishnu. He is lying on the causal ocean, and within his body there are millions of universes, and he can become smaller than an atom at the same time and enter into the... Every material atom. Merciful as he is, he becomes just suitable to the vision of the limited living being. He is unlimited. He is not limited by any measurement of our calculation, but he can become bigger than we can think of, and he can become smaller than what we can conceive. But in all circumstances, he is the same all-powerful Supreme Lord. His position, his power does not change. Unlimited power is always with him. So, the Lord mercifully gave darshan to Pariksit and also saved him. That's his mercy upon his pure devotee.

In this session, we will be discussing the first and second verses of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. So, with this session, we are beginning a new chapter in the first canto, the 13th chapter. The 13th chapter is entitled Vritrashtra Quits Home. And here is the first verse: Suta Vacha Viduras Tirthayatrayam Maitreyad Atmanogatim Nyatvagat Hastinapuram Taya Vapt Vividsitaha. The meaning of this first verse is: Shri Suta Goswami said, "While travelling on a pilgrimage, Vidura received knowledge of the destination of the self from the great sage Maitreya and then returned to Hastinapuram. He became as well versed in the subject as he desired." Who was Vidura? Shrilairati Amarath Shilaprabha explains in the purport. He gives a brief history of the personality of Vidura. In this purport, Shrilaprabha says, "One of the prominent figures in the history of the Mahabharata." He is describing Vidura. Vidura was conceived by Vyasa Deva in the 14th century. He took a sweet, light, and gentle way of living. So, Vidura quitted his old Soyine form. He became the central figure of the Mahabharata. In this way, he is the leader of the Mahabharata. He has been a leader for two centuries. He was a great figure and the most experienced in the Mahabharata of this time around because he was a great person. He was a great warlord. Yasadeva in the womb of the maidservant of Ambika who was the mother of Maharaj Pandu. He is the incarnation of Yamaraj. Being cursed by Mandukamuni, he was to become a Shudra. The story is narrated as follows. Prabhupada's story. How Yamaraj had to take birth after being cursed as Vidura, the son of a maidservant. Once upon a time, the state police caught some thieves who had concealed themselves in the hermitage of Mandukamuni. The police constables, as usual, arrested all the thieves and Mandukamuni along with them. The magistrates specifically punished the Muni to death by being pierced with a lance. When he was just to be pierced, the news reached the king, and he at once stopped the act on consideration of his being a great Muni. The king personally begged the Muni's pardon for the mistake of his men. And the saint, that is Mandukamuni, at once went to Yamaraj who prescribes the destiny of the living beings. Yamaraj being questioned by the Muni. The king replied that the Muni in his childhood pierced an ant with a sharpened straw and for that reason he was put into difficulty. The Muni thought it unwise on the part of Yamaraj that he was punished for his childish innocence. The Muni thought it unwise on the part of Yamaraj that he was punished for his childish innocence. And thus the Muni cursed Yamaraj to become a Shudra. And thus the Muni cursed Yamaraj to become a Shudra. And this Shudra incarnation of Yamaraj was known as Vidura, the Shudra brother of Dhritarashtra and Maharaj Pandu. And this Shudra incarnation of Yamaraj was known as Vidura, the Shudra brother of Dhritarashtra and Maharaj Pandu. But this Sudra son of the Kuru dynasty was equally treated by Bhishma Deva along with his other nephews, and in due course, Vidura was married with a girl who was also born in the womb of a Sudrani by a Brahmana. Although Vidura did not inherit the property of his father, that is the brother of Bhishma Deva, still he was given sufficient state property by Dhritarashtra, the elder brother of Vidura. Vidura was very much attached to his elder brother Dhritarashtra, and all along he tried to guide him on the right path. During the fratricidal war of Kurukshetra, Vidura repeatedly implored his elder brother Dhritarashtra to do justice to the sons of Pandu, but Duryodhana did not like such interference by his uncle Vidura, and he refused to do so. And thus Duryodhana practically insulted Vidura. This resulted in Vidura's leaving home for pilgrimage and taking instructions from Maitreya.

**Summary:** This segment explains the meaning of the second verse, focusing on Vidura's attainment of transcendental loving service to Krishna through questioning Maitreya Muni.

This resulted in Vidura's leaving home for pilgrimage and taking instructions from Maitreya. This is the history of Vidura described by Prabhupada. The meaning of this second verse is: after asking various questions and becoming established in the transcendental loving service of Lord Krishna, Vidura retired from putting questions to Maitreya Muni. That means he kept asking questions till he was properly established in transcendental loving service of Krishna, so which means you can understand the goal of all preliminaries in practicing religious principles is basically to come to the point of becoming established in transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "Vidura retired from putting questions before Maitreya Muni when he was convinced by Maitreya Rishi that the samambonam of life is to be finally situated in the transcendental loving service of Lord Sri Krishna."

**Key Quote:** "Like Vidura an inquisitive conditioned soul must approach a bona fide spiritual master like Maitreya and by intelligent inquiries must try to know everything about karma fructive activities about jnana philosophical research for the supreme truth and about yoga the linking process of spiritual realization."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the futility of seeking happiness through material means and emphasizes the importance of approaching a qualified spiritual master to understand karma, jnana, and yoga.

Who is Govinda? Or one who satisfies his devotees in all respects. The conditioned soul, the living being in material existence, seeks happiness by employing his senses in the modes of materialism, but that cannot give him satisfaction. Under illusion, we think, "I can be happy, satisfied in every respect if I somehow engage in sense gratification." He then searches after the supreme truth by the empiric philosophical speculative method and intellectual feats, but if he does not find the ultimate truth, ultimate goal, he again goes down to material activities and engages himself in various philanthropic and altruistic works which all fail to give him satisfaction. So, neither fruitive activities nor dry philosophical speculation can give one satisfaction because by nature a living being is the eternal servitor of Vishnu, and all the Vedic literatures give him direction towards that ultimate end. The Bhagavad-Gita confirms the statement. Krishna says, "From all the Vedas, I am to be known." Like Vidura, an inquisitive conditioned soul must approach a bona fide spiritual master like Maitreya, and by intelligent inquiries must try to know everything about karma, fruitive activities, about jnana, philosophical research for the supreme truth, and about yoga, the linking process of spiritual realization.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of a genuine spiritual master who can guide disciples to devotional service of Krishna, highlighting that bhakti is the ultimate goal.

One who is not seriously inclined to put questions before a spiritual master need not accommodate a show bottle spiritual master, nor should a person who may be a spiritual master for others pose to be so if he is unable to engage his disciple ultimately in the transcendental loving service of Lord Shri Krishna. So, Prabhupada clearly explains here the goal of all Vedic rituals is ultimately to come to the point of engaging in devotional service of Lord Krishna. So, Vidura was successful in approaching such a spiritual master like Maitreya, and he got the ultimate goal of life. What is that ultimate goal of life? It is bhakti unto Govinda.

**Summary:** This segment discusses Vidura's pilgrimage as an example of exemplary Krishna conscious behavior and reiterates that the ultimate goal of life is to be situated in loving devotional service to Krishna.

Thus, there was nothing to be known further about spiritual progress. So, Vidura apparently, as will be explained in the later verse, left his palace for the sake of going on a pilgrimage. Now, people go to pilgrimage to get rid of sinful reactions, but since Vidura is a pure devotee, there was no need for him to perform any religious rituals like that, but because he wanted to set an example how one should lead an exemplary life in Krishna consciousness, he retired from transform land finger all palace activities and went on pilgrimage pIyagam. Now, going on pilgrimage is also significant because one will be able to properly realize. Hmm, another example was vik bigam manohar understand this knowledge of the self only by progressing towards pure devotional service. Therefore, Vidura inquired from Maitreya, and Maitreya was competent to answer all of Vidura's questions because Maitreya was one of the sages who heard from Lord Brahma about self-knowledge. So, Vidura kept on inquiring, putting questions from Maitreya till he was convinced by Maitreya that he was a good man. The ultimate goal of life is simply to become situated in transcendental loving service of Krishna. That's the perfection. There is nothing else to be achieved because our constitutional position is eternally to be engaged in loving, devotional service of Krishna. Jeevera Swarupa Nitya Krishna Das. So, when Vidura realized that and was situated properly, he retired from asking any further questions. So, I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "My uncle you must have visited Dwaraka. In that holy place are our friends and well-wishers, the descendants of Yadu who were always wrapped in the service of the Lord, Sri Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verses from Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on Yudhishthira's inquiry about the well-being of the Yadavas and their devotion to Krishna.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam In this session we will be discussing from the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth verses of the thirteenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This chapter is entitled Dhritarashtra Quits Home. The eleventh verse Apinaha Suhrudastata Bandhava Krishna Devataha Drishta Shrutava Yadavaha Svapuriyam Sukhamasya. This is an inquiry made by Yudhishthira to Vidura. The meaning of this verse is, My uncle you must have visited Dwaraka. In that holy place are our friends and well-wishers, the descendants of Yadu who were always wrapped in the service of the Lord, Sri Krishna. You might have seen them or heard about them, are they all living happily in their abodes so this was the inquiry by Yudhishthira.

**Key Quote:** "The real qualification of a pure devotee is to become wrapped in the thought of Krishna favorably...favorably being absorbed in thought of Krishna is called Krishna consciousness."
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the importance of thinking of Krishna favorably, contrasting it with the unfavorable thoughts of demons like Kamsa, and defining favorable absorption as Krishna consciousness.

So in the purport, points out the particular word Krishna Devata, that is those who are always wrapped in the service of Lord Krishna is significant. The Yadavas and the Pandavas were always wrapped in the thought of the Lord Krishna and his different transcendental activities, were all pure devotees of the Lord. Like Vidura, not only Vidura was a pure devotee, even the Yadavas and Pandavas, even while staying in a palace or staying at home, they were always wrapped in the thought of Lord Krishna and his different transcendental activities, and this way they are also counted among pure devotees of the Lord. Vidura left home in order to devote himself completely to the service of the Lord, but the Pandavas and the Yadavas were always wrapped in the thought of Lord Krishna, thus there is no difference in their pure devotional qualities, either remaining at home or leaving home. The real qualification of a pure devotee is to become wrapped in the thought of Krishna favorably. This is very important, to continuously absorb oneself in thinking of Krishna favorably, that is what is the meaning of favorably, becoming absorbed in the thought of Krishna, knowing well that Lord Krishna is the absolute personality of Godhead, not that Krishna is an ordinary person or Krishna is an enemy or Krishna is a, like the example given here by Srila Prabhupada, and other demons like them were also always wrapped in thought of Lord Krishna, but they were absorbed in a different way, namely unfavorably. So favorably being absorbed in thought of Krishna is called Krishna consciousness.

**Key Quote:** "Simply by thinking of Krishna always anyone can get salvation but to revive our dormant devotion to Krishna and to be transferred to his personal abode...is possible only by the divine grace of Lord Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the difference between salvation and attaining Krishna's personal abode through loving devotion and divine grace.

So favorably being absorbed in thought of Krishna is called Krishna consciousness, unfavorably always thinking of Krishna like Kamsa, that is not Krishna consciousness. Now these demons, they were absorbed in thought of Krishna unfavorably or thinking him to be a powerful man only. See demons, they don't recognize Krishna to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They don't want to accept or they think that they can compete with Krishna. This is a very, very big mistake. Therefore Kamsa and Shishupala are not on the same level as pure devotees like Vidura, the Pandavas and the Yadavas. Simply by thinking of Krishna always anyone can get salvation but to revive our dormant devotion to Krishna and to be transferred to his personal abode as his associate and engage in loving service is possible only by the divine grace of Lord Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker provides practical advice on how to cultivate Krishna consciousness, even while living at home, through chanting, reading Srila Prabhupada's books, and associating with devotees.

This is only for those who are absorbed in thinking of Krishna favorably, not unfavorably. Therefore to think of Krishna in Krishna consciousness. It is described in the Bhagavad Gita that always thinking of Krishna in loving devotion, in thought of Krishna in loving devotion, that is actually favorable and that is that immediately qualifies one to actually be transferred to the spiritual world in personal association of Krishna. Maharaja Yudhishthira was also always wrapped in the thought of Lord Krishna and his associates in Dwaraka. Otherwise he could not have asked all about them from Vidura. Maharaja Yudhishthira was therefore on the same level of devotion as Vidura although engaged in the state affairs of the kingdom of the world. This is an instruction for us that we may not be traveling to Holy places, may not be living in a temple but even living at home if we are able to absorb our mind in Krishna consciousness through chanting Hare Krishna as far as possible and gradually progressing to come to the stage of constantly thinking of Krishna in so many different ways. Maharaja Yudhishthira was also always wrapped in the thought of Lord Krishna in so many different ways. The art of constantly thinking of Krishna has to be learnt from Srila Prabhupad by following his instructions by reading his books, by associating with his devotees, by engaging in devotional service, in varieties of ways recommended in the scriptures we can be always thinking of Krishna and become attracted

**Key Quote:** "Compassionate Mahatma Vidura could not stand to see the Pandavas distressed at any time therefore he did not disclose this unpalatable and unbearable incident."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why Vidura withheld the news of the Yadu dynasty's annihilation from the Pandavas, citing compassion and the principle of not speaking unpalatable truths.

to Krishna and Krishna consciousness, promote ourselves to the kingdom of Krishna in the spiritual world. At any time we can do that, we can immediately transfer ourselves to the spiritual world. The twelfth verse, the meaning of this verse is thus being questioned by Maharaj Yudhishthira, Mahatma Vidura gradually described everything he had personally experienced except the news of the annihilation of the Yadu dynasty. Vidura told everything except that the Yadu dynasty was completely annihilated, that he did not tell. Why? In the 13th verse that is explained why. So 13th verse, the meaning of this 13th verse says compassionate Mahatma Vidura could not stand to see the Pandavas distressed at any time therefore he did not disclose this unpalatable and unbearable incident because calamities come of their own accord. So in this 13th verse it's explained that Vidura did not disclose this unpalatable and unbearable incident of the annihilation of the Yadu dynasty to the Pandavas. Now Srila Prabhupada says in the purport according to Niti Shastra, civic laws, one should not speak an unpalatable truth to cause distress to others. The Niti Shastra says satyam bhruyat priyam bhruyat na bhruyat satyam apriyam. Apriyam is unpalatable, even though it may be the truth, apriyam satyam, unpalatable truth one should not speak because that will cause distress to others. See how refined is

**Key Quote:** "Distress comes upon us in its own way by the laws of nature...just like the example is given of a forest fire nobody goes to the forest to set fire to the trees."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a forest fire to illustrate how distress arises naturally and should not be aggravated by spreading unpalatable truths.

Vedic culture, that you must speak the truth but only that which is palatable. Why? Why is it like this? Because distress comes upon us in its own way by the laws of nature. See nobody can prevent natural calamities, they come of their own accord. Just like the example is given of a forest fire, nobody goes to the forest to set fire to the trees but when there is sometimes in blazing summer heat when there is a wind blowing and there is friction between two dry bamboo pieces and there is a spark, that spark can ignite a fire in the dry bamboo in the blazing sun and that fire will spread throughout the forest, a dense forest filled with dry bamboo plants, it can spread very quickly and the fire will even aid the spreading of the fire and a big portion of the forest can be entirely echeloned by this fire to collect out fire wherever they may be, forest can be entirely burnt away by the forest fire and great destruction can happen. Now this is not due to somebody going and setting fire to the dry bamboo, no it happens of its own accord by arrangement of providence therefore it is said here distress comes upon us in its own way

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating Vidura's compassion and his reasons for withholding the news, emphasizing the close relationship between the Pandavas and Yadavas.

by the laws of nature so one should not aggravate it by propaganda. There is no need to speak of unpalatable truths if we want to not cause distress for people who are already distressed by natural calamities. So this is the, so one should not aggravate the distress by propaganda further for a compassionate soul like Vidura especially in his dealings with the beloved Pandavas it was almost impossible to disclose an unpalatable piece of news like the annihilation of the Yadu dynasty. The Pandavas and the Yadavas they were very closely related both by family ties and because both were devotees of pure devotees of Krishna so they always discussed about Krishna in absorbed in thought of Krishna as you said in the previous verse. So therefore Vidura did not disclose this news of the annihilation Yadu dynasty purposely refrained from it and except that he told everything else about his travels to the Pandavas. I'll stop here thank you very much.

### Vidura's visit, Purpose of saintly persons, Material absorption

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "He stayed there just to rectify the mentality of his eldest brother Dhritarashtra."
**Summary:** This segment explains the purpose of Vidura's visit to the palace of Yudhishthira, which was to rectify Dhritarashtra's mentality, and the general significance of visits from saintly persons to the homes of householders.

In this session we will be discussing from the 14th verse of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. कंचित कालम अथावात सीत सत्कृतो देववत सुखम भ्रातुर जेष्ठस्य श्रेयस्कृत सर्वेशाम सुखम आवहन. The meaning of this verse is thus: Mahatma Vidura, being treated just like a godly person by his kinsmen, remained there for a certain period just to rectify his kinsmen, to rectify the mentality of his eldest brother, and in this way bring happiness to all the others. So this being said of the purpose of Vidura's visit to the palace of Yudhishthira, the Pandavas, after the battle of Kurukshetra. Why did Vidura come to the palace? So he has got a very, very important work. He stayed there just to rectify the mentality of his eldest brother, Dhritarashtra. This was Vidura's purpose. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport very elaborately the significance of the visit of Vidura to this palace, Vasthinapura, and similarly the significance of the travel and the visit of saintly persons of the caliber of Vidura to the homes of householders who are generally forgetful of their spiritual responsibility in their ordinary dealings. They become absorbed materially.

### Devatas, Interplanetary travel, Spiritual culture, Narada Muni

**Key Quote:** "It is only the spiritual culture of the people concerned that makes interplanetary travel possible even in the present body."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the treatment of saintly persons like Vidura, the visits of devatas, Arjuna's visit to heavenly planets, Narada's unrestricted travel, and the role of spiritual culture in interplanetary travel.

So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, saintly persons like Vidura must be treated as well as a denizen from heaven. What's the meaning of this? In those days, denizens of heavenly planets used to visit homes like that of Maharaj Yudhishthira, and sometimes persons like Arjuna and others used to visit higher planets. Of course, nowadays we cannot see the devatas even if they visit the earth planet. First of all, devatas don't visit the earth planets in our present days because we are not engaged in so much in pious activities in Kali Yuga. Most people are not engaged in pious activities. They are busy with sense gratification for selfish interest. So devatas are not interested in visiting such a place. And also in former times some persons like Arjuna could visit higher planets. Arjuna visited the heavenly planet because he was exceptionally qualified for traveling like that. Then Srila Prabhupada gives the example of Narada. Srila Prabhupada says Narada is a spaceman who can travel unrestrictedly not only within the material universes but also in the spiritual universes. So Narada is a pure devotee. He has got all the mystic powers of a perfected yogi. A pure devotee has all the siddhis of a perfected yogi. So Narada can travel without the aid of a spacecraft everywhere within this universe, and he can even travel beyond the material universes to the spiritual world, to the personal abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Vaikuntha and even in Goloka Brindavana. Narada can travel because he is a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Therefore he can travel. Now about Narada, Srila Prabhupada says even Narada used to visit the palace of Maharaja Yudhishthira and what to speak of other celestial demigods. So devatas would visit Yudhishthira because Yudhishthira was very, very, very pious person, and not only that, he was himself a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord. So Srila Prabhupada remarks here, it is only the spiritual culture of the people concerned that makes interplanetary travel possible.

**Key Quote:** "Only pure devotees can go even to Krishna's personal abode from this earth planet or from anywhere they can go."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's book 'Easy Journey to Other Planets', the limitations of earthly bodies for interplanetary travel, the role of Ashtanga Yoga, and the exclusive ability of pure devotees to reach Krishna's abode.

Srila Prabhupada has written a book called Easy Journey to Other Planets. In that book he says that in this present body, human beings who are not on the level of pure devotees, they cannot travel to upper planets in this earthly body. Not possible. They have to prepare themselves and change their bodies to actually transfer themselves to heavenly planets. Of course, if somebody practices Ashtanga Yoga and perfects the meditation process to achieve eight kinds of Siddhi, Ashta Siddhi, then they can travel to the higher planets. But even Ashta Siddhi does not qualify a yogi to go beyond the coverings of the universe. To go beyond the coverings of the universe to the spiritual sky or the spiritual planets requires that one be a pure devotee of Krishna. Only pure devotees can go even to Krishna's personal abode from this earth planet or from anywhere they can go. So they can freely travel.

**Key Quote:** "Vidura accepted out of his own mercy what was offered to him by Maharaja Yudhishthira, but the purpose of living in the palace was to deliver his elder brother Dhritarashtra."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Vidura's renounced order of life, the purpose of sannyasis visiting householders, and Vidura's specific mission to deliver his materially attached elder brother, Dhritarashtra.

So Narada being a pure devotee he can travel anywhere. Maharaja Yudhishthira therefore received Vidura in the manner of reception offered to the devatas or demigods. Further Srila Prabhupada says Mahatma Vidura had already adopted the renounced order of life and therefore he did not return to his paternal palace to enjoy some material comforts. This is a very important point that those who are in the renounced order of life, sannyasis, they should never visit any householder for enjoying a nice reception, for enjoying the comforts that the householders may offer to a saintly person or a sannyasi. No, never. So then why should they visit at all? It is explained here, Vidura accepted out of his own mercy what was offered to him by Maharaja Yudhishthira, but the purpose of living in the palace was to deliver his elder brother Dhritarashtra. This is the real purpose. Why should a sannyasi or a saintly person visit a householder? Just to deliver the householders who are otherwise absorbed in material activities. So here Srila Prabhupada says the purpose of Vidura visiting the palace and living there was to deliver his elder brother Dhritarashtra.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's plan ultimately is that his representatives who are devotees who properly represent the Supreme Lord are meant to administer and rule this earth planet or any other planet for that matter."
**Summary:** This segment explains Dhritarashtra's unhappiness after the battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna's plan for devotees to administer the earth, and Dhritarashtra's continued material attachment despite losing everything.

Dhritarashtra somehow he was very unhappy that his sons could not succeed him. He was the caretaker king of the Hastinapura, the throne in Hastinapura, the royal throne. He was sitting in the in Hastinapura as the emperor of the world. But after the battle of Kurukshetra in which all his sons died in the battle he was very unhappy that his sons could not succeed him. Though by unfair means Duryodhana tried to kill the Pandavas, but Krishna protected the Pandavas and Krishna's plan was something different than what Duryodhana planned or Dhritarashtra desired. So Krishna's plan ultimately is that his representatives who are devotees who properly represent the Supreme Lord are meant to administer and rule this earth planet or any other planet for that matter. So Srila Prabhupada further explains how Dhritarashtra became materially attached. Dhritarashtra lost all his state. Dhritarashtra lost all his state and descendants in the fight with Maharaj Yudhishthira, and still due to his sense of helplessness he did not feel ashamed to accept the charity and hospitality of Maharaj Yudhishthira.

**Key Quote:** "It is a duty of enlightened souls to deliver the fallen ones and Vidura came for that reason."
**Summary:** This segment describes Yudhishthira's compassion for Dhritarashtra, the impropriety of Dhritarashtra accepting hospitality, and Vidura's mission to enlighten and deliver Dhritarashtra.

See, Maharaj Yudhishthira is very, very conscientious that he felt compassion for Dhritarashtra, that Dhritarashtra had lost all his sons and he was in that aggrieved state. Yudhishthira was particularly careful to comfort Dhritarashtra and Gandhari, his uncle and aunt, his father's brother and sister-in-law, to offer Dhritarashtra and Gandhari very nice facilities in the palace. So Srila Prabhupada says on the part of Maharaj Yudhishthira it was quite in order to maintain his uncle in a befitting manner. Yudhishthira was right in doing that. But acceptance of such magnanimous hospitality by Dhritarashtra was not at all desirable. Even though Yudhishthira offered Dhritarashtra very nice facility to stay very comfortably, but for Dhritarashtra it was not proper. He accepted it because he thought there was no alternative. Dhritarashtra thought there was what else do I have? But Vidura particularly came to enlighten Dhritarashtra and to give him a lift to the higher status of spiritual cognition. Vidura came to enlighten Dhritarashtra that his last days he should not spend comfortably living in a palace accepting all the kind hospitality of Yudhishthira. No. So Srila Prabhupada says it is a duty of enlightened souls to deliver the fallen ones and Vidura came for that reason. So Vidura came for the purpose of enlightening Dhritarashtra.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the refreshing nature of spiritual talks, their ability to attract everyone, the importance of attentive hearing, and the transformative power of hearing messages from the Bhagavatam and Bhagavad Gita to achieve Krishna consciousness.

And it will be explained in this chapter that Vidura was successful in impressing upon Dhritarashtra the importance of preparing himself to quit his body by becoming spiritually enlightened. But Srila Prabhupada further says but talks of spiritual enlightenment are so refreshing that while instructing Dhritarashtra, Vidura attracted the attention of all the members of the family and all of them took pleasure in hearing him patiently. Spiritual talks are always enlivening for the soul. Spiritual talks even though may be intended for particular people but it can be enlivening for everyone. Even the younger ones or those otherwise engaged can also become attracted by spiritually enlivening talks. This is the way of spiritual realization. The message should be heard attentively and if spoken by a realized soul it will act on the dormant heart of the conditioned soul. If we simply hear the spiritual messages from the Bhagavatam and the Bhagavad Gita it will work on our heart and our heart will get transformed and purified so that we can become Krishna conscious and prepare ourselves to go back to God.

### Vidura's birth, Curse of Yamaraj, Lineage of Dhritarashtra and Pandu
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/Gz918Ho68hY?t=76
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Vidura, born in the womb of a Shudra woman, was forbidden even to be a party of royal heritage, along with his brothers Dhritarashtra and Pandu."
**Summary:** This segment explains the story of Vidura's birth as the son of a maidservant, his relationship to Dhritarashtra and Pandu, and his resulting lack of inheritance rights.

The meaning of this verse is, as long as Vitura played the part of a Shudra, being cursed by Manduka Muni, Arhyama officiated at the post of Yamaraj to punish those who committed sinful acts. So in the Purport, Shila Prabhupada explains, already it has been told that Vitura was actually Yamaraj. Yamaraj was a Shudra. Yamaraj was cursed due to a small mistake, a slight mistake he did, in carrying out his official responsibility. And he was cursed by Manduka Muni. And therefore, he was born as Vitura in the womb of a Shudra woman. But actually, Prabhupada explains, the real reason why it was actually a higher arrangement by the Supreme Lord, that Yamaraj actually was cursed to take birth like that. So the hidden meaning of this particular incident is very nicely explained by Prabhupada in the Purport. So Shila Prabhupada says, Vitura, born in the womb of a Shudra woman, was forbidden even to be a party of royal heritage, along with his brothers Dhritarashtra and Pandu. If I may refresh your memory about who is Vitura, in terms of his relationship with Dhritarashtra and Pandu, all the three are sons of Vichitravirya, but they are posthumous children. They were born after Vichitravirya's death. And how were they born after Vichitravirya's death? This is called Deva-rena-suton-patti. That means, if a person is unable to conceive children, whatever may be the reason, why such a person, such a person is unable to conceive a child. The emperor of the world, he has to have sons who can succeed him. Qualified, capable, trained up sons. But Vichitravirya died untimely. So then there was nobody to ascend the throne. So then the mother of Vichitravirya, Satyavati, the wife of Shantanu, Vichitravirya's father, he, sorry, Satyavati, she called Vyasadeva and asked for a solution to this problem. So Vyasadeva agreed to impregnate the wives of Vichitravirya, Ampika and Ambalika, two queens. But it so happened that Vyasadeva, even though Vyasadeva was in perfect consciousness, but because he was undergoing severe austerities before he came to impregnate these wives of his brother, Deva and Sutrapati, means conceiving a child by the brother in the womb of one's own wife. So Vyasadeva was the son of Satyavati before her marriage with Shantanu. So Vyasadeva was called upon to impregnate these two queens so that they'll be good progeny for later on occupying the throne. So Dhritarashtra and Pandu were conceived by the two queens, but both of them were not conceived properly. So therefore, in order to conceive a third child, and one of the queens was asked to conceive a third child, but she, instead of conceiving one more child, she asked her maid to go in her place to conceive a child. And that royal maid actually was in very proper consciousness, and therefore, Vyasadeva conceived in that womb of the maiden, a maid servant, Yamaraj, who was cursed to be born as the son of a maid servant. So that was Vidura. So Vidura is actually a step-brother of Dhritarashtra and Pandu. So Dhritarashtra and Pandu were the two sons conceived in the queen. Even though they are conceived by Vyasadeva, they are considered sons of Vichitramirya. All the three are considered sons of Vichitramirya. But the son of the maid servant doesn't have the same position in terms of inheritance like the sons of the queen. So Dhritarashtra and Pandu inherited whatever the royal opulence, but entitled to inherit, but Vidura, as the son of a maid servant, was not entitled for that. So therefore, Srila Prabhupada is saying, Vidura, born in the womb of a Shudra woman, was forbidden even to be a party of royal heritage along with his brothers, Dhritarashtra and Pandu.

### Vidura's authority, Spiritual qualification, Transcendental knowledge

**Key Quote:** "Anyone who is conversant in the transcendental knowledge or the science of Godhead, be he a Brahmana or a Shudra...he is a Brahman."
**Summary:** This segment addresses the question of how Vidura, born a Shudra, could instruct learned Kshatriyas, explaining that spiritual qualification and transcendental knowledge are more important than birth.

So the question is being raised, how could Vidura occupy the post of a preacher to instruct such learned kings and Kshatriyas as Dhritarashtra and Maharaj Yudhishtira? If he is the son of a maid servant and he doesn't even have any inheritance, what is his authority to instruct and preach such learned Kshatriyas as Dhritarashtra and Maharaj Yudhishtira? So Srila Prabhupada gives the answer. The first answer is that even though it is accepted that Vidura was a Shudra by birth, because he renounced the word for spiritual enlightenment, by the authority of Rishi Maitreya, and was thoroughly educated by him in transcendental knowledge, he was quite competent to occupy the post of an Acharya, spiritual preceptor. So always the scriptures say, irrespective of birth, if somebody is trained up and has got the qualities of a Brahmana or a Kshatriya or even a Vaisya, even though he may be born in a Shudra family or a Shudra woman, still he is accepted as a Brahmana, Kshatriya or Vaisya according to qualification, training, the qualities he displays, etc. So Vidura was actually Yamaraja himself and even though he was born in the womb of a Shudra woman, he had all the good qualities because of which he was in a position to renounce and seek spiritual enlightenment by Maitreya Rishi and he was also thoroughly educated by Maitreya Rishi in transcendental knowledge. Therefore he was competent to occupy the post of an Acharya or a spiritual preceptor. Now Srila Prabhupada percourses Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. According to Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, anyone who is conversant in the transcendental knowledge or the science of Godhead, be he a Brahmana or a Shudra, a householder or a Sannyasi, kiba vipra kiba nyasi, shudra kenanaya, he Krishna tattva veta, he is a Brahman. If a person is born as a Shudra or if he is a Brahmana or in terms of ashrama, in terms of varana, whether he is a Brahmana or a Shudra doesn't matter. In terms of ashrama, whether he is a householder or a Sannyasi doesn't matter. As long as he is conversant with transcendental knowledge or the science of Krishna consciousness, he is a Brahmana. In terms of Akshara, he is a Brahmana of Krishna consciousness, he is eligible to become a spiritual master.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that knowledge of Krishna consciousness qualifies one to be a spiritual master, regardless of birth, and references Chanakya Pandit's similar views.

ये कृष्ण तत्व वेव्तकृ। One who knows in truth that science of Krishna consciousness, such a person, से गुरु होये, he is qualified to occupy the post of a spiritual master, a spiritual preceptor, a guru, a qualified guru. Now Prabhupada also quotes Chanakya Pandit. Even in the ordinary moral quotes mentioned by Chanakya Pandit, the great politician and moralist, there is no harm in taking lessons from a person who may be by birth less than a Shudra, provided that person is qualified to impart lessons. So this birth is not important at all. That's what the Acharyas have taught us, that is what the scriptures teach us. That's what even Chanakya Pandit says. This is one part of the answer that Vidura is qualified. He has undergone thorough training by Maitreya Rishi. He has renounced the world for the sake of gaining spiritual enlightenment. So exceptionally qualified, even though he has taken birth in the womb of a maidservant.

**Key Quote:** "The second part of the answer is Vidura was not actually a Shudra. He was to play the part of a so-called Shudra."
**Summary:** This segment provides the second part of the answer, explaining that Vidura was actually the incarnation of Yamaraj, one of the twelve Mahajanas, and therefore an authority on Dharma.

That's the first part of the answer. Next is the other part of the reply for that question that was raised. How is he competent to instruct somebody like the Dhrashtra or Maharaja Yudhishthira? The second part of the answer is Vidura was not actually a Shudra. He was to play the part of a so-called Shudra for one hundred years being cursed by Manduka Muni. He was the incarnation of Yamaraj. And who is Yamaraj? Yamaraj is one of the twelve Mahajanas. Mahajanas means they are the authorities on Dharma. In the whole universe there are twelve Mahajanas. So Yamaraj is one of the twelve Mahajanas on the level with such exalted personalities as the other Mahajanas, Brahma, Narada, Shiva, Kapila, Bhishma, Prahlada, etc. So all these Mahajanas are the most exalted personalities in the whole universe. They are authorities on Dharma. So being a Mahajana, it is the duty of Yamaraj to preach the cult of devotion to the people of the world, as Narada, Brahma and other Mahajanas do. All the Mahajanas are first-class Mahabhagavatas, top-class Vaishnavas. And they preach the science of Krishna Consciousness to everyone. They are the most competent preachers of Krishna Consciousness. So, Prabhupada explains further. But Yamaraj is always busy in his platonic kingdom, punishing the doers of sinful acts. Yamaraj has got a duty. Even though he is a Mahajana, he is qualified, but he has got this duty of punishing the wrongdoers. So, he generally doesn't have much time to take leave from his responsible office of punishing the wrongdoers.

**Key Quote:** "Such a devotee is never a Shudra, or a Brahmana, or a householder, or a sannyasi. He is transcendental to all divisions of varna and ashrama."
**Summary:** This segment concludes by stating that Yamaraj took birth as Vidura to participate in Krishna Leela and that as a pure devotee, he is transcendental to all social divisions, making him qualified to preach to anyone.

Therefore, Yamaraj wanted to preach the glories of the Lord. By the will of the Lord, he was cursed to be born as a son of a Shudra. But he took birth at a time when Krishna had appeared as an incarnation. So, he participated in Krishna Leela. And also, he is an exalted devotee. Even though he is cursed, his consciousness doesn't become affected by the birth, because his activities are always those of a devotee in any body, in any situation, in any position. He is always a pure devotee, Mahabhagavata, fixed up in his position as a pure devotee. So, such a devotee is never a Shudra, or a Brahmana, or a householder, or a sannyasi. He is transcendental to all divisions of varna and ashrama. So, therefore, he is the most authorized and competent and most appropriate person to preach to anyone in the whole universe what to speak of preaching to Dhritarashtra. So, this is the explanation given. We should always understand him, Vidura, to be greater than the purest Brahmana because he is a pure devotee. He is also a Mahajan. Hare Krishna. I will stop here.

**Key Quote:** "Vidura has come to instruct Dhritharashtra, to save him from missing the opportunity for self-realization in his human form of life."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the purpose of Vidura's visit to Dhritharashtra, which is to instruct him on self-realization and prevent him from wasting his life.

So, meaning of this verse is: Having won his kingdom and observed the birth of one grandson competent to continue the noble tradition of his family, Maharaj Yudhishthira reigned peacefully and enjoyed uncommon opulence in cooperation with his younger brothers who were all expert administrators to the common people. So this verse is describing what is Yudhishthira's position when Vidura is visiting Yudhishthira. Vidura's purpose is not to enjoy any nice hospitality. Rather, he has come to instruct Dhritharashtra, to rescue Dhritharashtra from his so-called comfortable living towards the end of his life. Instead of preparing for putting the body through self-realization, Dhritharashtra is completely neglectful of his spiritual responsibility. So Vidura has come to instruct Dhritharashtra.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Yudhishthira's peaceful reign and his anticipation for his grandson Parikshit to become a competent successor.

So what about Yudhishthira? So that is being explained by Prabhupada in this purport. Yudhishthira was, the verse says, ruling very nicely, assisted by his younger brothers who were all expert administrators. And he had a competent grandson because as soon as Parikeet was born, the learned astrologist told he is a competent successor for Yudhishthira. When he grows up, he will have excellent qualities. So Yudhishthira was very peacefully ruling, waiting for his grandson to grow up and take charge. Till then Yudhishthira was accepting to rule the whole world.

**Key Quote:** "Even though they were unwilling to kill their own men in the fight, it had to be done as a matter of duty."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Yudhishthira and Arjuna were unhappy about the Kurukshetra war but fought due to duty and Krishna's will, as Krishna wanted a devotee to rule the kingdom.

Now Srila Prabhupada says something important about Yudhishthira, that both Maharaj Yudhishthira and Arjuna were unhappy from the beginning of the battle of Kurukshetra. Why were they unhappy? They were not very comfortable fighting against their own kinsmen, simply for the sake of getting their share of the kingdom to rule. Duryodhana cleverly cheated the Pandavas and sent them away for exile, 13 years. So even after the term of exile is over, Duryodhana refused to give back the share of the kingdom. So then Kshatriya code of conduct is, if a Kshatriya challenges, then another Kshatriya cannot refuse the challenge. So Yudhishthira could not refuse the challenge offered by Duryodhana. So Yudhishthira had to engage in fighting the battle of Kurukshetra because Duryodhana challenged. So even Arjuna, even though he was very very powerful, even Yudhishthira was very powerful and strong and not afraid of fighting, but he did not like to fight for the sake of gaining some kingdom, because by and heart he is a pure devotee. Both Yudhishthira and Arjuna are pure devotees. Therefore it is described by Prabhupada here that they were unhappy from the beginning. Even though they were unwilling to kill their own men in the fight, it had to be done as a matter of duty. Why? Because it was planned by the supreme will of Lord Krishna that somebody like Yudhishthira should rule the kingdom and not be corrupt, non-devotional Duryodhana.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of a ruler being spiritually competent to guide citizens in Krishna consciousness and prepare them to return to Godhead.

Krishna wants the world to be ruled by his representative who is a devotee. Such a devotee is the perfect person to rule because people have to not only be taken care of in terms of their material necessities, but they should also be directed and protected for practicing spiritual life to make their human form of life successful by preparing themselves to go back to Godhead. So that's why it is so important that the ruler not only be competent in terms of material qualifications to rule the kingdom, but also be spiritually competent to guide the citizens how they can side by side, apart from doing their material duties, also practice Krishna consciousness

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna wanted Yudhishthira to rule, and describes the aftermath of the war, the lack of descendants, and the attack on Parikshit in the womb, who was saved by Krishna.

to actually prepare themselves for going back to Godhead. So, because Krishna wanted Yudhishthira to go home and Duryodhana was not a devotee, so he was not giving any spiritual guidance to the people. He himself was not a devotee. So where would he give guidance to others to become devotees? So that is the reason Krishna wanted it, therefore as a duty they had to fight in the battle. After the battle, Maharaj Yudhishthira was unhappy over such mass killings. Huge massacre happened. It was a world war. So in that world war so many people died. Practically there was none to continue the Kuru dynasty after them, the Pandavas. Pandavas took charge of ruling. But there were no descendants in the Kuru dynasty. The only remaining hope was a child in the womb of Yudhishthira's daughter, Lavuktha Rao. And that child in the womb was attacked by Ashwatthama. Even the child in the womb was attacked by Ashwatthama. The last surviving descendant of the entire Kuru dynasty was attacked by Ashwatthama. But by the grace of the Supreme Lord Krishna the child was saved in the womb of the mother. The child was saved by Krishna. This has already been explained in an earlier chapter.

So after the settlement of all disturbing conditions and re-establishment of the peaceful order of the state and after seeing the surviving child Pariksha well satisfied Maharaj Yudhishthira felt some relief as a human being. After the massacre Yudhishthira was very disturbed. But he was instructed by Bhishma that he has to do his duty and not become afflicted by his sorrow over the big killing that has happened in the battle. So he was pacified by Bhishma. Yudhishthira was pacified by Bhishma. And he was even more happy rather even more peaceful when this Pariksha was saved and Pariksha took birth as a competent descendant to ascend the throne after Yudhishthira Maharaj. So things were settled and he felt some relief as a human being, although he had very little attraction for material happiness

In the Bhagavad Gita Krishna says in the fifth chapter: yehi samsparsha ja bhoga dukha yonaya evade aadyantamant kaunteya na teshu ramate buddhah. Intelligent people who are totally enlightened do not take pleasure in happiness arising from sense contact because they know all such happiness is simply a temporary sensation due to the sense contact and it is always a source of misery in the material world.

in the future. All material happiness is like this. It is promising to give us great amount of happiness but that is just a false promise. It is due to illusion. Due to illusion we consider some type of sense contact as favourable and another type of sense contact as unfavourable. So when the sense contact is favourable we think it is happiness. And when the same sense contact is unfavourable we think it is distress. Prabhupada gives a simple example to help us understand. It is like cold water. In winter in the severe cold cold water is very unpleasant very harsh for the sense of touch. The same cold water at the same temperature in summer it is very very pleasing for the sense of touch. In fact we like to take a cold water bath in summer and it is very hot outside. So it is just the contact which is due to some particular situation or condition it is either interpreted as happiness or distress based on whether it is favourable contact or unfavourable contact. This is the nature of

**Summary:** The speaker explains that material happiness is a concoction of the mind based on likes and dislikes, and that both happiness and distress are ultimately illusions.

all kinds of sense contact. We have five primary senses, external senses: the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, sense of touch, skin, and we have one sense within the mind. Now including the mind with these six senses we are trying to enjoy happiness, material happiness of this world. But our only avenue for material happiness through these senses is sense contact. And that sense contact simply is a concoction in our mind and we are trying to enjoy something that is not so nice or something that is painful or something that is pleasurable. Just like another example, if you are given some edible which you like to eat you will think oh it is so nice I am having this for eating because you like the taste, the contact of that edible with your sense of taste, oh so nice. The same thing for somebody else who does not like it. They when they look at it oh I don't like it I don't want it. So even if it is edible even if it is to the liking of somebody some other person for me it is not likeable so I don't consider it as a pleasurable experience to eat such an edible. So the same thing according to our concoction of likes and dislikes we are born into this material world with certain set of likes and dislikes, material likes and material dislikes and exactly according to these likes and dislikes we consider something as pleasurable and something as not pleasurable. So this is the basis of all material happiness and distress. So neither happiness nor distress is actually the reality. Reality is it is illusion. It is illusion. But we in ignorance we seek after material happiness and try to avoid material distress. And we are always in this way under illusion.

**Key Quote:** "These are some of the thoughts which engross the insanely attached householder who is blind to the passing of eternal time."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains the meaning of Srimad Bhagavatam 1.13.17, focusing on how attachment to family and material pursuits leads to wasting valuable time and spiritual ignorance, contrasting this with the perspective of spiritually advanced individuals.

In this session we will be discussing from the 17th verse of 13th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. अनेशु सक्तानाम् प्रमत्तानाम् तदीहया अत्यक्रावण अविध्यातः कालपरमदुस्तरहाँ. The meaning of this verse is, insurmountable eternal time imperceptibly overcomes those who are too much attached to family affairs and are always engrossed in their thought. So this is Sotu Goswami narrating to the sages of Maimishananya. The reality about the time being wasted by Dhritarashtra, even though he is very nicely taken care of by Yudhishthira, he is spending his last few days without utilising it properly for eternal benefit. So that is going to be explained on top of that. And that is the statement made by Sotu Goswami. What is that? Insurmountable eternal time. Time is eternal. But it is continuously passing, passing, passing, passing, passing. And nobody can overcome it. The effect of time, the influence of time, nobody can overcome it. No materialist can overcome it. So imperceptibly this time overtakes us. And particularly those who are too much attached to family affairs and engrossed in thought of the family, its well-being, and children and the bonding of affection between the different family members, like that time just passes away. And human form of life is wasted without any eternal benefit. So that is going to be explained on top of that. So Srila Prabhupada says, "I am now happy. I have everything in order. My bank balance is quiet enough. I can now give my children their first aid. I am now successful. The poor beggar sannyasis depend on God. But they come to me for begging from me. Therefore I am more than the Supreme Father." The Prabhupada says, "These are some of the thoughts which engross the insanely attached householder who is blind to the passing of eternal time." What Suta Goswami stated, Srila Prabhupada explaining, by going into a little more detail, what is the kind of thinking of people who are spiritually ignorant, having got the evil form of life. They are always after material achievements, material happiness, material relationships, material prosperity. Almost to the extent that they completely neglect spiritual life. So what is their thinking? They are thinking that actually they are happy. Because presently their health is good. Presently everything is going on okay. Materially everything is going on okay. They have enough money. They have nice children. Or they have enough to give their children their children inheritance. They have saved enough. And they consider themselves successful because they successfully managed to get a good job or a business. And they have earned enough money. So they also consider the spiritual, especially the sannyasis more renounced. And therefore they don't, they don't have money with them. So they are renounced. And they depend upon Krishna. And in all humility they go and beg from householders to get some bhiksha, some little food for their basic needs and sustenance. So these householders who are foolish, medievalists and a very attached to family, they think these sannyasis, they are just beggars. And they say they depend on God but actually they are depending on a person like me. And if I give some, some small donation then they can, they can maintain themselves. Otherwise not even that. So this is the total misunderstanding of these so called successful people, materialistic people.

**Key Quote:** "Every second of human life is meant for making an ultimate solution to the problems of life."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of utilizing every moment of human life for spiritual advancement, highlighting the problems of birth, death, disease, and old age inherent in the material body and the opportunity to transcend them through spiritual practice.

So Prabhupada explains, our duration of life is measured and no one is able to enhance it even by one second against the scheduled time ordained by the supreme will. So we got a fixed duration of time in this body. Such valuable time especially for the human being should be spent very carefully, cautiously. Because even a second passed imperceptibly cannot be replaced in exchange for thousands and millions of gold coins amassed by hard labour. Supposing I lose time, I cannot regain that lost time by any means. It is lost forever. So, why is Prabhupada telling this? Every second of human life is meant for making an ultimate solution to the problems of life. The fundamental problems of life, which we cannot solve except by spiritual method. If we don't make a solution then we have the opportunity for spiritual practice in the human form of life. Then we simply are going to repeat the cycle of birth and death. And when repeating the cycle of birth and death, we may take birth in lower species. And in the lower species if we take birth, there is no opportunity for somebody in the lower species, a soul in the lower species, to inquire about spiritual life, to take up the practice of spiritual life in lower life forms. It is not possible, generally. So, they are losing the birth and death opportunity for eternal life full of bliss and knowledge by not practicing spiritual life. They spend away all their time in material pursuits. And time lost is lost forever. So, the ignorant people, spiritually ignorant people, they don't understand a fundamental fact about this material body. What is that? This material body subject to birth, death, disease, old age. And these four fundamental problems in the material body are the cause of all sufferings of the living being. Otherwise, the living being himself is eternal and never born, never dies, never has to face old age or disease in this spiritual body, in this spiritual form. Never has to face. So, foolish people forget this that I have got a material body. It is simply the source of all miseries. But I am not meant for this material body. In my original position as a transcendentalist, I am entitled to eternal life full of bliss and knowledge, without any of the miseries, without birth or death or disease or old age or any of the miseries.

**Key Quote:** "Such illusion cannot affect a person who is engaged in pure devotional service."
**Summary:** The lecture explains how illusion affects those engrossed in temporary family affairs, contrasting this with the detachment of devotees like Yudhishthira Maharaj, who are focused on eternal spiritual happiness through devotional service, and applying this to the example of Dhritarashtra.

And even if some people take note of these problems, miseries which crop up from time to time, they do not know how to solve these miseries in such a way that we come out of the miseries entirely, that they do not know. They become engrossed in the temporary family affairs not knowing that they are losing valuable time in human form of life. So, this is called illusion. This is called illusion. More. Such illusion cannot affect a person who is engaged in pure devotional service. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj and the Pandavas they were all engaged in service of Lord Krishna. So, they had very little attraction for illusory happiness because they know what is the value of this illusory happiness. You know, it is worthless. And they also know they have to prepare for eternal life by practicing devotional service. So, they were engaged in Krishna consciousness. And therefore, they were always attracted to spiritual perfection, achieving spiritual perfection at the end of life by practicing spirituality now in the human form when we got an opportunity. So, Maharaj Yudhishthira was always fixed in the service of Lord Mukunda or Krishna. And therefore, there was no point in seeking the happiness of life as it was in the kingdom of heaven and what to speak of the happiness available on the earth because he knows all these are illusory, all these are temporal. So, therefore, happiness, being attached to family life, they do not realize that insurmountable eternal time is overtaking them and they are losing valuable time, wasting it in some material pursuits. So they don't realize this doesn't apply to Yudhishthira Maharaj, it doesn't apply to Pandavas, it doesn't apply to devotees, it applies to Dhritarashtra who was actually out of attachment for his body, for his wife, for the comforts, material comforts that

Yudhishthira was offering as a courtesy. He was lost in that and he was completely lost in neglecting spiritual life. So this verse is applicable to Dhritarashtra and Vidura had come exactly to shake up Dhritarashtra out of the ignorance and to instruct him how he can save himself before that comes. So Srila Prabhupada says that one who is factually learned, he knows that material happiness is not important, it's not worthwhile. There is something called Brahma Sukha or absolute happiness, spiritual happiness. That Brahma Sukha or spiritual happiness is eternal and it is always unconditionally experienced by those engaged in devotional service. So such devotees, they have no attraction for any material, including material happiness or material comforts. So Maharaj Yudhishthira actually was a true devotee of Yudhishthira. He was a true devotee of Yudhishthira. He was spiritual, enlightened, was spiritually alert. But Dhritarashtra was not. So it was actually for the sake of Dhritarashtra that Vidura had come to enlightened Dhritarashtra and that is why we will hear how Dhritarashtra strongly instructs Dhritarashtra to come out

**Key Quote:** "In a sense, those who are spiritually inclined and are spiritually engaged in spiritual activities, they don't require the kind of alertness that Vidura is trying to bring in by his strong words."
**Summary:** Prabhupada's purport explains the urgency of Vidura's instruction, applicable to both Dhritarashtra and Yudhishthira, but especially needed for the materialistic Dhritarashtra.

In the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains the reason why Vidura is telling Dhritarashtra, 'Get out of here immediately, do not delay.' It's urgent that he has to leave the palace, and one of the reasons he gives is because fear has overtaken you now. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport, 'Cruel death cares for no one, be he Dhritarashtra or even Maharaj Yudhishthira, therefore spiritual instruction as was given to old Dhritarashtra was equally applicable to younger Maharaj Yudhishthira.' Dhritarashtra is the uncle of Maharaj Yudhishthira, his father's brother. So Dhritarashtra is old and Yudhishthira is younger than Dhritarashtra, but this instruction which Vidura is giving is equally applicable to both Dhritarashtra and Yudhishthira. जातस्यही द्रुवाव मृत्यु द्रुवाम जन्म मृतस्यचा फर्मेकृतत्वःत देखऌ अवधिधर्यक्ति भृत देखा दिया तो धफ्त प्रतित्रणित देखा । प्रतित्र्यी केस्ट materially दोष्षल न एउदर्धर्यक्ति से अतित्राधूक्या टत्रेक्रि तौर फिर धैम न परिणा हो जातू ऋह । So, Srila Prabhupāda says, further, as a matter of fact, everyone in the royal palace, including the king and his brothers and mother, was rapidly attending the lectures that were being given by Vidura. But it was known to Vidura that his instructions were especially meant for Dhritarashtra, who was too materialistic.

**Key Quote:** "Dhritarashtra had become too materialistic, and therefore he required such a dose of, as they say, bitter medicine. He required that."
**Summary:** Dhritarashtra's materialism and disqualification from the throne due to blindness are discussed, along with his ambition to become king and hand the kingdom to his sons.

In a sense, those who are spiritually inclined and are spiritually engaged in spiritual activities, they don't require the kind of alertness that Vidura is trying to bring in by his strong words. And we shall hear how Vidura is going to speak. Dhritarashtra spoke very, very harshly, just to shake him up out of the slumber. Now, the important point here is Dhritarashtra had become too materialistic, and therefore he required such a dose of, as they say, bitter medicine. He required that. The word Rājan is especially addressed to Dhritarashtra. Why is the word Rājan applicable to Dhritarashtra, particularly? It's because Dhritarashtra was the eldest son of his father, and therefore, according to law, he was to be installed on the throne of Hastinapura. But because he was blind from birth, he was disqualified from his rightful claim. See how, in the ancient times, they were so conscious of... exercising their claim based on their qualification. Not just because, 'I am the eldest son, so I should ascend the throne, regardless of whether I am blind, I am unqualified.' No, it's never like that. So, he was disqualified because he was blind by birth. But he could not forget. Dhritarashtra could not forget the bereavement. And his disappointment was somewhat compensated after the death of his younger brother, Pandu. Pandu died untimely, when he was very young. So, Dhritarashtra was made the caretaker king, because there was no one to ascend the throne after Pandu's death, because the children were all... His younger brother left behind him some minor children, and Dhritarashtra became the natural guardian of them. But at heart, he wanted to become the factual king and hand the kingdom over to his own sons headed by Duryodhana. With all these imperial ambitions, Dhritarashtra wanted to become a king, and he contrived all sorts of intrigues in consultation with his brother-in-law. And he contrived all sorts of intrigues in consultation with his brother-in-law, Shakuni.

**Key Quote:** "So, he decided to destroy the Kuru dynasty."
**Summary:** Shakuni's anger at his sister's marriage to a blind king and his plan to destroy the Kuru dynasty are explained, highlighting his role in Dhritarashtra's intrigues against the Pandavas, which ultimately failed due to the Lord's will.

Now, Shakuni, the brother-in-law of Dhritarashtra, that is Gandhari's brother, Dhritarashtra's wife's brother, he was very angry that his sister Gandhari, the most beautiful princess of her time, she was married to a blind king. She was married to a blind king. So, Shakuni was very angry. 'Why my sister, who is so qualified, so beautiful, so chaste, so very good in all qualities, why is she being married to a blind person?' So, he decided to destroy the Kuru dynasty. To destroy the Kuru dynasty. So, this was Shakuni's agenda. And when Dhritarashtra, he contrived all sorts of intrigues, Shakuni actually became very much instrumental in trying to, in Dhritarashtra's attempt at somehow trying to destroy the Pandavas, because Shakuni's agenda was somehow the Kuru dynasty should be destroyed. But everything failed by the will of the Lord. Dhritarashtra was not successful. Shakuni was not successful.

**Key Quote:** "When the Lord protects somebody, Nobody can destroy such a devotee protected by the Lord."
**Summary:** Even after losing everything, Dhritarashtra wanted to remain king and shamelessly accepted Yudhishthira's hospitality, while Vidura aimed to awaken him from his slumber of disease and old age, detailing the physical decline associated with aging.

Everything failed by the will of the Lord. When the Lord protects somebody, nobody can destroy such a devotee protected by the Lord. And at the last stage, even after losing everything, men and men, Dhritarashtra wanted to remain as king, being the eldest uncle of Maharaja Yudhishthira. Maharaja Yudhishthira, as a matter of duty, maintained Dhritarashtra in royal honor. Dhritarashtra was not entitled to the royal honor, because Yudhishthira Maharaj had ascended the throne. And before Yudhishthira Maharaj ascended the throne, Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana had given so much trouble to Yudhishthira. So Dhritarashtra was shamelessly accepting all the hospitality Yudhishthira was offering, shamelessly. So this will be pointed out later on by Vidura. Hmm. Dhritarashtra was happily passing away his numbered days in the illusion of being a king or the royal uncle of King Yudhishthira. See, just because Yudhishthira was very, very courteous, and he was upright in his dealings, he was straightforward in his dealings, he was ideal in his behavior and character, Dhritarashtra was misusing this kind of treatment of Yudhishthira. Now Vidura as a saint and as the duty-bound affectionate youngest brother of Dhritarashtra wanted to awaken Dhritarashtra from his slumber of disease and old age. Now what is Dhritarashtra's condition? He had become old. So invalidity due to old age has set him. That will be described by Vidura later on. That means as the body ages, generally the senses become weaker and weaker and weaker, and internally the organs start failing. The digestion becomes poor. The liver doesn't function properly. The heart becomes weak. So many changes in the body, and that will be described later on. These are all changes which are natural, consequence of the aging of the body, and nobody can prevent it. It's natural for everyone to experience this.

**Key Quote:** "Everyone is the servant of eternal time."
**Summary:** The inevitability of old age and its effects are discussed, leading to Vidura's sarcastic address to Dhritarashtra as king, emphasizing that everyone is controlled by time (Kala) except pure devotees, and Vidura's mission is to help Dhritarashtra save himself.

If they live beyond a certain stage of this body. When old age sets in, if somebody is still living, then in the old age, even though they may be happy that 'I am still living,' but their body may not be in the best of conditions. So Dhritarashtra was facing the invalidity due to old age, and also the disease that accompanies sometimes the aging of the body. Vidura therefore sarcastically addressed Dhritarashtra as the king, which he actually was not. Dhritarashtra was not the king. Then why is Vidura addressing him as the king? Rajan. The word says, 'Rajan nirgam yatham shigram.' 'My dear king, please leave this place immediately.' So it was a sarcastic address. Everyone is the servant of eternal time. You see, Kala reigns supreme in this material world, because it is a representation of the Supreme Lord Paramatma. Nobody can overcome Kala except a pure devotee who transcends the material conditions, the material modes, and even Kala. Only a pure devotee can transcend Kala. But those who are not taken to devotional service, they cannot transcend Kala. So therefore, no one can be king in this material world, in the real sense of the term. Nobody is like the controller. Everyone is controlled. So therefore, this situation which Dhritarashtra was in, Vidura had come to get him out of this situation, to help him save himself. That was Vidura's mission. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "My Lord, it is the Supreme Personality of Godhead as eternal time or Kala that has approached us all."
**Summary:** The lecture begins with invocations and then introduces the verse SB 1.13.19, explaining that the frightful situation Dhritarashtra faces is due to the approach of Kala, or eternal time, representing death.

Om Ajnana Timira Andhasya Jnananjani Shalakaya Chakshur Unmilitam Jena Tasmai Shri Gurave Namaha Namah Om Vishnupadaya Krishna Preshtaya Bhutale Shri Mate Bhaktivedanta Swamin Nithinamine Namaste Saraswate Deve Gauravani Pracharine Nirvishesha Shunyavadi Pashchatya Deshatarine Jaya Shri Krishna Chaitanya Prabhu Nithyananda Shri Advaita Gadhadhara Shri Vasadi Gauravakta Vrinda Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudhirayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 19th verse of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Pratikriyana yasyeha kutashchit karhichit prabho saesha bhagavan kalaha sarveshamna samagatah. The meaning of this verse is, this frightful situation cannot be remedied by any person in this material world. My Lord, it is the Supreme Personality of Godhead as eternal time or Kala that has approached us all.

**Key Quote:** "So, death cannot be remedied by any material solution."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the verse, explaining Dhritarashtra's fear as being related to the fast-approaching death and emphasizing that there is no material solution or escape from death.

So this can be understood in connection with the previous verse in which Vidura is addressing Dhritarashtra and telling, "My dear king, immediately get out of this place, do not delay." Why? Because Dhritarashtra is overtaken by fear. Why is he afraid? What is he afraid of? So that frightful situation is due to Kala approaching Dhritarashtra to remind him of the fast approaching death, fast approaching death. So, death cannot be remedied by any material solution. There is no remedy for death in terms of working out a material escape path or a route, no. So, it is the Supreme Personality of Godhead as eternal time that has approached Dhritarashtra.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "In this material world, there is no superior power which can check the cruel hands of death."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Prabhupada, stating that no superior power can stop death, and explains that old age is a notice of death's arrival, and that death is present from birth, with life constantly reducing, and that material enjoyment is illusory.

In the purport, Prabhupada explains, there is no superior power which can check the cruel hands of death. In this material world, there is no superior power. No one wants to die however acute the source of bodily sufferings may be. Even in the days of so-called scientific advancement of knowledge, there is no remedial measure either for old age or for death. Old age is the notice of the arrival of death served by cruel time. Why old age? Because it is a notice of fast approaching death. Srila Prabhupada explains elsewhere that actually death is present along with birth. Why? Because this body, as soon as we enter into this body, the limited duration of time we inhabit to some degree, the checkout time for nailed up children will be ensuring that the life cycle is in Ruha-Rasankara. Therefore, as soon as we inhabit this body that counter starts ticking, so the countdown has begun. The day we are born our lifespan keeps on reducing, reducing, reducing, reducing, reducing, reducing, and specially in younger age we are completely forgetful of these reducing effect of kala on our lifespan. We may think that, oh maybe there is death but it is long, long time to go before I die, let me enjoy while I'm young, and that enjoyment also, as we heard yesterday in the previous session, it is illusory.

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Only intelligent spiritualists don't have attraction for this illusory and temporary material happiness."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts illusory material happiness with spiritual happiness, stating that materialists are always defeated by nature's laws, and that death is the supreme judgement of eternal time, and that the spirit soul is eternal, and that ignorance of this leads to fear of death.

And terrible, and it is not good. Temporary, illusory, and temporary. Only intelligent spiritualists don't have attraction for this illusory and temporary material happiness. The foolish materialists, they do not know of spiritual happiness, so they think the only happiness that we can really have in this world is material happiness. So they chase material happiness which is temporary, illusory, and they are always defeated in their attempt to enjoy material happiness, always defeated by the laws of material nature. So there is no remedy for old age or death, and old age means it is the notice of the arrival of death. No one can refuse to accept either someone calls a supreme judgment of eternal time when we are supposed to quit this body, that is called death. We leave this body, spirit soul which is eternal. I or you are any real person, we are eternal, but we have to leave the body, and in ignorance we think this bodily existence is all in all and we are not prepared for leaving this body. Then we suddenly shocked, why am I asked to leave this body? Where will I go? What will happen to me? How will I exist? This is the fear of death. Why people forgot as to cheated or cheated who cheated or anything in all the wrongs in this matter, watch.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Everything is not finished it's only this body which is actually deteriorating and that is going to be finished but you are going to continue to exist after death."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that death is not the end, only the body perishes, and the soul continues to exist, and that this knowledge is not available in material books, and that Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita that death is merely a change of body.

Of course, before death comes some foolish materialist may think everything is finished at death, but everything is not finished. It's only this body which is actually deteriorating and that is going to be finished, but you are going to continue to exist after death. This is a very, very, very important lesson given in our scriptures, in spiritual literature. It's not available in any material book. They do not know what is what life really is. They have no idea. So those who are writing all this material literature, they do not know spiritual creature is home, the foundational truth, understanding of the foundational truth that I am NOT this body. This body's just temporary body, it is going to deteriorate and perish, and I should prepare before death comes to quit this body and transfer myself to my eternal home, Krishna's about. So such lessons are not available in our material books. No, no material education can give you this understanding. Only in the Bhagavad Gita directly Krishna says you are not the body, your spirit soul, you as spirit soul have no death. Then what is called is death is change of body.

**Key Quote:** "There is no remedial measure available by staying in the palace while staying in the palace now there's no remedial measure like that before ordering however Vidura informed Dhritarashtra that there is no remedial measure by anyone or from any source in this material world there is no material solution for this problem of death."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Vidura is telling Dhritarashtra that there is no material solution to the problem of death, and that staying in the palace will not protect him.

This is explained before Dhritarashtra because he might ask Vidura to find out some remedial measure for the imminent fearful situation as he had ordered many times before. Whenever there was danger, Dhritarashtra was having his brother Vidura, younger brother Vidura, as his advisor, and whenever there was some difficulty or danger in a political situation, Vidura was giving very good advice to Dhritarashtra. So now again Vidura has come to the palace, and when Vidura is warning Dhritarashtra there is danger, beware, then Dhritarashtra might ask Vidura, okay you are warning me of the danger but you find a solution so that I am protected remaining here, I am protected against the danger. So Vidura is telling there is no remedial measure available by staying in the palace. While staying in the palace now there's no remedial measure like that. Before ordering however, Vidura informed Dhritarashtra that there is no remedial measure by anyone or from any source in this material world. There is no material solution for this problem of death.

**Key Quote:** "Death is identical with the Supreme Personality of Godhead as it is said by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad Gita."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that death is identical to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, quoting Krishna from the Bhagavad Gita as saying, 'I am death, and I take away all your material possessions.'

This we have to get convinced because we are always hoping somehow I will overcome some bodily problem and we've been doing it as long as there is life in this body is always some remedial measure we figure out are we somehow managed to survive but that will not work at that time due to a certain difficulty so said Dhritarashtra resented Viya thinking that something is wrong with him never dare to go to HIM at the time of death this is the important point here because there is no such thing in the material world death is identical with the Supreme Personality of Godhead as it is said by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad Gita what is Krishna saying the Bhagavad Gita? Mruthu sarva haras chaahum Mruthu I am death and as death sarva hara I take away all your material possessions I terminate your material existence in the body material existence means this body bodily existence and you are left with nothing none of your material possessions none of your material relationships none of your material assets assets, none of your material knowledge, nothing you are left with. Sarvaharascha. That's why.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Death cannot be checked by anyone or from any source within the material world."
**Summary:** The speaker gives the example of Hiranyakashipu, who wanted to become immortal through severe penance, but Brahma could not grant him immortality because Brahma himself is subject to death.

Sometimes death is called all devouring death. All devouring death. So Srila Prabhupada gives an example here. Death cannot be checked by anyone or from any source within the material world. And Prabhupada gives the example here. Hiranyakashipu wanted to be immortal and underwent a severe type of penance by which the whole universe trembled. Hiranyakashipu amassed a lot of power by performing severe austerities and asking for boons from Brahma. And Brahma himself approached Hiranyakashipu to dissuade Hiranyakashipu from such a severe type of penance. So Hiranyakashipu's plan was to become immortal. But Brahma wanted to dissuade him from this penance because it is futile to think that I will do tapasya so that I will become immortal. Material type of tapasya. Hiranyakashipu asked Brahma to award him the blessings of immortality. But Brahma said that he himself was subject to death, even in the top. So how could Brahma award Hiranyakashipu the benediction of immortality? Brahma himself is going to die. Then how can Brahma give anybody else immortality when he himself is subject to death? So the lesson to be learnt is everyone beginning from Brahma down to the most insignificant creature in this material world who has taken birth is subject to death.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Nobody can escape death. There is no question of immortality in this body or in any body, any material body. There is no immortality."
**Summary:** The speaker states that death exists even in Brahma Loka, and that the only way to overcome birth, disease, old age, and death is through spiritual realization, which is what Vidura will advise Dhritarashtra.

Subtitles by the Amara.org community. Nobody can escape death. There is no question of immortality in this body or in any body, any material body. There is no immortality. So there is death even in the topmost planet of this universe and what to speak of other planets which are far, far inferior in quality to Brahma Loka. So Brahma Loka is the place where Brahma resides. The topmost planet in this material universe. And even in Brahma Loka there is death even though they have fantastic long life span as compared to the life span of the human beings on the earth. But still Brahma lives for some 311 trillion years measured in our time scale. But even Brahma has to die. Brahma has to die. When that 311 trillion years is measured in our time scale. When that 311 trillion years is measured in our time scale. So 311 trillion years are over. So Srila Prabhupada concludes by telling wherever there is influence of eternal time there is this set of tribulations namely birth, disease, old age and death. And all of them are invincible. You cannot conquer any of these. Birth, birth means rebirth after death, rebirth. Then followed by further rebirth by a disease old age and death so this cannot be overcome by any material means any material methods so the only way is to work for spiritual realization of our spiritual nature eternal spiritual nature so that is what the scriptures advice and that's what exactly Vidura is going.

**Key Quote:** "whoever is under the influence of supreme Kala or eternal time must surrender his most dear life and what to speak of other things such as wealth, honour, children, land and home"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces verse 20 of the 13th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining that everyone is subject to the influence of time and must surrender everything at death.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we are discussing from two verses, the 20th and the 21st verses of the 13th chapter of the 1st canto of Shri Madbhagavata, one verse at a time, first the 20th verse: Yena Chaivabhipannoyam Pranai Priyatamair Api Janasadyo Viyujeta Kimutanyair Dhanadibhi. Now Vidura is explaining to Dhritarashtra, whoever is under the influence of supreme Kala or eternal time must surrender his most dear life, and what to speak of other things such as wealth, honour, children, land and home Dhanadibhi. Dhana is wealth and all the things that we think wealth can buy for us, some land, some home, some material possessions, assets, some status, material status in society, all these things, when none of these things can be protected or saved when death comes, supreme Kala. Kala means synonymous with death, that time we surrender most dear life and what to speak of other things.

**Key Quote:** "actually being ignorant of the fact that death always comes suddenly"
**Summary:** The speaker provides examples from Srila Prabhupada's teachings and historical events to illustrate the inevitability of death and the surrender of material possessions.

So Srila Prabhupada explains, a great Indian scientist busy in the plan making business was suddenly called by invincible eternal time while going to attend a very important meeting of the planning commission, and he had to surrender his life, wife, children, house, land, wealth, etc. One of the examples Srila Prabhupada is giving, we always actually witness around us that somebody, they say, suddenly died. They say suddenly died, actually being ignorant of the fact that death always comes suddenly, always comes suddenly. So somebody is very, the example being given by Srila Prabhupada, a great Indian scientist busy in plan making business, he was in the planning commission and very important meeting he was going to attend, suddenly death came and he collapsed while going for the meeting, and death means surrender his life, and along with his life he has to surrender everything connected with that body in which there was life till he was having his life span, everything he has to surrender. Another example Srila Prabhupada gives, during the political upsurge in India and his division into Pakistan and Hindustan at the time of independence, political independence India got, so many rich and influential Indians had to surrender life, property and honour due to the influence of time. When they had to die, they had to give up everything that they had accumulated, they had amassed by being so called successful in business or in becoming rich, everything they had to surrender. And there are hundreds and thousands of examples like that all over the world, all over the universe which are all effects of the influence of time.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "there is no powerful living being within the universe who can overcome the influence of time"
**Summary:** The speaker expands on the influence of time, explaining that even demigods (devatas) are subject to its power and must relinquish their positions during the partial dissolution of the universe.

It's not just the earth people, it's not just the earth planet, it's not just the human beings, there are even devatas. When the partial dissolution of the universe happens, all the devatas they have to give up their positions, they have to give up their life, they have to give up their wealth, they have to give up their power, everything they have to give up the influence of time. Therefore, the conclusion is that there is no powerful living being within the universe who can overcome the influence of time, Kala. If we are conscious of Kala, we realize that the influence of time is insurmountable, we cannot overcome the influence of time, whatever position one might be in, even in the upper planets including Brahma's position in the topmost planet. Many poets have written verses lamenting the influence of time, many devastations have taken place over the universes due to the influence of time.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "even in our daily life so many things come and go in which we have no hand but we have to suffer or tolerate them without remedial measure"
**Summary:** The speaker describes the devastation caused by the partial dissolution of the universe, where planets are submerged in water, and connects this to the influence of time (kala) in daily life.

See, when devastation takes place, everything is destroyed. Of course, when there is partial dissolution of the universe, the planets are not exactly destroyed, but there is a flood and water covers every planet in the middle and lower planetary systems. Everyone in the middle and lower planetary systems has to quit his body and the planet itself is covered by water, the water of devastation, pralaya payodhi jale. Pralaya means the dissolution or the devastation, destruction, payodhi jale, the water of the ocean. Just like we have experienced now that the oceans are contained within a certain limit, they never come beyond the high tide line on the shore, any ocean or sea, but that is only as long as this universe is maintained by the supreme lord. But when dissolution comes, the universe, of course the final dissolution, the whole universe is destroyed, but even the partial dissolution at the end of Brahma's day, there is submerging of the planets in the middle and lower planetary systems. The earth planet will be completely submerged by water and there is no one who can check this devastation when Kala brings about the devastation. Even in our daily life, so many things come and go in which we have no hand, but we have to suffer or tolerate them without remedial measure, that is the result of time, Kala, that Kala is being described by Vidura as insurmountable.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces verse 21, focusing on Vidura's message to Dhritarashtra about his precarious situation due to old age, loss of family, and dependence on others.

21st verse: pitra bhratra suhratputra hataste vigatam vayam aatmacha jarayagrastaha paragyeham upasase. What is Dhritarashtra's actual situation now that Vidura is telling him, get out of the place, why so? Some of the reasons are stated in this verse. Vidura is telling, your father, brother, well wishers and sons are all dead and passed away, you yourself have expended the major portion of your life, your body is now overtaken by invalidity and you are living in the home of another. So these are all the facts which Vidura is bringing to the notice of Dhritarashtra. So in the purport Srila Prabhupada says, the king is reminded of his precarious condition influenced by cruel time, what does Kala do?

**Key Quote:** "it unfolds our karma"
**Summary:** The speaker explains how time unfolds our karma, bringing both enjoyment and suffering, and highlights the illusory nature of material happiness.

It unfolds our karma. We are carrying a load of karma with us when we take birth and Kala will decide in this particular body during our life span which of those reactions which are not yet fructified in our heart, in our subtle body, which of those will actually give us the result. It could be either enjoyment or suffering. Of course, enjoyment, there is no real enjoyment, there is no real enjoyment, real happiness, it is illusory happiness, but even if somebody settles for illusory happiness, there is also the suffering due to the bad reactions, the sinful reactions. So all this will unfold, that is what is called as the influence of cruel time. And Dhritarashtra by his past experience, he should have been more influenced and intelligent to see what was going to happen to his own life. We think that I am not going to die, though I see everyone else around me either as already dead, either as already dead or they are going to die, but I think I am not going to die, each person thinks like that. So the warning given by Vidura is explained by Prabhupada.

**Key Quote:** "Dhritarashtra lost all his sons"
**Summary:** The speaker recounts the tragedies in Dhritarashtra's life, including the deaths of his father, brother, sons, and other relatives, emphasizing his immense loss.

That Dhritarashtra's father Vichitravirya died long ago when he and his younger brothers were all little children and it was due to the care and kindness of Bhishma Deva that they were properly brought up. Bhishma Deva was the elder brother of Vichitravirya, so Bhishma Deva took responsibility for raising these small children when their father died untimely. Then again his brother, Dhritarashtra's brother, Pandu died also, Pandu died untimely. Then in the battlefield of Kurukshetra his 100 sons and all his grandsons died. So Dhritarashtra lost all his sons, he had 100 sons, see his ill-fated destiny that not even one son survived that battle of Kurukshetra, all of them died and his grandsons also, they also died and even his other well-wishers like Bhishma Deva, Dronacharya, Karna, many other kings and friends, all of them died in the battle of Kurukshetra. It is told elsewhere that only the Pandavas were specially protected by Krishna, they survived that ghastly war, the battle of Kurukshetra, everybody else died. So Dhritarashtra lost all men and money and now he was living at the mercy of his nephew whom he had put into troubles of various types.

**Key Quote:** "the only protector is the Supreme Lord and nobody else"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Dhritarashtra's dependence on Yudhishthira, whom he and Duryodhana considered an enemy, and emphasizes that only the Supreme Lord can provide true protection.

With whom is Dhritarashtra living, with his enemy now. Yudhishthira did not consider Dhritarashtra or Duryodhana as his enemy, but Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana were always eyeing the Pandavas as their enemy, why? Because Pandavas were eligible and it was their rightful claim to the kingdom of Hastinapur and Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana had to give that kingdom to Yudhishthira when Yudhishthira grew up, became a major adult, but Dhritarashtra did not do that and Duryodhana was always plotting and planning to kill Yudhishthira and that way Duryodhana developed enmity, Dhritarashtra developed enmity towards Yudhishthira. So now where is Dhritarashtra living, in the house of his enemy. Is it a very honorable life, living in the house of the enemy is not at all honorable. Despite all these reverses, he thought that you prolong his life more and more, as long as I live let me live comfortably, that was Dhritarashtra's plan. Vidura wanted to point out to Dhritarashtra that everyone has to protect himself by his action and the grace of the Lord. There is a suitable way of protecting oneself by Krishna's mercy and your spiritual activities, only that can protect you. One has to execute his duty faithfully depending on the result, depending on the Supreme Lord for the result, result is in the hands of the Lord. No friend, no children, no father, no brother, no state and no one else can protect a person who is not protected by the Supreme Lord, so the only protector is the Supreme Lord and nobody else.

**Summary:** The speaker explains verse 22, where Vidura points out Dhritarashtra's old age and failing health as a warning of approaching death, urging him to consider his future.

This chapter is entitled Dhritarashtra Quits Home. The verse number 22 Andhapuraiva Vadhiro Mandaprajnyascha Sampratam Vishirna Danto Mandagni Saraga Kapham Udbhahan The meaning of this verse is: You have been blind from your very birth, and recently you have become hard of hearing. Your memory is shortened, and your intelligence is disturbed. Your teeth are loose, your liver is defective, and you are coughing up mucus. These are words spoken by Vidura to Dhritarashtra, and Vidura is pointing out that the symptoms of invalidity due to old age are very much prominent in the person of Dhritarashtra, which means that it is notice of death which is fast approaching. So what are you doing about Dhritarashtra facing death? So Vidura is actually alerting Dhritarashtra.

### material attachment, illusion, impermanence, shadvikara

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "This is the power of illusion in this material world."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the purport, explaining the symptoms of old age, the concept of 'Shadvikara' (six changes in the body), and how people foolishly seek permanent settlement in the material world, forgetting the impermanence of the body and material possessions.

So in the Purport, Shila Prabhupada explains the symptoms of old age which had already developed in Dhritarashtra were all, one after another, pointed out to him as warning that death was nearing very quickly, and still he was foolishly carefree about his future. The signs pointed out by Vidura in the body of Dhritarashtra were signs of Apakshaya, or dwindling of the material body before the last stroke of death. The body is born, it develops, stays, creates other organs, other bodies, dwindles, and then vanishes. This is called Shadvikara, six different changes that take place in the body from birth to death. So body is born, body is going to die, but in between four stages: body develops, then it stays for some time, produces by-products, and dwindles. So these are described in the Shadvikara. So these are described in the scriptures as Shadvikara, six changes that happen in the body, irrespective of whether it is the body of a small insignificant creature, or the body of a human being, or the body of an animal or a bird, or a demigod, these six changes take place. But foolish men want to make a permanent settlement of the perishable body and think that their estate, their children, their society, country, etc., will give them protection. With such foolish ideas, they become overtaken by such temporary engagements and forget altogether that they must give up this temporary body and take a new one, again to arrange for another term of society, friendship, and love, again to perish ultimately.

**Key Quote:** "We are spirit soul, we belong to Krishna, we have eternal life."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the deep-rooted desire for material enjoyment, the illusion of finding lasting happiness in the material world, and the tendency to forget our true, eternal identity as spirit souls belonging to Krishna, contrasting genuine sadhus with those who offer sense gratification.

This is the power of illusion in this material world, because we have got a deep-rooted desire for material enjoyment. We have hope that we can make it in this material world by some adjustment, some arrangement, some wealth, some friendship, some so-called love of near and dear ones, but actually none of these can really save us ultimately from death. Everything is taken away, everything material is taken away from us at the time of death. They forget their permanent identity. What is our permanent identity? We are spirit soul. We belong to Krishna. We have eternal life. We belong to Krishna. We have eternal relationship of love with Krishna. That we forget and become foolishly active for impermanent occupations, forgetting altogether their prime duty. Therefore, saints and sages like Vidura approach such foolish men to awaken them to their real situation, but they take such sadhus and saints as parasites of society, and almost all of them refuse to hear the words of such sadhus and saints, although they welcome show bottle sadhus and so-called saints who can satisfy their senses.

**Key Quote:** "A genuine sadhu will never promise any sense gratification in exchange for some spiritual life."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why people are cheated by bogus sadhus who offer sense gratification, emphasizing that a genuine sadhu will never promise material benefits for spiritual advancement, and that Vidura is correctly pointing out the real situation of life.

Sometimes we ask, why do people get cheated by bogus sadhus? Because these bogus sadhus know how to cheat people by satisfying their senses. The same business is going on even otherwise without any saintly person, so-called saintly person, trying to satisfy their senses. People are simply busy with material enjoyment, and for the sake of material enjoyment, they are seeking satisfaction of their senses. So these show bottle sadhus who somehow give some license for sense gratification in the name of so-called religious practices, a genuine sadhu will never promise any sense gratification in exchange for some spiritual life, never. Vidura was not a sadhu to satisfy the ill-gotten sentiment of Dhritarashtra. He is correctly pointing out the real situation of life and how one can save oneself from such catastrophes.

**Key Quote:** "A sadhu is to speak to the householders about the naked truth of life so that they may come to their senses about the precarious life in material existence."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces verse 23, where Vidura uses strong words to shake Dhritarashtra out of his illusion, comparing him to a household dog dependent on Bhima, and explains that a sadhu should speak the truth about the precariousness of material life.

The 23rd verse: Aho mahiyasi jantor Jivitasha Yatha bhavan Bhima pavarjitam Pindam adatte Grihapalavat. These are very strong words spoken by Vidura to shake up Dhritarashtra out of his illusory situation. The meaning of this 23rd verse is: Alas, how powerful are the hopes of a living being to continue his life. Verily, you are living just like a household dog and are eating remnants of food given by Bhima. These are very strong words spoken by Vidura. So the purport, Shila Prabhupada explains, why is Vidura speaking so harshly? Prabhupada says, a sadhu should never flatter kings or rich men to live comfortably at their cost. A sadhu is to speak to the householders about the naked truth of life so that they may come to their senses about the precarious life in material existence.

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Yudhishthira is actually a pure devotee, so such pure devotees, they depend on Krishna under all circumstances."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Dhritarashtra as an attached old man, explains why Bhima is specifically mentioned, recounting Bhima's anger at the Kauravas' cheating and mistreatment of Draupadi and the Pandavas, and highlighting Yudhishthira's righteous conduct and dependence on Krishna.

This is a genuine sadhu. Dhritarashtra is a typical example of an attached old man in household life. He had become a pauper in the true sense, yet he wanted to live comfortably in the house of the Pandavas, of whom Bhima especially is mentioned here. Why is Bhima mentioned especially among the five Pandavas? Because personally it was Bhima who killed two prominent sons of Dhritarashtra, namely Duryodhana and Dushyasana. These two sons were very much dear to Dhritarashtra for their notorious and nefarious activities. Bhima is particularly pointed out because he killed these two pet sons. Actually, Bhima killed not only these two pet sons, Bhima killed each of the 100 sons of Dhritarashtra. Bhima was angry because Ghervravas took undue advantage of Yudhishthira's righteous, upright behavior even in trying circumstances in gambling match which was rigged, and the Pandavas were cheated. Just because Yudhishthira agreed to follow the rules of the game, even though he was cheated, Duryodhana and Dushasana took undue advantage of Yudhishthira's good conduct, righteous conduct, and simply insulted Draupadi, made Pandavas slaves, and practically insulted all of them, so Bhima was very angry at this particular time, but he restrained himself because Yudhishthira did not want any of the Pandavas to protest.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This sense of continuing one's life indicates that a living being is eternally a living entity and does not want to change his bodily habitation."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotees accept suffering as Krishna's will, maintaining their righteousness, and recounts how Krishna protected the Pandavas and ensured their victory, emphasizing Dhritarashtra's desire to live comfortably despite humiliation and the eternal nature of the living being.

Now Yudhishthira is actually a pure devotee, so such pure devotees, they depend on Krishna under all circumstances. If it is the Lord's will that we have to undergo suffering, we will suffer, but we will never give up our righteous conduct in order to avoid some suffering, no. The Lord has got his own higher reason why he wants devotees to suffer in certain circumstances. There is a higher plan, and devotees have this full faith in the Supreme Lord, and as it turns out, that in the battle of Kurukshetra, against all odds the Pandavas were protected by Krishna and the Kauravas were completely destroyed in that battle because it is Krishna's will that the Pandavas must win this battle and Yudhishthira must be enthroned as the emperor of the world against all odds. So therefore it is specifically mentioned here that Bhima who was angry at the Kauravas, he got an opportunity to properly fight in this battle and personally kill each of the 100 sons of Dhritarashtra. Why was Dhritarashtra living there at the house of the Pandavas? Because he wanted to continue his life comfortably even at the risk of all humiliation. Vidura therefore was astonished how powerful is the urge to continue life. This sense of continuing one's life indicates that a living being is eternally a living entity and does not want to change his bodily habitation. The foolish man does not know that a particular term of imprisonment, a particular term of bodily existence is awarded to him to undergo a total term of imprisonment, and the human body is awarded after many many births and deaths as a chance for self-realization to go back home, back to Godhead, but persons like Dhritarashtra try to make plans to live here in this material world comfortably. They do not see things as they are. Dhritarashtra is blind and continues to hope to live comfortably in the midst of all kinds of reverses of life, but as

**Key Quote:** "Vidura is pointing out to Dhritarashtra how Dhritarashtra had done so much of atrocities, committed so many atrocities against the Pandavas and now living in their house is a degraded life."
**Summary:** Vidura criticizes Dhritarashtra for his past actions against the Pandavas and his current degraded state of living off their charity.

In this session, we will be discussing two verses, the 24th and the 25th verse of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 24th verse: Agnir Nisrishto Dattascha Garodarascha Dushitaha Hritham Kshetram Dhanam Yesham Tad Dattair Asubhi Kiyat. The meaning of this verse is, "There is no need to live a degraded life and subsist on the charity of the Lord. There is no need to live a degraded life and subsist on the charity of those whom you tried to kill by arson and poisoning. You also insulted one of their wives and usurped their kingdom and wealth." Vidura is pointing out to Dhritarashtra how Dhritarashtra had done so much of atrocities, committed so many atrocities against the Pandavas, and is now living in their house, a degraded life.

**Key Quote:** "To stick to family life to the end of one's human life is the grossest type of degradation and there is an absolute need for the Viduras to educate such Dhritarashtras even at the present moment."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's purport emphasizes the importance of self-realization in human life and criticizes those who remain attached to material life until death, drawing a parallel to Dhritarashtra's situation.

This is a degraded life for Dhritarashtra. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains some very important points. The system of Varnashrama religion sets aside a part of one's life completely for the purpose of self-realization and attainment of salvation in the human form of life. This is how human life is. Human life is distinguished from animal life in that there is a special provision that you can set aside a part of your life exclusively for self-realization, which is the main goal of the human form of life and which is only possible in the human form of life. That is a routine division of life. But persons like Dhritarashtra, even at their very ripened age, want to stay home, even in a degraded condition of accepting charity from enemies. Vidura wanted to point this out and impressed upon him that it was better to die like his sons than accept such humiliating charity. It was not a dignified way that Dhritarashtra was living in the house of the Pandavas. So Vidura is pointing out, "If you have any consideration for living a dignified way, you should immediately leave this place. This is not a suitable place for you." Five thousand years ago there was one Dhritarashtra, but at the present moment there are Dhritarashtras in every home. People's life has become very degraded in this present time because they live in spite of all kinds of difficulties and dangers. They don't

make any preparation for facing death like a proper human being. So that's why Prabhupada says now it's not just one rare Dhritarashtra who is living a degraded condition of life. There are many, many, many such people living a very degraded condition of life, and Prabhupada specially mentions here politicians especially do not retire from political activities unless they're dragged by the cruel hand of death or killed by some opposing element. We see this all around us. This is the reality. To stick to family life to the end of one's human life is the grossest type of degradation, and there is an absolute need for the Viduras to educate such Dhritarashtras even at the present moment. So don't take this episode as some historical incident which is not relevant now.

Somebody may think that I will make some adjustment and somehow live, but nature does not allow you to live in the same way you have been living. Your body deteriorates and it will give you more and more trouble as the body ages. It will only deteriorate further.

**Key Quote:** "Human life is meant for finishing all kinds of miseries of material existence."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concepts of Kripana (miserly man) and Brahmana, contrasting their understanding of the material body and the purpose of human life, emphasizing the importance of preparing for death and ending material suffering.

That's the law of nature. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says the words Kripanasya Jiji Vishoho are significant, two words, Kripana and Jiji Vishoho. So Prabhupada explains there are two classes of men, this is described in the scriptures, in the Upanishads. This is described. That are the... One is called Kripana and the other is called Brahmana. The Kripana, or miserly man, has no estimation of his material body, but the Brahmana has a true estimation of himself and material body. So Kripana and Brahmana. Kripana does not know the value of this human form of body. The Brahmana knows the value. The Kripana, having a wrong estimation of his material body, wants to enjoy sense gratification with his utmost strength. And even in old age, he wants to become a young man by medical treatment or otherwise. We see this all around us, that old people somehow want to maintain themselves for sense gratification, living a life of sense gratification. But that's not possible. That's really not possible. Dhritarashtra is addressed herein as a Kripana because without any estimation of his material body, he wants to live at any cost, somehow live a life of sense gratification. Vidura is trying to open his eyes to see that he cannot live more than his term and that he must prepare for death. The symptoms are indicative of fast approaching death and Dhritarashtra must prepare to face death like a human being and not miss the opportunity like an animal. Since death is inevitable,

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts spiritual and material assets, highlighting the eternal nature of spiritual assets and the futility of wasting human energy on sense gratification.

why should he accept such a humiliating position for living? It is better to take the right path even at the risk of death. Human life is meant for finishing all kinds of miseries of material existence. It's only in the human form of life that this is possible. It's not possible in animal form of life, bird form of life, reptile form of life. The form of life is not possible. The form of life of lower creatures, this elevated consciousness does not exist. There is consciousness in every form of life, but that consciousness is mainly simply used for eating, sleeping, mating, defending, just maintaining the body as far as possible, subsisting in this material existence. But human life, we have got developed consciousness. For what? To realize that I can prepare for death to put an end to all kinds of miseries of material existence. Life should be so regulated that one can achieve the desired goal of going back home, back to Godhead. Dhritarashtra, due to his wrong conception of life, had already spoiled 80% of his achieved energy. So it behooved him to utilize the remaining days of his miserly life for the ultimate good. Such a life is called miserly because one cannot properly utilize the assets of the human form of life. One who does not know the value of this body will waste this human energy simply for sense gratification. And at the end, left with nothing, which is like an asset which one can utilize in the future, can carry forward to the next life. So only spiritual assets are eternally with us. We can carry forward and utilize it always. Material assets are not going to remain with us. They will be completely lost at the time of death.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that meeting a self-realized soul like Vidura can help one overcome nescience (ignorance) and prepare for death through spiritual culture.

Only by good luck does such a miserly life, miserly man, meet a self-realized soul like Vidura. And by his instruction, by Vidura's instruction, Dhritarashtra can get rid of the nescience of material existence. What is nescience? Nescience means the ignorance, the darkness in which one is living. Material existence means there is this ignorance about who am I? What is my actual goal of life? How to solve all the problems of material existence once and for all? Make a permanent solution for these problems, not some temporary patchwork solutions. No. So that is possible by meeting a self-realized soul like Vidura and taking instructions from him how to actually prepare oneself, especially towards the end of one's life, how to prepare for facing death by spiritual culture, by spiritual practice, by spiritual enlightenment.

**Key Quote:** "He is called undisturbed, Dheera, who goes to an unknown remote place and freed from all obligations quits his material body when it has become useless."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 26th verse of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining its meaning about leaving the body in a remote place when it becomes useless, and Vidura's advice to Dhritarashtra.

In this session we will be discussing from two verses, the 26th and the 27th verses of the Shri Advaitha Gadadhara Shri Vasadi Gauravakta Vrinda of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. The 26th verse: Gata Swartham Imam Deham Virakto Mukta Bandhanaha Avignyata Gatir Jahyat Savay Dheera Udah Hruthaha. So far Vidura has been describing the condition of the Trashtra, which is a miserable condition, a degraded life he is leading, not preparing himself for death. Now he is giving a practical solution: what should the Trashtra do? He has already told him, quit home, leave home immediately and do what? That is going to come in the next few verses. So this 26th verse, the meaning is, he is called undisturbed, undisturbed means Dheera, who goes to an unknown remote place and freed from all obligations quits his material body when it has become useless. So what is the meaning of this, going to a remote unknown place and quitting the material body when one has, when the body has become useless?

**Key Quote:** "One who has spoiled his life without such cultural activities is advised to leave home without knowledge of friends and relatives, and being thus freed from all obligations of family, society, country, etc., give up the body at some unknown destination."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport on the verse, emphasizing the importance of devotional service in human life and the recommendation for those who haven't engaged in it to leave home and give up the body in an unknown place.

That is explained by Srila Prabhupada in the purport. Narottam Das Thakur, a great devotee and acharya of the Gaudiya Vaishnava sect, has sung, Narottam Das Thakur, my lord, I have simply wasted my life, having obtained the human body I have neglected to worship your lordship and therefore I have willingly drunk poison. This is a part of a song written by Srila Narottam Das Thakur, one of the previous acharyas. So Srila Prabhupada explains, in other words, the human body is especially meant for cultivating knowledge of devotion and service to the Lord, without which life becomes full of anxieties and miserable conditions. Therefore, one who has spoiled his life without such cultural activities is advised to leave home without knowledge of friends and relatives and being thus freed from all obligations of family, society, country, etc., give up the body at some unknown destination so that others may not know where and how he has met his destiny, where and how he has met his death. This is the recommendation for somebody who has not taken up devotional service to fully engage in devotional service at the time of old age. Before death comes is the best remedy for facing death and achieving perfection of the human form of life. But if somebody, let us say, is in the middle of death, has not practiced, not prepared that way then better to quit home without knowledge of friends and relatives in such a way that one may give up the body in some unknown place.

**Key Quote:** "Quit home is possible only for a dhira. Dhira means undisturbed. This is however the path of renunciation based on a frustrated life is for those who are unable to take to devotional service and are experiencing the miserable conditions especially in old age."
**Summary:** The speaker continues explaining Prabhupada's purport, defining 'dhira' as one who is undisturbed and can give up family life, and clarifying that this path of renunciation is for those frustrated with material life and unable to take up devotional service.

And without the knowledge of anyone else. So Srila Prabhupada further explains, dhira means one who is not disturbed even when there is sufficient provocation. One cannot give up a comfortable family life due to his affectionate relationship with wife and children. Self-realization is obstructed by such undue affection for family and if anyone is at all able to forget such a relation he is called undisturbed or dhira. To be able to forget that bond of affection for family members and thereby quit home is possible only for a dhira. Dhira means undisturbed. This is however the path of renunciation based on a frustrated life is for those who are unable to take to devotional service and are experiencing the miserable conditions especially in old age.

**Key Quote:** "But stabilization of such renunciation is possible only by association with bona fide saints and self-realized souls by which one can be engaged in the loving devotional service of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that renunciation alone is not enough; association with devotees and engaging in devotional service under proper guidance are crucial for stabilization and liberation, highlighting Dhritarashtra's fortune in having Vidura's association.

But Srila Prabhupada says this is a recommendation of accepting the path of renunciation based on frustrated life. But stabilization of such renunciation is possible only by association with bona fide saints and self-realized souls by which one can be engaged in the loving devotional service of the Lord. So what is Prabhupada saying here? That you may accept the path of renunciation giving up the miserable condition of material existence based on experiencing frustration living such a miserable life. But you cannot become stable and fixed up in that renounced life. Simply by going away from home and remaining undisturbed. No. You have to positively engage in pure devotional service under the guidance of pure devotees like Vidura. Sincere surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is possible by awakening the transcendental sense of service. This is called awakening of the divine sense of service. This is made possible by association with pure devotees of the Lord. Sadhu Sangha. Dhritarashtra was lucky enough to have a brother whose very association was a source of liberation for his frustrated life. So Dhritarashtra was very very fortunate because Vidura specially came to the palace of Hastinapura to deliver Dhritarashtra.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 27th verse, explaining that the best course of action is to understand the falsity of material existence through enlightenment from devotees and depend fully on Krishna within the heart when renouncing the world.

In the twenty-seventh verse further instructions are being given by Vidura to Dhritarashtra.

So he is our top most well wisher. He is our best guide. He is most dependable. He is always ready to enlighten us, to guide us, to protect us, to give us strength. So leave home depending. So, Srila Pravapada says the idea is that the renounced order of life after a frustrated life of sentiment in the material world may be the stepping stone on the path of self-realization. But real perfection of the path of liberation is attained when one is practiced to depend fully on the personality of Godhead who lives in everyone's heart, as Paramatma so it is necessary for everyone regardless of how they plan to quit household life and enter spiritual life regardless of that everyone should prepare themselves to depend fully on Krishna within the heart by learning this from an expert devotee learning this from an expert devotee so Srila Prabhupada says one may live in the darkest jungle alone out of home but a steadfast devotee knows very well that he is never alone how can one understand I'm never alone because the Supreme Personality of God it is with him and he can protect his sincere devotee in any awkward circumstance this who's living in your heart the Paramatma the Supreme Lord Krishna he is supremely powerful he is a supreme controller so he can arrange for you a devotee he can arrange for his devotee anything the devotee wants especially even the devotee's craving for self-realization Krishna can make all

**Summary:** The speaker provides practical instructions on how to prepare for depending on Krishna by associating with devotees, chanting, and hearing about Krishna, emphasizing that seeking material benefits hinders true God consciousness.

One should therefore practice devotions service at home hearing and chanting the holy name quality form pass times entourage etc in association with pure devotees and this practice will help anyone fromude to purification of feelings or emotions of pureness and the same with one's Emergencies but also with with several other qualities He also stands there for this conversation but everything in all ournsinnas have different Representatives and so these can be a work of meditation everything as well only for those people who are conscious one awaken God consciousness in proportion to one's sensitive purpose. So Prabhupada is giving us directions. If at all you want to be able to fully depend on Krishna towards the end of your life, then prepare, begin preparation for it now by associating with devotees and practicing chanting, hearing about Krishna's holy name, Krishna's qualities, Krishna's pastimes described in the Bhagavatam, etc. Prepare yourself by this practice and then Krishna will actually guide you, help you, Krishna will purify you and you can actually seriously take up Krishna consciousness in this way. One who desires material benefit by such devotional activities can never depend on God consciousness. one who desires material benefits by electing Kristina's material benefits will depend on the Supreme Personality of Godhead although the Supreme Lord is seated in everyone's heart as Paramarckim. So to actually depend on Krishna means never to accept any material benefits from devotional service. The materialistic devotees, who are materialistic devotees, they want the material benefit by doing a devotional service.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the context of the verse, focusing on Vidura's instruction to Dhritarashtra to leave for the north due to the approaching age of Kali and its deteriorating effects on human qualities.

We are discussing Dhritarashtra quitting home on the instruction of Vidura. Vidura has come to the palace of Yudhishthira in order to instruct Dhritarashtra. So Vidura is speaking to Dhritarashtra. This 28th verse also is spoken by Vidura to Dhritarashtra, continuing his instructions: Atho Deechim Disham Yathu Svair Adnyata Gathir Bhavan Itorvak Prayashak Kalah Pumsam Gunavikar Shanah. The meaning of this 28th verse is as follows: Please therefore leave for the north immediately. Please therefore leave for the north immediately, without letting your relatives know, for soon that time will approach which will diminish the good qualities of men.

So Srila Prabhupada explains all these terms. What is the meaning of 'leave for the north,' and what is the time being referred to here? So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "One can compensate for a life of frustration by becoming a Dheera, or leaving home for good without communicating with relatives." And Vidura advised his eldest brother to adopt this way without delay because very quickly the age of Kali was approaching. The age referred to here is the age of Kali, which is fast approaching. Dwapar Yuga is going to come to an end, and Kali Yuga is going to begin. And what is the characteristic of the age of Kali? And that is told in the verse. The verse, it said, Pumsam Gunavikar Shanah, that which will diminish the good qualities of men, that which will deteriorate the good qualities of people in general.

**Summary:** The speaker continues to discuss the degradation caused by material association in all Yugas, with Kali Yuga representing the lowest point, and Dhritarashtra's need to leave home before its full influence sets in.

So Srila Prabhupada says regarding this age of Kali fast approaching, Srila Prabhupada says, "A conditioned soul is already degraded by the material association, whether Satya Yuga or Dwapar Yuga, or Treta Yuga or Kali Yuga, all Yugas. This material association is already degrading our consciousness by the power of illusion, the power of the three Gunas. And still in the Kali Yuga, the good qualities of a man will deteriorate to the lowest standard. Satya Yuga was the best age, and then little degradation when Treta Yuga set in, and even more little degradation when Dwapar Yuga set in, but Kali Yuga is the lowest. The maximum deterioration happens in Kali Yuga." Dhritarashtra was advised to leave home before Kali Yuga approached because the atmosphere which is created by Vidura, his valuable instructions on the facts of life, would fade away due to the influence of the age which was fast approaching.

**Key Quote:** "Human life is simply meant for self realization, but due to this dangerous age, men have completely forgotten the aim of life."
**Summary:** The speaker describes symptoms of Kali Yuga, including the forgetting of self-realization as the aim of life and the prevalence of unrestricted sense gratification.

Some symptoms of Kali Yuga are mentioned by Srila Prabhupada in another purport, in the beginning of the Bhagavatam, first canto, first chapter. Srila Prabhupada says about the age of Kali, "The age of Kali is very dangerous for the human being. Human life is simply meant for self realization, but due to this dangerous age, men have completely forgotten the aim of life." It's characteristic of Kali Yuga. We see everywhere around us, people do not know what is the aim of life. Most people lead a life without any particular aim. Of course, there is always a default aim, that is sense enjoyment, sense gratification. That's common for all living beings throughout the creation, at all times, in all places, in all circumstances. That's common, sense enjoyment. But in Kali Yuga, even this sense enjoyment, they are not cautious to exercise certain restrained. Unrestricted sense gratification is the norm in Kali Yuga.

**Key Quote:** "In this age of Kali, the life span will gradually decrease, people will gradually lose their memory, they will lose their finer sentiments, they will lose their strength, and they will lose their better qualities."
**Summary:** The speaker details the negative consequences of Kali Yuga, such as decreased lifespan, loss of memory and finer sentiments, and the complete absorption in sense gratification, leading to the neglect of self-realization.

So it is been explained in the scriptures, in this age of Kali, the life span will gradually decrease, people will gradually lose their memory, they will lose their finer sentiments, they will lose their strength, and they will lose their better qualities. A list of the anomalies of this age is given in the 12th canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam. And so this age is very difficult for those who want to utilize this life for self-realization. The scriptures say there is only one aim of the human form of life, that is self-realization. But in general, people in the material world are inclined to sense gratification, and they don't take the aim of life as self-realization very seriously, especially in the age of Kali. They almost completely forget that the aim of life is self-realization. So people are so busy with sense gratification that they completely forget about self-realization. Out of madness, they frankly say there is no need for self-realization because they do not realize that this brief life is but a moment on our great journey towards self-realization.

**Key Quote:** "The whole system of education in Kali Yuga is geared to sense gratification."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the current education system, focused on sense gratification, with the traditional gurukula system, which emphasized self-realization and livelihood training.

Generally self-realization takes many lifetimes. So as we progress in self-realization life after life, life after life, life after life, then each duration of life, life in a particular body, is a brief moment, that's all. Made little progress, some more progress, some more progress, like that. The whole system of education in Kali Yuga is geared to sense gratification. And if a learned man thinks it over, he sees that the children of this age are being intentionally sent to the slaughterhouses of so-called education. This is not the case in the former ages. Children were educated in a gurukula, and in the gurukula, the primary education that was given was that this human form of life is very precious. It should be utilized only for self-realization. And of course there was also the teaching of how to earn one's livelihood by different prescribed methods. The brahmanas, the kshatriyas, the vaishyas, they used to undergo training in the gurukula. So they were trained in the prime necessity of human life, that is self-realization, and they were also trained in how to earn their livelihood. Both training was given. But in this age of Kali, there is no training about self-realization at all. Even in the so-called schools and educational institutions, it's almost completely forgotten.

**Summary:** The speaker advises caution in Kali Yuga and suggests following the guidance of saintly persons and scriptures like Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam to cross the ocean of material existence.

Learned men therefore must be cautious of this age, and if they at all want to cross over the dangerous ocean of Kali, they must follow the footsteps of great saintly persons like the sages Naimisharanya. And they should accept, like the sages Naimisharanya accepted Suta Goswami, they should accept Suta Goswami or his bona fide representative as the captain of the ship. What is a ship? Like in an ocean, to cross an ocean you take help of a ship. Similarly, the ship for crossing the ocean of Kali is described here as the message of Lord Sri Krishna in the shape of Bhagavad Gita, Shreemad Bhagavatam. So the Bhagavatam suggests that hear the message of Krishna in the Shreemad Bhagavatam or the Bhagavad Gita, and thereby prepare oneself to cross this ocean of material existence or the ocean of the age of Kali.

**Key Quote:** "A person who is completely relieved of all taints of sinful acts can alone depend on the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Vidura's instruction to Dhritarashtra is tailored to his situation, highlighting the difficulty of becoming a Narottama (first-class devotee) for ordinary people due to sinful acts, referencing Bhagavad Gita 7.28.

Now Srila Prabhupada explains that Vidura is giving specific instruction to Dhritarashtra considering Dhritarashtra's current position. What is his situation? So Srila Prabhupada explains, "The best is to become a Narottama, or a first class human being, depending completely on the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna." Now this is not possible for any ordinary man to become a Narottama, or a first class human being. A first class personality is not possible for a human being in which one completely depends on the Supreme Lord. Such a situation is not possible for an ordinary human being. Why is it not possible for an ordinary human being? It is stated in the Bhagavad Gita in the 7th chapter and 28th verse that a person who is completely relieved of all taints of sinful acts can alone depend on the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna, the personality of Godhead: Ye shantu antagatam papam Jananam punyakarmanam Tedvam dhamoha nirmukta Bhajan temam dhridam vrataham.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Dhritarashtra is advised by Vibhira to at least become a Dheera."
**Summary:** The speaker outlines three stages of spiritual advancement - Dheera, Sanyasi, and Narottama - and emphasizes that becoming a Dheera (one who is detached) is the minimum requirement for preparing for death and self-realization, concluding with a summary of Vidura's advice to Dhritarashtra.

This is not possible for ordinary people. Dhritarashtra is advised by Vibhira to at least become a Dheera. Three stages: Dheera, a Sanyasi, and Narottama. So Dheera is the lowest, the least one can do to prepare oneself for death, for Self Realization. So Dhritarashtra advised Vibhira at least to become a Dheera in the beginning, if it were impossible for him to become a Sanyasi or a Narottama. Lowest is Dheera, better than that is Sanyasi, better than that, best is Narottama. Persistently endeavoring on the line of Self Realization helps a person to rise to the conditions of a Narottama from the stage of a Dheera. Gradually rise to the top most platform. The Dheera stage is attained after prolonged practice of the Yoga system, but by the grace of Vidura, one can attain this stage immediately simply by willing to adopt the means of the Dheera stage, which is the preparatory stage for Sanyas. The Sanyas stage is the preparatory stage of Paramahamsa, or the first great devotee of the Lord, also called Narottama. So this is the advice of Vidura for Dhritarashtra. Consider Dhritarashtra's situation. He was completely entangled. So to pull him out, extricate him from the entanglement, at least leave home and go to a secluded place and prepare yourself by being undisturbed. So that is the advice Vidura is giving to Dhritarashtra. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

### association with devotees, sadhu, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, perfection

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Sadhu Sangha Sadhu Sangha Sarva Shastra Koi. Lava Matra Sadhu Sanghe Sarva Siddhi Hoi."
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the importance of associating with pure devotees (sadhus), quoting Chaitanya Mahaprabhu on how even a moment's association can lead to perfection.

In these words, Anuja means the younger brother. So the strong words of Vidura had a very nice impact on the heart of Dhritarashtra. He was able to cut off all the strong familial ties and he became determined. He immediately left home. Vidura was not delivered. collect вжеi ki Bopamanna Varasi Tal. Immediately left home. And that is the wonderful effect of the association of a pure devotee Vidura. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the great preacher of the principles of Srimad Bhagavatam, has stressed the importance of association with sadhus or pure devotees of the Lord. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita. Sadhu means a pure devotee, not one with a long beard or one with a particular type of tilak or talak, or one with a particular type of robes. No, this is not sadhu. Sadhu means a pure devotee. So, sadhu is bhajate mam ananyabhak, one who is engaged in pure devotional service without even a little deviation. So, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has said that even a moment's association with a pure devotee can help one achieve all perfection. What is the verse Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says? Sadhu Sangha Sadhu Sangha Sarva Shastra Koi. Lava Matra Sadhu Sanghe Sarva Siddhi Hoi. The meaning of this verse in the Chaitanya Charitamrita, this is said by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu: The verdict of all revealed scriptures is that, by even a moment's association with a pure devotee, one can achieve all perfection. The verdict of all revealed scriptures is that, by even a moment's association with a pure devotee, one can achieve all perfection. Lava Matra. Lava is just one moment. Actually, Shri Lapa Prabhupada says, this Lava Matra Sadhu Sangha, a brief moment. What is the duration of that brief moment? According to astronomical calculation, Lava means one eleventh of a second. Lava means one eleventh of a second. It is less than one second. It is one eleventh of a second. So, so little association is very, very valuable. So, so little association is very, very valuable.

**Key Quote:** "Without seeing him at that opportune moment, he said, we could have become a very great business magnate, but never would we have been able to walk the path of liberation and be engaged in the factual service of the Lord"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the value of association with devotees, referencing another verse from Bhagavatam and Srila Prabhupada's experience with his spiritual master, highlighting the transformative power of such association.

There is one more verse in the Bhagavatam. It is said... tulayama lave naapi na svaryam na punar bhavam... tulayama lave naapi na svaryam na punar bhavam... Bhagavat Sanghi Sanghasya... Bhagavat Sanghi Sanghasya... martyanaam kim utashishah... lava also the same duration of time is being used. The meaning of this Bhagavatam verse is: the value of a moment's association with a devotee of the Lord cannot be compared even to the attainment of heavenly planets or liberation from matter, and what to speak of worldly benedictions in the form of material prosperity which is for those who are meant for death. So it's very, very, very, very valuable to have even a brief association with a pure devotee of the supreme law, that is the teaching of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. So Srila Prabhupada says about his own life in this purport, he says, we are not ashamed to admit this fact, that we experienced this particular teaching of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in our practical life. Srila Prabhupada experienced this. Were we not favoured by His Divine Grace, Sri Madbhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaj, by our first meeting for a few minutes only, it would not have been possible for us to accept this mighty task of describing Sri Madbhagavatam in English. Srila Prabhupada, while writing this purport, in the first canto, he is recollecting his first meeting with his spiritual master, Sri Srimadbhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaj. Without seeing him at that opportune moment, he said, we could have become a very great business magnate, but never would we have been able to walk the path of liberation and be engaged in the factual service of the Lord under the instructions of His Divine Grace, Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur. So that meeting was a turning point in the life of Srila Prabhupada. Completely everything changed.

### Vidura, Dhritarashtra, detachment, sadhu, motivation

**Key Quote:** "He just spoke some words, but those words pierced the heart of Dhritarashtra and made such an impact that Dhritarashtra was able to cut off all material attachments and immediately leave home and proceed towards the north for self-realization."
**Summary:** The speaker returns to the example of Vidura and Dhritarashtra, emphasizing how a sadhu's words can sever material attachments and lead to self-realization, and that a sadhu's motivation is to enlighten others.

Though, we should not disregard the fact that Srila Prabhupada was born to a pure devotee. His father was a pure devotee, Gaur Mohan Dey. He was a pure devotee. And Prabhupada was trained in devotional service right from his infancy by his father. That is explained in Prabhupada's biography. But nevertheless, what is the example? Here is another practical example by the action of Vidura's association with Dhritarashtra. What is the effect of Vidura coming to the palace and instructing Dhritarashtra? He just spoke some words, but those words pierced the heart of Dhritarashtra and made such an impact that Dhritarashtra was able to cut off all material attachments and immediately leave home and proceed towards the north for self-realization. So, it is also told that a sadhu's words are meant for cutting off the material bonds of attachment. And it is also told in the Shastra that a sadhu should not flatter. How sadhu? A sadhu should not flatter householders or people who are attached simply for the sake of getting some dakshina or some viksha. No. For maintaining himself, a sadhu is fully dependent on Krishna and he is confident that Krishna will protect him under all circumstances and provide him with the basic needs. So, why does a sadhu go begging? It is an excuse to enter a householder's garden in order to enlighten the householder, like Vidura is doing.

### Dhritarashtra, material attachment, failure, self-realization, sadhu

**Key Quote:** "And yet, despite his life of failure, materially speaking, it was a life of failure, he achieved the greatest of all success in self-realization by the forceful instructions of a pure devotee of the Lord, who is the typical emblem of a sadhu."
**Summary:** The speaker details Dhritarashtra's life of material ambition and ultimate failure, contrasting it with his success in self-realization through Vidura's guidance.

So, Dhritarashtra was tightly bound in a network of material affinities related to politics, economy and family attachment. And Dhritarashtra, he did everything in his power to achieve so-called success in his planned projects, because he could not lay a claim for ascending the throne, even though he was the eldest son of his father. He could not ascend the throne because he was blind by birth. But, he had the desire and when his younger brother Pandu, after ascending the throne, died untimely, immediately Dhritarashtra got the opportunity to sit on the throne, at least as a caretaker king. Nobody else was there. So, he was the caretaker king. Then, he started planning how I can retain this throne for myself and my eldest son, Duryodhana. So, he made so many plans. But, he was frustrated from the beginning to the end, so far as his material activities were concerned. He could not continue. But, when he was still on the throne, he lost the post of the emperor when, in the battle of Kurukshetra, all his sons were defeated and killed in the battle. And he himself completely lost everything. All his well-wishers and his position and his sons and his wealth, everything he lost. And yet, despite his life of failure, materially speaking, it was a life of failure, he achieved the greatest of all success in self-realization by the forceful instructions of a pure devotee of the Lord, who is the typical emblem of a sadhu. A pure devotee of the Lord. A pure devotee of the Lord. A pure devotee is a true sadhu. He is a true saintly person. His words can penetrate the heart through the layers of ignorance and instantly cleanse the heart.

### compassion, Shukadeva Goswami, association with devotees, detachment, self-realization

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "This material world is a world of great illusion. And only by such association of pure devotees or genuine saints can we actually cut off our attachments."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating the importance of associating with sadhus, drawing parallels with Shukadeva Goswami's compassion and emphasizing the power of such association to break material bonds and guide one towards self-realization.

That's why as a sadhu, he goes door to door and speaks. In the Bhagavatam also, it is said, Shukadeva Goswami, Suta Goswami, glorified Shukadeva Goswami, that Shukadeva Goswami, out of compassion for the suffering humanity, spoke the Bhagavatam. Karunaya aha purana guhyam. Samsarinam karunaya aha purana guhyam. Out of compassion for the suffering souls of this world, Shukadeva Goswami spoke the Bhagavatam. So, same thing. Vidura spoke the words of enlightenment and Dhritarashtra became completely detached and left home and middle. The scriptures enjoin, therefore, that one should associate with sadhus only, rejecting all other kinds of association. Asasangatyagye Vaishnavachar. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, reject association of materialistic persons, even though in their association, somebody may enjoy some material, sense gratification. But that's not important. That's available in all species of life. Even to those in hell, sense gratification is available. What to speak of others? So, that's not important. What is important is the association of sadhus or pure devotees, who can cut the bonds of material affection and free us from this material bondage and direct us from this bondage, and direct us for self-realization. This material world is a world of great illusion, and only by such association of pure devotees or genuine saints can we actually cut off our attachments, by hearing them attentively and by taking their words very seriously, understanding them to be the best well-wishers and taking their words seriously and cutting off this bondage and following their instructions how to proceed on the path of self-realization. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

### Vidura, Hastinapura, Duryodhana's Insult, Vidura's Pilgrimage
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/58fbM0TAqxU?t=49
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Vidura left the palace and went away not because exactly that he was insulted by Duryodhana, but because he was not interested in any material comforts or materialistic way of life."
**Summary:** The lecture begins with an introduction to verses 3 and 4 of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on Vidura's return to Hastinapura, the joy of the inhabitants, and the circumstances of Vidura's departure due to Duryodhana's insult and his own desire for spiritual advancement.

In this session, we will be discussing the third and fourth verses of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Since there is a long purport for these two verses given by Srila Prabhupada, we will discuss this in two parts. So this session will be discussing part one of the purport. The third and fourth verses are given together. I shall read them together. So the third and fourth verses are given together, their translation: "When they saw Vidura return to the palace, all the inhabitants—Maharaj Yudhishthira, his younger brothers, Dhritarashtra, Satyaki, Sanjaya, Kripacharya, Kunti, Gandhari, Draupadi, Subhadra, Uttara, Kripi, many other wives of the Kauravas, and other ladies with children—all hurried to him in great delight. It so appeared that they had regained their consciousness after a long period." This indicates how dear Vidura was to all the inhabitants of the palace of Hastinapura. Foolishly, Duryodhana insulted Vidura, though Vidura was a well-wisher of Dhritarashtra and all the Kauravas. But Duryodhana, he very foolishly, in a narrow-minded way, he thought somehow that Vidura was against his real welfare, while the opposite was true. Vidura was actually advising Dhritarashtra for the well-being of Dhritarashtra and their entire family members, but Duryodhana thought otherwise. And when Duryodhana, out of foolishness, he insulted Vidura, Vidura left the palace and went away, not because exactly that he was insulted by Duryodhana, but because he was not interested in any material comforts or materialistic way of life. His interest was in Krishna consciousness, and he thought it wise to go on a pilgrimage and travel to holy places, searching for a suitable pure devotee of the Lord to hear Krishna katha and inquire about spirituality from such a bonafide, proper devotee. So it was described in the previous words that Vidura was on pilgrimage. He actually went searching for a pure devotee. He came in contact with Maitreya Muni. He inquired from Maitreya Muni, and after he got conviction that the ultimate goal is to be established in transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord Krishna, after that, he stopped putting questions to Maitreya and returned to Hastinapura.

**Key Quote:** "All of them they were very very joyful to receive him back after he had left and gone means they were not happy that he left."
**Summary:** The segment describes the joyful reception of Vidura upon his return and introduces the upcoming discussion of the histories of Gandhari, Kunti, Draupadi, and Subhadra as described in the purport.

Now, what are the purpose of return to Hastinapura? That will be made clear in the next few verses. But here, when he returned, all the inhabitants of Hastinapura were not the same as he had been in the past. Also, that palace, Maharaj Yudhishthira, the brothers of Yudhishthira, Kunti, Gandhari, Draupadi, and so many other ladies with children, all of them, they were very, very joyful to receive him back after he had left and gone, means they were not happy that he left. Duryodhana foolishly insulted Vidura, but Vidura was actually a real well-wisher, and he was very dear to all the other members of the family. So they all felt great delight when Vidura returned, and they went to receive him, and they were appearing to have regained their consciousness after a long time. It appeared like that they were so happy, so joyful. So Srila Prabhupada in the Purport describes the four different personalities mentioned in this verse: the brief history of Gandhari, Kunti, Draupadi, and Subhadra. These four personalities' history, brief history, is given by Srila Prabhupada in the Purport.

### Gandhari's History, Chastity, Worship of Lord Shiva, Marriage to Dhritarashtra, Blindness

**Key Quote:** "She wrapped up her eyes with many silk linens and she was married to Tirtharashtra under the guidance of her elder brother Shakuni."
**Summary:** The lecture details Gandhari's history, emphasizing her chastity, her worship of Lord Shiva, her marriage to the blind Dhritarashtra, and her decision to voluntarily blind herself.

So first of all, Prabhupada describes the history of Gandhari. Gandhari is the mother of the Kauravas. She is the wife of Dhritarashtra, and she is being described here by Srila Prabhupada, "the ideal chaste lady in the history of the world." Such a glorious description of Gandhari, "ideal chaste lady." Now, why she is described in this way will be very clear in the later parts of this description. She was the daughter of Maharaj Subala, the king of Gandhara. Now, this Gandhara is known as Kandahar in Kabul, Afghanistan. And in her maiden state, Gandhari worshipped Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva is generally worshipped by Hindu maidens to get a good husband. Gandhari satisfied Lord Shiva, and by his benediction, to obtain 100 sons, she was betrothed to Dhritarashtra despite his being blind forever. Dhritarashtra was very powerful Kshatriya, but he had that blindness from birth. He was born blind. When Gandhari came to know that her would-be husband was a blind man, to follow her life companion, she decided to become voluntarily blind. These are the characteristics of a chaste lady, a chaste wife. She voluntarily decided to become blind. So what did she do? She wrapped up her eyes with many silk linens, and she was married to Dhritarashtra under the guidance of her elder brother Shakuni. She was the most beautiful girl of her time, and she was equally qualified by her womanly qualities, which endeared every member of the Kaurava court. Despite all her good qualities, she had the natural frailties of a woman.

### Envy of Kunti, Birth of 100 Sons, Kurukshetra War, Advice to Dhritarashtra

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "When the intrigue of the battle of Kurukshetra was going on, she was not in favour of fighting with the Pandavas, rather she blamed Dhritarashtra her husband for such a fratricidal war."
**Summary:** The segment continues Gandhari's story, describing her envy of Kunti, the miraculous birth of her 100 sons, her disapproval of the Kurukshetra War, and her attempts to advise Dhritarashtra.

And she was envious of Kunti when the latter gave birth to a male child. Both the queens were pregnant, but Kunti first gave birth to a male child. Thus, Gandhari became angry and gave a blow to her own abdomen. As a result, she gave birth to a lump of flesh only. But since she was a devotee of Vyasadeva, by the instruction of Vyasadeva, the lump was divided into 100 parts, and each part gradually developed to become a male child. Thus, her ambition to become the mother of 100 sons was fulfilled, and she began to nourish all the children according to her exalted position. When the intrigue of the battle of Kurukshetra was going on, she was not in favor of fighting with the Pandavas. Rather, she blamed Dhritarashtra, her husband, for such a fratricidal war. She desired that the state be divided into two parts from the sons of Pandu and her own sons. She was very affected by this when all her sons died in the battle of Kurukshetra, and she wanted to curse Bhishmadeva and Yudhishthira, but she was checked by Vyasadeva. So you can understand, she is a very chaste lady. She is very faithful to her husband, but still she advised based on proper religious principles, and she actually felt grief when she lost all her 100 sons in the battle of Kurukshetra. Her mourning over the death of Duryodhana and Dushasana before Lord Krishna was very pitiful, and Lord Krishna pacified her by transcendental messages.

**Summary:** The lecture concludes Gandhari's history with her mourning over the death of her sons, her pacification by Lord Krishna and Vyasadeva, and her eventual death in a forest fire along with Dhritarashtra.

Always in the Vedic culture, when somebody is grieved due to the death of a near and dear one, they are pacified by transcendental messages from the Vedic literature. That is the only way one can become pacified. Further, it is described by Srila Prabhupada, she was equally grieved on the death of Karna, and she described to Lord Krishna the lamentation of Karna's wife. She was pacified by Shri Vyasadeva when he showed her dead sons, then promoted to the heavenly kingdom. She died along with her husband in the jungles of the Himalayas near the mouth of the Ganges. She burned in a forest fire. Maharaj Yudhishthira performed the death ceremony of his uncle and aunt. Then Srila Prabhupada describes Kunti Devi's brief history.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Durvasa Muni gave her a mantra by which it was possible for her to call any devata she pleased."
**Summary:** The lecture transitions to Kunti's history, detailing her birth, adoption, service to Durvasa Muni, the mantra she received, and her invocation of Suryadeva, leading to the birth of Karna before her marriage.

Kunti Devi was born as the daughter of Maharaj Shurasena, and she was a sister of Vasudeva. Vasudeva was Lord Krishna's father. Later, Kunti was adopted by Maharaj Kunti Bhoja, and hence she is known as Kunti. She was born as the daughter of Maharaj Shurasena, but she was adopted by Kunti Bhoja, and therefore she is called Kunti. She is the incarnation of the success potency of the personality. You got it. The heavenly denizens used from the upper planets used to visit the palace of King Kunti Bhoja, and Kunti was engaged for their reception. In former times, people were very pious, that the pious people of the earth were very strict in following all the rules and regulations, so they were visited by the devatas, and devatas were visible on this earth planet whenever they used to visit here because people were pious. In Kali Yuga, because of the sinful activities having increased too much, we cannot see the devatas even when they come to this material world. Now, whenever these heavenly denizens used to visit King Kunti Bhoja's palace, Kunti was engaged for their reception. She also happened to serve the great mystic sage Durvasa Muni, and being satisfied by her faithful service, Durvasa Muni gave her a mantra by which it was possible for her to call any devata she pleased. As a matter of inquisitiveness, she at once called for the sun god Suryadeva. Now, this Suryadeva, when he was called, he immediately desired couplement with her, but she declined. But the sun god assured her that she would be not adulterated, her virginity would not be adulterated, that she would be given immunity from the adulteration of her virginity. So she agreed to that proposal. As a result of this couplement, she became pregnant, and Karna was born by her. This is before her marriage to Pandu. So by the grace of the sun, she again turned into a virgin girl, but being afraid of her parents, she quitted the newly born child Karna. After that, when she actually selected her own husband, she preferred Pandu to be her husband.

**Summary:** The lecture concludes with the explanation of how Kunti used her mantra to invoke devatas and bear children for Pandu due to his curse, leading to the birth of the Pandavas, and announces the continuation of the discussion in the next session.

Now, Pandu was under a curse that he could not conceive children from his wife Kunti. So therefore, Kunti had to use that mantra to call upon devatas to bear children for Pandu, and that's how the five Pandavas, sorry, the first three Pandavas were born from Kunti, and two other Pandavas were born from Madri. So there is more description which we will continue to discuss in the next session. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "The two co-wives namely Kunti and Madri decided that Kunti should live for the maintenance of the five minor children, the Pandavas and Madri should accept the Sati rituals"
**Summary:** The speaker continues the history of Kunti Devi, describing Pandu's death, Madri's decision to perform Sati, and Kunti's responsibility to raise the Pandavas, highlighting the Vedic culture and the role of sages in endorsing these decisions.

So, we continue to discuss the purport from the previous session. We were discussing the history given by Srila Prabhupada about Kunti Devi. So, continuing to describe the history of Kunti Devi from where it was stopped in the previous session. It was described that Kunti Devi, after marrying Pandu because Pandu could not beget any children in his wives, so Kunti Devi was requested to call upon the Devatas by using the mantra given to her by Durvasamuni, and she called upon three different personalities: Yamaraj, Vayudeva, and Indrava, and begot Yudhishthira, Bhima, and Arjuna. Then, Madri also wanted to begot children. So, Kunti Devi taught her the mantra, and she begot twins, Nakula and Sahadeva, by calling upon the Ashwini Kumaras. And in this way, Kunti Devi was called upon by Durvasamuni and Indra. This way, Pandu had five sons through his two wives. Then, it is described that Maharaj Pandu died at an early age, for which Kunti was so aggrieved that she fainted. The two co-wives, namely Kunti and Madri, decided that Kunti should live for the maintenance of the five minor children, the Pandavas, and Madri should accept the Sati rituals by meeting voluntary death along with her husband Pandu. This agreement was endorsed by great sages like Shatashringa and others present on the occasion. This is the meaning of chaste wife or chaste wives. One of them decided to undergo Sati rituals, and the other one decided to stay back as a widow for taking care of the five minor children, and this was approved by great sages like Shatashringa.

**Key Quote:** "This human life is not simply meant for enjoying some sense gratification while life is there in the body. But the Vedas give us the higher purpose of life that we can become self-realized and attain eternal life"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of following Vedic scriptures for self-realization and attaining eternal life, contrasting it with the modern focus on sense gratification and warning against wasting the human form of life.

So, the Vedic culture, everybody follows the Vedic scriptures as explained and endorsed by the great sages who are well versed in this Vedic literature. So, it is a perfect society that is based on the principles given in the Vedas: How civilized human beings must live in this world with the ultimate aim of self-realization. This human life is not simply meant for enjoying some sense gratification while life is there in the body. No. That is the modern understanding. But the Vedas give us the higher purpose of life, that we can become self-realized and attain eternal life in the spiritual abode of the Supreme Lord. Go back to Him to associate with Him and live with Him eternally, full of bliss and knowledge. That is the special purpose, the special prerogative of the human form of life. People do not know this in the modern age, and in ignorance, they are simply living like animals. So, therefore, Srila Prabhupada and all the Acharyas and the scriptures and the great Rishis, they are warning us: Don't waste the human form of life simply in sense gratification. You may not get this opportunity again, though you will take birth again in this world. You may take birth in a lower species, and again to evolve the consciousness from the lower species to human form takes millions of years. So don't miss this chance; otherwise, you have to wait millions of years to again get this chance for eternal life free from all miseries, all kinds of ignorance and suffering.

**Key Quote:** "Later on when the Pandavas were banished from the kingdom by the intrigues of Duryodhana, Kunti followed her sons and she equally faced all sorts of difficulties during those days in exile"
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of Kunti, describing her trials during the Pandavas' exile, including the encounters with Hidimba and Bakasura, and the circumstances surrounding Draupadi's marriage to the five Pandavas.

This is the opportunity. So, all these great personalities that are described in the Bhagavatam, in the Puranas, the great devotees, the great saintly persons, they lived a life based on the scriptural directions, and they attained perfection. So, the description continues. Later on, when the Pandavas were banished from the kingdom by the intrigues of Duryodhana, Kunti followed her sons, and she equally faced all sorts of difficulties during those days in exile. During the forest life, one demon girl, Hidimba, wanted Bhima as her husband. Now, this is Kshatriya Dharma: If some woman or girl approaches a Kshatriya and begs for shelter, protection, because women have to be protected, and if they don't have protection, they can approach a Kshatriya and beg for protection. Bhima refused this girl. But when the girl approached Kunti and Yudhishthira, they ordered Bhima to accept her proposal and give her a son. As a result of this combination between Bhima and this Hidimba, Ghatotkaja was born, and he fought very valiantly with his father against the Kauravas in the battle of Kurukshetra. In their forest life, the Pandavas along with Kunti Devi, they lived with a Brahmana family that was in trouble because of one Bakasura demon, and Kunti ordered Bhima to kill the Bakasura demon to protect the Brahmana family against troubles created by the demon. She advised Yudhishthira to start for Panchala Desha. Draupadi was gained in this Panchala Desha by Arjuna, but by order of Kunti, all the five Pandava brothers became equally the husbands of Panchali or Draupadi. She was married with the five Pandavas.

**Summary:** The speaker addresses the question of Draupadi's chastity despite having five husbands, explaining that it was due to Kunti's order and approved by Vyasadeva, emphasizing Draupadi's extraordinary nature.

In the presence of Vyasadeva. Again, Draupadi accepted five husbands is not the norm. A chaste woman accepts only one husband. So people sometimes wonder how can Draupadi be considered as a chaste lady when she had five husbands. So it is explained that on the order of Kunti, though Draupadi actually was gained in this Swayamvara of Draupadi only by Arjuna, so she should have married Arjuna alone. But Kunti Devi ordered Draupadi to accept all the five brothers as her husband. And this was approved by Vyasadeva, the great sage, based on the scriptures. So she is an extraordinary personality. Draupadi is described elsewhere by Srila Prabhupada as a partial incarnation of Lakshmi. So Draupadi is a transcendental personality. She is not an ordinary woman. So therefore, we can't view this Draupadi having five husbands as unchaste on her part to have more than one husband.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Kunti's devotion, including her lament for Karna, her prayers to Lord Krishna, and her severe penance in the forest, highlighting her dedication to self-realization.

Kunti Devi never forgot her first child, Karna, who was born before Kunti's marriage. And after Karna's death in the battle of Kurukshetra, she lamented and admitted before her other sons that Karna was her eldest son prior to her marriage with Maharaja Pandu. She admitted. Her prayers for the Lord after the battle of Kurukshetra, when Lord Krishna was going back home, she excellently explained. She is a pure devotee of Krishna. So she offered wonderful prayers, and it has become immortalized in the Bhagavatam. So in those prayers, we come to know what is the transcendental position of Lord Krishna, very nicely explained by Kunti Devi. Later, she went to the forest with Gandhari for severe penance. She used to take meals after 30 days. See, this is proof that Kunti Devi is actually a great devotee. Because for the sake of self-realization, she underwent fasting, taking meals only once in 30 days. Who can do this? Not possible for some ordinary people. She finally sat down in profound meditation and later burned to ashes in a forest fire.

**Summary:** The speaker shifts to describing Subhadra, Krishna's sister, mentioning her birth, her relationship with Krishna and Balarama, and her representation in the Jagannath temple, linking it to the meeting of Radha and Krishna.

Then there is a description of Subhadra. Subhadra was the daughter of Vasudeva and sister of Lord Sri Krishna. In the 10th canto of the Bhagavatam, it is described that Vasudeva and Devaki gave birth to 8 sons and 1 daughter, Subhadra, and the 8th son is Krishna, and 6 of her children were killed by Kamsa, Shadgarbha it is called, and the 7th son was actually Balarama, but he was transferred from Devaki's womb to Rohini's womb, so when he was actually born, he appeared as the son of Rohini, but initially for 7 months he was in the womb of Devaki, so therefore it is described here. Subhadra was very dear sister to both Krishna and Balarama. The two brothers and sisters are represented in the famous Jagannath temple at Puri, and the temple is still visited by thousands of pilgrims daily. Jagannath Baldev Subhadra Maharani Ki Jai! The three are present in the deity form in this particular temple as the two brothers and sister. This temple is in remembrance of the Lord's visit at Kurukshetra during an occasion of solar eclipse and his subsequent meeting with the residents of Vrindavan. The meeting of Radha and Krishna during this occasion is a very pathetic story, and Lord Sri Chaitanya in the ecstasy of Srimati Radharani always pined for Lord Sri Krishna Jagannath Puri.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Arjuna kidnapping Subhadra with Krishna's advice, their subsequent marriage, the birth of Abhimanyu, and Subhadra's solace upon the birth of Pariksit, concluding the lecture.

While Arjuna was at Dwaraka, he wanted to have Subhadra as his queen, and he expressed his desire to Lord Krishna. Sri Krishna knew that his elder brother, Lord Baladeva, was arranging Subhadra's marriage elsewhere, and since he did not dare to go against the arrangement of Baladeva, Krishna advised Arjuna to kidnap Subhadra. Krishna himself kidnapped Rukmini. Similarly, Krishna advised Arjuna to kidnap Subhadra. So when all of them were on a pleasure trip on the Raivata hill, Arjuna managed to kidnap Subhadra. Krishna Baladeva was very angry at Arjuna, and he wanted to kill Arjuna, but Lord Krishna implored his brother to excuse Arjuna. Then Subhadra was duly married to Arjuna, and Abhimanyu was born of Subhadra and Arjuna. At the premature death of Abhimanyu in the battle of Kurukshetra, Subhadra was very mortified, but on the birth of Pariksit, she was happy and solaced. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "The gentle and chaste Gandhari, who was the daughter of King Subala of Kandahar or Gandhara, followed her husband, seeing that he was going to the Himalaya mountains, which are the delightful mountains, which are the delight of those who have accepted the staff of the renounced order, like fighters who have accepted a good lashing from the enemy."
**Summary:** Suta Goswami describes Gandhari's decision to follow her husband Dhritarashtra to the Himalayas, highlighting her chastity and devotion.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 30th verse of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. We have already heard how Dhritarashtra cut off his attachment after hearing the strong words spoken by Vidura and left home and went towards north. Now, the further description is being given here. It is Suta Goswami who is describing this to the sages of Naimisharanya. Patim Prayantam Subalasya Putri Pativratacha Anujagama Sadhvi Himalayam Nyasta Dhanda Praharsham Manasvinam Ivasat Samprahara. The meaning of this verse is, the gentle and chaste Gandhari, who was the daughter of King Subala of Kandahar or Gandhara, followed her husband, seeing that he was going to the Himalaya mountains, which are the delightful mountains, which are the delight of those who have accepted the staff of the renounced order, like fighters who have accepted a good lashing from the enemy.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Gandhari's qualities as a Sadhvi and Pativrata, emphasizing the importance of chaste and devoted wives in Vedic culture.

It is a very poetic, beautiful language used by Suta Goswami to describe. Along with Dhritarashtra, Gandhari also followed her husband, seeing that he was going to the Himalayas. So, he proceeded north, means he went in at least the Indian subcontinent. When somebody proceeds north for a spiritual purpose, they are going to the Himalayas. And that's the ideal place for those who want to go to a secluded place and live in seclusion, exclusively for the purpose of self-realization. So, you see Gandhari is described very beautifully here as Sadhvi, Pativrata. And Sadhvi means she is the most chaste lady. And Pativrata means she is devoted to her husband. So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, Sovalini or Gandhari, daughter of King Subala and wife of King Dhritarashtra, was ideal as a wife devoted to her husband. Pativrata, Sadhvi. The Vedic civilization especially prepares chaste and devoted wives, of whom Gandhari is one amongst many mentioned in history. Whenever there is an example given in the scriptures about historical personalities who were ideal, chaste and devoted wives,

**Key Quote:** "Just like Sita voluntarily chose to follow her husband and go to the forest with him, similarly Gandhari, she voluntarily accepted to follow her husband and go with him to the Himalayas."
**Summary:** The speaker draws a parallel between Gandhari and Sita, highlighting their voluntary sacrifices and devotion to their husbands, despite the hardships involved.

Gandhari's name is one of the foremost. Similarly, Srila Prabhupada says, Lakshmiji, Sita Devi, was also a daughter of a great king. She followed her husband Lord Ramachandra into the forest. Sita, she was a daughter of King Janaka. She was a princess. She was married to the Prince Rama. But, when Rama was ordered by his father to go to the forest, Sita need not have gone. So, it is said here, just like Sita voluntarily chose to follow her husband and go to the forest with him, similarly Gandhari, she voluntarily accepted to follow her husband and go with him to the Himalayas. So, Srila Prabhupada says, similarly as a woman, Gandhari could have remained at home or at her father's house. But as a chaste and gentle lady, she followed her husband without consideration. Life in Himalayas, that too for practicing Self Realization, is a very difficult life, especially for a woman. So, in spite of knowing the difficulties, Gandhari did not hesitate even a little bit. She simply followed her husband.

**Key Quote:** "As a chaste lady, Gandhari decided to follow her husband till the last moment."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Gandhari's decision to follow Dhritarashtra was voluntary and emphasizes Dhritarashtra's detachment and Gandhari's unwavering devotion.

Instructions for the renounced order of life were imparted to Dhritarashtra by Vidura. And Gandhari was by the side of her husband, hearing Vidura, while Vidura was instructing Dhritarashtra. So, Vidura did not ask Gandhari to follow her husband. Or, Dhritarashtra did not ask Gandhari that you follow me. No. Because, Dhritarashtra was at that time fully determined, like a great warrior who faces all kinds of dangers in the battlefield. The example is given, Manasvinam Ivasat Samprahara. Manasvinam. Those who are great warriors, they are ready to face any danger in the battlefield, but they will not give up fighting for the just cause, or for fighting in a Dharma Yudha. They are never afraid of facing any situation. So, even if they are injured or even if they are killed, they don't mind. But they will fight for justice. Similarly, Dhritarashtra was determined to renounce and leave the palace and go away to the Himalayas. So, he did not ask her, are you going to come with me? What are you going to do? He did not ask her. So, Srila Prabhupada says, Dhritarashtra was no longer attracted to so-called wife or relatives, and he decided to start all alone. But, as a chaste lady, Gandhari decided to follow her husband till the last moment. It will be explained in the later verses. And Srila Prabhupada is writing in the purport, Gandhari decided, I am going to be with my husband till the last moment of his life. I am not going to bother about my comforts, especially in old age. This is real chastity. This is a sign of chastity. As a chaste lady,

### Vanaprastha, Sanyas, Varna Ashrama, renunciation

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "These are all based on a very advanced culture and civilization in the Vedic culture."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the stages of Varna Ashrama, focusing on Vanaprastha and Sanyas, and the rules regarding a wife's association with her husband in each stage, highlighting the advanced nature of Vedic culture.

Gandhari decided to follow her husband till the last moment. Maharaj Dhritarashtra accepted the order of Vanaprastha. It is not that after Grahastha, one directly accepts Sanyas. No. Directly accepting Sanyas is possible only for a Brahmachari who decides not to enter the Grahastha Ashrama. Such a Brahmachari can directly accept Sanyas. But a Grahastha, one who has been trained as a Brahmachari and enters Grahastha Ashrama, should next accept Vanaprastha and then accept Sanyas. So, Brahmacharya, Grahastha, Vanaprastha, Sanyas. These are the progressive stages of spiritual development in the life of a civilized, cultured human being following the Varna Ashrama system. But, Dhritarashtra, because he had accepted the Grahastha Ashrama, he next accepted the Vanaprastha order. Now, Srila Prabhupada says, because Dhritarashtra accepted the order of Vanaprastha, at this stage, the wife is allowed to remain as a voluntary servitor of the husband. It is allowed for the wife to remain with the husband as a servitor of the husband. But in the Sanyas stage, no wife can stay with her former husband. So, Sanyas is that particular stage of renunciation or the spiritual order where a Grahastha who renounces home, goes away to the forest or a holy place or to the Himalayas, can take his wife only as long as he is in Vanaprastha order. But Sanyas order, he cannot be with his wife. He has to be away from his wife. Completely away from his wife. Why? Srila Prabhupada explains, according to the scriptures, a Sanyasi is considered to be a dead man civilly. It is declared like he is no longer present for the wife. Therefore, the wife becomes a civil widow without connection with her former husband. These are all based on a very advanced culture and civilization in the Vedic culture. Of course, nowadays it is not practical. Neither it is recommended.

**Key Quote:** "Sanyas is only for those who want to dedicate themselves for traveling and preaching without any other responsibility. Otherwise, Sanyas in Kali Yuga is forbidden."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the prohibition of Sanyas in Kali Yuga, except for those who dedicate themselves to traveling and preaching, and reiterates Dhritarashtra's detachment and Gandhari's voluntary following.

Sanyas itself is not recommended in Kali Yuga. Somebody may ask, why did I accept Sanyas? Now, Sanyas in Kali Yuga in general is not recommended for everyone. But some people who want to preach in this society very vigorously, travel and preach, for them, Sanyas may be accepted. May be accepted simply for the sake of dedicating oneself for traveling and preaching without any encumbrances of other responsibilities and duties in the society. So, Sanyas is only for those who want to dedicate themselves for traveling and preaching without any other responsibility. Otherwise, Sanyas in Kali Yuga is forbidden. Five things are forbidden in Kali Yuga: Ashwamedham, Gavalambham, Sanyasam, Palapaitrikam, Devarayana, Suthopati, Kalopancha, Vibharjayet. So, Sanyas is forbidden in Kali Yuga. Maharaj Dhritarashtra did not deny his faithful wife and she followed her husband at her own risk. It doesn't mean that husband because the wife is following him, he takes some responsibility for protecting her, maintaining her. No. She is following her husband at her own risk. And the husband is still completely detached from the wife and he is determined to practice. He is determined to practice self realization without any other incomprehenses.

### Sanyas, Danda, Mayavadi, Vaishnava, renunciation

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Vaishnava Sanyasis from the beginning they learn to depend on Krishna. The Supreme Personality of God."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the significance of the Sanyas Danda, differentiating between Ekadanda (Mayavadi) and Tridanda (Vaishnava) Sanyasis, and their respective approaches to renunciation and dependence on Krishna, concluding with advice for Dhritarashtra.

Now, regarding Sanyas, Srila Prabhupada says, briefly, the Sanyasis accept a rod as the sign of the renounced rod of the Danda. Sanyas Danda. Like, I am having this Danda here. So, Sanyasis accept this Danda. What is the significance of this Danda? This Danda is accepted by Sanyasis to signify that they have accepted the renounced daughter of the fly, Sanyas. There are two types of Sanyasis. Those who follow the Mayavadi philosophy headed by Sri Pachankaracharya accept only one rod or Ekadanda, Sanyas. But those who follow the Vaishnava philosophy accept three combined rods called Tridanda. Inside this, three Dandas. There are three rods. The Mayavadi Sanyasis are Ekadandi Swamis, whereas the Vaishnava Sanyasis are Tridandi Swamis. More distinctly, they are called Tridandi Goswamis, in order to be distinguished from the Mayavadi philosophers. The Ekadandi Swamis are mostly fond of the Himalayas. But the Vaishnava Sanyasis are fond of Vrindavan and Puri. Vaishnava Sanyasis generally go to a holy place connected with the pastimes of the Supreme Lord, whereas the Mayavadi Sanyasis they generally go to the Himalayas. The Vaishnava Sanyasis are Narottamas, whereas the Mayavadi Sanyasis are Dheeras. The Vaishnava Sanyasis they from the beginning they learn to depend on Krishna, the Supreme Personality of God. So therefore, specially in Sanyas, they are completely dependent on Krishna only. Where therefore, they are eligible for this Narottama stage of renunciation, the highest stage. Whereas the Mayavadi Sanyasis because they don't have any conception or understanding of the personality of Godhead, so they are mostly Dheeras, undisturbed by material circumstances and detached from all material comforts. So they are mostly Dheeras. Dhritarashtra was advised to follow the Dheeras because at that stage it was difficult for him to become a Narottama, given the circumstances in which it was he was situated. He was advised to become a Dheera. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "This is the Vedic culture."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of verse 31, highlighting the daily duties of a householder in Vedic culture, as exemplified by Maharaj Yudhishthira, and contrasting it with modern practices.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devim Saraswatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing three verses, 31, 32, and 33 of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This chapter is dealing with the topic of Dhritarashtra quits home. So we have already discussed how Vidura instructed Dhritarashtra with very, very strong words, and Dhritarashtra was able to cut off his attachments and leave the palace and immediately go to the Himalayas. And after that, what happened? So that is being now described by Suta Goswami to the sages of Naimishaharanya. So the 31st verse, Ajatashatru krutamaitro hutagnir Viprannatva tilago bhumi rukmaihi Graham pravishto guru vandanaya Naca apasyat pitarau saubhalimcha. The meaning of this verse is, Maharaj Yudhishthira, whose enemy was never born, performed his daily morning duties by praying, offering fire sacrifice to the sun god, and offering obeisances, grains, cows, land, and gold, to the brahmanas. He then entered the palace to pay respects to the elderly. However, he could not find his uncles or aunt, the daughter of King Subala. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, Maharaj Yudhishthira was the most pious king because he personally practiced daily the pious duties for the householders. The householders are required to rise early in the morning, and after bathing, they should offer respects to the deities at home by prayers, by offering fuel in the sacred fire, by giving the brahmanas in charity land, cows, grains, gold, etc., and at last offering to the elderly members due respects and obeisances. This is the Vedic culture, duties of a householder.

### importance of sadhu sanga, spiritual guidance, modern life vs. Vedic principles

**Key Quote:** "Nothing good can be expected from them unless they associate with sadhus."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of associating with pure devotees (sadhus) like Vidura to learn and adopt Vedic principles, contrasting this with the detrimental effects of modern lifestyles.

If you study the 10th canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam, you will find a chapter describing Lord Krishna's daily activities as a grahastha in Dwaraka. So Krishna is to do all this. Yudhishthira Maharaj was doing all his duties very nicely. So Srila Prabhupada comments, One who is not prepared to practice any duties, and is not prepared to practice injunctions prescribed in the shastras, cannot be a good man simply by book knowledge. Modern householders are practiced to different modes of life, namely to rise late, they don't rise early, and then take bed tea without any sort of cleanliness, and without any purificatory practices as mentioned above. A cultured householder should rise early in the morning, and the first business after rising early in the morning is to cleanse oneself completely. That is a very, very, very first thing one should do. But modern day householders do not do so. The household children are taken to practice what the parents practice, and therefore the whole generation glides towards hell. Nothing good can be expected from them unless they associate with sadhus. Sadhus means pure devotees. Like Dhritarashtra, the materialistic person may take lessons from a sadhu like Vidura, just like Vidura instructed Dhritarashtra. Similarly, modern day householders should take lessons from devotees of the Lord who are following all these practices very nicely. So if the materialistic persons take proper lessons from sadhu like Vidura, then they can be cleansed of the effects of modern life.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the events following Dhritarashtra's departure, focusing on Yudhishthira's anxiety and concern for his uncles and aunt, and his reaction upon discovering their absence.

Now Maharaj Yudhishthira, Srila Prabhupada says, however, could not find in the palace his two uncles, namely Dhritarashtra and Vidura, along with Gandhari, the daughter of King Subala. Saubalini means the daughter of King Subala. So all the three of them had left the palace very silently, quietly, without informing anybody. So therefore the next morning when Yudhishthira came to offer respects to his uncles and his aunt, the elderly, he could find them. He was anxious to see them and therefore asked Sanjaya, the private secretary of Dhritarashtra. So the 32nd verse, The meaning of this 32nd verse, Maharaj Yudhishthira, full of anxiety, turned to Sanjaya who was sitting there and said, O Sanjaya, where is our uncle who is old and blind? The 33rd verse, Ambacha hata-putrarta pitruvyakva-gata-surat apimaiyakrita-prajne hata-bandhusya-bharyaya Asham samana shamalam Ganga aayam dukhito apatat. The meaning of this 33rd verse is, Where is my well-wisher, uncle Vidura and mother Gandhari, who is very afflicted due to her son's demise? My uncle Dhritarashtra was also very mortified due to the death of all his sons and grandsons. Undoubtedly, I am very ungrateful. Did he therefore take my offenses very seriously and along with his wife drown himself in the Ganges?

**Summary:** This segment discusses Yudhishthira and Arjuna's reluctance to engage in the Kurukshetra war, highlighting their compassionate nature and the understanding that the battle was ultimately executed by the will of the Lord.

See the reaction of Yudhishthira when he did not find his uncles and aunt. It is just befitting with Yudhishthira's good-natured behavior. So Srila Prabhupada explains, The Pandavas, especially Maharaj, Yudhishthira and Arjuna anticipated the after-effects of the battle of Kurukshetra. Both Yudhishthira and Arjuna did not actually want to fight the battle. They were just carrying out their duties according to what was prescribed for them as kshatriyas. Kshatriyas are duty-bound to fight for justice. So Yudhishthira and Arjuna were unwillingly engaged in the battle. So Srila Prabhupada points out, Because both of them did not really like the fighting, therefore Arjuna declined to execute the fighting. You can read in the Bhagavad Gita, in the first chapter, how Arjuna tells Krishna, I won't fight. How can I kill my kinsmen just for the sake of me to enjoy a flourishing royal kingdom? I don't want to fight. So this is the soft-hearted nature of pure devotees. All the Pandavas are pure devotees. The fight was executed, however, by the will of the Lord. So even though the Pandavas did not want to fight, especially Yudhishthira and Arjuna did not want to fight against the Kauravas, but it was executed, the fighting was executed by the will of the Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "Care for the elderly. That is the culture, the Vedic culture."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the aftermath of the war and Yudhishthira's deep concern for Dhritarashtra and Gandhari, emphasizing the Vedic cultural value of caring for the elderly and contrasting it with modern trends.

Everyone is bound by the will of the Lord. Now after the battle, the effects of family agreement, as they had thought of it before, had come true. Whatever they had feared would be the aftermath of the massacre. Millions of Kshatriyas who were participating in the battle all died. Maharaj Yudhishthira was always conscious of the great plight of his uncle Dhritarashtra and aunt Gandhari, because they lost all their sons and grandsons, and they are old, and now they are bereft of their kingdom. Their sons and grandsons have died. Their well-wishers have passed away. So what do they do? But Yudhishthira Maharaj, being the most saintly, compassionate, kind, considerate, good-natured, well-behaved, saintly king, he was always conscious of the miserable condition of his aunt and uncle. Therefore, he took all possible care of them in their old age and aggrieved conditions. Care for the elderly, that is the culture, the Vedic culture. Nowadays, many, many children, when they are grown up, they go away from home, leaving their parents alone. They go for some career, some business, some opportunities for making a lot of money. In the western countries, especially from India, so many youngsters go away and leave their parents alone. Yudhishthira Maharaj is not like that. He was taking all possible care of Dhritarashtra and Gandhari in their old age.

**Key Quote:** "A devotee never finds faults with others, but tries to find his own fault and rectify them as far as possible."
**Summary:** This segment focuses on Yudhishthira's humility and self-reflection, highlighting the qualities of a devotee who focuses on their own faults rather than those of others, and acknowledging Dhritarashtra's past kindness.

When, therefore, he could not find his uncle and aunt in the palace, naturally, his doubts arose. He was worried, what happened to them? Where have they gone? Why are they missing from their place of residence? He conjectured that they had gone down to the water of the Ganges. Had they drowned themselves in the Ganga river because they thought their life is not worth living? He thought himself ungrateful because when the Pandavas were fatherless, Maharaj Dhritarashtra had given them all royal facilities to live. And in return, Yudhishthira had killed all Dhritarashtra's sons in the battle of Kurukshetra. See how Yudhishthira is thinking. Dhritarashtra gave me shelter when I was fatherless, and what did I do? I killed all his sons and grandsons in the battle of Kurukshetra. So, as a pious man, Maharaj Yudhishthira took into account all his unavoidable misdeeds. He never thought of the misdeeds of his uncle and company. Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana were always plotting to kill the Pandavas. So, the fact is, Dhritarashtra suffered the effects of his own misdeeds by the will of the Lord. But Maharaj Yudhishthira was thinking only of his own unavoidable misdeeds. This is the nature of a devotee of the Lord. A devotee never finds faults with others, but tries to find his own fault and rectify them as far as possible. This is a wonderful quality of a devotee of the Lord. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verses to be discussed and explains the context of Yudhishthira's inquiry about his missing uncles and aunt, and Sanjaya's initial inability to respond due to grief.

In this session, we will be discussing from four verses, the 34th, the 35th, the 36th and the 37th verses of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The description is continuing about Yudhishthira searching for his missing uncles and aunt. The 34th verse: Pithari Uparate Pandav Sarvanas Surudas Shishun Arakshatam Vyasanataha Pitruvyav Kva Gatav Itaha. The meaning of this verse is: When my father Pandu fell down and we were all small children, these two uncles came to me and said, 'They gave us protection from all kinds of calamities. They were always our good well-wishers. Alas, where have they gone from here?' This is spoken by Yudhishthira to Sanjaya while inquiring from Sanjaya about the uncles and aunt who are missing from the palace. The 35th verse: Suta Vacha. We should remember that Suta Gosvami is speaking, narrating this, describing this in silence to the sage of Sunayamishadanya. Suta Vacha Kripa Yaas Neha Vaikla Vyat Suto Viraha Karshitaha Atmeshwaram Achakshano Napratya Napratyaha Atipiditaha.

### Dhritarashtra's departure, Sanjaya's perspective, Renunciation, Better life

**Key Quote:** "Unless one is convinced of a better life after renunciation of present life, one cannot stick to the renounced order of life simply by artificial dress or staying out of the home."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Sanjaya's sorrow at Dhritarashtra's departure and connects it to the importance of genuine conviction in a better life for successful renunciation, as explained by Srila Prabhupada.

The meaning of this verse is, Suta Goswami said, because of compassion and mental agitation, Sanjaya, not having seen his own master Dhritarashtra, was aggrieved and could not properly reply to Maharaj Yudhishthira. Immediately Sanjaya could not respond to Yudhishthira's inquiry. So in the Purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, Sanjaya was the personal assistant of Maharaj Dhritarashtra for a very long time and thus he had the opportunity to study the life of Dhritarashtra. And when he saw at last that Dhritarashtra had left home without his knowledge, his sorrows had no bound. He was extremely sorry that somebody whom he had served for a very long time had left home without informing Sanjaya. So Sanjaya was fully compassionate toward Dhritarashtra because in the game of the battle of Kurukshetra, King Dhritarashtra had lost everything, men and money. And at last the king and the queen had to leave home in utter fright. Dhritarashtra was so frustrated that he felt very sorry for the people who had left home without informing Sanjaya. He studied the situation in his own way because he did not know that the inner vision of Dhritarashtra has been awakened by Vidura. So Sanjaya left home in enthusiastic cheerfulness for a better life after departure from the dark well of home. So Srila Prabhupada says, Sanjaya doesn't know that Dhritarashtra's inner vision has been awakened by Vidura and he has cheerfully left the palace, not in frustration. So Srila Prabhupada says, unless one is convinced of a better life after renunciation of present life, one cannot stick to the renounced order of life simply by artificial dress or staying out of the home. Sometimes not. Nowadays people leave home and go away to some ashram. But such renunciation will not last unless they are properly fixed up in that renunciation by being convinced of a better life after quitting home.

**Key Quote:** "First he slowly pacified his mind by intelligence. And wiping away his tears. And thinking of the feet of his master, Dhritarashtra. He began to reply to Maharaj Yudhishtira."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how Sanjaya regains his composure by pacifying his mind with intelligence, wiping away tears, and remembering his master, Dhritarashtra, before replying to Yudhishthira.

Being convinced of a better life. The 36th verse: Vimrgya ashroni paanibhyam vishtabhyatmanam atmana ajatashatrumpratyuche prabhopadavanusmaran. The meaning of this 36th verse: First he slowly pacified his mind by intelligence, and wiping away his tears, and thinking of the feet of his master, Dhritarashtra, he began to reply to Maharaj Yudhishtira. Sanjaya. He pacified his mind because he was disturbed on not finding Dhritarashtra in the palace. So he pacified his mind by his intelligence. In the Bhagavad Gita it is explained that the mind is superior to the senses. The intelligence is superior to the mind. The soul is even superior to the intelligence. So one can pacify the mind by intelligence because intelligence is higher. If one's intelligence is not working then one can get the mind pacified by taking instructions from somebody else who is more intelligent, who is spiritually awakened. So Sanjaya pacified his mind by his intelligence and wiping away his tears, thinking of the feet of his master Dhritarashtra, he began to reply to Maharaj Yudhishtira.

### Sanjaya's reply, Deception by great souls, Respect for elders
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/TgJFmDw9S5k?t=479
**Verse References:** SB 1.13.37
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "I have been cheated by those great souls."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Sanjaya's reply to Yudhishthira, focusing on his feeling of being 'cheated' by Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, and Vidura, and emphasizes the importance of respecting elders regardless of their actions.

What was his reply? That's the next verse, 37th verse: Sanjaya Vacha. Sanjaya is replying to Maharaj Yudhishtira. Naham Veda Vyavasitam. Pitrorva Kulanandana. Gandharya Vamahabaho. Mushitosmi Mahatmabhi. This is the most important point here in this verse: Mushitosmi Mahatmabhi. What's the meaning of this? The meaning of this verse, the 37th verse: Sanjaya said, he is speaking to Yudhishtira, replying to Yudhishtira's enquiry, 'My dear descendant of the Kuru dynasty, Nandana.' He is addressing Yudhishtira in that way. 'I have no information of the determination of your two uncles and Gandhari. I have no information. I do not know where they have gone, O King. I have been cheated by those great souls.' Mushitosmi means 'I have been cheated.' By whom? By those great souls, Mahatmabhi. This is Sanjaya's attitude towards Dhritarashtra, Vidura, and Gandhari, elders. This is our culture. Regardless of what they may do or not do, the elders are to be offered proper respect by the younger ones. This is the culture. So Sanjaya is addressing to Yudhishtira that 'I have been cheated by them because they never informed me where they are going. I was taking care of them, especially Dhritarashtra and Gandhari.' So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport that great souls cheat others may be astonishing to know. If they are great souls, why should they cheat? So Srila Prabhupada explains clearly in this purport, kindly hear attentively, that great souls cheat others may be astonishing to know, but it is a fact that great souls cheat others for a great cause. They have a solid reason to cheat others under very, very, very, very special circumstances, rarest of rare cases. Such great souls, Mahatma, who are basically devotees, they sometimes, for a greater cause, they do cheat others.

### Great souls cheat for a cause, Satisfying the Lord, Occupational duty, Perfection
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/TgJFmDw9S5k?t=659
**Verse References:** BG 18.46
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The highest perfection of life is to satisfy the Lord by one's occupational duty."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of great souls 'cheating' for a greater cause, citing examples and emphasizing that the ultimate goal is to satisfy the Lord through one's prescribed duties, referencing the Bhagavad Gita.

So it is explained here by Srila Prabhupada, it is said that Lord Krishna also advised Yudhishtira, only for Dronacharya. Yudhishtira is the greatest moralist of his time, but he was told by Krishna, 'Tell a lie to Dronacharya, his own teacher. Tell a lie.' And it was also for a great cause. The Lord wanted it, therefore it was a great cause. Whatever the Lord wants, that is the greatest thing one can do. Satisfaction of the Lord is a criterion of one who is bona fide. And the highest perfection of life is to satisfy the Lord by one's occupational duty. That is the verdict of Gita and Bhagavad, both the Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam describe this. Where is it said in the Gita that the highest perfection of life is to satisfy the Supreme Lord by one's occupational duty? In the 18th chapter, the 46th verse says: Yataha Pravritti Bhutanam Yena Sarvam Idam Tatam Svakarmana Tam Abhyarchya Siddhim Vindati Manavaha. Is the meaning of this verse: By worship of the Lord, who is the source of all beings and who is all pervading, man can in the performance of his own duty attain perfection. So one attains perfection by worship of the Lord, who is the source of all beings and who is all pervading, while a person performs his own duties as prescribed in the Shastra. One can please the Lord in this way. In the Bhagavatam it is said, it is therefore concluded that the highest perfection one can achieve by discharging the duties prescribed for one's own occupation according to caste divisions and orders of life is to please the personality of Godhead. Highest perfection, Sam Siddhi, is Haritoshanam, satisfy or please Lord Hari.

### Confidentiality, Examples of cheating, Absolute Truth, Conclusion

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "To satisfy the Lord, anything is good, for it is in relation with the absolute truth."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by providing further examples of devotees 'cheating' for a higher purpose, emphasizing that actions done to satisfy the Lord are aligned with the absolute truth, and ends the lecture.

So therefore Prabhupada says, Dhritarashtra and Vidura, followed by Gandhari, did not disclose their determination to Sanjaya, although he was constantly with Dhritarashtra as his personal assistant. Sanjaya never thought that Dhritarashtra could perform any act without consulting him. But Dhritarashtra's going away from home was so confidential that it could not be disclosed even to Sanjaya. And Srila Prabhupada gives more examples. Sanatana Goswami also cheated the keeper of the prison house than Mahaprabhu. Sanatana was trying to get relief from the duties in the royal palace of the King, Nawab Hussain Shah of Bengal. He was the minister. So he cheated the prison keeper and went away to join Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Raghunath Das Goswami also cheated his priest and left home to join Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. So to satisfy the Lord, anything is good, for it is in relation with the absolute truth. That's the conclusion. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of the verses, explaining Narada's appearance as a divine arrangement to inform Yudhishthira about his relatives.

In this session, we will be discussing from two verses, the 38th and the 39th verses of the 13th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 38th verse is as follows: Athar Jagama Bhagavan Narada Sahatumburuho Pratyutthaya Abhivadhyaha Sanujo Abhyarchayan Munim. The meaning of this verse is, "While Sanjaya was thus speaking, Shri Narada, the powerful devotee of the Lord, appeared on the scene carrying his tumburu. Maharaj Yudhishthira and his brothers received him properly by getting up from their seats and offering obeisances." So, this is the Lord's arrangement. When Yudhishthira is puzzled as to where his uncles and aunt have gone, Sanjaya is also unaware. So, the Lord, unknowingly, arranged that Narada inform Yudhishthira about the whereabouts of Dhritarashtra and Gandhari and Vidura.

**Key Quote:** "The way of devotional service is not only to worship the Supreme Lord with all devotion, but also to worship the pure devotee spiritual master, the Acharya, on the same level as the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why Narada is referred to as Bhagavan, emphasizing the importance of honoring pure devotees and their role in preaching.

So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, Devarishi Narada is described herein as Bhagavan. Why? Why is he called Bhagavan? Is he Bhagavan? He is not Bhagavan. Krishna is Bhagavan. The Supreme Personality of God is Krishna. Krishna is Bhagavan. So, why is Devarishi Narada described as Bhagavan? Prabhupada explains it is because he is the most confidential devotee of the Lord. In rare cases, very exalted devotees who are most confidential devotees of the Lord are described, addressed as Bhagavan. So, Srila Prabhupada further says, "The Lord and his very confidential devotees are treated on the same level by those who are actually engaged in the loving service of the Lord. The way of devotional service is not only to worship the Supreme Lord with all devotion, but also to worship the pure devotee spiritual master, the Acharya, on the same level as the Lord. Because, such Acharyas and pure devotees are very, very dear to the Lord. Such confidential devotees of the Lord are very much dear to the Lord because they travel everywhere to preach the glories of the Lord in different capacities and try their utmost to convert the non-devotees of the Lord into devotees in order to bring them to the platform of sanity. This material world is filled with non-devotees. And to convert these non-devotees into devotees, pure devotees like Narada travel and preach and try to convert non-devotees into devotees."

**Key Quote:** "Actually a living being cannot be a non-devotee of the Lord because of his constitutional position."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the inherent devotional nature of all beings and highlights preaching to non-devotees as the highest form of service.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains, it's very interesting to note that actually a living being cannot be a non-devotee of the Lord because of his constitutional position. What is our constitutional position? We are part and parcel of the Lord. We belong to the Lord. We are all devotees of the Lord. But, when one becomes a non-devotee, a non-believer, it is to be understood that the person concerned is not in a sound condition of life. So, if somebody is a non-devotee, that is not the perfect condition or sound condition of the life of such a non-devotee. The confidential devotees of the Lord treat such illusioned living beings and therefore they are most pleasing in the eyes of the Lord. There are so many devotees rendering different kinds of service to the Lord. Among all of them, who is rendering the best service or the topmost service? It is those who are engaged in preaching to the non-devotees and delivering such non-devotees to the spiritual world.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the generosity of those who preach and the importance of offering respect to pure devotees like Narada.

They are the best devotees. They are described in the Bhagavatam 10th canto in the prayers offered by the gopis to Krishna that bhuvigranantiye bhuridājana. Such people who, devotees, pure devotees, who preach the glories of the Lord among the non-devotees, they are actually the most munificent. Bhuridājana. They are very, very, very generous. The Lord says in the Bhagavad Gita that no one is dearer to Him than one who actually preaches the glories of the Lord to convert the non-believers and non-devotees. So the preaching is very, very much necessary and it is powerful and effective when it is done by pure devotees. Such personalities as Narada must be offered all due respects like those offered to the personality of Godhead Himself. sākṣād haritvena samasta-śāstrair uktas tathā bhāvyata eva sattvihī. The pure devotees are to be treated on the same level as the Lord. That is the verdict of the śāstras. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira along with his noble brothers were examples for others in receiving a pure devotee of the Lord like Narada who had no other business save and except singing the glories of the Lord along with his veena,

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Gandhari's exceptional character as an ascetic, highlighting her tolerance and devotion.

from Narada. So, in the purport Śrīla Prabhupāda explains Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira as a good soul and devotee of the lord was always conscious of the great loss of his aunt and her sufferings as an ascetic. So, Gandhari is an exceptional personality described in the history called Mahabharata. Gandhari's personality is very much glorified in the Mahabharata because she was living the life of an ascetic even though she was living in a palace. Because her husband was blind, Gandhari blindfolded herself voluntarily. This is called a chaste wife, an obedient wife, a devoted wife. And after the great loss of her sons, in the battle of Kurukshetra, Gandhari was living like an ascetic, tapasvini. Particularly, Yudhiṣṭhira is referring to Gandhari as tapasvini. And what is the characteristic of a tapasvini or ascetic? An ascetic is never disturbed by all kinds of sufferings. So, suffering is a part of material existence which is unavoidable even for great devotees, even for pious people, even for anybody who is willing to undergo the austerities to detach themselves from their body. For such people, any difficulty is tolerable. They tolerate. Queen Gandhari is a typical example of an ascetic because of her marvelous character

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Gandhari's wise counsel and the importance of tolerance in the face of difficulties encountered on the path of devotional service.

in many trying situations. Gandhari has always displayed this tolerance because she was kind to Dhritarashtra who was plotting and planning to kill the Pandavas. Gandhari was not supporting her husband. She was giving him good counsel. But, the Kauravas would not listen to Gandhari nor would they listen to other great personalities. So, this is a demoniac nature. They will not listen to others if they think that is not so favorable. So, Queen Gandhari is a typical example of an ascetic because of her marvelous character in many trying situations. So, they teach us by their example these great personalities, great devotees, very, very tolerant. Srila Prabhupada says in the material world, while we have taken up the path of devotional service, we have declared a war against Maya. So, in a battle between Maya and people, there will be difficulties, there will be dangers, there will be some inconveniences, but one has to tolerate all of them in order to actually practice spiritual life and make progress to go back home,

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing Gandhari's exemplary qualities as an ideal woman and her unwavering fairness, even in difficult circumstances.

back to Godhead. It is not some voluntary torture of the body or voluntarily denying something which is nicely enjoyable. No, that is not this proper understanding. So, Gandhari is described as she was an ideal woman as mother, wife, and ascetic and in the history of the world such character in a woman is rarely found. Gandhari has been glorified a lot in the Mahabharata and even in the Bhagavata as a great personality. So, she is setting a very good example for tapas we need. Even though her husband was not fair to the Pandavas, but she was always fair herself and she was requesting her husband to be fair to the Pandavas. She never approved the different nefarious activities of Duryodhana, of Dushasana, of Dhritarashtra, she never approved. And she was always advising them to refrain from giving trouble to the Pandavas. So, she is a marvelous personality and such character in a woman is rarely found in the world. She is a very rare ideal woman to be found very rarely. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the story of Dhritarashtra leaving the palace, Yudhishthira's worry and his respect for his elders, and the subsequent arrival of Narada Muni.

So the background for this 40th verse is that Dhritarashtra has left the palace after hearing the strong instructions of Vidura. Vidura, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari all have left the palace. And Yudhishthira the next day morning is doing his daily morning duties as a pious householder. So he went to pay respects to Dhritarashtra and he didn't find Dhritarashtra in his usual place. Then immediately he inquired from Sanjaya, Dhritarashtra's secretary, Where is Dhritarashtra, my uncle? So Sanjaya said, I don't know. I don't know where he's gone, I have no idea. Then Yudhishthira began to worry whether because Dhritarashtra and Gandhari had lost all their sons and they were very much aggrieved because we were all here, aggrieved because of the great loss in the battle of Kurukshetra, all their 100 sons were killed and their grandsons, sons and grandsons, everyone was killed in the battle of Kurukshetra, so because he was so very much aggrieved, did he leave the palace to go and drown himself in the river Ganga? That was what Yudhishthira was so much concerned, worried. In fact, Yudhishthira wanted to take care of his uncle and aunt, that they should be comforted when they have undergone such a huge loss in the last days, so he was taking good care actually, but suddenly when they disappeared he began to worry what happened, why did they, where did they go and where have they gone? So as he was worrying suddenly Narada appeared in the

**Summary:** The speaker explains the analogy of Narada Muni as a captain of a ship, guiding Yudhishthira who is lost and seeking direction, emphasizing Narada's role as a guide.

palace of Yudhishthira and as soon as Narada came Yudhishthira began to inquire from Narada and he explained that my uncles and aunt have gone, I do not know where they have gone, kindly tell me what should I do now. So Yudhishthira is describing Narada as a captain of a ship in a great ocean. In this analogy is very important for us to understand that if somebody is, I'm going in a ship and is in the middle of the coast, the ocean, if every side they look they'll only see water, they'll see only water, there'll be no sight of any land in the middle of the great ocean, big ocean, there will be no sight of any land. Then only the captain who knows how to navigate the ship based on, of course nowadays they have modern equipment, but formerly they used to have maps and using the maps and the compass, the direction which they should go, they would actually steer the ship in the ocean and take it from one place where they start, shore of the ocean, one particular landmark to another particular landmark to another country or another place in the other side of the ocean. So only a captain who's experienced, who has got these maps, who knows how to use the maps to steer the ship, only such a person can help the to reach the destination, the designated place they are supposed to go, they wish to go, they desire to go.

Similarly, Yudhishthira is now lost. He doesn't know where his uncle and aunt are. But Narada Muni is actually a great philosopher devotee as it will be explained in the, as it is mentioned here. Narada Munisattamaha, he is the greatest among the philosopher devotees. So he is like a captain of a ship in the great ocean. And Yudhishthira Maharaj is requesting Narada, you please direct us to our destination. And when Devarshi Narada, the greatest of the philosopher devotees, the godly personality, he is the greatest of the devotees, pure devotees. And he is also a philosopher, he is also a great personality, the greatest of the personalities, such personalities. And when Narada is addressed by Yudhishthira, he began to speak.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "There are different types of philosophers and the greatest of all of them are those who have seen the personality of Godhead and have surrendered themselves in the transcendental loving service of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Srila Prabhupada's explanation of Narada Muni, emphasizing the importance of seeing the Supreme Lord, becoming spiritually situated, and surrendering in loving service.

And that will come in the next few verses. So in the purport Srila Prabhupada says something about Narada. There are different types of philosophers and the greatest of all of them are those who have seen the personality of Godhead and have surrendered themselves in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. And to see the Supreme Lord is not an ordinary thing. The Lord is completely spiritual. And not only is he a spiritual personality, but he is also the unlimited Supreme personality. So one has to first of all become spiritually situated to be able to see or perceive or realize what is spirit. And then go beyond this, beyond perceiving spirit, to be able to perceive or see the Supreme Spirit, the unlimited Supreme Lord. Both of these are distinct qualifications. It's not that anybody and everybody can just either see spirit or ultimately be able to see even the Supreme Spirit. That is the personality of Godhead. And after seeing the Supreme Lord, one has to surrender in transcendental loving service. This is what Krishna explains in the Bhagavad Gita.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This surrender is not for any material purpose. It is not for any other purpose other than to render loving devotional service to the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes the Bhagavad Gita and explains the process of surrendering to the Supreme Lord in transcendental loving service, highlighting Narada Muni as an example.

This is what Krishna explains in the Bhagavad Gita. He says, tad viddhi pranipatena pariprasnena sevaya upadekshanti te jnanam jnaninah tatva-darshinah. Tatva-darshinah means one who has seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And jnaninah, one is full of knowledge about who is the Supreme Lord and what is the relationship, what is the relationship of everyone with the Supreme Lord, and how one can situate himself or herself in the proper position of one's relationship by surrendering to the Supreme Lord in transcendental loving service. This surrender is not for any material purpose. It is not for any other purpose other than to render loving devotional service to the Lord. That is our actual constitutional position. So Narada Muni is one such personality who has seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is described in the earlier chapter how Narada had darshan of the Lord. Then he realized the Lord. Then he became situated as a totally surrendered devotee of the Lord. And after situating himself in that way, he is simply traveling and preaching to everyone to help them to get out of this material existence and reinstate themselves in their original position as pure devotee of the Supreme Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Narada Muni has come to help Yudhishthira and that Narada is the chief among devotees and a learned philosopher of Vedanta.

So Narada Muni has now come to actually help Yudhishthira understand the destination or the future of his uncles and aunt. So among all such pure devotees of the Lord, because Lord has many pure devotees like Narada, Devarishi Narada is the chief. Narada Munisattamaha. And therefore he has been described herein as the greatest of all philosopher devotees. Now even among devotees there are different kinds of devotees. So who is a philosopher devotee? That Prabhupada explains, unless one has become a sufficiently learned philosopher by hearing the Vedanta philosophy from a bona fide spiritual master, one cannot be a learned philosopher devotee. So to know the philosophy of Vedanta. Vedanta means the conclusion of the Vedas. And what is the conclusion of the Vedas? Vedaischa sarvair ahameva vedyam. Krishna is the goal of all Vedas, Vedic knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "Narada Muni is actually the proper qualified person to guide somebody like Yudhishtira."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to describe Narada Muni's qualifications as a guide, emphasizing his realization of Vedanta and his engagement in transcendental loving service, and the need for faith, learning, and renunciation to be a pure devotee.

So Narada is such a devotee who has become sufficiently learned philosopher by hearing the Vedanta philosophy from the Bhaktivedantas in his previous life. And he has become realized. He followed the instructions to realize that subject matter after hearing. And he had darshan of the Lord. And he became situated in his transcendental relationship as the pure devotee engaged in transcendental loving service of the Lord. So therefore Narada Muni is actually the proper qualified person to guide somebody like Yudhishtira. So Prabhupada says one must be very faithful, learned and renounced. Otherwise one cannot be a pure devotee. It's not possible to be a pure devotee unless one is very faithful. Bhakti begins with faith. And that faith has to be developed. And then one has to become learned in the science of Krishna consciousness, science of Bhakti. And one has to become renounced. Completely free from all material attachments. 100% pure. That's called 100% pure. Without these qualifications one cannot be a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord. And such a pure devotee is qualified to help anybody cross this ocean of ignorance and reach the destination of the shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by explaining Narada Muni's visits to the Pandavas and Yudhishthira's humility in seeking guidance from a Brahmana or pure devotee, despite being capable of knowing directly from the Lord.

And it is also explained here by Prabhupada Devarshi Narada used to visit the palace of the Pandavas because the Pandavas are pure devotees themselves. And Devarshi Narada used to visit them and was always ready to give them good counsel whenever needed. Of course, Yudhishthira as a pure devotee himself, he is capable of knowing from directly the Supreme Lord because he is always engaged in the service of the Lord. But he is playing the part of a Kshatriya who always seeks the direction of a Brahmana or a pure devotee saint, saintly person. So therefore he is enquiring from Narada. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (1.13.41) and explains its basic meaning: Narada Muni consoles Yudhishthira by stating that everyone is under the control of the Supreme Lord.

In this session we will be discussing from the 41st verse of the 13th chapter of the 1st canto of Shri Madbhagavatam Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Narada Vacha Ma Kanchana Shucho Rajan Yadishvara Vasham Jagat Loka Sapala Yasyeme Vahanti Balim Eeshituhu Sa Samyunakti Bhutani Sa Eva Viyunakti Cha.

**Key Quote:** "Every living being either in this material world or in the spiritual world is under the control of the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of Krishna's supreme control, explaining that all beings, from Brahma to the smallest creature, are subject to His order.

So, Shri La Pravapada explains this very important point in the purport elaborately, what Narada Muni is telling as a reply to Yudhishthira. Yudhishthira is concerned, where are my uncles and aunt gone? So, Narada before directly telling where have they gone, he is first explaining the general principle, which all of us have to understand. Every living being either in this material world or in the spiritual world is under the control of the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead. Now, why is Krishna called the Supreme Lord? Because Lord means controller, and Supreme means he is the ultimate controller of everyone. So, he is completely controlling everyone in the material world and in the spiritual world. Universally, everywhere he is controlled. And Pravapada further clarifies this. Beginning from Brahmaji, the leader of this universe, down to the insignificant, all are abiding by the order of the Supreme Lord. Brahma is the first created being in this universe.

**Key Quote:** "It is only the devotees and the pious people, the followers of the Vedic injunctions or the scriptural directions given by God, only they are actually voluntarily following the order of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker distinguishes between voluntary obedience by devotees and forced obedience by others, emphasizing the subordinate position of all beings to the Supreme Lord.

There are millions of planets in each universe, and in each planet there are millions of living entities, all of them beginning from Brahma, the topmost living being in this universe, and down to the most insignificant creature, everyone is abiding by the order of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord's control is everywhere. And when it is said everyone is abiding by the order, not everyone is abiding by the order of the Lord voluntarily. It is only the devotees and the pious people, the followers of the Vedic injunctions or the scriptural directions given by God, only they are actually voluntarily following the order of the Supreme Lord. The others, demons, atheists, and agnostics, materialists, rebellious souls, all of them are forced to obey the order of the Supreme Lord. Thus, the constitutional position of the living being is subordination under the control of the Lord. Everyone is subordinate to the Lord. The Lord is the only supreme personality. He is the supreme master.

**Key Quote:** "The foolish living being, especially man artificially rebels against the law of the supreme God...and thus becomes chastised as an asura or law breaker"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that rebelling against God's law leads to suffering and punishment, comparing it to breaking earthly laws and facing consequences.

Everyone is under his control. Ekala, Ishvara, Krishna are Sababhrithya. This is explained in the Chaitanya Charitamatha. Krishna is the only Ishvara, only control, ultimately. And everyone else is under his control. Constitutional position means the way we are made, the way we are constituted, the way we are eternally, is that we're subordinate. And the way Krishna is ... what is Krishna's constitutional position? It is to always control, always be the master, the Lord, the supreme. And we are always subordinate, eternally we are subordinate to the supreme Lord Krishna. The foolish living being, especially man, artificially rebels against the law of the supreme God, the law of the supreme, and thus becomes chastised as an asura or law breaker. When laws are operating and there's an enforcing authority, anybody who breaks the law is immediately punished by the law enforcing authority, just like there is traffic police patrolling and anybody violates the traffic laws, immediately the traffic police will chastise, will actually stop the lawbreaker and correct the lawbreaker. So similarly, even in the whole creation there is the law of the supreme that is operating and anybody who rebels against the law is chastised, is punished by the supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "A living being is placed in a particular position by the order of the supreme lord and is again shifted from that place by the order of the supreme lord or his authorized agents"
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the question of how divine control manifests in practical experience, explaining that beings are placed in and removed from positions by the Lord or His agents, and provides examples of powerful figures throughout history who were ultimately under divine control.

Now, Sri La Prabhupada explains how does it work actually. In our practical experience, we don't see any God coming and chastising us. If at all we are chastised, it's by the lawmakers in our country or in our institutions. We don't see any God. Where is God? That's what an atheist or a law breaker may question in this way. So, Prabhupada says, a living being is placed in a particular position by the order of the Supreme Lord and is again shifted from that place by the order of the Supreme Lord or his authorized agents. We are all placed in some particular position and removed from that position by whom? By the order of Krishna or his authorized agents. So, Prabhupada lists some names by which you can get an idea what is the extent of the control of the Supreme Lord: Brahma, Shiva, Brahma and Shiva, the greatest of demigods in the entire creation, Indra, Chandra, they are also very powerful demigods but subordinate to Brahma and Shiva. Even they, Maharaj Yudhishthira, even Maharaj Yudhishthira, he is under the control of the Lord. Or in modern history, Napoleon, Akbar, Alexander, Gandhi, Subhash, and Nehru, all are servants of the Lord. All these names mentioned are powerful persons of the Lord. All these names mentioned are powerful persons of the Lord.

There is this kind of the Bhagavatam in the beginning in the first canto, first chapter, first words, swarat janma dhyasya tyaha anvayat itirthas chartheshu abhigya swarat. Swarat means Krishna is supremely completely independent. Even though such men or leaders rebel so as not to recognize the supremacy of the Lord, they are put under still more rigorous laws of the material world by different miseries. Why do miseries come? They are enforcement of the authority of the Supreme Lord on lawbreakers, on rebellious souls. It is only the rebellious souls who suffer.

**Key Quote:** "Whenever he suffers right from the time he is placed in the womb of a particular mother inside the womb he has suffered so much and he forgets that"
**Summary:** The speaker illustrates the pervasive nature of suffering, even from infancy, using the analogy of a baby suffering from an ant bite to show how past karma manifests.

It is only the rebellious souls who suffer. Nobody else who is fully obedient will have to suffer in this material world. Only the foolish man therefore says that there is no God. Foolish people, they say where is God? Who is God? There's no God. But the foolish man doesn't realize that who is imposing miseries upon him whenever he suffers, right from the time he is placed in the womb of a particular mother. Inside the womb he has suffered so much and he forgets that. Everyone who enters the womb of a particular mother, what suffering they undergo, they forget after they come out of the womb because they get some relief and they say better don't remember that traumatic experience, better forget it. And then through their growing up, childhood, as a child, so many different types of sufferings. Even the rich man's child, the most cared for child also has to suffer. Supposing there an ant biting a child in the diaper, then how does the child express itself to its mother or nurse or caretaker? We had the best of people taking care, but how does the child express? The child simply is helpless in expressing. It can only cry. Now when the child cries, the mother or the caretaker or the nurse cannot understand why the child is crying. Of course, the mother or child caretaker can make out the child is having some discomfort. Okay, they'll try to comfort the child. Maybe they'll think it's hungry so they'll try to feed it. So, feeding that will not stop the crying because the ant is biting in the diaper. And then they will try to make out the child is crying and then they will try to play with the child, try to give the child some air, maybe it's feeling suffocation or maybe it is feeling too cold, whatever different ways they speculate and try to comfort the child. But how will they understand the child is crying specifically because an ant is biting in the diaper? How will they figure that? They cannot. So this is a misery that

**Key Quote:** "Intelligent people simply understand that we have to surrender to Krishna the supreme lord and we have to abide by his laws orders and pray to him to get out of this entanglement of material existence"
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of surrendering to Krishna as the only way to overcome the laws of material nature and escape suffering, referencing a verse from the Bhagavad-gita about the difficulty of transcending Maya without surrender.

the child has to suffer because of its own past misdeeds, own past misdeeds and it's not very easy for the child to get relief from that. So only till that quota of suffering is given to that living entity in that situation, in that circumstance, till then it has to suffer. It has to cry and cry and cry and cry and then by the will of the Lord somehow they will figure out. Let's say it passes urine then to change the diaper. When they remove the diaper, oh they'll see, oh there was a, they may or may not notice anyway with the diaper being removed and disposed the ant is also gone, the child gets relief or they notice the ant and then they understand the cause and then they remove that ant. So like that it is, even those who are cared for by different material methods, there is no guarantee of freedom from miseries, even those who are cared for. So therefore this world, everybody is by the Lord, everybody is placed in a particular position and removed from that position by the will of the Lord, by his superior arrangement and those are called the laws of God and everybody is forced to abide by the laws. So intelligent people simply understand that we have to surrender to Krishna, the Supreme Lord and we have to abide by his laws, orders and pray to him to get out of this entanglement of material existence. Only he can help us cross over this ocean of material existence. Daivihesha gunamayi mamma maya duratyaya ma mevaye prapadyante maya metham tarantite. In simple one verse, in a simple way Krishna says in the Bhagavad-gita, you cannot overcome the stringent laws this material nature which are the laws of Krishna only simply by your own methods and arrangements and intelligence and and and and all kinds of remedies, you cannot. But if you surrender to Krishna, Krishna will easily help you to cross over and that is what will be explained by Narada.

**Key Quote:** "Narad Muni is explaining how we are all controlled by the Supreme Lord through the Vedic injunctions."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (1.13.42) and explains that it discusses how all beings are controlled by the Supreme Lord through Vedic injunctions.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 42nd verse of the 13th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Yatha Gavo Nasiprotha Tantyam Baddhashchadamabhi Vaktantyam Namabhir Baddha Vahanti Balim Eeshituhu. The meaning of this verse is: As a cow bound through the nose by a long rope is conditioned, so also human beings are bound by different Vedic injunctions and are conditioned to obey the orders of the Supreme. Narad Muni is explaining how we are all controlled by the Supreme Lord

**Key Quote:** "Every living being whether a man or an animal or a bird thinks that he is free by himself but actually no one is free from the severe laws of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Prabhupada's explanation, contrasting the severity and inescapability of God's laws with the fallibility of man-made laws.

through the Vedic injunctions. Now how does it work? Prabhupada explains this in the purport. Every living being, whether a man or an animal or a bird, thinks that he is free by himself, but actually no one is free from the severe laws of the Lord. This is the reality. This is the truth. Nobody is free. Nobody is independent. The laws of the Lord are said to be severe because they cannot be disobeyed in any circumstance. The man-made laws may be evaded by cunning outlaws, but in the codes of the Supreme Lawmaker, there is not the slightest possibility of neglecting the laws. So, Prabhupada is helping us distinguish between man-made laws, however stringently enforced or however powerful the garment may be, or the law enforcing mechanism. There is a difference. Man-made laws are possible to be evaded by somebody who is cunning or more intelligent or is more powerful than the enforcing authority itself. That is possible. But in the codes of the Supreme, the Supreme Lawmaker, there is not the slightest possibility of neglecting the laws.

Krishna's laws nobody can neglect or evade or avoid. That is not possible. A slight change in the course of God-made law can bring about a massive danger to be faced by the law-breaker. We have experienced one, tsunami, and even the most powerful persons in this earth planet we are living in. When they have to face such calamities, natural calamities, then there is no question of anybody being powerful, or wealthy, or influential, or well-protected by some material arrangement. All that doesn't work. None of those things work. Such laws of the Supreme are generally known as the codes of religion

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the core principle of all authentic religions is obedience to the Supreme God, leading to protection.

under different conditions. Codes of religion. God and God's laws as codes of religion, religious principles. But one should not think, oh, there are so many different religions, and so many different scriptures. So, is there any commonality? Prabhupada says, but the principle of religion everywhere is one and the same. What is that one and the same principle of religion? Namely, obey the orders of the Supreme God, that is the codes of religion. Every scripture describes this. Authentic, bona fide scriptures we are talking about. We are not talking about some concocted religious systems. No. The authorized religious systems, they are given for the human beings to obey the laws of God, and thereby be under the proper protection, and safe protection of the Supreme Lord only. That is the condition of material existence. Material existence means, we have to obey the codes of religion, which is the orders of the Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "All living beings in the material world have taken up the risk of conditioned life by their own selection."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that living beings in the material world have chosen a conditioned life and are not in complete control of their bodies, which are governed by material nature.

All living beings in the material world have taken up the risk of conditioned life by their own selection. Now, how is it that somebody comes under a particular set of laws? In this material world, the creation itself is made like that. For example, this body that I have got, I think that I am the controller of my body. But actually the reality is, I am not the real ultimate controller of the body. Though I have some degree of control, like I can lift my hand, okay, that is given to you, that control is given to you, limited control is given to you. I can digest the food I eat normally. But if I eat something which cannot be digested, or if I overeat, then I have to suffer indigestion, the consequences of indigestion. So, where is my control? Can I digest anything and everything, and whatever quantity I eat? No. So, can I keep on working without taking rest when the body becomes fatigued? No. When there is an infection that attacks me, then some germs invade my body, then I have to suffer the consequences of that infection unless it is treated. I cannot be living a normal, healthy life. I have to suffer the symptoms of that infection. So, like that, we are not ultimately under complete control of our body. Our body actually is controlled. It is controlled by material nature who is the agency of God's control in this material world, through this material body.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "We are taking up the risk of conditioned life by our own selection, because we want to enjoy."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how the material body is a vehicle for punishment due to the desire for concocted enjoyment and violation of God's laws, leading to entrapment in material nature.

Now, who doesn't have a material body? Every created being has a material body. Every created being. Brahma, beginning from Brahma, the first created being, the topmost devata, up to the insignificant creatures, everyone has a material body. We don't have any suffering. There is no connection between the material body and the soul except that this body is given to us simply because we desire some concocted enjoyment. And we violate the laws and we are also given the punishment through this body only, by the agency of God, called material nature, Durga Devi. So, we are taking up the risk of conditioned life by our own selection, because we want to enjoy. We violate the laws and we come under the enforcement, law enforcement authority, forcing us to accept this body, so that we will be given suitable punishment through this body. We thus become entrapped by the laws of material nature. We are trapped, because even a slight violation, we have to suffer the consequences of that violation.

**Key Quote:** "The only way to get out of the entanglement is to agree to obey the Supreme."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the concept of spiritual intelligence as the key to understanding and escaping material entanglement through obedience to the Supreme Lord and spiritual practices.

The only way to get out of the entanglement is to agree to obey the Supreme. Actually, it is very simple. How do I get out of this entanglement? First of all, to understand that I am entangled itself requires some a particular type of intelligence. It is called spiritual intelligence. It is different from material intelligence. Please try to understand this point. Material intelligence is for ordinary material subject matters. But spiritual intelligence is something else. It is only possible to exercise our spirit. Everybody has got spiritual intelligence because it is spirit soul. Everyone, every living being is spirit soul. But that spiritual intelligence is awakened and it is trained up to be utilized by spiritual instruction, by spiritual practice, by spiritual master, by spiritual direction given in the scriptures. So only that can awaken our spiritual intelligence.

**Key Quote:** "As long as one is spiritually ignorant, it doesn't matter what is their material situation or material position."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts spiritually ignorant people, who deny God and suffer, with devotees who have awakened their spiritual intelligence and understand God's hand in everything.

Spiritual intelligence is different. Like foolish people. Foolish people means they say there is no God. I don't believe in religion. Such foolish people, they don't, they are unable to awaken their spiritual intelligence because they don't follow the scriptural directions. They don't have any spiritual practices. They don't obey the order of the Supreme Lord. And so therefore they have to suffer. They suffer in ignorance, spiritual ignorance. They might be materially very qualified or unqualified. It doesn't matter. As long as one is spiritually ignorant, it doesn't matter what is their material situation or material position. Whether they are wealthy or they are poor. Whether they are old or young. Whether they are powerful or not so powerful. Materially, whatever their situation, if they are spiritually ignorant, they have to suffer. Suffer in ignorance. Because they violate and they don't awaken their spiritual intelligence. Those who have awakened their spiritual intelligence by properly following the laws of God. They are the wisest people in the whole creation. They are called devotees of the Supreme Lord. And very easily they understand how the laws are working. They are able to see the hand of God in every action they do. Everywhere. Everyone is under the control of God. So this requires spiritual intelligence to be able to understand, to be able to perceive, to be able to actually make a make a very intelligent decision. How to get out of this forced suffering. So, it is to agree to obey the Supreme Lord.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Surrender to the Supreme Lord and agree to abide by His orders is the way to get out."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by discussing how material designations bind us and reiterates that surrender and obedience to the Supreme Lord are the path to liberation, ending with Hare Krishna.

But instead of becoming free from the clutches of Maya or illusion, foolish human beings become bound up by different nomenclatures being designated as Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra, Hindus, Mohammedans, Indians, Europeans, and many other designations like this. And thus they carry out the orders of the Supreme Lord under the influence with respect to scriptural or legislative injunctions. See these material designations. Upadhi. Everybody has got Upadhi. I am this, I am that. Beginning with I am the body. And later on the body becomes decorated with different titles. Somebody studies in a university and acquires degrees like Ph.D. or M.A. or whatever the university titles are. Or somebody becomes qualified as a doctor or a lawyer or a prime minister is elected or has won the popular vote and is in a very powerful position as the leader of a big nation. So, the leader of a big nation, great nation or even the post of a devata much higher. Indra, Chandra, Varuna, Vayu, all powerful controllers. You can imagine the control of the wind which is blowing all over the universe. Very powerful position. But even He is subject to the laws of God in this material world. So, surrender to the Supreme Lord and agree to abide by His orders is the way to get out. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the context of Narada Muni's words, explaining that he is first laying out general principles before addressing Yudhishthira's specific concerns about his uncles.

These are words spoken by Narada Muni. He is explaining to Yudhishthira when Yudhishthira questioned Narada Muni that I do not know where my uncles have gone away. You are like the captain of the ship. So you please guide us to our destination. So then Narada is, first of all, explaining the important principles by which this world is working, and then he will come to the actual facts about the uncles of Yudhishthira, both Vidura and Dhritarashtra, as well as Gandhari, where have they gone. That he will tell later, but first of all, he explains the general principles which is very much helpful for all of us to understand the facts about our existence in this material world. So in this verse, Narada is telling, the supreme will of the Lord brings men together and separates

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding that our current situation is a result of our past actions and that we are responsible for our actions under the laws of karma, which apply to all living beings, especially humans.

them; both are due to the supreme will of the Lord. But how does it actually work? Some details are given by Srila Prabhupada in the purport. We must know for certain. We need to know that the particular position in which we are now set up is an arrangement of the supreme will in terms of our own acts in the past. So we have to consider the supreme will of the supreme Lord and also our own actions in the past. So it is not just the Lord alone who decides everything independently, there is also the consideration of our own actions in the past. What kind of actions? Our material activities in the past. We are held responsible for every action of ours, especially as human beings. So this we should not forget. If we don't act responsibly, we'll have to pay the price for irresponsibly acting because we are under the laws of the Supreme Lord God. These are called the laws of karma. So every action we are accountable, whether the state laws may or may not consider the consequence of every action of ours. The state laws work within the framework of some constitutional laws for people who are called citizens of this country. But the laws of karma are not responsible for our actions. The laws of God are working for every living being.

### Paramatma, witness, sanction, karma

**Verse References:** BG 13.23
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Supreme Lord is present as the localized Paramatma in the heart of every living being"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the role of the Paramatma (Super Soul) as the witness and sanctioner of our actions, citing Bhagavad Gita (13.23), and how this relates to the reactions we receive for our past deeds.

And especially the human being is held responsible for every action of his. Srila Prabhupada further explains, the Supreme Lord is present as the localized Paramatma in the heart of every living being, as it is said in the Bhagavad Gita in the 13th chapter in the 23rd verse: Upadrishta anumanam. Svaramanta bharata bhoktamaheswaraha. Paramatmeti capyukto dehesmin purushapparaah. Krishna is explaining, there is another transcendental enjoyer in this body apart from the living being who is a subordinate enjoyer, there is a transcendental enjoyer, he is called Paramatma, the Super Soul. Srila Prabhupada further explains, and he is the witnesser of every action of ours and he is the sanctioner of every action, both the witnesser and sanctioner. He is a supreme lord, he is a supreme controller, he is a supreme proprietor, Maheshwara Bharta, he is a supreme enjoyer, he is a supreme maintainer, supreme provider. Therefore, Srila Prabhupada says he knows everything of our activities in every stage of our lives. He knows the past, present and future. Vedaham Samatitani Vartamanani Charjuna Bhavishyani Chabhutani Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, I know the past, present and future of every living being, and this is a fact. So because he knows, he rewards the reactions of our actions by placing us in some particular place. So if I am in my whatever position, born in a particular family with certain circumstances, with certain facilities, with certain amount of life, with certain knowledge or intelligence or wealth, material knowledge I am talking about, material wealth, material intelligence, that is the reward of the Paramatma

**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of a rich man's son born with a silver spoon to illustrate how the Paramatma guides living beings according to their karma and desires, and how both coming together and separation are governed by the Lord's will.

for my past actions. So Srila Prabhupada gives an example, a rich man gets his son born with a silver spoon in his mouth, but the child who came as the rich man's son deserved such a place and therefore he is placed there by the will of the Lord. Every one of us is spirit soul and we have got our reactions from the past. So the Lord places, as Paramatma, he guides every living being, every living being and particularly the human being is guided every moment for every action according to the will of the Lord, to what he deserves and what he desires, both are taken into account, and at a particular moment when the child has to be removed from that place, he is also carried by the will of the Supreme, even the child or the father does not wish to be separated from the happy relation. So we come together in a family or in a society, in a community, in a workplace, in a family, in a country, in a foreign place even, or even in heavenly planets, we come together by the will of the Lord according to our karma and we are separated also by the will of the Lord again according to our karma.

The same thing happens in the case of a poor man also. It is not just a rich man alone. It's working in everybody's case. Neither rich man nor poor man has any control over such meetings or separations of living beings. The example of a player and his playthings should not be misunderstood. Narad Muni is giving the example just like a player. He sets up different things, and according to his sweet will, he sets it up and he dismantles it whenever he likes, the way he likes.

**Key Quote:** "But we should not think that the Lord is completely bound up to reward each of our reactions that is not true generally the Lord will give us our reactions which is due to us but he may at his own will he may change"
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that while the Lord generally awards reactions according to karma, He is not bound by it and can change the reactions at His will, contrasting this with the Karma Mimamsa philosophy.

So, this should not be misunderstood. How to understand this example properly? Srila Prabhupada says here, one may argue that since the Lord is bound to avoid the reactionary results of our own actions, the example of a player, player cannot be applied because earlier Prabhupada is mentioned according to our reactions the Lord is giving us a certain placing us in a certain position, but we should not think that the Lord is completely bound up to reward each of our reactions, that is not true. Generally the Lord will give us our reactions which is due to us, but he may at his own will, he may change that also. The karma mimamsa philosophy says that even if there is God, everyone will have to get their own reactions of their past actions, so the karma mimamsa philosophers say we don't have to bother about God, which is a wrong

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that the Lord is not bound by the law of karma and can change resultant actions, especially for devotees who have surrendered to Krishna.

philosophy. While it is true that people in general get the reactions of their own past actions according to the body they have got, but still the Supreme Lord always reserves the ultimate sanction of such reactions moment to moment, and in specific cases the Supreme Lord can change the reactions which are due, especially Prabhupada explains that in the case of a devotee who has surrendered to Krishna. So Shri la Prabhupada explains how does it work in the case of a devotee. We must always remember that the Lord is a supreme will and he is not bound by any law. He is not bound by law, we are bound up, he is not bound by any law. Generally the law of karma is that one is awarded to the Lord itself when we are specific about the duty of God who has made us that way, we are bound up and we should not get bound by any law. Generally the law of karma is that one is awarded to the Supreme Lord and the Lord is not bound by any law, we are bound up the result of one's own actions, but in special cases by the will of the Lord such resultant actions are chained also. So when is it changed? This change can be affected by the will of the Lord only and no other. Only the Lord can change if he wants to, not otherwise. Therefore, the example of the player cited in this verse is quite appropriate for the supreme will. He is absolutely free to do

**Key Quote:** "The Lord is particularly concerned about protecting the pure devotee in all circumstances in all conditions even in this material world"
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the Lord's special concern for protecting pure devotees who have surrendered to Him, and that the Lord is transcendent to all laws.

whatever he likes, and because he is all perfect, there is no mistake in any of his actions or reactions, the supreme law to the supreme perfect being. Therefore, there is no question of any mistake in any of his actions, absolutely no mistakes. These changes of resultant actions are especially rendered by the Lord when a pure devotee is involved. See, when a pure devotee is involved, the Lord is particularly concerned about protecting the pure devotee in all circumstances, in all conditions, even in this material world. So the Lord is neutral as far as non-devotees are concerned according to the divine law because the reactions are actually given to each living being who is an art devotee, but for a pure devotee the Lord intervenes according to his own sweet will. It is assured in the Bhagavad-Gita that the Lord saves a pure devotee who surrendered unto him without reservation from all sorts of reactions of sins and there is no doubt about this. So the Lord is able to change the reactions of one's past deeds if the person in question happens to be a pure devotee. So if he can change for a pure devotee, then he himself is not bound by any laws, himself is not bound, he is perfect and transcendent to all laws.

**Key Quote:** "Bhagavatam, and the followers of the Bhagavata philosophy, the pure devotees, they give the perfect understanding based on the complete knowledge about the reality."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains that the Bhagavatam and its followers offer a perfect understanding of reality based on complete knowledge, unlike other philosophers.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 44th verse of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. यन मन्यसे ध्रुवं लोकं अध्रुवं वा नचो भयं सर्वथा नही शोच्चास्ते स्नेहाद अन्यत्र मोहजात The meaning of this verse is, O King, in all circumstances, whether you consider the soul to be an eternal principle, or the material body to be perishable, or everything to exist in the impersonal absolute truth, or everything to be an inexplicable combination of matter and spirit, feelings of separation are due only to illusory affection and nothing more. A technical verse, and it explains perfectly the philosophy of Krishna Kaalabhata, as the perfect explanation of the reality of the truth in this world. About what is this world, or who we are, or what is actually going on, the basis for things to take place in this world. Different philosophers have different theories. Now, the Bhagavatam, and the followers of the Bhagavata philosophy, the pure devotees, they give the perfect understanding based on the complete knowledge about the reality.

**Key Quote:** "Just like the materialists do not know anything about the soul. If they don't know anything about the soul, then they do not know anything about the supreme soul either."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the Bhagavata understanding with that of materialists, who are ignorant of the soul and the Supreme Soul, and discusses the understanding of matter and its elements.

Because the other philosophers are not able to see the complete reality. They are ignorant about certain facts, or certain facets of reality. Just like the materialists do not know anything about the soul. If they don't know anything about the soul, then they do not know anything about the supreme soul either. So, they don't take spiritual reality into consideration, which is always in the background of the material reality. Even the material reality, different philosophers have different degrees of understanding. Different philosophies have different degrees of understanding. Different philosophies are different. Different religions have different degrees of understanding. Different religions have different degrees of understanding of what is matter. Some people do not even know that matter means the five elements, gross matter, consists of five elements combined in different proportions. It consists of five elements combined in different proportions, and it comes into existence by the combination of the five elements in different proportions when it is created. It remains for some time, and then it is separated again back to the five elements. This is what is going on as far as all the material objects are concerned. And this is happening not by any person's endeavor, but by the actions and reactions of the material modes of nature.

**Key Quote:** "Feelings of separation, which any two people experience who are separated, are only due to illusory affection."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the main point of the verse, stating that feelings of separation are due to illusory affection.

This reality is not known to the modern day scientists. They don't even know what are these five elements. So, here, Naramuni is presenting the fact that whatever be one's understanding of the present reality, feelings of separation, which any two people experience who are separated, are only due to illusory affection. So, here, Naramuni is presenting the fact that whatever be one's understanding of the present reality, feelings of separation, which any two people experience who are separated, are only due to illusory affection. So, here, Naramuni is presenting the fact that whatever be one's understanding of the present reality, feelings of separation, are only due to illusory affection. We have an affection for some of our near and dear ones, and when we are separated from somebody whom we have got an affectionate relationship, we feel the pangs of separation, and we desire that we again are able to come together and stay as well-wishers of each other.

### soul, eternal principle, material body, Supreme Lord

**Key Quote:** "The soul to be an eternal principle is a fact but that is not the only eternal principle that is there in this world there is a higher eternal principle of the absolute eternal principle that is the Supreme Lord Krishna above both this tiny spirits souls and matter itself for the material creation itself beyond both."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the first philosophical viewpoint: the soul as an eternal principle, contrasting it with the Supreme Lord Krishna, who is above both the soul and matter.

The Maya that is working in this world, so what are the different philosophies? Just to cite the different philosophers mentioned here by Naramuni, four kinds of philosophies are mentioned in our verse. So, the first philosophy he mentions is those who say the soul to be an eternal principle. I am spirit soul, you are spirit soul, every living being is spirit soul, and as spirit soul, we are all eternal beings. We don't die, we don't take birth, we don't deteriorate as soul. Soul has no deterioration. The wonderful qualities and properties of the soul are described in the second chapter of the Bhagavad Gita by Lord Krishna. So there it is clearly said, cannot be burned by fire, cannot be withered by the wind, cannot be destroyed by any of the different kinds of weapons, is not subject to birth and death. It is only the body which is born, which undergoes changes, six kinds of changes, shad vikara: birth, growth, sustenance, producing by-products, dwindling, and finally vanishing. These six changes apply to the body or any material object, but it doesn't apply to the spirit soul. So, the soul to be an eternal principle is a fact, but that is not the only eternal principle that is there in this world. There is a higher eternal principle of the absolute eternal principle, that is the Supreme Lord Krishna, above both these tiny spirit souls and matter itself. For the material creation itself, a material world itself, beyond both. The controller of both, the absolute controller, the ultimate controller is Krishna.

### material body, perishable, atheism, rebirth, soul

**Key Quote:** "It is a fact that this body is perishable. But the body we are going to get next, after we quit this body, when it becomes no longer habitable, then we have to actually enter another body, forced to enter, and suffer in that body, undergo experiences in that body, whether we like it or not."
**Summary:** The speaker presents the second philosophical viewpoint: the material body as perishable, referencing the atheist Charvak Muni, and refutes it by emphasizing the soul's transmigration and rebirth.

So this is just one aspect of the truth or the reality, the soul to be an eternal principle. Another theory says, a philosopher says, the material body is perishable. Many times even materialists say that, after all this body we are not going to have forever. So, why should we be so much worried about next life? One atheist by name Charvak Muni, he has said in the past, millions of years ago he has said, that this body is going to turn into ashes because ultimately according to our tradition, we either burn the body or bury the body or leave it for vultures to eat. It is going to be ultimately perish. So when the body is going to perish, where is the question of taking birth again? Now this is a philosophy which does not take into consideration within the body there is a spirit soul which is eternal. That Charvak Muni is not able to figure out. He is like the modern day materialist, materialistic scientist that, after all, who are we? This body. So this body is, as long as it is there, enjoy life. Don't bother about God and life after death and all that. Don't bother about all that. So this is the hedonistic philosophy, atheistic philosophy, Charvak philosophy. So body is perishable. It is a fact that this body is perishable, but the body we are going to get next, after we quit this body, when it becomes no longer habitable, then we have to actually enter another body, forced to enter, and suffer in that body, undergo experiences in that body, whether we like it or not. So that Charvak Muni has no understanding. Neither the materialistic persons understand that. Change of body at death. By whom? By the person inside this body. The body is coming into existence and it's going to remain for some time, undergo some changes, and it's going to perish. Yes. But what about the person inside the body? The experiencer. The resident of the body. Dehi and Deha. This fundamental differentiation is made in the Bhagavad Gita in the beginning.

**Key Quote:** "Everything is existing in the impersonal absolute truth... Try to understand matter is illusory. And, you are that impersonal absolute truth. And, you have to aim for liberation from this material bondage by developing detachment and becoming one with the supreme impersonal absolute."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the third philosophical viewpoint: everything existing in the impersonal absolute truth (Mayavada philosophy), where matter is considered illusory and liberation is achieved through detachment.

Then, another philosophy says, everything is existing in the impersonal absolute truth. The Mayavadis. They say, there is only one impersonal Brahman, and we are all that impersonal Brahman. This matter is simply some illusory thing. That's all. It is there today. It is not there tomorrow. At the most, it will last till Pralaya. So, don't bother about this body. Don't take into consideration anything about matter. Try to understand matter is illusory, and you are that impersonal absolute truth, and you have to aim for liberation from this material bondage by developing detachment and becoming one with the supreme impersonal absolute. So, this is the Mayavada philosophy that Narad Muni is mentioning here. And, yet another philosophy is, everything to be an inexplicable combination of matter and spirit.

**Key Quote:** "Whatever be your philosophical understanding, Narab Muni says the truth you have to remember is that feelings of separation is only due to illusory affection. That's all."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the fourth philosophical viewpoint: everything as an inexplicable combination of matter and spirit, acknowledging the distinct difference between living beings and dead matter, and concludes by reiterating that feelings of separation are due to illusory affection.

There are some philosophers who say there is something called spirit and something called matter. Two things are there, because they understand there is a distinct difference between a living person and dead matter, whether it is a dead body or dead object like a table. There is a distinct difference, and this difference always exists. Always exists. Living body is never the same as a dead matter, and dead matter can never be showing any living symptoms. Though sometimes people claim that even in dead matter we can see some life symptoms, actually, it never is possible. There is a distinct difference between living person in this world I am talking and dead matter. There is always difference. So, they say ultimately there is some kind of combination of matter and spirit, because matter they recognize as completely different from the living person, and living person, they kind of say is something spirit, which is not matter, which is not just dead matter. So, somehow they think there is some combination of the two, because we have got in this body hair and nails which is like dead matter. So, how is hair which is when you cut the hair you don't feel any pain, and that hair is it is just like matter. So, but, the hairs as long as it is attached to this body it keeps growing. So, what about that? Under certain conditions. So, some combination of matter and spirit. That's all. Don't break your head about it. That's all it is. We cannot understand beyond that. Some philosophers say like that. So, whatever be your philosophical understanding, Narab Muni says the truth you have to remember is that feelings of separation is only due to illusory affection. That's all.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "All feelings of separation are due to illusory affection."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains the meaning of Srimad Bhagavatam 1.13.45, emphasizing detachment from illusory affection and understanding the supreme control of the Lord.

In this session we will be discussing from the 45th verse of the 13th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. तस्माद् जह्यंग वैक्लव्यं अज्ञानक् कृतमात्मनः कथम् तू अनाथा कृपणा वर्तेरं स्तेच माम् विना The meaning of this 45th verse is, "Therefore give up your anxiety due to ignorance of the self. You are now thinking of how they who are helpless poor creatures will exist without you." So now Narada Muni is coming to the point that he explained in the previous verse. All feelings of separation are due to illusory affection. Then the conclusion now is being drawn after explaining the philosophy, the truth, the reality, that give up your anxiety which is due to ignorance of the self. So you are not considering the fact that you, your uncles, your aunt and everybody for that matter is spirit soul and are controlled by, their movements are controlled by the supreme will according to their own past actions. And now you are thinking, even though you know that, you might be aware that supreme lord ultimate is a controller, but you're thinking, "How will they exist without your help? Because they have become old, they are helpless." That's your anxiety now. But give up your anxiety to the self. Give up that anxiety. And why he has to give up that anxiety, that he'll explain the next verse.

**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing that while we should perform our duties, ultimate protection comes from the Supreme Lord.

But Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, a brief purport, "When we think of our kit and kin as being helpless and dependent on us, it is all due to ignorance." Why is Prabhupada saying this? Because every living creature is allowed all protection by the order of the supreme lord in terms of each one's action. A quiet position in the world, how much protection each person can have at any given time is dependent on the position in which one is placed by the Lord, and the important point is to remember always the Lord is known as Buddha breath, means he is the one who gives protection to all living beings, he is not partial, he is impartial and is the only one who protects each and every living being. So therefore understanding that there is the supreme control of the Supreme Lord and everybody is protected by the Lord, one should discharge his duties only. Does it mean the Supreme Lord is everybody's controller so why should I bother to protect my children or why should I bother to give any protection to the people who are dependent on the Lord? No, that is not correct. We have to do our duty in the position in which we are placed presently. If I am in the position of a father I have to do father's duties towards the children, if I am in the position of a husband I have to do husband's duty, if somebody else is in the position of a mother such a mother has to do her duty towards her children. So everybody has to do their duties and always remember no one but the Supreme Lord can give protection to anyone else. You do your duties and depend on the Supreme Lord for protect your protection, for the protection of your children, the protection of your beloved loved ones, everybody you depend on the Lord for protection, this is the perfect understanding as regards to the...

**Key Quote:** "This gross material body made up of these five elements is already under the control of three different things: eternal time, action, and the three moments."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami introduces the next verse (SB 1.13.46) and explains how the material body is controlled by eternal time (kala), karma, and the three modes of material nature (guna).

Now how the Lord gives protection and how we have to simply discharge our duties is explained very nicely in the next verse. The next verse, forty-sixth verse is, काल कर्म गुणाधीनो देहोयं पांच भवतिकह कथम अञ्याम्स्तु गोपायेत सर्पग्रस्तो यथापरम। This is a very important verse. The meaning of this verse, "This gross material body made up of these five elements is already under the control of three different things." What is that? It is already under control of eternal time, that is काला, under the control of कर्म or action, and under the control of गुणा or the three moments. The three moments of material nature, काला, कर्म, गुणा, eternal time, action, and the material moments. How then can it being already in the jaws of the serpent protect others? काला is also called काल सर्पा because time brings about death. As we all know, it is just a question of time. Somebody may die now, somebody may die some few hours later, somebody may die a few years later, somebody may die at the end of the duration of this universe, but काला is going to ensure death for everybody. So, everybody is under the clutches of काला. So, how can you... how can you avoid that particular death which is going to come? You cannot protect. Everybody is under काला.

### freedom, control of material nature, modes of nature

**Key Quote:** "The world's movements for freedom through political, economic, social, and cultural propaganda can do no benefit to anyone because everyone is controlled by the superior power."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, stating that true freedom is not possible through material means because everyone is controlled by material nature and the modes of nature.

So, Srila Prabhupāda explains in the purport, "The world's movements for freedom through political, economic, social, and cultural propaganda can do no benefit to anyone." This so-called freedom is actually really not beneficial. Why? Because everyone is controlled by the superior power. So, who can go against the supreme will of the Supreme Lord that is operating in this material world? No one can do it. A conditioned living being is under the full control of material nature. Conditioned means those who are under the laws of karma. So, everyone is under the laws of karma, except pure devotees, who are transcendental to the laws of karma, because of being directly under the Supreme Lord's internal potency, the spiritual potency, Yoga, Maya. So, except for them, everyone else is under the full control of material nature. Everyone else is a conditioned living being, full control of material nature. Control of material nature means it is represented by three things. Control of material nature means it is represented by eternal time. It is represented by activities under the direction of the material modes of nature, which are always working in this world. So, there are three material modes of nature, namely, goodness, passion, ignorance. Goodness means the sattva guna. Passion means rajo guna. Ignorance means tamo guna. Unless one is situated in the mode of goodness, or sattva guna, one cannot see things as they are. So, Prabhupada says, "The passionate and the ignorant," that means the rajasic and tamasic people, "they cannot even see things as they are. They are unable to see this control of kala, karma, guna. They cannot see. They cannot perceive."

### modes of nature, guidance, bhakti yoga, kala

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Only the man in the quality of goodness can help to a certain extent... Only that is the only alternative for protection."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains that only those in the mode of goodness can guide others towards taking shelter of the Supreme Lord, and that bhakti yoga is the only way to escape the clutches of kala.

They cannot understand. Therefore, a person who is passionate and ignorant cannot direct his activities on the right path. So, rajasic and tamasic people, they can never be doing things right. They will always make mistakes and they will suffer. Only the man in the quality of goodness can help to a certain extent. So, a man in the quality of goodness can see things properly and can guide how one can actually take shelter of the supreme lord. Only. That is the only alternative for protection. There is no other alternative. Most persons are passionate and ignorant and therefore their plans and projects can hardly do any good to others. So many plans are there for protection, but they don't work the way somebody desires, because the supreme lord, the supreme will, is ultimately going to override all our plans. Above the modes of nature is eternal time, which is called kala, which is called kala because it changes the shape of everything in the material world. Kala is changing everything and that is forced change. It is not something which we can reverse or we can avoid, the influence of kala. Even if we are able to do something temporarily beneficial, time will see that the good project is frustrated in the course of time. Kala will ensure that. The destruction will come at the right time. For the time being we may say maintenance, or we may say protection, or we may say some safety, but ultimately there is no eternal safe position in this material world. No. So Srila Prabhupada says, "The only thing possible to be done is to get rid of eternal time kala, which is compared to kala sarpa or the cobra snake, whose bite is always lethal." Lethal means its constant. Lethal means its going to end our life in this body. So when death comes there is no remedy for avoiding death except bhakti yoga. That Prabhupada will explain. No one can be saved from the bite of a cobra. The best remedy for getting out of the clutches of cobra, like kala, or its integrity, the modes of nature.

**Key Quote:** "One who renders pure devotional service to Krishna, unfailing in all circumstances, transcends the modes of material nature, comes to the spiritual platform."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami quotes Bhagavad Gita 14.26, explaining that bhakti yoga is the only way to transcend the modes of material nature and become free from the effects of kala, karma, and guna.

Is bhakti yoga. And this is recommended in the Bhagavad Gita, in the 14th chapter, 26th verse. Maam chayo avyabhicharena, Bhakti yogena sevate, Sagunan samatityaitaan, Brahma bhuvaya ayakalpate. One who renders pure devotional service to Krishna, unfailing in all circumstances, transcends the modes of material nature, comes to the spiritual platform. On the spiritual platform one is immune to death and immune to the influence of kala, karma, guna, everything. One's actions become completely spiritual on the spiritual platform for those who are engaged in pure devotional service. So the highest perfectional project of philanthropic activities is to engage everyone in the act of preaching bhakti yoga all over the world. So you should practice bhakti yoga, pure devotional service, and you should preach this bhakti yoga to people who are not aware of bhakti yoga, and this alone can save the people from the control of maya or material nature, represented by kala, karma, and guna. So this is very, very clear. So we should practice bhakti while doing our duties. We should practice bhakti yoga and in that way become free from the effect of kala, karma, guna. I'll stop.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Very important law of material nature that's working universally is explained by Sri Narada Muni to Yudhishthira and to all of us."
**Summary:** This segment introduces the verse about one living being being food for another and addresses the common argument used to justify eating animals.

In this session, we will be discussing from the forty-seventh verse of the thirteenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Ahastāni sahastānām apadāni chatuṣpadām falgūṇī tatra mahatām jīvo jīvasya jīvanam. Very important verse. The meaning of this verse is: those who are devoid of hands are prey for those who have hands. Those devoid of legs are prey for the four-legged. The weak are the subsistence of the strong, and the general rule holds that one living being is food for another living being. So, a very important law of material nature that's working universally is explained by Sri Narada Muni to Yudhishthira and to all of us. Jīva jīvasya jīvanam. The food for our subsistence, according to the law of material nature, is that one living being is food for another. So, there are so many misunderstandings that are possible by simply considering, anyway, one living being is food for another. So what is wrong in killing animals for food? This is the argument many people will give. Those who are meat eaters, they give this argument. But that argument is wrong, as will be pointed out by Prabhupāda in the purport.

**Key Quote:** "The living beings who have come to this material world against the will of the supreme being are under the control of a supreme power called maya shakti, the deputed agent of the lord"
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of purports for understanding scripture, introduces the concept of Maya Shakti, and explains how the law of 'the weak are the subsistence of the strong' is one of the threefold miseries.

Purports are important because they help us understand in the proper way the particular statement of the scripture. What Narada Muni is telling is definitely true. For our subsistence, we cannot eat dead objects. But we still have to use our good sense what kind of food we should, we are permitted to take in terms of jīva jīvasya jīvanam. So, Srila Prabhupāda says in the purport, "A systematic law of subsistence in the struggle for existence is there by the supreme will, and there is no escape for anyone by any amount of planning." So, you try to protect any poor helpless creature. Ultimately, when death comes, you cannot save the body. This is the law. The living beings who have come to this material world against the will of the supreme being are under the control of a supreme power called maya shakti, the deputed agent of the lord. The deputed agent of the lord is maya shakti. And this daivimaya, divine power, is meant to pinch the conditioned souls by threefold miseries, one of which is explained here in this verse. We are always under the threefold miseries, tapatraya, which is the one that is mentioned here, the weak are the subsistence of the strong.

**Key Quote:** "Although the law states that a human being must subsist on another living being, there is also the law of good sense. For the human being is meant to obey the laws of the scriptures."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the categories of strength, the importance of following scriptural laws, and the sinful reactions that arise from violating them.

No one is strong enough to protect himself from the power of the supreme being. And by the will of the lord, there are systematic categories of the weak, the stronger, and the strongest. All around you, you can see this. There is nothing to be lamented if a tiger eats a weaker animal. For its food, a tiger will kill another weaker animal and eat its flesh. Although the law states that a human being must subsist on another living being, there is also the law of good sense. For the human being is meant to obey the laws of the scriptures. For the human beings, there is something extra above the fundamental laws of jivo, jivasya, jivanam. We have to subsist on other living beings, but that doesn't mean that we violate the laws of the scriptures. So we have to live by eating some other living thing, but we also have to follow the laws of scriptures. That is the law of good sense for the human being. The human being is meant for self-realization. And for that purpose, he is not to eat anything which is not first offered to the lord. This is the law of scripture. It is explained in the Bhagavad Gita. Whatever you eat, you have to first offer to Krishna. And only then you are free from reactions. Otherwise, you are going to suffer severe reactions. And what are those reactions? That reaction is called papa.

### Offering Food to Krishna, Prasada, Vegetarianism

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Whatever you eat, you have to first offer to Krishna. And only then you are free from reactions. Otherwise, you are going to suffer severe reactions."
**Summary:** This segment explains the process of offering vegetarian food to Krishna, partaking of prasada, and how this mitigates suffering and frees one from reactions.

Sinful reaction. Sinful reaction is severe suffering, which is enforced by material nature. Nobody can go against it. So, Srila Prabhupada explains, the lord accepts from his devotee all kinds of food, preparations made of vegetables, fruits, leaves, and grains. Fruits, leaves, and milk in different varieties can be offered to the lord. And after the lord accepts, the food is offered to him. The devotee can partake of the prasada, by which all suffering in the struggle for existence will be gradually mitigated. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad Gita, 9.26: Patram pushpam phalam toyam yome bhaktya prayarchati. What Krishna accepts has been told in the Gita. This is the law of scripture. You should eat only what is offered to Krishna. Only then you can be free from reactions. And you can progress in bhakti, to get out of the clutches of maya. No more to suffer any material existence. But, you have to only offer Krishna varieties of foodstuff, which is prepared from patram pushpam phalam toyam. In this category, vegetarian, not non-vegetarian.

**Summary:** This segment discusses scriptural injunctions for meat-eaters, emphasizing that they are meant to restrict and minimize harm to animals, not to encourage meat-eating.

Even those who are accustomed to eat animals can offer foodstuff. Now, this is something that is explained in the scriptures, people do not know. They can eat animal flesh, not by offering to the lord directly, not by offering to Krishna. No, Krishna does not accept flesh. But, they can offer to an agent of the lord according to the scriptures, according to the scriptural direction, under certain conditions of religious rights. So, there are specific rules: what they can offer, to whom they can offer, when they can offer, how they have to offer. All this is given in the shastra. So, injunctions of the scriptures, especially for these meat eaters, who want to eat animal flesh. For them, the injunctions are not meant to encourage the eating of animal flesh. No, but to restrict them by regulated principles, to minimize the harm done to animals. The killing of animals is to be restricted. That's the ultimate aim.

**Key Quote:** "You can relish. And lead a healthy life simply by eating vegetarian foods of offer to the lord."
**Summary:** This segment promotes a vegetarian diet offered to the Lord, emphasizing that the Lord provides for all living beings and one need not be anxious about subsistence.

And put some sense into these people's head, that you should completely avoid animal killing because you can subsist, and not only subsist, you can relish and lead a healthy life simply by eating vegetarian foods offered to the lord and partaking prasad. So, to put this sense into the head of the foolish people who simply, to satisfy their tongue, they indiscriminately kill animals and eat animal flesh. For them to be saved from severe reactions, very, very sinful, severe reactions, the scriptures are guiding and regulating such animal killing. So, further Srila Prabhupada says, "The living being is a source of subsistence for other stronger living beings. No one should be very anxious for a subsistence in any circumstances, because there are living beings everywhere, and no living being starves for want of food at any place." See, if I am placed in a particular situation by the higher arrangement of the supreme lord, then I will be provided by the lord whatever I require for my subsistence. Now, how that is going to happen is mystical.

**Summary:** This segment uses the analogy of the African jungle to illustrate how the Lord provides for all living beings, regardless of their size or needs, and assures that even in the forest, prasada is available.

Like how do, Prabhupada explains this very nicely in another place, how do so many millions of living entities subsist in the African jungle? Or any jungle? How do they subsist? The lord arranges for the elephant. It requires 500 kg of food at a time in one day. And the ant requires a small grain of sugar, or some small grain of stuff, particular foodstuff. So, the lord provides the ant its small grain, and the lord provides the elephant its 500 kg of food. So, the lord is arranged. So, you don't have to be anxious how elephants will survive, how will they get their food, or how an ant will survive. No. Just like in the African jungle, there is no scarcity of food. So, therefore, the conclusion is Maharaj Yudhishtira has advised by Narada not to worry about his uncle's suffering for want of food, for they could live on vegetables available in the jungles as prasada of the supreme lord, and thus realize the path of salvation.

**Key Quote:** "For a spiritualist, for a transcendentalist. Who is engaged in meditation. Or spiritual practice in the jungle. Prabhupada explains that also."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how those seeking self-realization can subsist in places like the Himalayan region on available fruits and vegetables, emphasizing the Lord's protection for spiritualists.

So, Narada is going to tell, your uncles have gone to the forest for the sake of self-realization. And how will they subsist without your providing them their food? The lord will provide prasada in the form of vegetables or fruits in the forest. Srila Prabhupada says about the Himalayan region, the forest in the Himalayan region, there is plenty of fruits for spiritualists particularly. Plenty of fruits available, and roots are there, berries are there, and vegetation is there, which different seasons, different things are available for subsistence of the devotees, the yogis, the transcendentalists. They don't have to kill any animal, nothing. And the lord's protection is also there for a spiritualist, for a transcendentalist, who is engaged in meditation or spiritual practice in the jungle. Prabhupada explains that also. So, that is the higher arrangement.

### Natural Law of Existence, Exploitation of the Weak, Spiritual Sense

**Key Quote:** "It can be checked only by awakening the spiritual sense of the human being. By practice of spiritual regulation."
**Summary:** This segment explains that while the exploitation of the weak by the strong is a natural law, it can only be checked in humans by awakening their spiritual sense through spiritual practice.

Now, the exploitation of the weaker living being by the stronger is a natural law of existence. That is natural law. A tiger will kill another living being, but only when the tiger is hungry, and only as much as it requires. The tiger lives in the jungle, not that it is always killing some other weaker animal. No. Only when it is hungry, and that also only one animal, and that also that flesh will last for it for several days or weeks. I don't know how much time. But till that flesh is there, the tiger will not kill another animal. So, this is the law of existence. There is no possibility of checking this tendency of a stronger living being devouring a weaker living being for its food by any artificial means under material conditions. It can be checked only by awakening the spiritual sense of the human being by practice of spiritual regulation.

**Key Quote:** "Human being should not kill another animal. They should only subsist on food grains. Vegetables, fruits and milk."
**Summary:** This segment concludes by reiterating that humans should subsist on grains, vegetables, fruits, and milk offered to Krishna, emphasizing that killing animals disrupts peace and leads to negative consequences.

Only a human being should not kill another animal or another creature, whether insect or bird or anything. Human being should subsist on food grains, and vegetables and fruits, and milk. But this sense is possible to be awakened by spiritual practice. So, if a man kills another animal, then how can he expect peace in the society? He will also be killed by the laws of nature. And there are many instances of this explained, which I don't have time to go into. Some other time I will explain. So, human being should not kill another animal. They should only subsist on food grains, vegetables, fruits, and milk, by offering that to Krishna and partaking prasad. So, this is the conclusion. I will stop here.

### supremacy of the Lord, oneness of God, challenges to God
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/f7jFX9_Y1EY?t=55
**Verse References:** SB 1.13.48
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Supreme Lord Personality of God, it is one without a second."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami introduces verse SB 1.13.48, explaining that Narada Muni is addressing Yudhishthira Maharaj and emphasizing the Supreme Lord is one without a second, illustrating this point with the story of Paundraka who falsely claimed to be God.

In this session we will be discussing from the 48th verse of the 13th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: रदिदं भगवान राजन एक आत्मात्मानं स्वद्रिक अन्तरो अनन्तरो भाती पश्यतं माययो रुधा. The meaning of this verse is: Therefore, O King, you should look to the Supreme Lord only, who is one without a second, and who manifests himself by different energies, and is both within and without. This verse is spoken by Narada Muni, he is addressing Yudhishthira Maharaj. He is explaining the philosophy first and then he is going to give the details about where the two uncles of Yudhishthira, Tritarashtra and Vidura, where have they gone. That is basically Yudhishthira's question to Narada Muni. So Narada Muni is going to answer that, before that he explains the philosophical basis for the solution to Yudhishthira's problem. And already Narada Muni has explained that when our own body is under the clutches of material nature, how can we help somebody else who may be suffering or undergoing difficulty because of their bodies being under the clutches of material nature. So it is ultimately the Supreme Lord, who is the Supreme Controller, who actually is the ultimate cause of all causes. We have to look towards him only after we do our duties. It is not that we neglect our duties because Supreme Lord is in control. No, we have to do our duties, but beyond that we only look towards the Lord. And Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport very elaborately. Srila Prabhupada says, "The Supreme Lord, Personality of Godhead, is one without a second." That means he is the only one who is the Supreme Lord. There are no two Supreme Lords, only one. Supreme means one, and there is nobody else who is a competitor to God. Sometimes we hear that somebody else is challenging God. That is never possible. It never has happened, never will happen. Even when Krishna was present on this earth, he had incarnated 5000 years ago, he was in Dwaraka. One Asura by name Paundraka, he declared himself as the real God, and he told Krishna, he challenged Krishna that you give up your symbols because I am the real Vasudeva. And Krishna actually when he received that note from the messenger of this Paundraka, Paundraka was a king ruling a particular province, and this Paundraka declared himself to be God. And this happens even now, that somebody declares I am God. So these sort of claims have no real foundation, they have no real basis. So Krishna just sent his Sudarshan Chakra. The Sudarshan Chakra cut off this Paundraka's head, and that was the end of Paundraka. So these sort of claims have no real basis. Therefore it is very clearly said by Narada, authoritative statement, the Supreme Lord, Personality of God, it is one without a second.

### energies of the Lord, marginal energy, spiritual nature of living beings, contamination of material world

**Key Quote:** "The living beings are also manifestations of his marginal energy."
**Summary:** The lecture explains how the Lord manifests through different energies, including the marginal energy (living beings), highlighting the spiritual nature of living beings and how it is qualitatively one with the Lord, but pervertedly manifested in the material world due to contamination.

But he manifests himself by different energies because he is by nature blissful. Even though he is one only, he is not a limited person like us. So he has many forms, and all of them are identical to him. They are all only one person: Rama, Narasimha, Vamana, Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Narayana, all, Balarama, Krishna, all are Krishna only, one person. So he manifests himself by different energies. The living beings are also manifestations of his marginal energy. We are also energy of the Supreme Lord, but what kind of energy? Called marginal energy. And this marginal energy characteristic is qualitatively one with the Lord. That means our quality, which is spiritual, is same as the Lord's quality, which is completely spiritual. So we are not material beings, we are spiritual beings. And there are innumerable living beings both within and without the external internal energies of the Lord. So apart from this marginal energy, the Supreme Lord has got the external energy, the material energy, and the internal energy, which is the spiritual energy. So within the material with spiritual energy, and within the material energy, there are innumerable living beings. Since the spiritual world is a manifestation of the Lord's internal energy, the living beings within that internal potency are qualitatively one with the Lord without contamination from external potency. They are pure. In the spiritual world, there are many many living beings, but all of them are pure, means there is no contamination of the external potency. Although qualitatively one with the Lord, the living being in this material world, due to contamination of the material world, is pervertedly manifested.

### material contamination, false identity, illusory happiness and distress, forgetfulness of spiritual qualities

**Key Quote:** "The perception of such ephemeral happiness and distress is due only to the forgetfulness of its qualities."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how material contamination leads to a false sense of identity and the experience of illusory happiness and distress, emphasizing that this is due to forgetfulness of our true spiritual qualities.

So this manifestation here means everyone here has got a material body, and that material body is not only externally covering the soul, but the consciousness also has become polluted by the material atmosphere with a false sense of identity, as I am independent, I am the Lord, I am the master, I am the enjoyer, I am the proprietor. All these contaminations are even there in the consciousness. So that's why Srila Prabhupada says here, "The living being is pervertedly manifested in this material world, and therefore he experiences so called happiness and distress in the material world." What is our original position? Completely blissful, eternally in the association of Krishna in the spiritual world. That is our original position, that's our pure state of existence. But this contaminated state in the material world is such that there is illusory happiness and there is illusory distress. Such experiences are all ephemeral. Ephemeral means they are all temporally manifested and do not affect the spirit soul. The spirit soul is completely aloof from all the material coverings or the material influence. The perception of such ephemeral happiness and distress is due only to the forgetfulness of its qualities. We forget our own spiritual quality. In contact with this material nature, we forget our self, we forget our spiritual nature.

### Lord's arrangement for rectification, Paramatma, spiritual master, scriptures, cooperation with the Lord

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "By his order only, one should become a spiritual master."
**Summary:** The lecture explains how the Lord makes arrangements to rectify the fallen condition of living beings, both internally as Paramatma and externally through the spiritual master and scriptures, emphasizing the importance of cooperating with the Lord's outward activities.

Now our qualities are completely spiritual, like the Lord's quality, which is completely spiritual. There is however a regular current from the Lord himself, from within and without, by which to rectify the fallen condition of the living being. The Lord wants to correct our mistaken identity, so he makes arrangement, he makes elaborate arrangements in this material world. So within, from within us, he corrects the desiring living beings as localized Paramatma. That means Krishna has entered every living being's heart in this material world as Paramatma, Supersoul, and he corrects the desiring living being. He guides, provided we take his guidance. We can be corrected, we can be saved, we can be delivered from this material existence, we can get out of this entanglement. It's possible. And from without, that means externally, he corrects by his manifestations, the spiritual master and the revealed scriptures, Guru and Shastra. One should look unto the Lord, one should not be disturbed by so called manifestations of happiness and distress. Look towards the Lord, internally look towards the Paramatma, and externally look towards the spiritual master and the scriptures, and don't be disturbed by so called happiness and distress. If there is happiness also, there is no cause for jubilation, and if there is distress, there is no cause for lamentation. In either case, we have to go on with our spiritual life. So therefore Srila Prabhupada says, "Instead of being disturbed, one should try to co-operate with the Lord in his outward activities for correcting the fallen souls." Outward activities, the Lord is making arrangement for correcting the fallen souls. By his order only, one should become a spiritual master.

### order of the Lord, spiritual master's motivation, qualities of a bonafide spiritual master, forgetfulness of the Lord

**Key Quote:** "Nobody can be a spiritual master without the order from the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that a spiritual master must be authorized by the Lord and should not seek personal gain, highlighting the qualities of a bonafide spiritual master who is qualitatively one with the Lord, contrasting this with those who are forgetful of the Lord and perverted reflections.

Very clear, the Lord's order has to be there to become a spiritual master. Nobody can be a spiritual master without the order from the Supreme Lord, explicit order from the Supreme Lord. And one should in this way co-operate with the Lord. Nobody can have an independent program of spiritual life. It has to be something which is given by the Lord, which is authorized by the Lord, which is ordered by the Lord. One should not become a spiritual master for one's personal benefit, for some material gain, or as an avenue of business or occupation for earning livelihood. This is very very bad. Somebody becomes a guru so that they can live off the disciples. That is very wrong, that should never be done. Neither should spiritual master look for some material benefit from the disciples. No. The spiritual master who looks at the Supreme Lord to co-operate with him is actually qualitatively one with the Lord. See, the bonafide spiritual master are completely spiritual personalities. They have no tinge of any material contamination. Therefore they are described as qualitatively one with the Lord. And the forgetful ones are perverted reflections only. The living beings who are forgetful of the Supreme Lord, they are not in their original state of existence, they are perverted reflections. Yudhishthira Maharaj is advised by Narada therefore not to be disturbed by the affairs of so called happiness and distress, but to look only unto the Lord.

### Krishna's descent as time, Asuras vs. Devatas, Devotee protection
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/suRASGsPB1s?t=51
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "For the devotees, his factual form is disclosed, and for non-devotees, he appears like Kalarupa, which is causal form."
**Summary:** This segment explains the meaning of the verse, describing Krishna's descent as all-devouring time to eliminate the envious, contrasting the fates of devotees and asuras, and highlighting the protection afforded to devotees.

In this session we will be discussing from the 49th verse of the 13th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, सोयम अध्यमहाराज भगवान भूतभावनह कालरूपो अवतीरणो स्याम अभावाय सुरत्विशाम। The meaning of this verse is, that supreme personality of Godhead, Lord Sri Krishna, in the guise of all devouring time, कालरूपा, has now descended on earth, to eliminate the envious from the world. So, this verse describes Krishna's descent, also as the all devouring time, कालरूपो. So, Prabhupada explains this in the purport. There are two classes of human beings, namely the envious and the obedient, who are called the envious. Since the supreme lord is one and the father of all living beings, the envious living beings are also his sons, but they are known as the asuras. But the living beings who are obedient to the supreme father are called devatas or demigods, because they are not contaminated by the material conception of life. Demigod means almost like God, or godly. Demigods also can be called godly persons or godly beings. Not only are the asuras envious of the lord, in even denying the existence of the lord, but they are also envious of all other living beings. See, this is the nature of the asuras. It's called demoniac nature. This is described in the Bhagavad Gita also, 16th chapter. The demoniac nature and the divine nature. The predominance of asuras in the world is occasionally rectified by the lord when he eliminates them from the world and establishes a rule of devatas like the Pandavas. The lord sometimes personally comes and sometimes he deputes his devotee. To kill these asuras and establish the proper rule of the devatas, like the Pandavas, godly beings. So his designation, that means the lord's designation as Kala in disguise, is significant. Kalaropoyam. He is not at all dangerous, but he is the transcendental form of eternity, knowledge and bliss. Kalaropoyam. That's the real form of the Supreme Lord. Full of bliss, full of knowledge. Very, very beautiful form, most attractive and very pleasing to the eyes. So that is the real form, original form of the lord. But, Prabhupada says, for the devotees, his factual form is disclosed, and for non-devotees, he appears like Kalarupa, which is causal form. So what is the causal form? This causal form of the Lord is not at all pleasing to the asuras. When he appears as death, that is not at all pleasing to anybody.

### Devotee's perspective on death, Asura's fear of death, Form of God

**Key Quote:** "So for devotees, there is no death. That's why devotional service is the only way to conquer death."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how devotees are protected from death and how asuras fear death and deny the form of God to feel secure.

Specially for the asuras. Now, devotees don't have to face death, even devotees who take birth in this material world, because they are personally protected by the Lord. So for devotees, even though once having taken birth, it appears like even devotees die, but they are not dying like the asuras. Asuras are completely finished when they die, because all their power, their wealth, their possessions, their influence, everything is finished. But devotees, because they are on the spiritual platform, their devotional service, their devotional relationship, their devotional assets, everything is perfectly intact. And at the time of so-called death, a devotee changes the body from this body to another spiritual body. So for devotees, there is no death. That's why devotional service is the only way to conquer death. So these asuras, they are always afraid of death. They are always afraid of death and therefore they think of the Lord as formless. Asuras always describe if at all there is some god, he is formless. Why? Because in that way they feel secure that they will not be vanquished by the Lord. They think they can escape death or they can escape the destruction by the Supreme Lord if they declare that God is there but he is formless. This is not the truth. This is not the reality. God is there. He has got his transcendental form. But for the non-devotees he is always present as death.

### Pandavas' role, Lord's mission, Asuras' envy, Desire for control

**Key Quote:** "We have come out of our own choice, dictated by a strong desire to lord it over the resource of material world."
**Summary:** This segment explains the Pandavas' role in Krishna's mission to cleanse the earth of asuras, highlighting the asuras' envy of the Lord and devotees, and their desire to control the material world.

The 50th verse. The meaning is the Lord has already performed his duties to help the demigods and he is awaiting the rest. You Pandavas may wait as long as the Lord is here on earth. So Narada Muni is indicating to the Pandavas that they are to cooperate with Krishna. Krishna is the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord has descended with a mission to clean up the earth which was overburdened by Asuras. So now the Pandavas are part of the mission of the Lord in this material world. So it is Krishna's desire that the Pandavas rule the world, the devotees, the divine personalities, not the demoniac natured Duryodhana and company. No. So in the Purport Srila Prabhupada says, "The Lord descends from his abode, Krishnaloka, the topmost planet in the spiritual sky, in order to help the demigod administrators of this material world when they are greatly vexed by the Asuras." The Asuras give too much trouble to the demigods or devatas or the divine beings in this material world. Then the Supreme Lord comes here. Now these Asuras are described as, "Not only are they envious of the Supreme Lord, they are also envious of the Lord's devotees." This is the nature of this Asuras, demoniac nature, as referred to above. They are conditioned living beings, contact material association by their own choice. So we are not put here accidentally. We have not come here by somebody else's dictation. We have come out of our own choice. And what is that choice we have made? Dictated by a strong desire to lord it over the resource of material world.

### Material disease, Imitation gods, Disturbance by Asuras, Prayers for relief

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Everyone is trying to become an imitation god."
**Summary:** This segment describes the 'material disease' of wanting to be the lord, the competition among imitation gods (asuras), and how their disturbances lead devotees and demigods to pray for the Lord's intervention.

And become imitation lords of all they survey. This is the whole disease. It is called Bhavaroga, material disease. I want to be the lord of everything I survey and I want to lord over resources of this material world. So this is the desire which dictates us, contact with material association. And this is only possible with material association. It is not possible in the spiritual existence. Everyone is trying to become an imitation god. We cannot be. We cannot become god. We can try to imitate god. That's what all these Asuras do. They declare there is no god, or I am god, or everyone is god. All these kind of foolish things are done by Asuras only, not by the demigods. There is a keen competition among such imitation gods and such competitors are generally known as Asuras. Even the Asuras sometimes they fight among themselves. One tries to kill the other or one tries to overpower the other. When there are too many Asuras in the world, then it becomes a hell for those who are devotees of the lord. Devotees want to live peacefully doing their own devotional service. They have no desires like the Asuras. But these Asuras become too many in number. The Asuras disturb the devotees also. Due to the growth of the Asuras, both of the Asuras, the mass of people who are generally devoted to the lord by nature, and the pure devotees of the lord, including the demigods in higher planets, pray to the lord for relief. And when the devatas, devotees pray to the lord, then what happens? The lord either descends personally from his abode or deputes some of his devotees to remodel the fallen conditions of human society, or even animal society. The lord can appear in any form, but he remains the transcendental lord and his form is always spiritual, though it appears like a material form. It is not a material form. Such disruptions take place not only in human society, but also among animals, birds or other living beings, including the demigods in the higher planets.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the periodic disturbances in the material world, the Lord's intervention to vanquish asuras, the annihilation of the Yadu dynasty, and Narada Muni's hint to the Pandavas about future events.

So in this material world, periodically these disturbances are there, time to time. yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata. Whenever and wherever there is this dharmasya glani, neglect of religious principles, these Asuras, they come in the way of following religious principles. Then the lord personally comes. Lord Shri Krishna descended personally to vanquish Asuras like Kamsa, Jarasandha, Chishupala. And during the reign of Maharaj Yudhishthira, almost all these Asuras were killed by the lord. Now, it is told in the verse, "Await the rest." What is that? Now he was awaiting the annihilation of his own dynasty, called the Yadu Vamsha, who appeared by his will in this world. Krishna appeared along with the Yadus and they were very very powerful. Now, this annihilation of this Yadu Vamsha also, it is not required except when the Asuras had to be annihilated. After annihilation of the Asuras, the Yadu Vamsha is not required on this earth. So, the lord wanted to take them away, the Yadu Vamsha, before his own departure to his eternal abode. So, Narada like Vidura did not disclose the imminent annihilation of the Yadu dynasty, but he directly gave a hint to King Yudhishthira and his brothers to wait till the incident happened and the lord departed. So, Narada is indicating what is going to happen in the future, immediate future now, that the Yadu Vamsha will be annihilated and the lord will go to his own abode and then the Pandavas can go back to the spiritual world. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Vidura actually left the palace not because he was insulted by Duryodhana, but really because he wanted to inquire and acquire the knowledge about this cell, Atma Vidya."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Vidura left the palace not because of Duryodhana's insult, but to seek spiritual knowledge and inquire about Atma Vidya.

the limbs and senses become active and existence itself becomes delightful. Vidura was so dear to the members of the Kaurava family that his long absence from the palace was comparable to inactivity. Why was Vidura absent for a long time from the palace? If you remember, it was described previously that Vidura was insulted by Duryodhana when Vidura was trying to advise Dhritarashtra, his elder brother, in some particular issue, particularly Dhritarashtra not treating the Pandavas properly, while the Pandavas were actually not treating the Pandavas properly, without their father, fatherless children. And Dhritarashtra was a caretaker, but he was not properly treating the Pandavas. He was partial to his own sons, and he did so much injustice to the Pandavas. Therefore, when Vidura pointed that out to Dhritarashtra, Duryodhana became very angry, and he insulted Vidura. Of course, Vidura apparently left the palace being insulted by Duryodhana, but in reality, Vidura left the palace because he wanted to inquire about the spiritual subject matter from saintly persons in the places of pilgrimage. Therefore, Vidura left the palace in order to visit holy places of pilgrimage to search out for a saintly person who could explain to him the truth about this self, Atma Vidya or Brahma Vidya. This is actually the real business of human form of life, to make this inquiry. In the Vedanta Sutra it is said, Athato Brahma Jignasa. So Vidura actually left the palace not because he was insulted by Duryodhana, but really because he wanted to inquire and acquire the knowledge about this self, Atma Vidya.

So Vidura left and went on a pilgrimage, and he kept travelling till he met Uddhava in one of the holy places of pilgrimage, and he began to inquire from Uddhava about this self. While Uddhava began to speak, then Uddhava realized that Vidura's questions can best be answered by Maitreya Rishi, because even though both Uddhava and Maitreya Rishi were instructed by Krishna before Krishna's departure from this world at the end of his manifest pastimes, even though both were instructed and both were self realized, both were competent, but Maitreya Rishi was elder in age to Uddhava. Therefore, Uddhava did not want to actually do Maryada Vetikrama, he didn't want to break the Vaishnava etiquette that when there is a senior devotee or senior personality present, then the younger one should not instruct the seekers of knowledge, spiritual knowledge. So Uddhava directed Vidura to go to Maitreya Rishi who was nearby and inquire from Maitreya Rishi about this knowledge of the self, Atma Vidya.

**Summary:** Vidura returns to Hastinapura after receiving instruction, intending to deliver Dhritarashtra, who is living comfortably under Yudhishthira's care, and his return is met with joy.

Accordingly, Vidura went to Maitreya Rishi, and Maitreya Rishi received Vidura very nicely and instructed him. So after Vidura was instructed by Maitreya Rishi, then he came back to Hastinapura. Why did he come back? To actually deliver his brother Dhritarashtra. By this time, already the battle of Kurukshetra was over, and all the Kauravas were killed in that battle. Dhritarashtra and Gandharva were staying under the care of Yudhishthira when Yudhishthira was enthroned as the emperor of the world after the battle of Kurukshetra by Lord Krishna, and Yudhishthira was ruling. Yudhishthira was very, very kind and respectful and compassionate, and very nicely he is taking care of Dhritarashtra and Gandharva, his uncle and aunt. He was taking care of them in the palace. They were living under the care of Yudhishthira very nicely, but Vidura actually thought that Dhritarashtra is actually not pursuing self realization. He is just living comfortably in the palace under the care of Yudhishthira and wasting his time in simply maintaining the body, simply for the sake of living a comfortable life, while time is running out, death is nearing. He had become an old man. Dhritarashtra had become an old man. So Vidura came back to the palace simply to deliver Dhritarashtra because he himself, Vidura himself, was self realized. So Vidura came back, and how the members of the royal palace received Vidura is being described here. Vidura was so dear to the members of the Kaurava family that his long absence from the palace is comparable to inactivity.

**Key Quote:** "Even an enemy received at home should be so well received that he will not feel any fearful situation."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the Vedic culture of hospitality, emphasizing that even enemies should be treated with respect and kindness when they are guests.

All of them were feeling acute separation from Vidura, and therefore his return to the palace was joyful for all. The sixth verse, mumucho prema baashpa, mumucho prema baashpaugham viraha autkantya kataraha rajatam arhayam chakre kratasana parigraham. The meaning of this verse is, due to anxieties and long separation, they all cried out of affection. King Yudhishthira then arranged to offer sitting accommodations and a reception for Vidura. The seventh verse, tam bhukta vantam vishrantam asinam sukham asane prashrayavanato raja prahatesham cha shunvatam. The meaning of this seventh verse is, after Vidura ate sumptuously and took sufficient rest, he was comfortably seated, then King Yudhishthira began to speak to him, and all who were present there listened since he has come back. They are very eager to hear from him about his travel. Now in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains something very important about the Vedic culture. Srila Prabhupada says, King Yudhishthira was expert in reception also even in the case of his family members. Vidura was well received by all the family members by exchange of embraces and obeisances. The younger ones to Vidura, they paid obeisances to Vidura, and the equals, they embraced, and out of affection for all those family members, Vidura himself, he embraced the affectionate family members. After that, bathing and arrangements for a sumptuous dinner were made by Yudhishthira, and then Vidura was given sufficient rest. After finishing his rest, Vidura was offered a comfortable place to sit, and then the king, Yudhishthira, began to talk about all happenings, both family and otherwise. That is the proper way to receive a beloved friend or even an enemy. This is the important point you should note. Srila Prabhupada says, not only receiving a friend properly so nicely or some dear relative, but even an enemy comes home, he should be received the same way like an affectionate relative or a dear friend. So Srila Prabhupada says, according to Indian moral codes that is based on the Vedic culture, Vedic tradition, even an enemy received at home should be so well received that he will not feel any fearful situation. An enemy is always afraid of his enemy, but this should not be so when he is received at home by his enemy. This means that a person when received at home should be treated as a relative.

**Key Quote:** "Even if a stranger enters your house, you will receive him in such a friendly way that he will forget that you are his enemy and he will have no fear."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the Vedic principle of treating uninvited guests (Atithi) with utmost respect and friendliness, ensuring they feel safe and welcome.

So what to speak of a family member like Vidura was a well wisher for all the members of the family. Thus Yudhishthira Maharaj began to speak in the presence of all the other members very lovingly. Yudhishthira began to speak to Vidura. Now Srila Prabhupada explains elsewhere what is this Vedic culture of receiving a guest, even if the guest, guest means somebody who comes without being invited, not having an invitation. Obviously, an enemy will not have an invitation. So even if an enemy comes or anybody comes without invitation, they are received very nicely by being offered a reception that is supposed to be offered to atithi, a guest who is uninvited, who comes home. How should a householder receive such a guest? So the injunction in the Vedas is that a householder should not be a stranger, not a stranger. So whatever a person is, even if a stranger enters your house, you will receive him in such a friendly way that he will forget that you are his enemy, and he will have no fear, no fear.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Parikshit Maharaj and Shamika Rishi to illustrate the importance of properly receiving guests, even if they are superiors or enemies, according to scriptural injunctions.

of facing the enemy. That is the way to receive. So Shrila Prabhupada explains elsewhere that when Parikshit Maharaj went hunting on some occasion and he became very thirsty and he started looking for water, he could not find any body of water nearby in the forest, and he happened to come across the ashram of one Shamika Rishi. So he entered that ashram of Shamika Rishi, and the Rishi was sitting there, and Yudhishthira Maharaj was not properly welcomed and received by this Rishi, so I'm sorry, Parikshit Maharaj was not received properly by Rishis Shamika. So Parikshit Maharaj became very angry, but not being received properly. So Shrila Prabhupada explains why did Parikshit Maharaj become angry at this Shamika Rishi. Actually, Parikshit Maharaj's Kshatriya is in a subordinate position to Shamika Rishi because Shamika Rishi is a Brahmana. So it is not expected that a Brahmana should actually respect a Kshatriya in the normal circumstances, but in this particular case when Parikshit Maharaj has come to the ashram as a guest, atithi, then even if that atithi happens to be an enemy, what to speak of a good Kshatriya king, the host, the resident of that ashram should receive the guest respectfully, very nicely, very properly. So only because of this particular injection in the scriptures, it was justified that Parikshit Maharaj became upset with Shamika Rishi, but then again Shamika Rishi did not, was not receiving परिक्षेत महाराज विकास शमिकर रिशी वास इन एंड मेडिटेशन सो इस एक्स्टाउर्नरी सरकुमस्टेंस अरेंड वाड़ सुप्रीन वॉल्ड सुगर परिक्षेत वुद्धि कर्स वाई द कि संख आफ शमिकर रिशी एंड परिक्षेत शुद्धी टाइप his kingdom and later on bhagat would be spoken by shukadeva swan pariksit maharaj and will reveal to the whole world through the medium of shukadeva and pariksit that was krishna's arrangement in any case this is what prabhupada says the very culture is to receive any uninvited guest properly even if

**Key Quote:** "Narada can see the past, present and future"
**Summary:** Narada Muni discloses Dhritarashtra's location and movements to Yudhishthira, highlighting Narada's ability to see past, present, and future events.

In this session, we will be discussing three verses: 51, 52, and 53 of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 51st verse: Dhritarashtraha Saha Bhratra Gandharaya Cha Swabharyaya Dakshinena Himavata Rishinam Ashramam Gatha. So Narada is now disclosing where Dhritarashtra has gone. He is telling the translation of the 51st verse: O King, your uncle Dhritarashtra, his brother Vidura, and his wife Gandhari have gone to the southern side of the Himalayan mountains, where there are shelters of the great sages. So Prabhupada briefly mentions in the purport: To pacify the mourning Maharaja Yudhishthira, Narada first of all spoke from the philosophical point of view, and then he began to describe the future movements of his uncle, which he had done in the past. He could see by his foreseeing powers and thus began to describe as follows. Narada can see the past, present, and future. Such saintly persons are called Trikalagya. By the mercy of the Lord, they are able to see specific events, either of the past or of the future, apart from seeing the present events, being aware of the present events.

**Key Quote:** "Dhritarashtra is now engaged in beginning Ashtanga Yoga"
**Summary:** Narada describes Dhritarashtra's activities at Saptasrota, including bathing, performing sacrifices, and practicing Ashtanga Yoga to control his mind and senses and detach from familial affection.

So the 52nd verse. Narada Muni is describing to Yudhishthira where they have gone. The translation of the 52nd verse: The place is called Saptasrota, divided by 7, because there the waters of the sacred Ganges were divided into 7 branches. This was done for the satisfaction of the 7 great Rishis, Saptarishi. 53rd verse: Snatva Anusavanam Tasmin Hutva Chagnin Yatha Vidhi Abhaksha Upashantatma Saaste Vigatai Shanah. The meaning of this 53rd verse is: On the banks at Saptasrota, Dhritarashtra is now engaged in beginning Ashtanga Yoga by bathing three times daily in the morning, noon, and evening, by performing the Agnihotra sacrifice with fire, and by drinking only water. This helps one control the mind and the senses and frees one completely from thoughts of familial affection.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the true purpose of Ashtanga Yoga, emphasizing that it's not merely for physical health but for controlling the mind and senses and diverting them from material to spiritual consciousness.

So specifically, Dhritarashtra is engaged in Ashtanga Yoga practice, and that is basically, any Yoga practice is to control the mind and senses, Yoga Indriya Samyama, and also become free from all thoughts of family affection. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport: The Yoga system is a mechanical way to control the senses and the mind and divert them from matter to spirit. This Yoga system, Ashtanga Yoga system, is a mechanical method, and the purpose is very clearly described by Prabhupada, which is missed out by many people who may be following some practice of Ashtanga Yoga, especially nowadays. They think Ashtanga Yoga is meant for maintaining good health or for increasing some mental power, like that. So many other purposes they use this practice of Ashtanga Yoga, but the real purpose of Ashtanga Yoga is to control the senses and mind and divert them from matter to spirit. We are completely spiritual beings, but due to our desire for lording over material nature, we have been given this material body, and we have a materialistic conception of life itself. So to correct that is to divert the mind and senses from matter to spirit.

**Key Quote:** "Facing the absolute person Paramatma"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the eight steps of Ashtanga Yoga, including posture, meditation, spiritual thoughts, manipulation of air (Pranayama), and achieving trance (Samadhi) focused on Paramatma.

In Ashtanga Yoga, there are different steps, Anga, Ashta Anga, eight steps actually. So Srila Prabhupada says: The preliminary processes are the sitting posture, meditation, spiritual thoughts, manipulation of air passing within the body, and gradual situation in trance, facing the absolute person, Paramatma. Very nicely Prabhupada is summarizing the eight steps: sitting posture, Asana; then meditation, fixing the mind, fixing the mind on the form of the Lord in the heart; spiritual thoughts, completely spiritualizing the thinking, because the Lord is completely spiritual. We are spiritual beings. There is no possibility of getting out of this material existence as long as we have got material thoughts, material conceptions, material ideas, material identification. We cannot get out. So these spiritual thoughts are very, very important. Manipulation of air passing within the body. Inside this body, there is something called Prana Vayu, and that Prana Vayu circulation or flow has to be manipulated. It is called Pranayama. Pranayama, Pranayama exercises which will help manipulate the flow in such a way that we will gradually become detached from all material sense objects, material pleasures, material thoughts. That is also called Vairagya, but it is a mechanical process. Therefore, they work with the Prana Vayu circulation, manipulating that by exercises, just like this inhalation and exhalation. That itself actually can regulate the flow of this Prana Vayu. So specifically exercising that inhalation and exhalation, breathing exercises, so that is called manipulation of air passing within the body and gradual situation in trance. Trance is the final stage actually, Samadhi, where one is completely, mind is in equilibrium, not disturbed by any external distractions, nor the mind is absorbed in some internal thinking process or feeling or willing, no internal activity either, but is absorbed in facing the absolute person, Paramatma, fixed completely on the form of Paramatma within the heart. Such mechanical ways of rising to the spiritual platform prescribe some regulative principles. Some strict rules have to be followed if at all one wants success in this Ashtanga Yoga.

**Key Quote:** "This material objective trying to enjoy materially is an illusory objective"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the strict rules of Ashtanga Yoga, such as bathing three times daily and fasting, emphasizing the need to detach from material objects and recognize the illusory nature of material enjoyment.

So what are the rules? Taking bath daily three times. That's why in the Bhagavad Gita also it is said, and in all the Yoga literature, Ashtanga Yoga literature, it is said, go to a secluded place which is suitable for practicing Ashtanga Yoga without any distraction and where there is facility for taking bath three times. So the Himalayan region is ideal because many, many rivers are flowing there. Most all of them are actually branches of the Ganga only, but that river flows in so many places. Anybody can actually take bath very easily three times. Fasting as far as possible. So gradually it is described in the episode on Dhruva Maharaj performing meditation on the Supreme Lord, how he progressively gave up solid food, then liquid, and even he gave up breathing. So this is the strict rules that are prescribed in the Ashtanga Yoga system, fasting as far as possible and sitting and concentrating the mind on spiritual matters. The mind is always absorbed in material things. That's our present condition. So if you want to change this subject matter of thinking for the mind, then one has to fix the mind on spiritual matters and freed from material thoughts and thus gradually becoming free from Vishaya, or material objectives. This material world is Vishaya Sagara. It's an ocean of material objects. Every material object has got some form, some taste, some smell, some sense of touch, some sound. So these material sense objects, we have to become free from them because we have nothing to do with matter or material objects or material things. We have no connection with them. We are spiritual beings, and trying to squeeze out some happiness out of matter is frustrating, will never give us the desired happiness or the desired satisfaction because we are spiritual beings. Material existence means to be absorbed in the material objective, which is simply illusory. This material objective, trying to enjoy materially, is an illusory objective.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating the importance of detaching from material thoughts and concentrating on Paramatma, using Dhritarashtra as an example of someone who had to abandon family affairs to turn towards spiritual realization.

Which body with some concocted idea of material enjoyment. So all these are coverings, material coverings of the spirit, and a yoga system helps one to become free from all these illusory thoughts and gradually turn towards the absolute person, Paramatma. This is the whole yoga practice or yoga system. By material associated education, we learn simply to concentrate on flimsy things, but yoga is the process of forgetting them all together. So real yoga practice means to forget all these material things and to concentrate on Paramatma, the supreme Lord within the heart, the spiritual, you all-spiritual being, supreme person. Dhritarashtra, you see the status condition, he was all along trying to improve his family affairs, but now for the sake of turning towards Paramatma, he has to forget all that. Therefore, it is necessary for him to become free from all these illusory thoughts and to concentrate on flimsy things, but now for the sake of turning towards Paramatma, he has to forget all that. Therefore, it is necessary for him to take bath three times, to fast, to concentrate his mind in spiritual thoughts like that. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

### Ashtanga Yoga, Modes of Material Nature, Paramatma, Individual Soul

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Real yoga practice means, to focus or concentrate one's attention on the supreme Lord who is seated in everyone's heart."
**Summary:** This segment explains the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam about controlling senses through Ashtanga Yoga to become immune to material contaminations, emphasizing the importance of focusing on the Supreme Lord within the heart and distinguishing between the individual soul and the Paramatma.

In this session we will be discussing from the 54th verse of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. जितासनो जितश्वासह प्रत्याहृतशड़िन्द्रियह हरिभावनया ध्वस्त रजसत्वतमो मलहा The meaning of this verse is, one who has controlled the sitting postures, the yogic asanas, and the breathing process, can turn the senses toward the absolute personality of Godhead, and thus become immune to the contaminations of the modes of material nature, namely mundane goodness, passion, and ignorance. So, Narada Muni is describing. How does that work? In the Ashtanga Yoga system, which is practiced by those who follow this Ashtanga Yoga process, how does it work? So, here, जितश्वासह, जितासनो जितश्वासह, जितासनो is controlled sitting postures. Because, unless a yogi is able to sit properly, he cannot become completely absorbed in meditation. He'll be disturbed by the body. So, this practice of yogasana, different sitting postures, or different bodily exercises, for controlling the sitting posture, the ability to sit, for a very, very long time, without any distraction, without any disturbance. Then, जितास्वासह, the breathing process, also has to be controlled. Why the breathing process has to be controlled? To turn the senses toward the absolute personality of Godhead, and thus become immune to the contaminations of the modes of material nature. We are influenced by the three gunas. So, that influence is felt through the senses, through the mind, through our material activities. We feel the influence, we experience the influence. Sometimes, we are influenced by goodness, sometimes by passion, sometimes by ignorance. So, a combination of these modes always acts, in most cases. In any case, these influences, are material influence. They are all the influence of the material energy. Because, the material energy consists of these three gunas. Sattvam rajas tamaiti guna prakati sambhavah. Prakati sambhavah. They are the ingredients of this material nature, these three gunas. And, they influence the body. They influence the living being in this material world. One has to become free from these influences. And, that we described here. The purpose, Srila Prabhupada says, the preliminary activities of the way of yoga are asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dhyana, dharana, etc. Eight steps are there. Maharaja Dhritarashtra was to attain success in those preliminary actions. Because, he was seated in a sanctified place. And, was concentrating upon one objective. What is that one objective? Namely, the supreme personality of Godhead, Hari. So, real yoga practice means, to focus or concentrate one's attention on the supreme Lord who is seated in everyone's heart. The Lord is there. And, everybody's heart he has entered. sarvasya caaham rudhi sannyavishto mattasmrutir jnanam appohanam jnanam In the fifteenth chapter, Krishna says, I am seated in everybody's heart. In the eighteenth chapter also, Krishna explains, ishwaras sarvabhutanam hrudeshe aryoh deshtati The supreme Lord is seated in everyone's heart. And, he is seated as Paramatma. Upadrishta anumanta bharta bhokta maheshwaraha Paramatmeti chaapyukto dehesmin purusha paraha There is a transcendental enjoyer, the supreme Lord as Paramatma. Paramatma iti uktaha He is called as Paramatma. He is not Atma. He is Paramatma. He is supreme Atma. Supreme soul. Super soul.

### Paramatma, Free Will, Bhakti Yoga, Direct vs Indirect Methods

**Key Quote:** "Engaging the senses in the service of the Lord means we become very easily focused on the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the role of Paramatma as the witness and sanctioner of desires, contrasting the indirect approach of Ashtanga Yoga with the direct engagement of senses in Bhakti Yoga, highlighting the effectiveness and power of the latter.

Some philosophers say this, super soul and individual soul are one. They don't say two, they say one. But actually, according to the Bhagavad Gita, according to the Vedanta Sutra, according to the Bhagavatam, according to all the Vedic literature, this individual soul and super soul are two distinct identities. Paramatmeti chaapyukto Upadrishta He is a witness. He is a sanctioner. We have no freedom to fulfill our desires unless it is sanctioned by Paramatma who is the actual witnesser and sanctioner of every jiva, every living being in this material world. So therefore, the primary activities are meant of this Ashtanga Yoga. They are meant to concentrate upon the Supreme Lord in the heart. That is the ultimate goal of Ashtanga Yoga practice. Thus, all his senses were being engaged in the service of the Lord. This is the important point. Engaging the senses in the service of the Lord means we become very easily focused on the Supreme Lord. This is actually the way of practice of Bhakti Yoga. To engage all the senses in the service of the Supreme Lord. In Bhakti Yoga, it is done directly. In other yoga systems, it is done indirectly. That is the difference. Of course, indirect methods are slow, very tedious, and they can be very, very difficult at times, and the person can get deviated or distracted in between. When the process is too slow, it takes a very long time, then one can very easily get distracted. But in Bhakti Yoga, it is quick, it is highly effective, it is very powerful. Directly engage all your senses in the service of the Supreme Lord. Just like this chanting Hare Krishna. Directly we engage our tongue, our ears, and our sense of touch, and our mind attentively here. So directly we engage these four things in service of the Lord. This is service. Chanting Hare Krishna, and hearing, and counting, and taking a vow to chant a fixed number of times. Attentively chant and hear. This is actually direct service to the Lord. Direct service. And engaging our senses in direct service is Bhakti.

### Bhakti Yoga, Purification, Modes of Nature, Lust and Greed

**Key Quote:** "Even the highest mode, the material mode of goodness, is also a cause of material bondage."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that directly engaging the senses in the service of the Lord purifies one from material contaminations, even the mode of goodness, and contrasts this with the bondage caused by passion and ignorance, which fuel lust and greed, leading to an insatiable desire for wealth and power.

So Srila Prabhupada says, this process of engaging all the senses in the service of the Lord directly helps the devotee to get freedom from the contaminations of the three material modes of nature. Directly engaging the senses in the service of the Lord. Automatically we become purified. We don't have to have a separate process for purifying the contaminations. That is not the way of Bhakti. Even the highest mode, the material mode of goodness, is also a cause of material bondage. This is a secret that is revealed in the scriptures, especially Bhagavad Gita. What does Bhagavad Gita say? Sattvam rajas tamaiti guna prakriti sambhavah Nibaddhanti mahabaho dehe. This is the truth about material nature, even the mode of goodness. It is simply a cause of material bondage. Then what to speak of other qualities namely passion and ignorance? Definitely passion and ignorance are very much the cause of material bondage. But goodness also is the cause of material bondage. Passion and ignorance increase the material propensities of hankering for material enjoyment. Of course there is a qualitative difference between goodness and the other two gunas. Goodness is comparatively better than passion and ignorance. But goodness is not the best. Goodness is relatively better. The best is transcendental goodness, shuddha sattva, the spiritual existence, the spiritual platform, the spiritual existence. That is the best, that is the topmost, that is the true freedom from all material contamination. So this passion and ignorance increases the hankering for material enjoyment. And what happens? A strong sense of lust provokes the accumulation of wealth and power. Driven by lusty desires, people are working hard day and night, I want more wealth, more power, more wealth, more power, more wealth, more power. And there is no end to this. You see around you, there are millionaires who want to become billionaires. And there are billionaires who want to become trillionaires. And where will this end? If one goes on trying to satisfy their desires and somehow they are successful, you think it is going to come to an end? What will the person do with, if somebody has billion dollars or billion rupees, what will he do with trillion rupees? He doesn't know what to do with billion rupees itself. So what will he do with trillion rupees?

### Lust and Greed, Loss of Discrimination, Goodness as a stepping stone, Surrender to the Lord

**Key Quote:** "When the heart becomes free from this lust and greed, that is a big step towards purification."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how lust and greed lead to a loss of intelligence and discrimination, emphasizing that overcoming these base mentalities is a significant step towards purification, ultimately leading to goodness, which, while not complete freedom, allows one to control the senses and surrender to the Supreme Lord through Bhakti Yoga.

But they lose that sense of discrimination. They lose their intelligence. Naśta buddhayaḥ kāmaiṣṭaiṣṭe hṛta-jñānaḥ prapadyante anyadevataḥ Bhagavad Gita says naśta buddhayaḥ. Hṛta-jñānaḥ means naśta buddhayaḥ. This is the acharya's explanation. Their knowledge becomes completely lost, means their intelligence is lost. They lose the power of discrimination. I have so much money, I can do whatever I want with that money. But whatever I am doing, I am not getting satisfaction. Then why do I think I will get satisfaction by accumulating more money? What will you do with that more money? Why don't you think about that? There is no thinking remaining because it is lost by this greed and lust. One who has conquered these two base mentalities, this lust and greed, kāma lobhāda yasya ye, tadārajaṣṭamo bhāva kāma lobhāda yasya ye, cetaye te rana viddham When the heart becomes free from this lust and greed, that is a big step towards purification. But by purifying this lust and greed, one comes to the platform of goodness. And even in goodness, there is no freedom from material existence, but it is better. Why? Because in goodness, one may attempt to control the senses and get proper knowledge to be able to surrender to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord Hari and thereby transcend all the influences. That is the Bhakti Yoga process.

**Key Quote:** "The Ashtanga Yoga system of practice is ultimately meant for liberation from material bondage."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains how it relates to liberation and the Ashtanga Yoga system, as simplified by Srila Prabhupada.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 55th verse of the 13th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: शेत्रग्ञे प्रविलाप्यतं, ब्रह्मणी आत्मानं आधारे, घटां बरं इवां बरे. The meaning of this verse is: Dhritarashtra will have to amalgamate his pure identity with intelligence and then merge into the supreme being with knowledge of his qualitative oneness as a living entity with the supreme Brahman, being freed from the blocked sky, he will have to rise to the spiritual sky. This is a typical philosophical verse in the Bhagavatam which also is explaining the Vedanta philosophy. So what is that philosophy that is being explained here is simplified by Srila Prabhupada in the purport. So basically, in the verse, it is explaining that the Ashtanga Yoga system of practice is ultimately meant for liberation from material bondage, and how that liberation happens technically is being explained.

**Key Quote:** "If we don't have a desire to Lord it over material nature then we act in our constitutional position in our original state as loving devotional servant of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the living being's desire to lord over the material world and the consequences of declining to cooperate with the Supreme Lord.

So Srila Prabhupada attached in the purport, "The living being, by his desiring to lord it over the material world and declining to cooperate with the Supreme Lord, contacts the sum total of the material world." Let me go a little slow and let us try to understand what Srila Prabhupada is telling here. Each one of us is a living being, and the characteristic of every living being is that the living being has the capacity or the ability to desire. Desire is integral with the existence as spirit soul, so you cannot be without desire at any stage, in any condition, in any place, in any situation. Any person cannot be desireless. So specifically, a certain type of desire, what is that desire? To lord it over the material world. I want to be the Lord. Now, who is the Lord actually? Krishna. Krishna is eternally the Lord of the material world, the spiritual world, in the whole existence. That is Krishna's position. Our position is not, never to be the Lord, but if we develop a desire to be the Lord, and as a result of desiring to be the Lord, what happens next? We decline to cooperate with the Supreme Lord. If we don't have a desire to lord it over material nature, then we act in our constitutional position.

**Key Quote:** "Desiring to lord over and declining to cooperate with the supreme lord, the living entity contacts the sum total of the material world called Mahatatva."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the desire to lord over is only possible under illusion in the material world, leading to contact with the Mahatatva, the sum total of material energy.

In our original state as loving devotional servant of Krishna. So we are happily situated, completely blissfully, nicely engaged in Krishna's service as a cooperator. Krishna never forces in the spiritual world anyone to serve him because he is not in need of service. It's for our own self-interest that we must serve Krishna, but how is the service rendered? Lovingly, with devotion, then we are happy, we are perfectly situated. But if we decline, "I don't want to serve Krishna," then what do you want to do, sir? "I want to lord over." So that lording over is only possible under illusion, and that illusion exists only in the material world. So therefore, desiring to lord over and declining to cooperate with the supreme lord, the living entity contacts the sum total of the material world called Mahatatva. The material world, the sum total of this material world, everything material is the original substance or the energy called as Mahatatva. This is a technical term, it's called Mahatatva.

**Key Quote:** "The contact of the living being with this Mahatatva or the sum total of the material energy gives rise to a false ego."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how contact with Mahatatva gives rise to false ego, intelligence, mind, and senses, leading to a false identity with the material world.

The sum total of all material energy. And finally, from this Mahatatva, from this sum total of the material energy, his false identity with the material world, false identity with the material world means my false ego, your false ego, each person's false ego, each person's ahankara. Ahankara is a Sanskrit word, the English equivalent is false ego or false identity. So the contact of the living being with this Mahatatva or the sum total of the material energy gives rise to a false ego and gives rise to a particular kind of intelligence and then a particular kind of mind and particular set of senses. All these are developed by the living beings.

**Key Quote:** "Self-realization means I realize myself as pure spiritual identity completely apart from this material body means material senses apart from the material mind."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that originally we are spiritual beings with a spiritual identity in relationship with Krishna, but this is covered by contact with Mahatatva, and self-realization is reverting to the original position.

Identity. Originally, we are all spiritual beings, pure spirit. We have our spiritual identity in relationship with Krishna. We have our spiritual senses, our spiritual mind, our spiritual intelligence, our spiritual identity as loving servitor of Krishna, but all that is covered when we come in contact with this Mahat Tattva, when a covering is generated suitable for the lording over. Now, by this yogic process, particularly the Ashtanga Yoga process or any yogic process, when his pure identity is realized, in shastra, self-realization, self-realization means I realize myself as pure spiritual identity completely apart from this material body, means material senses, apart from the material mind, apart from the material intelligence, apart from the material ego, I am pure spiritual identity. One has to revert to the original position by amalgamating, amalgamating means bringing together, combining the five gross elements.

**Key Quote:** "The cause of all our material problems in this material existence represents general of birth and death false understanding false identity all kinds of material misconceptions."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a clay pot to explain how the pure spiritual soul takes on material elements to form a material body, and how self-realization means freeing oneself from this material dress.

And the subtle elements, mind and intelligence into the Mahat Tattva. It is just like if a potter is making a clay pot, he takes some clay and then he mixes it with water and then shapes it into a pot and then bakes that pot in fire, it becomes a pot. Now the pot is used, and when the pot is destroyed, what happens? The elements which went into making the pot are all separated. Fire is separated, then water is separated, and the earth as clay goes back to the earth. Similarly, when we come in contact with this Mahat Tattva, the pure spiritual soul, then we take little false ego, little material intelligence, little material mind, little material senses, and then the material covering called the gross and the subtle body is prepared and that becomes a dress for the spirit soul, for the living being, material dress. But self-realization means we don't require this material dress because the cause of all our material problems in this material existence represents a general of birth and death, false understanding, false identity, all kinds of material misconceptions, material miseries, material, material, uh, material existence itself is completely.

**Key Quote:** "Always my identity as servant of the supreme lord and supreme lord's identity as the master of everyone eternally remains that never changes that never is never is at any time lost it always exists."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that becoming free from material existence means realizing the spiritual identity of the soul and merging into the super soul, while maintaining the eternal relationship of servant and master.

Unnecessary. So becoming free from this material existence means becoming free of तो अराओं के रूप में सुन रहे हैं। इसलिए अराओं उंदन दिया जाना है और एलिमेंट्स उनको बेट दबा देगा जो हम के लिए पहले शुरू कर रहे हैं। बेगिनी वे ने वर बी कॉंटाइटेड में महात्तव थी दस गएटिंग फ्रीड फॉर थे क्लाक्शेस वह थे थैंका पाप ला यहां इस टू मर्ज इन एग्जिस्टेंस ऑफ द सुपर सोल जो वह ने बिकंग फ्री फॉर ने महात्तत्व. Then what is left is the spiritual identity of the spiritual soul. Spirit soul in its pure identity is left behind and that has to merge into the super soul. Merge means become one, and what is this becoming one actually mean? In other words, Prabhupada says he has to realize that qualitatively he is non-different from the super soul. It doesn't mean that I become the super soul. Merging into the super soul here does not mean I become the super soul, no. Always my identity as servant of the supreme lord and supreme lord's identity as the master of everyone eternally remains. That never changes, that never.

**Key Quote:** "Realizing the qualitative oneness means I am pure spiritual personality and that pure spiritual personality is eternally the servant of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by explaining that realizing qualitative oneness means understanding oneself as a pure spiritual personality and eternally a loving, devotional servant of Krishna, transcending the material sky and engaging in transcendental service.

Is lost, never is, never is at any time lost, it always exists. So realizing the oneness, qualitative oneness means one in quality. I am spiritual by nature, super soul or quality. I am spiritual by nature, super soul or quality. I am spiritual by nature, super soul or Krishna is spiritual by nature, but Krishna is master, I am servant. So non-different means not that I, the servant becomes the master, no. Servant will never become the master, master will never become the servant. Master is always master eternally, Krishna is always the master eternally and all the living entities are eternally servants. Jivera swarupa hoy krishnera nitya dasa. So, realizing the qualitative oneness means I am pure spiritual personality and that pure spiritual personality is eternally the servant of Krishna. What kind of servant? Loving, devotional servant. And when this qualitative oneness is realized, freed from the mahat-tattva coverings or material coverings, one transcends the material sky. You rise above the material sky, material existence and in the pure spiritual intelligence becomes intelligent engaged in transcendental loving service of the Lord. So, this is explained here by Srila Prabhupada what happened to Dhritarashtra. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

### subtle body, gross body, detachment, yoga
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/GvneEL2W7G8?t=259
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So the yogi he is able to be aloof from the gross body and the subtle body."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the difference between the gross and subtle bodies and how a yogi can detach from both.

सन्यस्ता खिलप कर्मणः आहार। सन्यस्ता खिलप कर्मणः आहार। सन्यस्ता खिलप कर्मणः आहार। सन्यस्ता खिलप कर्मणः आहार। means what the senses, even the senses and this body will also deteriorate. As far as the subtle mind and intelligence are concerned, a spiritualist identifies from the material mind and the material intelligence and even the material ego because subtle matter is not exactly like this gross matter which is destructible. In the sense of the term 'destroying', we talk in terms of something gross, and that destruction also, what does it mean actually? Everything gross is a combination of one or more of the five elements: earth, water, fire, air, sky. So, destruction means separating all the elements and returning them to the original reservoir of these five elements in the Mahatatva. As I explained the example of the pot in the previous session, clay pot. The clay pot is formed or produced by combining earth in the form of clay and water and fire. So, clay is first mixed with water and then the pot is given shape and then it is baked in the fire. So, earth, water, fire, three are combined and the pot is produced by the potter. Now when it is destroyed, it means fire goes back to the fire element, water goes back to the water element, the reservoir of water element, and earth, the clay which is earth, nothing but earth, it returns, it is returned to the earthly reservoir. So, like that there is no destruction of the mind, intelligence, and the false ego because they always exist as subtle elements within the gross body as subtle body, bodily covering. So, the yogi is able to be aloof from the gross body and the subtle body.

**Content Type:** analogy

**Key Quote:** "If I think I am the body, then my satisfaction is satisfaction of the body."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of clothing, the speaker explains how detachment from the body leads to freedom from the desire for sense gratification, which is achieved through yoga.

And become completely immune to whatever is happening with the gross and subtle body without being affected or without worrying what is happening to me because he understands I am not this body, I am not the gross body, I am not the subtle body. It is like your dress. Supposing the dress has become old and sometimes a worn out dress may tear. So, do you think that, oh! I am suffering some injury? Just like if there is something which creates a tear in your skin, some sharp instrument. Something sharp spears in your hand, arm and then there is a cut. So now when you know you are not this body. Supposing there is a cut, now you have no body. And then there is a cut. So now when you know you are not this body. So I have seen, supposing the cloth tears, either it's worn out or it is pierced by some sharp instrument. If the cloth tears, does it mean that something has happened to you or something has happened to your cloth? If you distinctly know you are different from the cloth, which a matured person, an intelligent person will always be aware of that. I am not this cloth. Then nothing has happened to you when the cloth is torn. And if it is old and worn out, you discard this cloth and you take a new cloth. Exactly like that the yogi knows. The body itself is an external covering and one has to disidentify, I am not this body, I am spirit soul, spiritual person, personality, apart from the body. So, the yogic process helps a yogi to completely negate all these material coverings. The effect of the yogic process is, the effects of the material modes of nature draw the victim to indefatigable desires of enjoying matter. This desire for enjoying matter is because of the false identity that I am this body. If I think I am the body, then my satisfaction is satisfaction of the body. But if I realize I am not the body, then my happiness is not simply giving satisfaction to the senses, no. That is not going to make me happy. So, this false enjoyment by trying to satisfy the senses, external senses, is stopped by the yogic process.

**Key Quote:** "The conditioned soul is assaulted on all sides by maya."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how the senses constantly seek pleasure in the material world, leading to instability, and how yoga helps to withdraw from this pursuit.

So, then one escapes false enjoyment by following the yogic process. Every sense is busy searching for its food. That means eyes are looking for beautiful form, ears are searching for some sweet sound. Nose is looking for some nice fragrance, nice smell, like that. The conditioned soul is assaulted on all sides by maya. Material world is filled with all these different sounds, different forms, different smells, aromas, different tastes, different tasting type of edibles, and different types of objects which are very pleasing to the sense of touch. So, there is no chance to become steady in any pursuit of even searching for some pleasing sense object. There is no question of steadiness. Because always if something beautiful attracts the person due to the beautiful form, immediately there will be some sound or some smell or some sense of touch. So, nobody can pursue this. There is no sense object in a steady way. Whereas the yogic processes stop this complete pursuit of sense enjoyment and go within, go within.

### detachment, yoga, mystic power, Dhritarashtra

**Key Quote:** "Dhritarashtra by practicing the Ashtanga Yoga he had already become detached from everything material."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates how Narada advised Yudhishthira not to disturb Dhritarashtra because he had become detached through yoga and would leave his body by mystic power, burning it to ashes.

That is the actual yogic process. Now, Maharaj Yudhishtira was advised by his uncle, sorry, Maharaj Yudhishtira was advised by Narada not to disturb his uncle by attempting to bring him back home. Why? Because Dhritarashtra by practicing the Ashtanga Yoga he had already become detached from everything material. So, there will be no more any interest or attraction for Dhritarashtra to come and stay comfortably with Yudhishtira. He is beyond that. Nirguna means without reaction. The spiritual quality is distinguished from the material qualities by the word nirguna. Nirguna means the spiritual state where one is indifferent to all material attractions, all material objects, all material actions and reactions. One becomes indifferent, disinterested, completely aloof. The next verse, 57th verse. Sava adhyatanadrajan parata panchame ahani kalevaram hasyati svam tachabhasmi bhavishyati. The meaning of this verse is O king, he will quit his body most probably on the fifth day from today and his body will turn to ashes. So, Narada is telling that Dhritarashtra will perfect his yogic practice that he becomes detached and after detaching he will quit his body by his own mystic power and that mystic power will also enable him to burn the body to ashes, what he is leaving behind. The body will be burned to ashes by the self-generated fire by the yogic process itself. So, perfect yogis, they don't depend on somebody else to burn this body to dispose of the remnants after death or after quitting the body. No, they are able to generate the fire from within to burn the body and the spirit soul cannot be burned by fire. The spirit soul will leave the body by mystic power. So, that is explained here. So, Yudhishthira need not perform any funeral ceremony for Dhritarashtra because Dhritarashtra by the yogic process would perfectly be able to leave the body and also burn the body at the time of quitting, burn the body by self-generated fire. These are all very special facilities for the yogi, Ashtanga yogi.

### Gandhari's Sati rite, chaste wife, voluntary death

**Key Quote:** "for the woman the fire of separation from her husband is more intolerable than the fire of the burning of the husband's dead body so she decides to quit voluntarily and such quitting the body voluntarily is considered to be the most successful way to get her body into"
**Summary:** This segment explains Gandhari's decision to enter the fire of her dead husband, known as the Sati rite, highlighting it as a voluntary act of a chaste wife who finds separation from her husband more unbearable than death.

The meaning of this verse is, while outside observing her husband who will burn in the fire of mystic power along with his thatched cottage, his chaste wife Gandhari will enter the fire with rapt attention. So, now already Narada has told Yudhishthira, Dhritarashtra will follow the yogic process and quit the body and the body will be burnt by the self-generated fire through the mystic power. Now, along with Dhritarashtra's body burning, the thatched cottage in which he was sitting and performing his austerity or the practice itself will burn. And what will Gandhari do? She is not practicing any yoga. She is just faithfully as a chaste wife following her husband. So, Srila Prabhupada explains, Gandhari was an ideal chaste lady, a life companion of her husband. And therefore, when she saw her husband burning in the fire of mystic yoga along with his cottage of leaves, she despaired. Naturally, wife is very faithfully serving the husband and the husband quits, it's a big loss for the wife because she has always been with him as a chaste wife and she has been serving him. Now, what will she do when he is no longer present in the form as the husband? So, it says here, Srila Prabhupada explains, She left home after losing her 100 sons and in the forest she saw that her most beloved husband was also burning. She lost her sons in the battle of Krukshetra. Our husband also, he quit his body which was a self-generated fire, through mystic yoga practice. What will she do? So, Prabhupada says, Now she actually felt alone and followed her husband to death. She decided to also quit the body now. This entering of a chaste lady into the fire of a dead husband is called the sati rite. You would have heard this term sati, sati, sati ritual, sati rite. What is it? The wife has lost her husband and does not have any surviving sons. Such a wife, if she is a chaste woman, she will enter the fire of her dead husband and quit her body voluntarily and the action, this sati ritual or the sati rite, is considered to be the most perfect for a woman. How is it most perfect? Because Prabhupada says for the woman the fire of separation from her husband is more intolerable than the fire of the burning of the husband's dead body, so she decides to quit voluntarily and such quitting the body voluntarily is considered to be the most

**Summary:** This segment discusses the historical context of the Sati rite, emphasizing that it should be a voluntary act and condemning the practice of forcing widows to commit Sati as a criminal act.

successful way to get her body into per se, but it is considered a to be a and the death her whole life she is having a difficult period instead of releasing it she dies apart out of to perform sacrifices to help stay around her husband and her a coherent with his relationship to nothing else than that so it is sin he would say that in that sense in this four part of the biginating of a direct examination of the body is the Supreme enlightened much approved by the Vedas that she will have a glorious destination after quitting the body in this way. It is not suicide. Please don't think this is suicide. It appears like suicide which is voluntarily entering the fire even though her body still not completely deteriorated but she voluntarily enters fire procedurally is part of you have process of uncaregulated and then that which is much more beneficial it is take only which are different from the different other occasions fire and decides to quit her body along with her husband so that she is guaranteed of a brilliant wonderful future, a bright future. So, Sri la Prabhupada says in a later age this sati rite became an obnoxious criminal affair. It became criminal why? Because the ceremony was forced upon even an unwilling woman. See, mind you, it is totally voluntary for a chaste wife to enter the funeral pyre of her husband. It's totally voluntary. It should never be forced by anyone else. No one can, no one should force, no one has the right to force.

**Summary:** This segment explains that in the present age, the Sati rite is not possible for anyone to follow unless the wife feels the separation from her husband to be more burning than actual fire, and that by following her husband, she can attain liberation without separate spiritual practices.

but when people started forcing a widow, a woman, that became criminal. It is criminal to force somebody to die in this way. It is criminal. So, Sri la Prabhupada says in this present age, fallen age, it is not possible for anyone to follow the sati ritual as Gandhari did and others chaste women did in the past. Why? Because a chaste wife like Gandhari would feel the separation of her husband to be more burning than actual fire. Such a lady can actually observe the sati right voluntarily and there is no criminal being forced by anyone, so her destination will be a glorious destination because she is voluntarily quitting her body following her husband. That means she also desires liberation from material bondage and in following the footsteps of her husband who is also becoming liberated she will also attain liberation, so she doesn't have to separately practice. That is the grahastha dharma. The wife is chaste, she follows her husband especially in his spiritual duties or spiritual activities, she follows her husband and she simply gets the same benefit as the husband without

her having to actually practice the details of all the spiritual practices. So, this is the wonderful destination of Gandhari. The 59th verse, vidurasthu tad ascharyam nishamya kurunandana harsha shokayutastasmad gantatirtha nisevakah. The meaning of this verse is, Vidura being affected with delight and grief will then leave that place of sacred pilgrimage. Vidura is observing all this. He is gone with Dhritarashtra, Gandhari because he only was the inspiration for Dhritarashtra to quit home. So, he went with Dhritarashtra and he saw what did Dhritarashtra do? He followed Vidura's direction and he attained perfection and Gandhari followed as a chaste wife, she followed her husband. So, Vidura is delighted, but why is it described he was also having that grief? Prabhupada explains, Vidura was astonished to see the marvelous departure of his brother Dhritarashtra as a liberated yogi for in his past life, that is Dhritarashtra's past life, he was very much attached to materialism. Of course, the fact is that it was only due to Vidura that Dhritarashtra attained the desirable goal of life. So, Vidura was glad to learn about this Dhritarashtra attaining the ultimate goal that is liberation from material bondage, but Vidura was sorry that Vidura could not make Dhritarashtra a pure monk because he was feigned sobriety for his pure devotee. Why? Why Vidura could not make Dhritarashtra pure devotee? Because Dhritarashtra was inimical to the Pandavas who were all devotees of the Lord. Therefore Vidura could not make Dhritarashtra pure devotee.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that while devotees can guide and inspire, only the Lord can grant spiritual advancement and liberation, and that proper surrender to Krishna requires many lifetimes of understanding one's spiritual identity.

An offence at the feet of a Vaishnava is more dangerous than an offence at the feet of the Lord. Vidura was certainly very liberal to bestow mercy upon Dhritarashtra whose past life was very materialistic but ultimately the result of all such mercy depends on the will of the Lord who grants spiritual advancement, who grants spiritual liberation, who grants spiritual benefits. It's only the will of the Lord. It's only the Lord. Devotees may help, devotees may guide, devotees may direct, devotees may inspire but devotees cannot give anything. It is the Lord only who gives. Lord is completely under the control, in control of a spiritual potency and by spiritual potency the Lord gives spiritual advancement, spiritual benefits, spiritual liberation, spiritual engagement, everything. So Dhritarashtra attained liberation only but Vidura, sorry Dhritarashtra can, Dhritarashtra attained liberation only but he can attain the stage of devotional service after many many many such liberated states of life. So, bahu nam janma namante dhyana vanamaam prapadyate. One is able to properly surrender to Krishna only after many many lifetimes of living that stage of liberation. In proper understanding of one's spiritual identity, in relationship with Krishna. That relationship means, repenting, breathing in words, expressing self forced deeds, confession of great freedom in the spiritual realm, and knowing the divine gift and the real spiritual power, logging into the terms and forms of existence of our forest.

Yuriṣṭira kept his instruction in his heart and so was able to get to the fall lamentation. Yuriṣṭira was lamenting that my uncle left home and went away. I don't know where he has gone.

And therefore, Yuriṣṭira, keeping the instruction of Nārada in his heart, he became free from all lamentation. Now, Nārada is described here by Prabhupāda as an eternal spaceman. He is having a spiritual body, endowed by the Supreme Lord himself. He can travel in outer space of both the material and the spiritual worlds. He is free to travel anywhere without any restrictions and he can approach any planet, either in the material world or the spiritual sky. Spiritual sky are the Vaikuntha Lokas. In the material world, there are different kinds of upper planetary systems: Svarga Loka, Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, Brahmaloka, or the earthly planets, Bhūloka, Bhūvarloka, or even the lower planets, Atala, Vitala, Sutala, anywhere he can go. And why does he travel? He simply travels to preach the message of Kṛṣṇa about bhakti and to deliver people, to liberate people from material bondage.

**Key Quote:** "It is reserved for Great devotees"
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains why Vidura is addressed as Mahatma, emphasizing his spiritual realization and devotion.

Now Srila Prabhupada explains this. What is this poisoning and arson? In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "Due to Pandu's death at an early age, his minor children and widow were the object of special care by the elderly men, the family members of the family, especially Bhishma Deva and Mahatma Vidura." Vidura is addressed as Mahatma because he was not only very conscious of his responsibility as an elderly member of the family, but he was also spiritually self-realized, spiritually advanced, and self-realized after his traveling to pace the pilgrimage and inquiring from Maitreya Rishi and becoming spiritually enlightened. So therefore he is addressed as Mahatma Vidura. This Mahatma title is not for simply somebody great by some material estimation. No, it is reserved for great devotees.

**Summary:** The speaker quotes Bhagavad Gita to define a Mahatma as someone who has taken shelter of Krishna's internal potency and is engaged in pure devotional service.

According to the Bhagavad Gita, Mahatma anastumam partha Daiveem prakritim ashritah Bhajanti ananya manaso Gyaatva bhutadim abhyayam. According to the Bhagavad Gita, who is to be called a Mahatma? One who has taken shelter of Krishna's internal spiritual potency. And the symptom of having taken shelter of Krishna's internal potency is that such a person is always engaged in pure devotional service to Krishna without any interruption. So Vidura was such a pure devotee of Krishna. Therefore he is addressed as Mahatma Vidura.

**Key Quote:** "Dhritarashtra was Not treating the Pandavas Equally with his own sons"
**Summary:** The lecture explains Dhritarashtra's inner desire for his own sons to become emperors and his unequal treatment of the Pandavas, leading to Vidura's partiality towards them.

Vidura was more or less partial to the Pandavas. Due to their political position, the Pandavas were fatherless. Kunti was staying with her minor sons in the palace of Dhritarashtra. Dhritarashtra was the Ketakar king, but Dhritarashtra was not treating the Pandavas equally with his own sons because Dhritarashtra had an inner desire that somehow his own sons should become the emperors of the world and not the sons of Pandu, who are the rightful claimants to the throne of Hastinapura. So Duryodhana plotted to actually kill the Pandavas before they could actually become adults and supported his son Duryodhana in all his nefarious activities. So Srila Prabhupada explains, "Although Dhritarashtra was equally careful for the minor children of Maharaja Pandu, he was one of the intriguing parties who wanted to wash away the descendants of Pandu and replace them by raising his own sons to become rulers of the kingdom. Mahatma Vidura could follow this intrigue of Dhritarashtra and company, and therefore, even though he was a faithful servitor of his eldest brother Dhritarashtra, he did not like Dhritarashtra's political ambition for the sake of his own sons. Therefore, Vidura was very careful about the protection of the Pandavas and their widow mother Kunti. Thus he was, so to speak, partial to the Pandavas, preferring them to the sons of Dhritarashtra, although both of them were equally affectionate."

**Summary:** The speaker describes Vidura's careful balance in protecting the Pandavas while showing affection to both sides, and Dhritarashtra's policy of peaceful annihilation of the Pandavas.

In his ordinary eyes, see how Vidura is carefully, on the one hand, trying to protect the Pandavas. On the other hand, he is also showing equal affection to the Pandavas and Kauravas because both of them are sons of his two brothers. He was equally affectionate to both the camps of Nebus in the sense that he always chastised Duryodhana for his intriguing policy against his cousins. He always criticized his elder brother Dhritarashtra for his policy of encouragement to his sons. At the same time, he was always alert in giving special protection to the Pandavas. All these different activities of Vidura within the palace politics made him well known as partial to the Pandavas. Maharaj Yudhishthira has referred to the past history of Vidura before his going away from home for a prolonged pilgrim's journey. Maharaj Yudhishthira reminded Vidura that he was equally kind and partial to his grown up nephews even after the battle of Kurukshetra, a great family disaster. So Srila Prabhupada explains, "Before the battle of Kurukshetra, Dhritarashtra's policy was peaceful annihilation of his nephews. Peaceful annihilation means they should be eliminated in such a way that nobody will suspect any foul play."

**Summary:** The lecture narrates Dhritarashtra's plan to send the Pandavas to Varanavata and Vidura's tactful warning to Yudhishthira about the impending danger.

It should seem like they died somehow. And then because nobody is there to ascend the throne as descendants of Pandu, therefore Dhritarashtra's sons will become the claimants to the throne of Hastinapura. So this was Dhritarashtra's policy and plan. And what did Dhritarashtra do? He ordered Purochana to build a house at Varanavata. And when the building was finished, Dhritarashtra desired that his brother's family live there for some time because the Pandavas and Kauravas were sharing that palace in Hastinapura. So Dhritarashtra said to the Pandavas, "You can go and live there comfortably. This palace is for you separately, you can live." When the Pandavas were going there in the presence of all the members of the royal family, Vidura tactfully gave instructions to the Pandavas about the future plan of Dhritarashtra. The Pandavas did not know what was Dhritarashtra's plan, but Vidura knew, and Vidura gave instructions to Yudhishthira very, very tactfully about Dhritarashtra coming to know about it. So this is specifically described in the Mahabharata Adiparva 114.

**Key Quote:** "A weapon not made of steel Or any other material element Can be more sharp to kill an enemy"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Vidura's indirect warnings to Yudhishthira about the fire plot and the Pandavas' escape through a tunnel.

He indirectly hinted. What did he say? What did Vidura say to Yudhishthira? "A weapon not made of steel or any other material element can be more sharp to kill an enemy, and he who knows this is never killed." See, in the form of a riddle, he is telling something to Yudhishthira. That is to say, Vidura hinted that the party of the Pandavas was being sent to Varanavata to be killed, and thus he warned Yudhishthira to be very careful in their new residential palace. He also gave indications of fire and said that fire cannot extinguish the soul but can annihilate the material body, but one who protects the soul can live. Kunti could not follow such indirect conversations between Maharaj Yudhishthira and Vidura, and thus when she inquired from her son about the purport of the conversation, Yudhishthira replied to Kunti Devi that from the talks of Vidura, it was understood that there was a hint of fire proceeding later on. Vidura came in disguise to the Pandavas and informed them that the housekeeper was going to set fire to the house on the fourteenth night of the waning moon. It was an intrigue of Dhritarashtra that the Pandavas might die altogether with their mother. By his warning, that is Vidura's warning, Pandavas escaped through a tunnel underneath the earth so that their escape was also unknown to Dhritarashtra, so much so that after setting the fire, the Kauravas were so certain of the death of the Pandavas that Dhritarashtra performed the last rites of their death.

**Key Quote:** "Vidura played A Fair role In the Palace politics"
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by highlighting Vidura's fair role in palace politics, his efforts to prevent injustice, and his constant protection of the Pandavas, comparing it to a bird protecting its eggs.

With great cheerfulness during the morning period, all the members of the palace became overwhelmed with lamentation, but Vidura did not become so because Vidura had knowledge that the Pandavas were alive somewhere. There are many such instances of calamities, and in each of them, Vidura gave protection to the Pandavas. On one hand, and on the other, he tried to restrain his brother Dhritarashtra from such intriguing policies. See how Vidura played a fair role in the palace politics. He tried to prevent his brother Dhritarashtra from doing injustice to the Pandavas, and he also kept warning the Pandavas so that Pandavas might not be killed by Dhritarashtra's intrigues. Therefore, it is described here that Vidura was always partial to the Pandavas, just as a bird protects its eggs by its wing. It is natural when a bird lays an egg so that the egg can eventually mature and hatch into a young one. So before the egg hatches, the bird has to protect that egg against attack by enemies or by some other birds which may come and, or some reptiles can come and eat away the egg. So the bird has to protect. So like that, Vidura, in order to protect the Pandavas against being killed by Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana and the Kauravas, he had to protect them very, very carefully. So this was the special protection of Vidura, and therefore Yudhishthira makes a reference to this after Yudhishthira returned after the battle of Kurukshetra, how because of Vidura's protection, Yudhishthira and his brothers and even Kunti were actually protected against being completely killed and eliminated by Dhritarashtra and company.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the background of Vidura's departure from the palace, focusing on the insult he received from Duryodhana for being the son of a Shudrani and his attempts to give good advice to Dhritarashtra.

The palace where Yudhishthira was staying and ruling from. So in the Purport, Shrila Prabhupada says about Vidura's travel, Vidura went out from the palace to detach himself from household affairs, especially political intrigues. As referred to here and before, he was practically insulted by Duryodhana's calling him a son of a Shudrani. If you remember the background, Vidura was staying in the palace with Dhritarashtra while Dhritarashtra was the caretaker king before the battle of Kurukshetra. And Vidura as a well-wisher and a younger brother of Dhritarashtra, a step-brother, but still nevertheless an affectionate and younger brother, step-brother of Dhritarashtra, Vidura was giving very good advice to Dhritarashtra. And Vidura was very, very intelligent. The fact is Vidura had appeared as the son of a Shudrani. And Duryodhana found Vidura to be not favorable for his nefarious activities in plotting to kill the Pandavas. Even though Duryodhana had the support of his father, still Vidura was advising Dhritarashtra to be favorable. And this was not to the liking of Duryodhana.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the details of Vidura's birth and lineage, explaining how he was considered the son of a Shudrani (maidservant) and therefore not entitled to inheritance.

So Duryodhana at one stage, he insulted Vidura by calling him the son of a Shudrani. And Srila Prabhupada says, Although it is not out of place to talk loosely in the case of one's grandmother, that is Vidura's mother, although a Shudrani, was the grandmother of Duryodhana. How was Vidura's mother a Shudrani, the grandmother of Duryodhana? Duryodhana's father, Dhritarashtra, Dhritarashtra's mothers were the wives of Dhritarashtra's father. Dhritarashtra's father had actually... two wives, Ambika and Ambalika, Pichitravirya, Dhritarashtra's father, was having two wives. And Dhritarashtra's mother, Ambika, her maidservant was a Shudrani. And Vidura was born out of this maidservant of the queen. So therefore, Dhritarashtra was the son of the king and queen, but Vidura was the son of the maidservant of the queen. Therefore, Vidura was considered the son of a maidservant, a Shudrani.

**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain how Dhritarashtra valued Vidura's advice, which was not to Duryodhana's liking, and how the insult from Duryodhana led Vidura to renounce his position and prepare for a life of renunciation.

Therefore, he was not entitled to an inheritance in the royal kingdom. So, Dhritarashtra was maintaining Vidura very affectionately, very nicely in the palace. And he was giving much value to the valuable property of Vidura, valuable advice being given by Vidura, which is not to the liking of Duryodhana. So, Srila Prabhupada says Vidura's mother, although a Shudrani, was a grandmother of Duryodhana and funny talks are sometimes allowed between grandmother and grandchildren. So, even if Duryodhana's remark might have been considered as a humorous remark, but because the remark was an actual fact, it was unpalatable talk to Vidura when Vidura was told that he was son of a Shudrani by Duryodhana. Then, because it was an actual fact, it was unpalatable to Vidura and it was accepted as a direct insult. So, Vidura therefore decided to quit his paternal house

and prepare for the renounced order of life. This is because Vidura is alert as to his ultimate spiritual responsibility. So, this preparatory stage is called Vanaprasta Ashrama or retired life for traveling and visiting the holy places on the surface of the earth. In the holy places of India, like Vrindavan, Haridwar, Jagannath Puri and Prayag, there are many great devotees and there are still free kitchen houses for purification. There are many persons who desire to advance spiritually. This is one special feature of India or Bharata Varsha that people are spiritually enlightened. Therefore, they travel to holy places and take association of great devotees in those holy places and reside in faith. In the holy places of India, there are many great devotees and there are still free kitchen houses called Kshatras. Shri La Prabhupada says, Maharaj Yudhishthira was inquisitive to learn whether Vidura maintained himself by the mercy of the free kitchen houses.

We are going to begin a new chapter, chapter 14 of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The chapter is entitled, "The Disappearance of Lord Krishna." This is the speciality of the Bhagavatam. Bhagavatam topics are not necessarily chronologically described. Chronologically means first this happened, then this happened, then something else happened, then something else happened, then something else happened. No, the sequence of description in the Bhagavatam follows the questions and answers, the questions and the answers. So, according to the question being asked, the answer is given. And the answer is given with support of the historical incidents, describing certain incidents, describing certain important principles illustrated in the life of great devotees or taught by the activities of the Supreme Lord in his various incarnations, etc. So, the disappearance of Lord Krishna is described in the first canto. The appearance of Lord Krishna is described in the tenth canto. This is the peculiarity of the Srimad Bhagavatam. And not only Bhagavatam, even the other Puranas also, there is description of different topics according to the questions raised and according to the sequence in which the answers are given to questions, questions as the questions are raised and the message is important even if one is not able to strictly follow the chronology, the sequence of events very strictly important.

So it is explained in this verse that Yudhishthira sent Arjuna to Dvaraka to find out what is the next program of the Lord. So Srila Prabhupada explains, as stated in Bhagavad Gita, the Lord descended on earth for the protection of the faithful and annihilation of the empires. So after the battle of Kurukshetra and establishment of Maharaja Yudhishthira as the emperor of the entire world, the mission of the Lord was complete. The Pandavas, especially Sri Arjuna, were our eternal companions of the Lord and therefore Arjuna went to Dvaraka to hear from the Lord of his next program of work.

So in the purport Shri Ram Prabhupada says, what are these fearful omens that Yudhishthira is observing when Arjuna is away from Hastinapura, has gone to Dvaraka to inquire about Krishna's next program. So Prabhupada says in the purport, Sri Krishna, the supreme personality of Godhead is as a Pontifex. At the time of Arjuna's visit to Kulidwaraka as the principal of the group of Varunachala and Shri Krishna says that I have come to tell you that these are all possible omens and you have seen all the powerful and powerful things that come from far and wide to the extent that you go into the universe. But Krishna is not a complete and infinite Omens and he does not exist and we will not ever find any of that things that come from far and wide. The only thing you do is keep following the Gesture of Krishna's Omens of the Great Omens and you will be able to take that Omens of the Great Omens. The Omens of the Great Omens are the Omens of the Vishwara and Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "billions of suns are created by Krishna and he only annihilates everything and everything all his creation and destruction happens within one breathing period of the incarnation of Krishna called Maha Vishnu."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain Srila Prabhupada's purport on the second verse, describing the power of Krishna and Maha Vishnu, and the importance of the sun for material prosperity.

They are the Omens of the Shri Krishna and Krishna's will. Krishna's will is the highest form of power. Billions of suns are created by Krishna and he only annihilates everything and everything, all his creation and destruction happens within one breathing period of the incarnation of Krishna called Maha Vishnu. Maha Vishnu breathes out universes, universes remain as long as Maha Vishnu does not inhale. So, he breathes out, after some time he inhales, when he inhales everything that that is created is destroyed and enters his transcendental body. Now, in the material world, the sun is considered to be the source of all productivity and material energy and only due to the sun can we have our necessities of life. That is a fact, you may think. We may not be aware of this, we may not be able to figure this out, but the shastras explain this. Therefore, during the personal presence of the Lord on the earth, all paraphernalia for our peace and prosperity, especially religion and knowledge, were in full display because of the Lord's presence.

When Krishna was present, everything was perfect, everything was very nice for everyone in the entire earth planet. Maharaja Yudhishthira observed some discrepancies in his kingdom. Now, when Krishna is present, everything is fine. Now, why suddenly some discrepancies are appearing? Maharaja Yudhishthira is perfectly ruling. So, Yudhishthira is observing the discrepancies, is indicative of what? He suspected, Yudhishthira suspected disappearance of Lord Krishna. Otherwise, there would have been no possibility of any discrepancies. And also, Arjuna had not brought back the news of Krishna's next program. That was another observation by Yudhishthira. Long time Arjuna is gone, he has not come back. And these fearful omens are the same.

of livelihood. The purport explains this, in the purport, when civilization disconnected from the loving relation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, symptoms like changes of seasonal regulations, foul means of livelihood, greed, anger and fraudulence become rampant. If people in this, even in this material world, are not following the devotional principles, the directions of the bona fide scriptures, they don't follow, then people become corrupted and nature will not function properly. The change of seasonal regulations refers to one season's atmosphere become manifest in another season. For example, we have experience of this now, nowadays especially, the rainy season being transferred to autumn. Autumn is not supposed to rain, autumn is after the rainy season is over and the rains have stopped, but what if in autumn suddenly there is heavy rain? This is called seasonal irregularity or the fructification of fruits and flowers from one season in another season. Normally we get mango fruit in summer, but what if mango fruit starts appearing in the summer and it is not supposed to rain in winter? That is a seasonal irregularity. Also Srila Prabhupada says, a godless man is invariably greedy, angry and fraudulent. So good qualities cannot be generated in a person or

Such a man, a godless person who's full of greed, anger and corruption can earn his livelihood by any means, black or white and such godless people don't care how they earn their livelihood, they'll adopt even unfair means if they are unable to earn by a fair means. During the reign of Maharaja Yudhishthira all the above symptoms were conspicuous by their absence, that means in Yudhishthira was properly ruling and Krishna was present, everybody was following all the principles of the Dharma very nicely and they were nicely engaged, there was no scarcity, there was no bad behavior, there was no seasonal irregularities, nothing. But Maharaja Yudhishthira was astonished to experience even a slight change in the godly atmosphere of his kingdom, he detected and is carefully observing that there are some changes taking place, why? Therefore he at once suspected the disappearance of the Land of Future, thought, the only reason why these discrepancies are being observed by me is only because the disappearance of Krishna.

from where he comes. Now what is the meaning of foul means of livelihood? It means deviation from one's occupational duty. There are prescribed duties meant for the Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra. But if a Brahmana without doing his Brahmanical duties, he performs the duties of Kshatriya or Vaishya, Shudra, then that is called foul means of livelihood. Or somebody becomes too greedy for wealth. That is also incorrect, improper. Such a person will become greedy for wealth only if he has no higher objective in life. The goal of life is spiritual realization. But if somebody forgets that goal or misses that goal or does not care for that goal, then such a person has to be affected by greed, anger, corruption, etc. To remain free from all these bad qualities is to be Krishna conscious.

**Key Quote:** "Material advancement of civilization means advancement of the reactions of the three four miseries due to celestial influence earthly reactions and bodily or mental pains"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of the threefold miseries (tapatraya) - divyaan, bhavmaan, and daihikaan - and how material advancement often leads to increased suffering.

Naravyagra, three-fold miseries, miseries due to three different causes, which is always there in material existence. Tapatraya, in Kannada they say tapatraya. What is this tapatraya? Tapa means miseries, traya means three kinds. Three kinds of fundamental miseries are always part of this material existence and they have been described here as divyaan, bhavmaan, daihikaan. Divyaan is the celestial influences, supernatural powers over which you have no control, just like rain. Too much rain or no rain. Divyaan is misery for people on the earth. They have suffered in so many ways. Or too much heat or too much cold. Or too much of wind. All these are sufferings. Earthquake, tsunami, volcanoes, so many celestial influences. Daihikaan is due to earthly reactions, different kinds of reactions due to other living entities. Other living entities, they give us trouble in so many ways, mosquitoes and wild animals, enemies and all kinds of pathogens, infectious germs. So they give us so much of trouble, miseries we suffer, and bodily pains, our own body, indigestion or some malfunctioning of some organ or some injury or some fatigue or some deficiency in some senses, we suffer in so many ways. So all are actually very dangerous. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "Material advancement of civilization means advancement of the reactions of the three four miseries due to celestial influence, earthly reactions, and bodily or mental pains."

**Key Quote:** "Material advancement means advancement of the reactions of the three four miseries"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts modern life with its complications and occupational hazards to a simpler, less problematic past.

So this is a very important statement we have to understand and we have to internalize. We are very proud of material advancement. What is it that actually has brought about this advancement? Advancement, material advancement means, Prabhupada says, "Advancement of the reactions of the three four miseries." So there are more miseries. People used to live simple life because of which there were less dangers, less accidents, less complications, less problems. You see many of the diseases called psychosomatic diseases, they are all occupational hazards. Middle-age and occupation itself did not exist, so where is the question of any occupational hazard when the occupation doesn't exist? For example, people sit in front of a terminal and work for eight hours or ten hours continuously and then they develop some back pain, neck problem, eye problem, or they develop some headache and some of these are chronic problems. They are not just coming and disappearing after some time. No, day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year they work like that and then they develop permanent problem with the neck or with the back. So or with the hands, fingers. I know a person who keeps on typing, was typing, typing, typing and the finger movement itself has become very painful and doctors told, "No more you can use your fingers in that way." So the person is skilled in typing and if it's told you cannot type, you should not type, how will he earn his livelihood? What will he do to earn his living? So many problems. There is no need of typing in the last about fifteen hundred years back. So they had simple occupation and they will live in a simple life, so they didn't have any of the complications that we have in the modern times.

The aggregate result is the agony of the body and the mind. Whichever the type of misery ultimately it affects our body or our mind or both. Man-made material science cannot do anything to counteract these threefold miseries. These miseries have always existed. It's not in modern times we have eliminated some of the miseries, no, they've always existed and they continue to harass us in this material world. So Srila Prabhupada says, "They are all punishments from the superior energy of Maya under the direct advice of Upadhyaya." This is the clear statement of the pray or not, we are all punished by the laws of nature. Laws of nature are the same restriction of supreme law. We violate, we misbehave and therefore we are punished by the laws of nature. Laws of nature are fair, they're perfectly just, but we are the ones who are individually and collectively violating the laws and we are to suffer the consequences.

body. This is called the science of nimitta. In the Vedic literature there is a, there is a whole compilation of certain symptoms which forebode undesirable happenings, like for example the left side of Yudhishthira's body is quivering, is shaking and there is also quivering in the arms and the eyes and the thighs again and again. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "Material existence is full of undesirables. Things you do not want are forced upon us by some superior energy and we do not see that these undesirables are on the grip of the three modes of material nature." Nature is working, three gunas are always acting. We don't have control over the gunas. The gunas are forcing upon us their influence, sometimes desirable, sometimes undesirable. When a man's eyes, arms and thighs are all quivering constantly, one must know that something is going to happen which are undesirable. Without your movement of the eye, the eye is quivering, is shaking without your moment, then it is to be understood that something undesirable is going to happen in the near future. These undesirables are compared to a fire in a forest. Why? No one goes into the forest to set fires, but fires automatically take place in the forest creating inconceivable calamities for the living beings of the forest. When there's a forest fire there's so much destruction and so many living entities are killed, burnt alive, roasted in the forest fire when they cannot escape. Such a fire cannot be extinguished by human efforts. The fire can be extinguished only by the mercy of the Lord who sends clouds to pour water on the forest. When there's a torrential rain, a big rain cloud pours heavily down water on the forest, the portion where there is fire spreading, then the fire can be extinguished, otherwise there's no possibility of any human intervention. Similarly undesirable happenings in life cannot be checked by individuals. Such miseries can be removed only by the mercy of the Lord who sends his bona fide representatives to enlighten human beings and thus save them from all calamities. Srila Prabhupada has come, he's come to save us from all these calamities by Krishna consciousness. That's the way to receive the mercy of the Lord, chanting Hare Krishna and doing it as directed by Prabhupada, by the representative of Krishna. He teaches exactly what to do, how to do it and if you follow sincerely, faithfully, we will definitely overcome all undesirables and will be successful ultimately in our life in going back to God. I'll stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of Srimad Bhagavatam 1.14.12, explaining Yudhishthira's concern about Krishna's disappearance based on observed bad omens and Arjuna's delayed return.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing verses 12 to 16 of the 14th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This chapter deals with the topic of Disappearance of Lord Krishna. The 12th verse: Shivai Shodhyantam Adityam Abhirauti Analanana Mamanga Sarameyoyam Abhirebhati Abhiruvat. The meaning of this verse is: Just see, O Bhima, how the she-jackal cries at the rising sun and vomits fire, and how the dog barks at me fearlessly. So, in the purport, Shri Leprava says, these are words spoken by Yudhishthira to Bhima. Yudhishthira is observing some bad omens, and he's conjecturing that it may indicate the disappearance of Krishna. But, he has sent Arjuna to Dwaraka to find out Krishna's next program, and Arjuna has not returned for 7 months. So Yudhishthira is becoming concerned, what could be the reason why Arjuna has not returned? Is everything alright in Dwaraka? Has the Lord left this earth planet? This is the concern of Yudhishthira.

**Key Quote:** "In this material world always there is consideration of auspicious symptoms and inauspicious symptoms."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the Vedic science of Nimitta, differentiating between auspicious and inauspicious signs, and emphasizing the scriptural basis for recognizing omens, distinguishing it from superstition.

So he is telling Bhima about the bad omens that he is observing. So, in the purportional pravapa says just one sentence, these are some bad omens indicating something undesirable in the near future. There is a science in the Vedic literature called science of nimitta. Nimitta means certain indications by which we can say we can expect something auspicious to happen, or some other indications which indicate to us that something inauspicious is going to happen. So, in this material world, there is always consideration of auspicious symptoms and inauspicious symptoms. In the spiritual world, there is all auspiciousness; there is no inauspiciousness. So, this difference always exists between the material world and the spiritual world. Besides that, this science of Nimitta is not some superstitious belief as sometimes people may think. Modern man thinks that if the scriptures describe the crying of the she-jackal is inauspicious at the time of the rising of the sun, then people may dismiss it as something superstitious. Well, some people do have some superstitious beliefs which are not based on scriptures, that is all right. But if the scriptures are informing us of some inauspicious happenings, that we can expect undesirables in the near future by some bad omens, and they are very specific. It is not that I think it is bad or somebody else thinks it is not so bad. No, it is actually universally true, these bad omens. So, some of these bad omens are being observed by Yudhishthira and he is indicating them to Bhima.

**Key Quote:** "O Bhima Sena, tiger amongst men, now useful animals like cows are passing me on my left side and lower animals like the asses are circumambulating me."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the 13th verse, focusing on Yudhishthira's observations of unusual animal behavior as bad omens, and highlighting the importance of living in harmony with nature and respecting all living beings.

In the 13th verse, Yudhishthira continues to speak to Bhima and tell him about the bad omens he is observing. The meaning of this 13th verse: O Bhima Sena, tiger amongst men, now useful animals like cows are passing me on my left side and lower animals like the asses are circumambulating me. My horses appear to weep upon seeing me. These are all some of the inauspicious symptoms. Now see the close relationship between the people and the domestic animals. The horses appear to weep upon seeing me. That means they cared for the animals, not just in terms of taking some service from them, but also for their welfare, for their well-being, so the horses are weeping upon seeing their master, means they are also foreseeing something inauspicious is going to happen. So it is said in the scriptures that dogs can see ghosts, and if there's a ghost attack on somebody, the dogs will bark or make a sound in a particular way which is different from the usual barking of the dogs, a whining sound, so that indicates that dogs are foreboding some inauspicious bad happenings. So these are all very much true as explained in the scriptures, and these can be experienced if people learn how to live in harmony with nature. That means in harmony with nature means not to ill-treat or unnecessarily harm any other living being in any type of body.

**Key Quote:** "Not to harm anyone even the lower animals or the insignificant creatures."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Jada Bharat to illustrate the importance of non-violence and avoiding entanglement, even with seemingly insignificant creatures, to maintain spiritual focus.

This is very, very important to note, not to harm anyone. Even the lower animals or the insignificant creatures, like in the Bhagavatam there's a description that there was one saintly person, my name Jada Bharat, that was described in the fifth canto. He was highly enlightened, he was a pure devotee, but because he was misled by some happening in his past life, he became entangled in caring for one baby deer who lost its mother, and being thus entangled, he missed the opportunity at the time of death to think of Krishna, to remember the Supreme Lord, and therefore in this particular future life, he was extra cautious not to get entangled in something which is distracting in this world now. So he was very, very careful in conducting himself in such a way that he would not show any interest in any material activities or material happenings, but when he was walking on the ground, he was careful not to stamp even upon an ant that was passing. He was paying moeten to avatar to see vipassana and Giri 봤sān, he was a pure devotee.

**Key Quote:** "A pure devotee does not want to harm anyone even an insignificant creature like an ant."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the devotee's compassion and ability to see the presence of Krishna in all living beings, connecting this to Yudhishthira's sensitivity to the horses' behavior as a sign of impending calamity.

This is natural for a pure devotee. A pure devotee does not want to harm anyone, even an insignificant creature like an ant. This is very, very striking because that enlightened state enables one to see the part and parcel of Krishna, the living being, the tiny spirit soul in every type of body, every type of creature, in hundred habían saw and every type of body and ninety type of creature, every type of living entity, whatever be the body. Of course, we are not so careful when we walk on the ground, and we do commit some minor sins if we stamp on some ant or some insignificant insect while walking on the ground. And for all these type of minor sins, we have to perform some atonement, prayas chitta, so that these sinful reactions will not come in the way of our ultimately going back to Godhead. But those who are enlightened, they don't want to unnecessarily kill even when they are walking, even some insignificant creature. So similarly, Yudhishthira is pointing out to Bhima, my horses appear to weep upon seeing me. Who would care for a horse in this way other than a devotee? He is noticing that how the horses are responding when he is passing in front of them. Yudhishthira Maharaj is noticing that. They appear to weep upon seeing me, which means that they are indicating something inauspicious is going to happen.

### bad omens, natural disasters, calamity, Yudhishthira's observations

**Key Quote:** "Just see, pigeon is like a messenger of death the shrieks of the owls and their rival crows make my heart tremble it appears that they want to make a void of the whole universe some big calamity is going to happen."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the bad omens mentioned in verses 14-16, including unusual bird behavior, atmospheric disturbances, and violent weather, all indicating an impending calamitous event, and concludes by reiterating Yudhishthira's concern.

The 14th verse: viśvam vai ABOUT 10 0 the beginning of this Netflix words, just see… the pigeon is like a messenger of death. The shrieks of the owls and their rival crows make my heart tremble. It appears that they want to make a void of the whole universe. Some big calamity is going to happen, that's what all these symptoms are indicating, external symptoms in nature. They are very much living in harmony with nature, so they can notice specifically the shrieks of the owls, they are of a different type of sound, not the usual sound that they make when everything is normal. The 15th verse: Dhoomra Disha Paridhaya ha Kampate bhū sahādra vihi nirgātaś ca mahāṁ sthāta sākam ca sthanayit nubhī Dhoomra Disha Paridhaya ha Kampate bhū sahādra vihi nirgātaś ca mahāṁ sthāta sākam ca sthanayit nubhī. The meaning of this verse: Just see how the smoke encircles the sky. It appears that the earth and mountains are throbbing. Just hear the cloudless thunder and see the bolts from the blue. All these are indications of something calamitous that's going to happen, symptoms in the sky, symptoms on the surface of the earth, and symptoms in one's own body, that will come later in the later verses. The 16th verse, the meaning is: The wind blows violently blasting dust everywhere and creating darkness. Clouds are raining everywhere with bloody disasters. So the violent blowing of the wind blasting dust is also a sign of something inauspicious or calamitous that's going to happen. So these are all controlled. It is not simply something is accidentally or coincidentally happening, no, these are all definite symptoms and these are definite, a cent percent you can be sure that something calamitous is going to happen. Therefore Yudhishthira is particularly pointing out all these to Bhima.

**Key Quote:** "The calves do not suck the teats of the cows, nor do the cows give milk. They are standing crying, tears in their eyes."
**Summary:** The speaker explains verse 19, focusing on the distress of cows and bulls as a bad omen, highlighting the importance of cows in Vedic culture.

So, Yudhishthira Maharaj is describing to Bhima the bad omens that he is observing. Rivers are disturbed, ponds and reservoirs of water are disturbed. How they are so sensitive to note all these indications of something inauspicious or undesirable that is going to happen. People were living in harmony with nature. This is the point I mentioned in the earlier session and I am repeating that, that we are meant to live according to a certain design of the Supreme Lord in this material world. People have become indifferent to nature. Of course, they suffer calamities and they do take note of that. But then, even before a calamity occurs, the bad omens or the symptoms of such calamitous happenings in the future, that nobody is able to, most people are not able to recognize that. It is common knowledge in the Vedic times. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj is asking Bhima, what is this extraordinary time? What is going to happen? The 19th verse, na pibanti sthanam vatsa, na duhyanti ca matara, rudanti ashrumukha gaavo, na hrishyanti hrishabhavraje. The meaning of this verse is, "The calves do not suck the teats of the cows, nor do the cows give milk. They are standing crying, tears in their eyes." And, the bhima says, what is going to happen? What is happening? Then, they have had these long cuckoo calls, and the bulls take no pleasure in the pasturing grounds.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "In the Bhagavad Gita it is particularly said, Gauraksha, special mention is given that it is the duty of householders to give special protection to the cows."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the importance of cow protection in Vedic culture, emphasizing the special care and protection cows deserve, referencing Bhagavad Gita.

Especially in the Vedic culture, the cows and the calves and the bulls were treated by the people who owned them, who reared them, as their own children. This is very important. Among all the domestic animals, the cows were treated as seriously, as nicely, as caringly as their own children. And in the Bhagavad Gita it is particularly said, Gauraksha, special mention is given that it is the duty of householders to give special protection to the cows, though one should never harm any other creature, still specifically the cows had to be given special extra care, extra protection than the other animals, domestic animals. So Yudhishthira is marred, marking, cows do not suck the teeth of the cows, why? Because the cows are not giving milk. And why are they not giving milk? Because they are standing there crying tears in their eyes, something calamitous is going to happen. The cows are also sensing and Yudhishthira is noticing this. And the bulls, they used to happily go to the pasturing grounds and graze, but now they are not taking any pleasure in grazing. They seem to be disinterested. There are also four boardings on calamitous happening.

**Key Quote:** "Deities seem to be crying in the temple, lamenting and perspiring."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses verse 20, describing the deities in the temples as crying and the overall atmosphere as devoid of beauty and happiness, foreshadowing a major calamity.

The 20th verse, Daivathani Rudantiva Svidyanti Hi Ucchalanticha Ime Janapada Grama Purodhyana Akara Ashram. Ima Janapada Grama Purodhyana Akara Ashram. Ima Janapada Grama Purodhyana Akara Ashram. Ima Janapada Grama Purodhyana Akara Ashram. Ima Janapada Grama Purodhyana Akara Ashram Aaha. Brashta Shriyo Niranandaha, Niranandaha Kimmagha Darsha Yantinaha. The meaning of this verse is that deities seem to be crying in the temple, lamenting and perspiring. See even the deities are not just some statues in the temples. They are actually personalities. Verses 10 and 11. He was a tactician. The Prophet is also called a tactician. who are personally present and only in advanced devotee can see the deities seem to be crying in the temples. And these deities also Yudhishthira Maharaj is saying they seem about to leave the temple and go away. All the cities, villages, towns, gardens, mines and hermitages are now devoid of beauty and bereft of all happiness. The entire atmosphere is very sad. There is a sadness that is spread everywhere and natural beauty is absent in gardens, mines, hermitages that natural beauty is missing now. And there seems to be no happiness anywhere. I do not know what sort of calamities are now awaiting us. Yudhishthira Maharaj is telling Bhima. What kind of calamities are we going to face now? We do not know. But certainly there is going to be some major calamity.

**Summary:** The speaker explains verse 21, highlighting the significance of Krishna's presence and the auspicious marks on His feet, referencing Kunti Devi's prayer in the first canto.

The twenty-fifth day of the month is the day of the Lord Krishna. The first verse, the meaning of these verses, I think that all these earthly disturbances indicate some greater lost to the good fortune of the world. Why is he telling this? Why is Yudhishthira Maharaj telling this? The first verse, because in the next part of the verse he's telling the world was fortunate to have been marked with the footprints of the lotus feet of the lord these signs indicate that this will no longer be as long as Krishna was present on the earth the footprints when the lord used to walk the footprints of the lord made impression on the soft ground because the lord's personality is very special as compared to other human beings on our palms there are some lines but Krishna's palms there'll be no lines like this there'll be some special impressions Krishna's feet the sole of Krishna's feet the bottom of Krishna's feet there will be some special marks that's indicated here there is a verse in the 8th chapter of the first canto 39th verse kunti devi is addressing Krishna and she's offering a beautiful prayer which indicates what are the impressions on the feet of the lord underneath the feet of the lord kunti devi is telling oh gadhadhara Krishna our kingdom is now being marked by the impressions of your feet and therefore it appears beautiful but when you leave it will no longer be so so Krishna's presence Krishna is walking on the ground and leaving behind the spirit of Krishna and she's offering a special impression of his feet are all auspicious in every way for the prosperity of the entire world so in the purport to this particular verse Prabhupada says there are certain particular marks on the feet of the lord would distinguish the lord from others the marks of a flag a thunderbolt and an instrument to drive an elephant umbrella lotus disc

**Summary:** The speaker continues to discuss the auspiciousness of Krishna's presence and the impact of His footprints on the earth, emphasizing the loss felt after His disappearance and the decline of prosperity.

etc. are on the bottom of the Lord's feet. See all these symbols are there, impressions are there, these marks are impressed upon the soft dust of the land where the Lord traverses. The land of Hastinapura was thus marked while Lord Shri Krishna was there with the Pandavas and the kingdom of the Pandavas thus flourished by such auspicious signs. It's not simply some decorative marks, no, there is very significant good sign of such marks left behind on the soft dust when the Lord traverses the land of Hastinapura, the Lord traverses the ground while walking. So when Krishna was there with the Pandavas the kingdom of the Pandavas was flourishing with so much of prosperity just because of the auspicious signs left behind by Krishnas traversing the ground. Also Mother Earth is particularly making a statement in the sixteenth chapter of the first canto Bhagavatam it is mentioned Mother Earth is telling I was endowed with specific powers to supersede the fortune of all the three planetary systems by being decorated with the impressions of the flag Thunderbolt elephant driving rod and lotus flower which is signs of the lotus feet of the Lord under the Lord's feet there are some impressions which form a sign of anticipate that elder could have come into the Lord's power these four are mentioned again here by Prabhupada by Mother Earth what Prabhupada mentioned in the earlier verse flag thunderbolt elephant driving rod and lotus flower these are the signs underneath the feet of the Lord Krishna but at the end when I felt I was so fortunate mother earth felt very fortunate that Krishna when he is walking on the ground he is living behind his impressions so mother earth considered herself very very very fortunate but when she was thinking she is very very fortunate the Lord left me and went away this after the disappearance of the Lord mother earth is feeling the separation so the beauty Prabhupada says the beauty and opportunity of the Lord Krishna is very very fortunate the Lord Krishna is very very fortunate of the world can be enhanced by the grace of the Lord and not by any man-made planning so when Krishna was present on this earth the impressions of the special sign of his lotus feet was stamped on the dust and as a result of this specific grace the whole earth was made as perfect as possible so after Krishna disappearance people began to feel the difference that the prosperity is no longer going to be there because Krishna has left this world and stop here thank you very much

So Madhu dynasty, Bhoja dynasty, and so on. So it is said elsewhere in the tenth canto, Krishna was the king of 101 clans of the Yadu dynasty. Krishna was the chief. So there were so many clans and Krishna was the chief of all those, primarily because all of them were heading towards the Yadu dynasty. The members of those clans of the Yadu dynasty, they were all devotees of Krishna, pure devotees of Krishna. So Krishna descended to display his pastimes along with his associates from the spiritual world. Of course, not all are associates. Some of them are associates. Some of them are joining Krishna's pastimes after becoming eligible to go back to Godhead. So Yudhishthira is enquiring first of all about the well-being of all those clans of the Yadu dynasty, whether they are all doing well from Arjuna because Arjuna had gone to Dwarka to find out about Krishna's next program and Arjuna has written.

The meaning of these two verses. Yudhishthira to Arjuna specifically is asking about the different relatives of Krishna living with him in Dwaraka. Particularly, the mention is made about Balaram, the personality of Godhead, who is also the protector of all devotees. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, Hastinapura, the capital of the Pandavas, was situated somewhere near present New Delhi, and the kingdom of Ugrasena was situated in Mathura. While returning to Delhi from Dwaraka, Arjuna must have visited the city of Mathura, and therefore, the inquiry about the king of Mathura is valid. Arjuna is returning from Dwaraka, has returned from Dwaraka, to Hastinapura, which is New Delhi. So on the way, he would have passed through Mathura, so he's inquiring about Mathura.

### Balarama, Vishnu Tattva, expansions of Krishna, Prakasha Vigraha

**Key Quote:** "Because Lord Balarama is the immediate expansion of Vishnu Tattva as Prakasha Vigraha of Lord Krishna."
**Summary:** This segment explains the concept of Vishnu Tattva and how Balarama is the immediate expansion of Krishna, possessing the same qualities and power.

Amongst various names of the relatives, the name of Rama or Balarama, eldest brother of Lord Krishna, is added with the words, the personality of Godhead, Bhagavan, because Lord Balarama is the immediate expansion of Vishnu Tattva as Prakasha Vigraha of Lord Krishna. What is this meaning of Prakasha Vigraha? Now, Krishna, The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the one and only one Supreme Lord in the entire creation, the entire existence. But he expands and there are different types of expansions. So the immediate expansion is called the expansion of the Vishnu Tattva. That means the personality of Godhead with his all godly qualities, godly characteristics expands as Vishnu Tattva. They are all the expansions, immediate expansions, the personal expansions, full expansions are having the same power, same qualities. They are all the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna only. So Srila Prabhupada explains this. Balarama is the first expansion of Krishna. So Prabhupada says further, the Supreme Lord, although one without a second, expands himself as many other living beings. The Vishnu Tattva living beings are expansions of the Supreme Lord. Here living beings should not be confused with ordinary living entities. Here living being means their personalities, fully conscious and persons, but they are expansions of the Supreme Lord himself, and all of them are qualitatively and qualitatively equal with the Lord.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "One who considers the Vishnu Tattva and the Jeeva Shakti to be on equal level is considered a condemned soul of the world."
**Summary:** This segment differentiates between Vishnu Tattva and Jeeva Shakti, emphasizing the superiority of the former, and highlights Balarama as the original guru and Prabhupada as his merciful representative.

This is called Vishnu Tattva. Balarama, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Keshava, Narayana, all of them are qualitatively and quantitatively equal with the Lord. But expansions of the Jeeva Shakti, the category of ordinary living beings, are not at all equal with the Lord. So even we living beings, ordinary living beings, we are also expansions of the Lord, but we are not equal with the Lord. One who considers the Vishnu Tattva and the Jeeva Shakti to be on equal level is considered a condemned soul of the world. That means you should never equate any ordinary living being, Jeeva, Jeeva Shakti, with Vishnu Tattva, with the personality of Godhead or his expansions. So the Supreme Lord, Krishna, Balarama, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, all of them are on the level of Supreme God, and we are at a much, much, much, much lower level. Insignificant beings who have got the quality of the Supreme Lord as spirit soul, we are spiritual beings, but quantitatively, very, very, very, very tiny. Lord is infinite. We are infinitesimal. So therefore, Balarama is addressed as the personality of Godhead and the protector of the devotees. So Prabhupada says, therefore, Balarama is described also as the mercy incarnation of the Supreme Lord, manifested as the spiritual master who is the savior of the pure devotees. So Balarama is the first guru, Adiguru, and our spiritual master, Prabhupada, is the representative Balarama as the mercy incarnation. Prabhupada is very, very merciful upon the suffering souls, and therefore, Prabhupada is preaching in this world and wants to rescue the suffering souls and take them back to God.

**Key Quote:** "So Bhagawan can be used for all Vishnu Tattva expansions of the Supreme Lord Krishna."
**Summary:** This segment explains the Vishnu Tattva, focusing on Pradyumna and Aniruddha as expansions of Krishna and part of the Chaturvyuha.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Jai Vanarottamam Devim Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing verses 30 to 33 of the 14th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Yudhishthira is making inquiries from Arjuna. Pradyumna Sarva Vrishminam Sukhamaste Maharatha Gambhir Rayo Aniruddho Vardhate Bhagavanuta. The meaning of this verse is, how is Pradyumna, the great general of the Vrishni family, is he happy? And is Aniruddha, the plenary expansion of the personality of Godhead, faring well? The purport, Srila Prabhupada makes a remark, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are also expansions of the personality of Godhead, and thus they are also Vishnu Tattva. Krishna is the originator of the personality of Godhead. His first expansion is Balarama. Balarama expands into the first Chaturvyuha: Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha. So those Pradyumna and Aniruddha are mentioned here also as expansion of the personality of Godhead, and they belong to the Vishnu Tattva category. Vishnu Tattva means they are qualitatively and quantitatively equal with Krishna. At Dwarka, Lord Vaishnodeva, the great general of the Vrishni family, is happy. The quadruple expansions, namely Sankarsana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha, so the Chaturvyuha, the quadruple expansions as Prabhupada says elsewhere, Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, they are all engaged in transcendental pastimes. And therefore, each and every one of them can be addressed as the personality of Kadaj, as it is mentioned in connection with the name Aniruddha. Here, Gambhirarayo Aniruddho Vardhate Bhagawan Uta, Aniruddha Bhagawan. So Bhagawan can be used for all Vishnu Tattva expansions of the Supreme Lord Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, only a few of them are called to associate with the Lord in his transcendental pastimes as the Lord of Dwarka on this earth."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the vastness of Krishna's family in Dwarka, emphasizing the numerous sons and grandsons, and highlighting Krishna's role as the Lord of Dwarka.

The thirty-first verse. The meaning of this verse is, are all the chieftain sons of Lord Krishna, such as Sushena, Charudeshna, Sambha, the son of Jambavati, and Rishabha, along with the Chaturvyuha. Are all their sons all doing well? So here the enquiry by Yudhishthira about the sons of Krishna. Krishna's sons are called Karshna. So, the reference is made to the sons of Krishna, headed by some of the chieftains. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, as already mentioned, Lord Krishna married 16,108 wives, and each of them had 10 sons. Therefore, Krishna had 161,080 sons, if I were to put it in the terms of lakhs, 161,080 sons. They all grew up, and each of them had 10,000 sons. They all had as many sons as their father. Krishna, through each wife, he had 10 sons, and each of the sons of Krishna had 10 sons each. So, the whole aggregate was something near 1,610,800 family members of the Lord. The Lord is the father of all living beings who are countless. Therefore, only a few of them are called to associate with the Lord in his transcendental pastimes as the Lord of Dwarka on this earth. So, everyone is ultimately a son of the Supreme Lord, or a daughter of the Supreme Lord.

### Transcendental Position, Krishna Consciousness, Spiritual Platform

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So if we become connected with Krishna, we also become transcendentally situated."
**Summary:** This segment explains how connecting with Krishna elevates one to a transcendental platform, emphasizing the importance of practicing bhakti and purifying consciousness to remain in that state.

Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, Aham bija pradapita. The Lord is the father of all living beings. It is not astonishing that the Lord maintained a visible family consisting of so many members. In Dwarka, Krishna was having 1,610,000 grandsons and 161,000 sons. And 16,108 queens and a huge family. That's Krishna's own family as Krishna was playing the role of the Lord of Dwarka. It is better to refrain from comparing the Lord's position to ours, and it becomes a simple truth. As soon as we understand the Lord's position, we can understand how He is, even as we understand at least a partial calculation of the Lord's transcendental position. Always we should remember this point that the Lord is transcendentally situated eternally. Even when he comes to this material world, he is untouched by matter. He is completely spirit. He remains in his spiritual position eternally always, and all his connections are completely transcendental. So if we become connected with Krishna, we also become transcendentally situated. The simple example, when I vibrate my tongue and say Krishna, I chant the name of Krishna, I chant the name of the Supreme Lord Krishna, immediately I come in touch with the transcendental sound of his name and I am elevated to the spiritual position or platform. But to remain on the spiritual platform, that requires practice of bhakti and purifying the consciousness. I am elevating my consciousness to always remain on the transcendental platform while in the material world. And in the spiritual world, the entire spiritual world is completely on the spiritual plane. So there is no question of any touch of matter in the spiritual world. But in the material world, everything is tainted by the touch of the matter. Even our body, material body, means it's the touch of matter, so we have to elevate ourselves to the spiritual platform and remain there. If we remain on the spiritual platform always, we are also transcendentally situated like

### Yudhishthira's Inquiries, Liberated Souls, Eternal Associates

**Key Quote:** "all are liberated souls, eternal associates of the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Yudhishthira's inquiries about Krishna's associates and sons, explaining that the Yadavas and Pandavas are liberated souls and eternal associates of Krishna.

Krishna, and that is exactly what is called as Krishna consciousness. King Yudhishthira, while inquiring about the Lord's sons and grandsons at Dwaraka, mentioned only the chieftains among them, for it was impossible for him to remember all the names of the Lord's family members, 1 million 610,000. He did not mention, he just remembered, he is mentioned the chief chieftains. Verses 32 and 33, they are together. I'll read them both. tathai vanu chara shaure, sruta devodhavadayah, sunanda nanda shirsanya, ye chandye sattvatar shabhaah, api swasti asate sarve, rama krishna bhujaashrayah, api smaranti kushalam, asmakam baddha savrindaya. The meaning of these two verses is given together also, shruta Deva with dhaba and others, Nanda Sunanda and other leaders of liberated souls who are constant companions of the Lord, are protected by Lord Valerian and Krishna, are they all doing well in the respective functions? Do they, who are all eternally bound in friendship with us, remember our welfare? These are Yudhishthira's inquiries to Arjuna, because Arjuna has written from Dvārakā. So in the parport Śrīla Prabhupāda explains, The constant companions of Lord Kṛṣṇa, such as Uddhava, are all liberated souls, and they descended along with Lord Kṛṣṇa to this material world to fulfill the mission of the Lord. The Pāṇḍavas are also liberated souls who descended along with Lord Kṛṣṇa to serve Him in His transcendental pastimes on this earth. So both the Yadavas, in Dvārakā, and the Pāṇḍavas in Hastināpura, all are liberated souls, eternal associates of the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa.

### Vishnu Tattva vs. Jiva Tattva, Dependence on Krishna, Protection of the Lord
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/6y1C9X5o-wE?t=696
**Verse References:** BG 4.8
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Dependence on Krishna. That is the best dependence."
**Summary:** This segment differentiates between Vishnu Tattva and Jiva Tattva, emphasizing the dependence of Jiva Tattva on Krishna for protection and the eternal servitude of liberated souls.

As stated in the Bhagavad Gita, 4th chapter, 8th verse, The Lord and His eternal associates, who are also liberated souls like the Lord, come down on this earth at certain intervals. The Lord remembers them all but His associates, although liberated souls, do not forget, due to their being tatastha shakti or marginal potency of the Lord. Just like in the 4th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita it is said, Arjuna, he forgot that he had appeared with Krishna several times before. He had forgotten that, whereas Krishna remembers all of them. And that is very clearly explained in the 4th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. That is the difference between the Viṣṇu Tattva and Jīva Tattva. We belong to Jīva Tattva. Krishna, Vāsudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Narayana, Balarāma, Rāma, Narsimha, Varāha, all belong to Viṣṇu Tattva. They never forget anything, whereas we Jīva Tattva, we forget because of our tiny positioning. The Jīva Tattvas are infinitesimal potential particles of the Lord, and therefore they require the protection of the Lord at all times. And to the eternal servitors of the Lord, the Lord is pleased to give all protection at all times. The Lord is very pleased to give protection, and that is our position, dependence. Dependence on whom? Dependence on Krishna. That is the best dependence. That is eternal protection, dependence on Krishna. The liberated souls never therefore think themselves as free as the Lord. The Lord is completely free, completely independent, and the liberated souls, even though they are free from the touch of matter, they don't think themselves independent. They always seek the protection of the Lord in all circumstances, in the material world and in the spiritual world. In the spiritual world there is no question of seeking protection, but their attitude is, I want to be eternally under Krishna's shelter, Krishna's protection. This is the attitude of all devotees, all liberated souls.

### Constitutional Dependence, Spark and Fire Analogy, Spiritual Ignorance

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This dependence of the liberated soul is constitutional."
**Summary:** This segment uses the analogy of a spark and fire to illustrate the constitutional dependence of liberated souls on Krishna, warning against spiritual ignorance and the dangers of seeking independence from the Lord.

Now Srila Prabhupada explains a very important point. This dependence of the liberated soul is constitutional, for the liberated souls are like sparks of a fire that are able to exhibit the glow of fire along with the fire and not independently. This is the best example that can help us understand what is our active position. A spark of a blazing fire is very, very insignificant, tiny. But as long as the spark is in the fire, it will glow, like the fire. But the spark cannot independently glow when it is separated from the blazing fire. Independently, the glow of the spark is extinguished, although the quality of fire or the glowing is there, as spirit-soul. Our quality of spirit is actually not exhibited when we are separated from Krishna. Those who give up the protection of the Lord and become so-called Lords themselves, out of spiritual ignorance, come back again to the material world, even after prolonged tapasya of this severe type. That is the verdict of all Vedic literature.

### material pleasure vs transcendental pleasure, senses, Krishna's protection

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Being illusioned by false pleasures of the senses one becomes a servant of the senses."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts material and transcendental pleasure, explaining that attachment to sense gratification makes one a servant of the senses, and emphasizes the need for Krishna's protection.

इस material pleasure इन पिंट transcendental pleasure इस different सुख आध्यं तिकम् यत्तर् बुद्धि ग्राह्यम अतीण्ब्रियम is Bhagavad-gita description of transcendental pleasure. So Krishna gives transcendental pleasure to our spiritual senses or purified senses. Only the impure conditioned living being cannot derive any pleasure from the senses. Impure condition means under the influence of the three modes of material nature, and impure because the senses are contaminated by material contamination, a material conception, material desires, material loading over material nature, loading over material nature, independent material enjoyment. These are all the reasons why we are described as impure condition. So we cannot derive any pleasure from the senses. Being illusioned by false pleasures of the senses, one becomes a servant of the senses, go dasa. This is the description of the shastra. Go means senses, dasa means the servant. We all are servant of the senses. We seek out sense pleasures being driven by the senses demanding for pleasure pleasure by the senses demanding for pleasure pleasure pleasure pleasure by the senses demanding for pleasure pleasure pleasure pleasure material pleasure material pleasure material pleasure. Therefore we need his protection for our interest. We require Krishna's protection for our interest. The Lord is a protector of cows and the brahminical culture.

### cow protection, brahminical culture, Krishna's protection

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Prosperity in our human society depends on two things cow protection cow should never be killed."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of cow protection and brahminical culture for societal prosperity, stating that those who neglect these principles are not under Krishna's direct protection, using the analogy of prisoners in jail.

Brahminical culture brahminical culture go brahmana hitaya go brahmana hitaya go brahmana hitaya. There's a description in the shastra. Namo brahmanya devaya go brahmana hitaya jagat hitaya krishna govindaya namo namah. Protector of cows and the brahminical culture. So society devoid of cow protection and brahminical culture is not under the direct protection of the Lord. Is छी होने की थुख है। Is मौसेद व천 society है। भौत खाल के पूर्ति ओर ब्रह्मनिया की वन्निमर दिखाई aparecer केहर, सभितिंगी, पहल्मिक्षणे से लगते हैं, उन्हें पूर्ति को लड़ना देमा नहीं नहीं करतीं and to the Brahminic culture and therefore such people who are not giving cow protection, who are not giving protection to Brahminic culture are described as not under the direct protection of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Just as Prabhupada gives an example to help us understand, the prisoners in the jails are not under the protection of the king, but under the protection of a severe agent of the king. It's like even in modern government arrangement, the citizens who are law-abiding are under direct protection of the government, but those who are law breakers and who are punished in jail, they are under the protection of the jail superintendent. And that is the arrangement. Without cow protection and cultivation of Brahminical qualities in human society, at least for a section of the members of society, no human civilization can prosper at any length. Prosperity in our human society depends on two things: cow protection. Cow should never be killed because they are similar to Krishna and they're very, very useful animals. Every part of the cow is used, every part of the cow.

**Key Quote:** "One can become a brahmana and thus see the lord as he is if we become anybody can become a qualified brahmana simply by following the brahmanical principles and awaken the good qualities within by practicing brahmanical culture and then one can see the lord as he is."
**Summary:** The speaker continues on the usefulness of the cow, even after death, and then describes the qualities of a brahmana and how developing these qualities allows one to see the Lord.

It gives the most wonderful form of food, milk, cow's milk for human beings. And it's after the cow dies, even when it's living, cow urine and cow dung are very, very, very valuable for human society. So many ways cow dung and cow urine can be used by a civilized human being. And after the cow dies, natural death of course, then the cow hide, the cow skin is very, very useful. Then लोग शिक्षा में विचर बहुत नुपड़ि भी कर सकते हैं ... रूसिक सेum में बड़ा segundo विचर के स्थान में ये नहीं करते। Very, very useful, all of them are useful for human society. So cow is a wonderful animal, wonderful. So such a animal should never be killed by anybody. They should be protected to live their entire lifespan with nice care by human beings, by brahmanical culture. The development of the dormant qualities of goodness, namely truthfulness, equanimity, sense control, forbearance, simplicity, general knowledge, transcendental knowledge, and firm faith in the Vedic wisdom. These are the nine qualities by which brahmanas work. This is the transcendental qualities of the brahmanical culture. One can become a brahmana and thus see the Lord as he is. If we become, anybody can become a qualified brahmana simply by following the brahmanical principles and awaken the good qualities within by practicing brahmanical culture and then one can see the Lord as he is.

**Key Quote:** "After surpassing the brahmanical perfection one has to become a devotee of the lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that after achieving brahminical perfection, one must become a devotee to develop a loving relationship with Krishna as proprietor, master, friend, son, or lover.

And then one can see the Lord as he is. After surpassing the brahmanical perfection, one has to become a devotee of the Lord. So elevate yourself to the brahmanical platform, you become a brahmana with qualifications and then further elevate yourself to become a devotee to the transcendental platform. And then in the transcendental platform what happens? His loving affection in the form of proprietor, master, friend, son and lover can be transcendentally achieved. Krishna is related to every living being on the spiritual platform. So Krishna is related either as a transcendental proprietor, a transcendental master, a transcendental friend, a transcendental son, or a transcendental lover. These are the five kinds of relationships, primary relationships of Krishna which every living entity has on the spiritual platform that is being mentioned. The stage of a devotee which attracts the transcendental affection of the Lord does not

develop unless one has developed the qualities of a brahmana as above mentioned. Sometimes devotees think we have nothing to do with this mode of goodness. Of course, on the spiritual platform there is no question of any touch of any of the modes, neither goodness nor passion or ignorance. It's a transcendental state. But to come to the transcendental state, one has to first of all elevate oneself to the platform of goodness above rajoguna and tamoguna. These two base qualities, rajoguna and tamoguna or passion and ignorance are degrading our existence, human existence degrading. So one has to rise to the brahminical platform, the platform of goodness and then develop all the transcendental qualifications to come to the spiritual platform, vaishnava brahmana vaishnava. The Lord is inclined to a brahmana of quality, not of false prestige. Some people claim I'm a brahmana by birth though they don't have the qualities of a brahmana. Such brahmanas are not um not the special attention or subject to special attention of Krishna. Those who are not brahmana by quality simply claiming to brahmana doesn't attract the attention of the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "Those who are less than a brahmana by qualification cannot establish any relation with the lord just as fire cannot be kindled from the raw earth unless there is wood."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of fire, wood, and earth to illustrate that a relationship with the Lord cannot be established without proper qualification, and concludes by stating that Maharaj Yudhishthir did not inquire about Krishna's welfare because Krishna is eternally perfect.

Those who are less than a brahmana by qualification cannot establish any relation with the Lord, just as fire cannot be kindled from the raw earth unless there is wood, although there is a relation between wood and the earth. So this is the example given in the first canto of the Bhagavatam in the second chapter. There is earth, there is wood and there is fire. So fire can be kindled in the wood when earth has been transformed into wood, firewood, only then fire can be kindled. Raw earth you cannot kindle a fire. Since the Lord is all perfect in himself, there could be, there could not be any question of his welfare. So Maharaj Yudhishthir did not inquire about the welfare of Krishna because the Lord is all perfect, is eternally the Supreme Lord. So there is no

In this session, we will be discussing two verses which are given together in the Srimad Bhagavatam, 35 and 36 verses of the 14th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Mangalaya Cha Lokanam Kshemaya Cha Bhavaya Cha Aaste Yadu Kulam Bodhav Adyo Ananta Sakha Pumaan Yad Bahudanda Guptayam Swapuryam Yadavor Chitaha Kshemaya Cha Bhavaya Cha Kreedanti Param Aanandam MahaPavuchika Iva. The meaning of these two verses given together: the original personality of godhead, the enjoyer, and Balaram, the primeval lord Ananta, are staying in the ocean of the Yadu dynasty for the welfare, protection, and general progress of the entire universe. See this description. Krishna and Balaram are staying in the Yadu dynasty for the welfare, protection, and general progress of the entire universe. That is the position of the Lord. The members of the Yadu dynasty, being protected by the arms of the Lord, are enjoying life like the residents of the spiritual sky.

**Key Quote:** "The personality of Godhead Vishnu resides within each and every Universe in two capacities namely as the garbhodaka shayi Vishnu and the kshirodhaka shayi Vishnu."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Prabhupada's explanation of the three forms of Vishnu in the material world: Garbhodaka Shayi Vishnu, Kshirodaka Shayi Vishnu, and Maha Vishnu, describing their roles and locations.

This completes the meaning of the two verses. Now Prabhupada explains elaborately the comparison made here. It's a beautiful comparison to help us understand how Krishna ultimately is the protector of all of us. In the Purport, Prabhupada says, as we have discussed many times, "The personality of Godhead Vishnu resides within each and every Universe in two capacities, namely as the Garbhodaka Shayi Vishnu and the Kshirodhaka Shayi Vishnu." If you remember, three Vishnu forms in the material existence, out of which two are within the universe, and one is outside all the universes. The outside of all the universes is Maha Vishnu, one supreme form, supreme Lord's form is Vishnu, one form. Whereas Garbhodaka Shai Vishnu, the number of forms of Garbhodaka Shai Vishnu are as many universes as there are. Garbhodaka Shai Vishnu enters into each universe. There are millions of universes. And Kshirodaka Shai Vishnu enters into the heart of every living being on each universe. Billions and trillions of living beings on each universe and billions and billions of universes. So we cannot count all this. It's all very, very, very large numbers. The Kshirodaka Shai Vishnu has his own universe, his own planet on the northern top of the universe. That's called Shwetadvipa. And there is a great ocean of milk. Shwetadvipa means ocean of milk. Dvipa means an island. An island is always in the middle of an ocean. Now, in this great ocean of milk, the Lord resides as Kshirodaka Shai Vishnu on the bed of the Ananta incarnation of Baladeva.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Yudhishthira has compared the Yadu dynasty to the ocean of milk, Shri Balaram to Ananta, where Lord Krishna resides."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Yudhishthira's comparison of the Yadu dynasty to the ocean of milk and the citizens of Dwarka to the inhabitants of Vaikuntha, then describes the immense size and layers of coverings of the universe and the causal ocean.

Vishnu resides on the bed of Anantadeva, Anantashayana. He is also called the Anantashayana Lord. Thus Maharaj Yudhishthira has compared the Yadu dynasty to the ocean of milk, Shri Balaram to Ananta, where Lord Krishna resides. He has compared the citizens of Dwarka to the liberated inhabitants of the Vaikuntha lokas. You see the comparison done by Yudhishthira so beautifully explained by Prabhupada. So Prabhupada says about the Vaikuntha lokas, he says, beyond the material sky, further than we can see with our eyes, material sky we can see with our naked eyes, but beyond that and beyond the sevenfold coverings of the universe, each universe. The universe consisting of millions of planets has got several coverings, seven layers of coverings. The coverings are very, very, very, very big. If you consider the entire universe as a huge ball, then if the diameter of our universe is described as four billion miles, diameter of the universe. Now, the thickness of the first layer of covering of the universe is ten times the diameter of the universe. That means it is forty billion miles thick. Forty billion miles thick, the first covering. The second covering over the first covering is ten times thicker than the first covering. So, if the first covering is forty billion miles thick, the second covering is four hundred billion miles thick. So, we cannot even imagine how thick the coverings are and progressively the coverings keep on becoming thicker, thicker, ten times more, ten times more, ten times more than the previous covering. So, the second covering is four hundred billion miles thick. The third covering is four thousand billion miles thick. And then for forty thousand billion miles like that, it goes, it's very, very thick covering. So, beyond these coverings, there is the causal ocean in which all the universes are floating like footballs. So, just imagine this situation of this supreme Lord in the spiritual world. Just try to imagine by these descriptions. We are tiny beings

on this insignificant earth planet among millions of planets in the universe. And the universe is one insignificant universe among millions of universes in the entire material creation. And the entire material creation itself with all the universes and each universe with all the planets and each planet with all the living beings is one insignificant portion of the spiritual sky. So beyond all this, there is the causal ocean in the spiritual sky, one corner of the spiritual sky, there is causal ocean. In that ocean these universes are floating like footballs. Beyond the causal ocean, there is an unlimited span of spiritual sky. Beyond the causal ocean. And that is generally known as the effulgence of Brahman, Brahmajyoti. In Sanskrit, it's called Brahmajyoti. In English it is called Effulgence of Brahman. Within this effulgence, effulgence means that glow, within this effulgence, there are innumerable spiritual planets and they are known as Vaikuntha planets. Vaikuntha means where there is no anxiety, where there is no misery, where there is no suffering, where there is no material inebriety, no material imperfection, perfect spiritual situation. So each and every Vaikuntha planet is many many times bigger than the biggest universe within the material world. So how can we even conceive what is the spiritual world? We can't even conceive, it is inconceivable. At least accept it is inconceivable by these descriptions, factual descriptions. And in each and every one of them, each and every one of the Vaikuntha planets, there is no deity. There are innumerable inhabitants who look exactly like Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu in his four-handed form is there in every Vaikuntha planet as the predominating deity. There are many many many many inhabitants, they are all devotees, pure devotees. They all have forms which look exactly like Lord Vishnu. These inhabitants are known as the Mahapaulukas.

### Mahapaulukas, Vaikuntha, Happiness, Eternal Life, Miseries of Material World, Dwarka

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Yudhishthira has compared the inhabitants of Dwarka to the Mahapaulukas of Vaikuntha loka, because even in Dwarka, all the citizens are so happy with the Lord and the Lord is happy."
**Summary:** The speaker further describes the Mahapaulukas and the qualities of life in Vaikuntha, contrasting it with the miseries of the material world and highlighting the happiness of the citizens of Dwarka in the presence of Krishna and Balarama.

So, that reference was made by Yudhishthira, comparing the citizens of Dwarka to Mahapaulukas. So, who are these Mahapaulukas? They are the inhabitants of the Vaikuntha lokas. Now, these Mahapaulukas are called as persons directly engaged in the service of the Lord in his personal abode. They are happy in those planets and are without any kind of misery. And they live perpetually in full youthfulness, enjoying life in full bliss and knowledge, without fear of birth, death, old age or disease, and without the influence of Kala or eternal time. So, material world means full of miseries, fundamental miseries – birth, death, disease, old age – full of the influence of Kala, eternal time. So, time destroys everything systematically, whatever was created in this material world. That influence of time is not there in the spiritual world. That influence of the four miseries, fundamental miseries, is not there in the spiritual world. Maharaj Yudhishthira has compared the inhabitants of Dwarka to the Mahapaulukas of Vaikuntha loka, because even in Dwarka, all the citizens are so happy with the Lord and the Lord is happy. Just like the Mahapaulukas are eternally happy, even the citizens of Dwarka are happy in the Dwarka city, living with Krishna and Balarama. In the Bhagavad Gita, there are many references to Vaikuntha lokas and they are mentioned there as Madhama or the kingdom of the Lord. In the Bhagavad Gita, there is a reference to Vaikuntha loka, not directly mentioned as Vaikuntha. But Krishna says, yad gatva na nivartante tad dhama paramam mama – having gone where one never returns to this material world of repeated birth and death, but lives in the spiritual world with Krishna or with Narayana or with Vishnu, eternal life full of bliss and knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "That is described by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita as his supreme abode because every place belongs to Krishna, even the material world belongs to Krishna because it is a part of his material energy."
**Summary:** The speaker references the Bhagavad Gita to describe Vaikuntha as the supreme abode of Krishna, an eternal existence beyond the material world, and concludes the lecture.

That is described by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita as his supreme abode because every place belongs to Krishna, even the material world belongs to Krishna because it is a part of his material energy – his material energy. All energies are his – Krishna's. So material world also is Krishna's but it is an inferior place. Krishna does not reside here permanently. He sometimes comes to this world, to attract all of us to go back to him in his personal abode, supreme abode, mad-dhama. So that's the description of the Bhagavad Gita. Parastasmat bhavo anyo avyakto avyaktatsanatanah. Beyond vyakta and avyakta, beyond manifest and unmanifest matter, there is an eternal existence. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita in the 8th chapter, yad gatva nani vartante tad dhama param amma. So that is the supreme abode of the Supreme Lord described in the Bhagavad Gita briefly, but details are given in the Bhagavad Gita and other scriptures.

In this session we will be discussing from the 38th verse of the 14th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. यद बाहु दन्डाभ्युदयानु जीविनो, यदु प्रवीरा ह्यकुतो भयामुहु, अधि क्रमन्ती अंग्रिभिर आहृताम बलात, सभाम सुधर्माम सुरसत्तमो चिताम। The meaning of this verse is, the great heroes of the Yadu dynasty, being protected by the arms of Lord Shri Krishna, always remain fearless in every respect and therefore their feet trample over the Sudharma assembly house which the best demigods deserved but which was taken away from them.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's devotees have a very special position. This material world is characterized by fear."
**Summary:** Krishna's devotees are protected from fear and enjoy the best things because of Krishna's affection.

And that is explained by Prabhupāda in the purport. Śrīla Prabhupāda says those who are directly servitors of the Lord are protected by the Lord from all fearfulness and they also enjoy the best of things even if they are forcibly accumulated. Krishna's devotees have a very special position. This material world is characterized by fear. Every conditioned soul has got four characteristics, eating, sleeping, fearing, and mating. So everyone has got the fear of death. And before death comes, there is always the fear of suffering. There is always some other danger from some unknown enemy or so-called enemy. There is always the fear of losing one's possessions. Like this, there are so many different types of fears in this material existence. But those who are directly serving Krishna, they are always protected by Krishna because of which they are always fearless. And they are able to enjoy the best of things under all circumstances.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is also called devotee. Bhakta vatsala. He is specially affectionate towards his pure devotees."
**Summary:** Krishna is especially affectionate to devotees, and Dwaraka was enriched with the best things, surpassing even the heavenly assembly house Sudharma.

So Śrīla Prabhupāda further says, the Lord is equal in behavior to all living beings, but he is partial to his pure devotees, being very affectionate toward them. Krishna is also called devotee. Bhakta vatsala. He is specially affectionate towards his pure devotees. The city of Dvārakā was flourishing, being enriched with the best of things in the material world. The city of Dvārakā was on the earth planet. And earth is in the middle planetary system. The upper planetary system, all the planets have millions of times better facilities for their residents. But the city of Dvārakā, even though on the earth planet, it was special because it was enriched with the best things in the entire material universe. The state assembly house is constructed according to the dignity of the particular state. In heavenly planets, the state assembly house, called Sudharma, was deserving of the place of worship of the best of the demigods. The demigods are all controllers on behalf of Krishna in this material world. So they are exotic personalities who have got a very special state assembly house called Sudharma. Such an assembly house is never meant for any state on the globe on this earth planet because the human being on the earth is unable to construct it however far a particular state may be materially advanced.

**Summary:** The Yadu dynasty brought the Sudharma assembly house to Dwaraka to please Krishna, demonstrating pure devotion.

We cannot match the opulence or the grandeur of the state assembly hall in the heavenly planets. We can never do that. But during the time of Lord Krishna, Lord Krishna's presence on the earth, the members of the Yadu dynasty forcibly brought the celestial assembly house to earth and placed it at Dwaraka. The members of the Yadu family, they are all related with Krishna. So they want to please Krishna by offering the best of everything. So when they saw that, the assembly house in the heavenly planets is very, very grand. So they decided to forcibly bring it and offer it to Krishna. They are not desiring that we want to enjoy. No. It's for Krishna's pleasure.

**Key Quote:** "They were able to use such force because they were certain of the indulgence and protection of the Supreme Lord Krishna."
**Summary:** Devotees serve Krishna with the best offerings, and Krishna reciprocates by providing protection and fearlessness.

That's a characteristic of a pure devotee. They were able to use such force because they were certain of the indulgence and protection of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Krishna is affectionate to his devotees. Affectionate to his devotees means when the devotees require any protection, then Krishna is always ready to give them such protection. In other words, the Lord is provided with the best things in the universe by his pure devotees. Pure devotees serve Krishna out of their heart. And they want to offer Krishna only the very best things in the entire creation. So they will go to any length to actually please Krishna by such offerings. Again, we should remember Krishna is not in need of any of these offerings. He is completely independent. He is full of all opulences. He is not in need of anything. But, the Lord is not in need of anything except as a token of their love for them. Love for Krishna. Lord Krishna was provided with all kinds of comforts and facilities available within the universe by the members of the Yadu dynasty. Whatever the best things that are anywhere in the universe, the Yadu dynasty members, they would go there and fetch it for Krishna, for offering to Krishna. And in return, such servitors of the Lord were protected and fearless. Krishna reciprocates with his devotees. And in this case, Krishna assured them protection.

**Key Quote:** "A forgetful, conditioned soul is fearful. That's our position now."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the difference between a conditioned soul, who is fearful due to forgetfulness of Krishna, and a liberated soul, who is fearless.

Because of it, they became fearless. Now, something important that Srila Prabhupada explains for us, all of us, in this present condition. Srila Prabhupada says, A forgetful, conditioned soul is fearful. That's our position now. We are forgetful of Krishna. And therefore, we have become conditioned. Conditioned means, we have got a material body. And this material body is made up of the material elements. It is subject to the material modes of nature. And we are forced to think in a certain way, work in a certain way, act in a certain way, relate with things in a certain way. All this is called conditioning. And it is a cause for our fear in this material world. But a liberated soul is never fearful. One who is liberated is never fearful. Because a liberated soul knows, I am not this body. I don't belong to this material world. I belong to spiritual world. In this spiritual world, I have a spiritual form. So therefore, the conditioned soul is fearful. And the liberated soul is fearless.

### Fearlessness, Illusion, Eternal relation with the Lord
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/iNNL1IRLF6w?t=676
**Verse References:** BG 2.12
**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Just as a small child, completely dependent on the mercy of his father, is never fearful of anyone."
**Summary:** Fear is an illusion arising from forgetting our eternal relationship with the Lord, similar to a child's fearlessness due to dependence on their father.

Now Prabhupada gives an example. Just as a small child, completely dependent on the mercy of his father, is never fearful of anyone. So there are instances in the scriptures, where, it is described that, a child, depending on the father, is completely fearless, because of the protection of the father. Similarly, it is explained here, fearfulness is a sort of illusion for the living being. Fear comes out of the effect of the illusion. The effect of the illusory energy. And how does the illusory energy work? The living being, when he is in slumber, slumber means when he is sleeping, and forgetting his eternal relation with the Lord, is actually affected by fear. So fear is a sort of illusion. And fear afflicts every conditioned soul at different times. Since the living being is never to die by his constitution, as stated in Bhagavad Gita, You don't take birth, you don't die. Then, what is the cause of fearfulness?

### Bodily conception, Illusion, Fear of death

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Fearfulness is due to forgetting the eternal relation with the Lord."
**Summary:** Fearfulness arises from identifying with the body and forgetting our eternal nature, leading to the fear of death.

So, fearfulness is due to forgetting the eternal relation with the Lord. As soon as we are placed in a material body, we think in terms of the body only. So, a body has taken birth on a certain date, that date is ascribed to the soul, or to the real person. The real person does not take birth, does not die. That's the truth, that's the reality. But, people under illusion, they forget, and they keep on trying and trying and trying to come out of this illusion, but they cannot easily come out. So, in the Bhagavad Gita it is explained, since the living being is never to die by his constitution, as stated in Bhagavad Gita, then what is the cause of fearfulness? If we are never meant to die, why should we be afraid of death? That is because of a bodily conception. Everybody thinks in terms of normal people, they think in terms of body.

### Dream analogy, Wakefulness, Service to the Lord, Fearlessness

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "This is just like, Prabhupada gives an example, in a dream a person may see, while sleeping, in a dream he may see a tiger."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of a dream, the speaker explains that fear is an illusion, and by being awake in service to the Lord, like the Yadu dynasty, one can overcome fear.

They do not know anything about the spirit. This is just like, Prabhupada gives an example, in a dream a person may see, while sleeping, in a dream he may see a tiger. Now, this tiger in the dream is actually an effect of illusion, because there is no real tiger. For the person who is awake, the tiger does not exist, what the sleeping man is seeing in a dream. So, the person dreaming and the person awake, both are actually, for both of them there is no tiger. But the person who has forgotten his external position, in the sleep, for him the tiger in the dream is very, very fearsome. And for the person who is awake, it is not fearful. So, when this person who is dreaming wakes up, he also becomes free from the fear, because he sees there is no tiger. Similarly, Prabhupada says, the members of the Yadu dynasty were fully awake in their service to the Lord, and therefore there was no fear for them. And even if, in the wakeful state also, there is some cause for fear, the Lord was always there to protect them completely. That was their position.

**Key Quote:** "Please tell me whether your health is all right? You appear to have lost your bodily lust."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verses to be discussed (SB 1.14.39-41) and focuses on verse 39, explaining Yudhishthira's inquiry to Arjuna about his well-being and apparent loss of bodily luster, questioning if it's due to disrespect or neglect during his stay in Dwaraka.

In this session, we will be discussing verses 39, 40, and 41 of the 14th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 39th verse: Kachitte Anamayam Tata Bhrashta Teja Vibhasime Alabdha Mano Avagyataha Kimbatata Chiroshitaha. This is a verse spoken by Yudhishthira to Arjuna. Yudhishthira is addressing Arjuna, "My dear brother Arjuna, please tell me, is your health all right? You appear to have lost your bodily lust. Is this due to others disrespecting and neglecting you because of your long stay at Dwaraka?" This is a question raised by Yudhishthira. See, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "From all angles of vision, Maharaj Yudhishthira inquired from Arjuna about the welfare of Dwaraka, but he concluded at last that as long as Lord Sri Krishna himself was there, nothing inauspicious could happen. But at the same time, Arjuna appeared to be bereft of his bodily lust, and thus, the king inquired of his personal welfare and asked so many vital questions." This is a question raised by Yudhishthira to Arjuna.

### charity, promise, despondency
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/ad62gGX5cQ0?t=167
**Verse References:** SB 1.14.40
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Has someone addressed you with unfriendly words? or threatened you could you not give charity to one who asked or could you not keep your promise to someone"
**Summary:** The speaker explains verse 40, elaborating on potential reasons for Arjuna's dejection, such as being addressed with unfriendly words, failing to give charity, or breaking a promise, highlighting the importance of fulfilling obligations and the consequences of failing to do so.

The meaning of these verses… Has someone addressed you with unfriendly words or threatened you? Could you not give charity to one who asked, or could you not keep your promise to someone? These are all different reasons why a respectable personality becomes very depressed or dejected or very unhappy. So Yudhishthira is trying to find out what is the cause for Arjuna's dejection. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "A kshatriya or a rich man is sometimes visited by persons who are in need of money. When they are asked for a donation, it is a duty of the possessor of wealth to give charity in consideration of the person, place, and time. If a kshatriya or a rich man fails to comply with this obligation, he must be very sorry for this discrepancy. Similarly, one should not fail to keep his promise to give in charity. These discrepancies are sometimes causes of despondency, and thus, failing, a person becomes subjected to criticism, which might also be the cause of Arjuna's plight," Yudhishthira is trying to guess. So one should never go back on one's promise made to somebody to give charity; that is a very important culture. And if somebody does default, then there is such a problem. The person is subject to criticism. So Arjuna is being questioned by Yudhishthira, "Did you undergo any humiliation like that?"

**Summary:** The speaker discusses verse 41, focusing on the five categories of individuals (brahmanas, children, cows, women, and the diseased) who deserve protection, emphasizing Arjuna's role as a protector and questioning if he failed to provide shelter to those in need.

The 41st verse, kachit tvam bramanam balam gaam vriddham roginam striyam sharanopasrtham sattvam na atyakshi sharanapradah. The meaning of this verse is, "You are always the protector of the deserving living beings such as brahmanas, children, cows, women, and the diseased." Five categories of personalities are mentioned here who deserve protection. Who are they? The brahmanas, the children, the cows, the women, and the diseased people. So the question being raised, "Could you not give them protection when they approached you for shelter?"

**Key Quote:** "The brahmanas who are always engaged in researching knowledge for the society's welfare work both materially and spiritually deserve the protection of the king in all respects."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the importance of protecting brahmanas, children, cows, women, and the diseased, explaining the role of brahmanas in society's welfare and the king's responsibility to provide special protection to these vulnerable groups for the prosperity and peace of the state.

In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The brahmanas, who are always engaged in researching knowledge for the society's welfare work, both materially and spiritually, deserve the protection of the king in all respects." What is the position of a brahmana? Prabhupada is explaining. Why are these five categories singled out specifically for the protection of the king? To be given protection by the king, why? So, one by one, Prabhupada will explain. The brahmanas, they are always engaged in society's welfare work, and what kind of welfare activity do they perform? They are researching knowledge for society's welfare. They are conversant with the Vedas, and therefore they apply the Vedic principles and teach us. So such brahmanas have to be protected by the king. Similarly, the children of the state, the cow, the diseased person, the woman, and the old man specifically require the protection of the state or a chatriya king. They have to be given special protection, not the ordinary one. If such living beings do not get protection by the chatriya or the royal order or by the state, it is certainly shameful for the chatriya or the state. So they deserve to get protection, and the king should be giving them protection.

Then only there will be prosperity and peace in the state, at the state level. If such things had actually happened to Arjuna, Maharaja Yudhishthira was anxious to know about these discrepancies. So these were the different questions raised by Yudhishthira in questioning Arjuna. What is the cause of Arjuna's dejection, unprecedented? So, in different ways, he is questioning just to ascertain that. Is it really true that Krishna has departed to his personal abode, has left the earth planet? Is it true? That is what Yudhishthira is trying to ascertain, and before he concludes anything, he is trying to pacify.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the advanced and cultured nature of the society, emphasizing the importance of respecting great personalities and the significance of bodily luster as a sign of spiritual strength, contrasting it with the lack of such luster in ordinary or materially intelligent people.

And wants to ascertain the actual facts of the case. So the society was a very evolved society. It was not that people were living in an uncivilized way or primitive way. No. It was a highly cultured society. The indications are very clear here. If a great personality is disrespected, then it is a cause for great concern because the society was very, very well organized, and people were properly trained how to respect great personalities, and it was meticulously followed by everyone. The society was an evolved society. So therefore Arjuna appears to have lost his bodily luster. We do not know what is bodily luster in Kali Yuga. Such bodily luster is seen in persons who have got the strength of God's grace, the strength of doing some tapasya, some voluntary penance, and then they develop a certain spiritual bodily luster. Such luster is not seen among ordinary people or even externally intelligent, materially intelligent people. You cannot see such luster.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the potential humiliation Arjuna might have faced and the importance of respectful interactions, warning that a lack of respect leads to societal degradation and hinders spiritual progress.

It is only to be seen in transcendentalists. It is also said here that Arjuna is such a great personality, but somebody threatens Arjuna or addresses him with unfriendly words, that is a cause of great concern. Even though Arjuna is powerful, he does not want to utilize his power for some ordinary purposes. So therefore the questions are being raised to find out whether Arjuna's cause of dejection is something that happened while Arjuna was returning home to Hastinapura from Dwarka. Did somebody threaten you? Did they address you with unfriendly words? That means in the Vedic culture, people greet each other in a very respectable way because the culture is very advanced. Whereas if somebody is not showing the proper due respect for another person, the society

You just can't make a show of some ritual and become a spiritually advanced person; that never works. So all the devotees, they are always transiently situated, which means they are untouched by the inferior energy. So therefore they can actually live in the society in a dignified way. Otherwise, it becomes very difficult for civilized people to interact with others who may not be civilized. So therefore, in the former times, the society was properly divided, and people used to follow the principles very strictly, and therefore the culture was very, very advanced. That is what is...

**Key Quote:** "Everybody who is conditioned is prone to cheat others."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Prabhupada's point about the four defects of a conditioned soul, emphasizing the propensity to cheat as the most prominent.

So this is considered as a very serious matter by Yudhishthira, who was perfectly ruling and everybody was living very happily. There was plenty of all supplies by nature, mother nature. But when Yudhishthira started seeing symptoms of some irregularities, then he suspected maybe it is because the Supreme Lord has disappeared from the face of the earth. So in the purport, Prabhupada explains this particular point about cheating. Particularly, a conditioned living being is endowed with four principles of malpractice. This is explained in the Chaitanya Charitamrita, Prabhupada is quoting from Chaitanya Charitamrita: four defects of every conditioned soul in this material existence. What are they? Errors, insanity, inability, and cheating. Everybody who is conditioned is prone to make mistakes. Everybody who is conditioned is prone to cheat others. Everybody who is conditioned is prone to have defective senses, and that is inability. And everybody who is conditioned is subject to illusion. These are signs of imperfection. And out of the four, the propensity to cheat others is most prominent among all the defects and the conditions of all this. This particular defect of cheating propensity is very prominent.

**Key Quote:** "This cheating practice is there in the conditioned souls because the conditioned souls are primarily in the material world imbued with an unnatural desire to lord it over the material world."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the unnatural desire to lord over material nature as the root cause of the cheating propensity in conditioned souls, contrasting it with the pure state of eternal servitude to Krishna.

This cheating practice is there in the conditioned souls because the conditioned souls are primarily in the material world imbued with an unnatural desire to lord it over the material world. It's unnatural for us, but something unnatural that we all have as conditioned souls is the desire to lord over material nature. A living being in his pure state is not conditioned by the laws because in his pure state he is conscious that a living being is eternally subservient to the supreme being. Eternally we are servants. And in our unconditioned state, in our spiritual state of existence, in our pure state of existence, we are conscious that I am eternally servant of Krishna. And thus it is always good for him to remain subservient instead of falsely trying to lord it over the property of the supreme lord. The supreme lord is a factual proprietor, the factual master, factual controller everywhere of everything. But if we artificially try to control,

**Key Quote:** "Only under illusion somebody may think I am the master. Therefore he becomes the victim of all kinds of cheating."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how the illusion of being the master leads to victimization and cheating, even within close relationships.

then that is an unnatural desire. That's a defective state of existence. In the conditioned state, the living being is not satisfied even if he actually becomes the lord of all that he surveys. Let's say under illusion, somebody thinks I am the master of my family, or somebody thinks I am the master of my factory, or I am the master of my business. He thinks like that. He thinks he has become the lord, but actually he never becomes the lord because the supreme lord, Krishna, remains the master. And only under illusion somebody may think I am the master. Therefore he becomes the victim of all kinds of cheating. We are victimized actually under the influence of illusion. To wrongly think or to falsely think I am the master, I have to indulge in cheating others, even with his nearest and most intimate relations, he engages in all kinds of cheating, even with the nearest and dearest ones, so called near and dear ones.

**Key Quote:** "All these contending difficulties can be mitigated by one process... and that is the devotional service of the Supreme Lord Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker presents devotional service to Krishna as the solution to the problems of cheating and disharmony, quoting Prabhupada's conclusion that it's the only effective counteraction to hypocrisy.

In such an unsatisfactory state of affairs, there is no harmony even between father and sons or between husband and wife. It is expected, at least in a cultured, civilized family life, it is expected that husband and wife, there will be good understanding, good cooperation in the interest of the family, or between father and sons. Because father is very affectionate and he takes good care of his own sons, so there should be good dealings naturally between father and sons. But because of this cheating propensity, the relationship is not always cordial. But one important thing Srila Prabhupada says here, but all these contending difficulties can be mitigated by one process. Is there a solution to these problems? Prabhupada says, yes, there is one solution. What is that? And that is the devotional service of the Supreme Lord Krishna. So, it is devotional service only that can mitigate this difficulty of cheating and all other kinds of defects of the conditioned soul. So, Srila Prabhupada concludes this by saying, the world of hypocrisy can be checked only by counteraction through devotional service to the Lord and nothing else. There is no other solution that works. Factually, only this works: counteraction through engaging in pure devotional service.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Yudhishthira's observation of disparities and his conclusion about the disappearance of Krishna, leading to the prevalence of negative qualities.

Maharaj Yudhishthira, having observed the disparities, conjectured the disappearance of the Lord from the earth. This is Yudhishthira Maharaj's observation and conclusion, only because Krishna is no longer present on the surface of the earth. The fifth verse, nimittani atyarishtani kale tvanugate nirunam lobhadi adharma prakritim drushtvo vachanujam drupah The meaning of this verse is, in course of time, it came to pass that people in general became accustomed to greed, anger, pride, etc. Initially the symptoms started appearing at a certain point in time and in course of time people became used to it as if it's normal. Then Maharaj Yudhishthira, observing all these omens, spoke to his younger brother.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how Yudhishthira was perturbed by the emergence of negative qualities, indicating their absence during Krishna's presence and the beginning of Kali Yuga.

So next few verses will describe what did Yudhishthira speak to his younger brother. In the purport Srila Prabhupada explains, such a pious king as Maharaj Yudhishthira at once became perturbed when there were such inhuman symptoms as greed, anger, irreligiosity, and hypocrisy rampant in society. He just started seeing such symptoms and he became perturbed. That means they were used to a civilized society where all these things were absent. So when they started appearing, these symptoms of greed and anger and irreligiosity, Yudhishthira Maharaj became perturbed. It appears from this statement that all these symptoms of degraded society were unknown to the people of the time. And when Krishna was present, Yudhishthira Maharaj and all the people, they did not know what is greed, what is anger. It was astonishing for them to have experienced them with the advent of the Kali Yuga or the age of quarrel.

**Summary:** The speaker connects the beginning of Kali Yuga with Krishna's departure, highlighting Krishna's purpose of reducing the burden of the earth and the subsequent emergence of negative symptoms.

You see, it is said, elsewhere it is said, the beginning of Kali Yuga is when the day Krishna disappeared from this earth after winding up his earthly pastimes. When Krishna comes, he comes with his associates, with his abode, with his paraphernalia, with his entourage, and he stays for a certain time, duration of time. One hundred twenty-five years Krishna stayed and performed his wonderful Leela in Vrindavan, Mathura, and Dwaraka. And also he traveled to other places like Hastinapura, Mithila, so many other places. And Kurukshetra, he traveled to Kurukshetra. So he performed his pastimes and when his pastimes are over, time is up, then he went back to his personal abode, Krishnae Swadhamopagati, that was explained earlier, that as long as Krishna was there, everything was very nice. And Krishna had come to reduce the burden of the earth, which was overburdened by demoniac persons posing as kings and oppressing saintly persons and innocent people, unnecessarily. So Krishna came, he reduced the burden of the earth and Krishna went back. But when Krishna went back, Kali Yuga began. It was the end of Dwapara Yuga when Krishna came, but Dwapara Yuga is finished when Krishna left. Kali Yuga began, and the symptoms of Kali Yuga are mentioned here.

### Bad omens, Arjuna's dejection, Vedic culture, Free mixing of men and women

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This free mixing of men and women is not at all good. It results in so many anomalies."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Yudhishthira's questioning of Arjuna regarding his dejection and Srila Prabhupada's explanation of Vedic culture concerning free contact between men and women.

been seeing some bad omens indicating something undesirable is going to happen, and he is anxiously waiting for Arjuna to return. And even as he is discussing these bad omens with Bhima, Arjuna returns, and then immediately Yudhishthira begins asking Arjuna so many questions: what is the cause for Arjuna's dejection? And Arjuna is just not speaking, and Yudhishthira is asking him so many questions, so his questioning continues. Yudhishthira's questioning Arjuna continues till the end of this chapter, we are almost at the end. So this 42nd verse: Kachitvam Nagamo Agamyam Gamyam Vasat Kritaam Striyam Parajito Vatha Bhavan Notamair Nasamai Pathi. The meaning of this verse is, have you contacted a woman of impeachable character, or have you not properly treated a deserving woman? Or have you been defeated on the other hand, by someone who is inferior or equal to you? Yudhishthira is trying to find out what is the cause for Arjuna's dejection, so different reasons he is offering. And Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport a very important aspect of the Vedic culture. It appears from this verse that during the time of the Pandavas, free contact between man and woman was allowed in certain conditions only. We are living in the present time, where there is too much of free contact between men and women, and that is not very good for the society, for the proper upkeep of the society. This free mixing of men and women is not at all good. It results in so many anomalies.

### Caste system, Respect for women, Seven mothers, Uttama and Adhama contact

**Key Quote:** "The wife of a Brahmana is considered one of the seven mothers."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the Vedic social structure, explaining the rules regarding contact between men and women of different castes, emphasizing the respect due to certain women, particularly the wife of a Brahmana.

So Srila Prabhupada explains this further. The higher caste men, namely the Brahmanas and Kshatriyas, could accept a woman of the Vaishya or the Shudra community. But a man from the lower caste could not contact a woman of the higher caste. Even a Kshatriya could not contact a woman of the Brahmana caste. Why? Why is this so? That is explained by Prabhupada in the next sentence of this purport. The wife of a Brahmana is considered one of the seven mothers. This is a Vedic conception. There are seven mothers who are all respectable by everyone. Who are the seven mothers? One's own mother, the wife of the spiritual master or teacher, the wife of a Brahmana, the wife of a king, the cow, the nurse, and the earth. We say mother earth, mother cow. So these are the seven mothers in the Vedic conception of mother. And mother means everyone respects, everyone offers respect. So therefore, that is the reason a Kshatriya could not contact a woman of the Brahmana caste. This we are talking about openly mixing. That is not allowed. Out of respect. It is not a question of curtailing some freedom. No. It is out of respect. Please understand this point. Such contact between man and woman was known as uttama or adhama. Contact of a Brahmana with a Kshatriya woman is uttama. But the contact of a Kshatriya with a Brahmana woman is adhama and therefore condemned.

### Varana-sankara population, Undesirable progeny, Code of conduct, Independent enjoyment vs. Krishna consciousness

**Key Quote:** "Undesirable progeny results from improper mixing."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the consequences of improper mixing of men and women, leading to undesirable progeny, and contrasts the pursuit of independent enjoyment with the satisfaction found in Krishna consciousness.

And in the scriptures it is also described, if there is improper mixing of man and woman, there is what is called as varana-sankara population. This means that the child is not a good person. Undesirable progeny results from improper mixing. The children born will not be having good character. So there is a very great science behind this, behind the rules that are given, given for mixing between men and women. So to produce a good population, it is necessary that men and women follow the code of conduct for mixing with each other. A woman approaching a man for contact should never be refused. But at the same time, the discretion as above mentioned may also be considered. See how carefully the rules are laid down in the dharma shastras. The idea is the whole material existence is a chance for the living beings to try to enjoy independently and become realized that independent enjoyment will never give the desired satisfaction. That is the point. It will never give the desired satisfaction. It will never give the desired happiness that we are seeking as spirit souls. So such real happiness and real satisfaction is only available in our association with Krishna, because Krishna is the reservoir of pure transcendental bliss to an unlimited extent. Therefore, Krishna can fully satisfy us, Krishna can fully make us happy beyond even our capacity, beyond our expectation.

**Key Quote:** "A woman approaching a man for contact should never be refused."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Vedic literature guides individuals on how to approach Krishna and develop a loving relationship with Him, while also emphasizing the importance of discretion in interactions between men and women, stating that a woman approaching a man should not be refused.

Only possible for Krishna. Therefore, the whole Vedic literature is guiding us. The Vedic rules, regulations, directions, restrictions, everything is guiding us how we can actually approach Krishna. You see in the pages of the Bhagavatam, in the entire Bhagavad Gita, in all the dharma shastras, there is every instance that is explained there in the scriptures is how each one of us can actually approach Krishna, and by proper contact with Krishna we can develop the loving relationship with him, and in this regard everyone is encouraged. There is no question of some people being denied the opportunity. Nobody is denied the opportunity. So therefore, it says here a woman approaching a man for contact should never be refused. This is a very, very important point. A woman should not be refused. But at the same time there is a certain discretion that one has to apply. Who is the woman who is approaching and who is the man who is being approached. And men cannot approach women freely. Women freely at all. Men cannot approach women freely at all. A woman may approach a man, but man cannot approach a woman.

### Examples from Bhagavatam and Mahabharata, Uttama and Adama contact, Regulative principles, Good quality population

**Key Quote:** "The result of the contact between man and woman is natural because the way nature has made these mind-body systems a man is attracted to woman and a woman is attracted to a man but that also must be carried out under regulative principles."
**Summary:** The speaker provides examples from the Bhagavatam and Mahabharata to illustrate the principles of Uttama and Adama contact, emphasizing the need for regulative principles to ensure a good quality population.

This is civilized society. Now examples are given by Prabhupada from the Bhagavatam and the Mahabharata. Bhima was approached by Hidimbi from a community lower than the Shudras. Bhima was a Kshatriya, and Hidimbi was from a community lower than the Shudras. And Yayati, another example from the Bhagavatam, Yayati refused to marry the daughter of Shukracharya because Yayati was a Kshatriya and Shukracharya's daughter was Shukracharya was a Brahmana. So a Brahmana's daughter could not be married with a Kshatriya. Vyasadeva, a Brahmana, was called to beget Pandu and Dhritarashtra obviously in the womb of the wife of Vichitravirya, a Kshatriya. In the womb of a Kshatriya's wife, Pandu and Dhritarashtra were begotten by Vyasadeva, he was a Brahmana. So Satyavati belonged to a family of fishermen, but Parashara, a great Brahmana, begot in her Vyasadeva. See, Uttama and Adama contact, this is being explained here. So there are so many examples of contact with women, but in all cases the contacts were not abominable, nor were the results of such contacts bad. If the rules are followed, the result is excellent result. The result of the contact, contact between man and woman is natural, why? Because the way nature has made these mind-body systems, a man is attracted to woman and a woman is attracted to a man, but that also must be carried out under regulative principles so that social consecration may not be disturbed. What is the result of the contact between a man and woman? The population which is generated should be of a good quality, should be of good character, that is the central point.

**Key Quote:** "If somebody is born with a bad character it is not easy to reform even though there is direction in the shastra how even those born with bad character can be reformed but it is difficult."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating the importance of regulated contact between men and women to avoid varana-sankara and the birth of children with bad character, and then returns to the original context of Yudhishthira's questions to Arjuna.

Good character. Now if the contact in man and woman is regulated, then the contact between man and woman is regulated, then there will be no unwanted worthless population, there will be no unwanted progeny. It is called varana sankara. Varana means a population of generating children of very bad character, very bad. If somebody is born with a bad character, it is not easy to reform, even though there is direction in the shastra how even those born with bad character can be reformed, but it is difficult. So therefore here the question is being asked by the shastra, is that the shastra is not good character because you refused her and therefore you are feeling very bad that when such a woman should not have been refused, you refused because she was not very good. Have you done anything to fix your dejection? Tell me what is the cause, or you have been defeated on the way by someone who is inferior or equal to you. So somebody infe if they that is actually a very, very it's a cause for dejection for Arjuna. So Yudhishthira is trying to ask these questions. I'll stop here, thank you very.

### Grihasta Dharma, Vedic Culture, Social Responsibility
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/UmR2yfB8dDI?t=54

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So grihasta dharma is very very very important for upkeep of the society for the spiritual upkeep of the society."
**Summary:** This segment explains the duties of a Grihasta (householder) in Vedic society, emphasizing their responsibility to provide for children, the elderly, Brahmanas, invalids, and even unknown hungry individuals.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 43rd and 44th verses of the 14th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. These are the last two verses of this chapter. This chapter is entitled, "The Disappearance of Lord Krishna." The 43rd verse: अपिसित परियभुं तास्त्वं संभोज्यान वृद्धबालकान जो परियभुं तास्त्वं संभोज्यान वृद्धबालकान जुगुप्सितं कर्म किञ्चित् कृतवान नयद अक्षमं. The meaning of this verse is, "Have you not taken care of old men and boys who deserve to dine with you? Have you left them and taken your meals alone? Have you committed some unpardonable mistake which is to be considered abominable?" This question itself indicates how very exalted was the Vedic culture, that the consideration always for a person before he takes his food, especially lunch, is that he feeds all those who are desirous of food and he is deserving to be fed by a grihasta. This is called grihasta dharma. In the Vedic society, the four spiritual orders: brahmachari, grihasta, vanaprastha, sannyas. Out of these four orders, the grihasta has got certain duties which is absolutely essential to be carried out by the grihasta for the upkeep of the other three spiritual orders. A brahmachari goes and begs from householders. A vanaprastha, he also, of course a vanaprastha does not really beg from a grihasta, but a vanaprastha may beg from a grihasta if he cannot get anything in the forest in terms of fruits, roots, berries or something edible like that in nature. And a sannyasi, of course, he travels from door to door to enlighten people, but in the pretext of begging he tries to approach householders to enlighten them spiritually. So for his subsistence he may take a little, some, bare minimum bhiksha, some food, that's it! So grihasta dharma is very, very, very important for upkeep of the society, for the spiritual upkeep of the society. So Yudhishthira is asking Arjuna that have you not taken care of old men and boys who deserve to dine with you? So Prabhupada explains in the purport, it is the duty of a householder to feed first of all the children, the old members of the family, the brahmanas and the invalids. Such a wonderful culture it is, the very culture, the duty of the householder to feed these four categories of persons. Who are they? The children, the old members of the family, the elderly people, the brahmanas and the invalids. The brahmanas don't work for earning money or for their own maintenance, they don't work. They just give spiritual guidance to the entire society, rest of the society, after themselves becoming well versed in the scriptural knowledge. So they give free consultation to anybody in any subject matter free of charge and for the service they give to the society they are maintained by the other members of the society, especially householders. So householders they share what they have with brahmanas and the invalids. Due to some reason somebody is not able to work and earn money or get their livelihood then they are maintained by the others who are capable of earning and generating wealth. Those able bodied persons should maintain the invalids. This is the culture.

**Key Quote:** "Any householder before he takes his meals he should go out of his house after having fed all these people children, old members of the family, the brahmanas and the invalids after having fed them before he takes his own meals he goes out and calls three times is there anybody hungry who needs food anyone they can come and actually they will be fed first before the grahastha himself takes his meals he will feed them if any unknown hungry man they won't even ask who are you no questions asked you are hungry at lunch time please take prasad this is the culture."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the Vedic injunction for householders to offer food to any hungry person before taking their own meals, illustrating this principle with a story and highlighting the importance of this practice.

So Prabhupada says further, besides that, an ideal householder is required to call for any unknown hungry man to come and dine before he himself goes to take his meals. Any householder before he takes his meals he should go out of his house after having fed all these people, children, old members of the family, the brahmanas and the invalids, after having fed them, before he takes his own meals he goes out and calls three times, "Is there anybody hungry who needs food?" Anyone, they can come and actually they will be fed first before the grahastha himself takes his meals. He will feed them if any unknown hungry man, they won't even ask who are you, no questions asked, you are hungry at lunch time please take prasad. This is the culture, this is the chastric injunction. So a grahastha, a householder is required to call for such a hungry man thrice on the road. In fact, I have heard this that even now in some provinces there are people who follow this injunction. I know of a certain gentleman who said he was travelling in Karnataka in the south canada district, he was going from one place to another place by his car and while he was passing through one particular village it was about lunch time, say one o'clock in the afternoon and his car was stopped by a gentleman of the village and he stopped the car and he was curious why did that gentleman stop his car. So the gentleman said, "I am from this village. I stopped you to inquire from you, have you had your lunch?" So this person in the car said, "No I have not had my lunch." "Please come to my house for lunch," he invited. So this is grahastha dharma. So then that person in the car said who is travelling, who is a traveller, he was very pleased and he went to that gentleman's house of the village and took his meals. So formerly there were no hotels, there were no restaurants either. People would go to a temple which had the arrangement of feeding any visitors at lunch time. Even now if you go to Udupi temple you will get, you will get lunch at lunch time or if you go to ISKCON Bangalore temple you can get lunch at lunch time. So like this there are still some temples even in north India, even in south India, even in Gujarat, in Rajasthan, in Bengal, in Bihar, in Orissa, there are temples which feed people who are visitors in the afternoon at lunch time and sometimes the householders will to a limited extent they may host a person who is a visitor or a traveller or a person who has no arrangement for cooking his food, they may host such a person and feed him. So this is what is explained by Prabhupada here, the neglect of this prescribed duty of a householder especially in the matter of the old men and children is unpardonable. It is considered as a violation of the Vedic injunction for a householder who does not feed such deserving people. So Yudhishthira's question to Arjuna is, did you refuse to feed such deserving people, refuse to feed somebody who was worthy of being fed as a grahastha dharma?

### Separation from Krishna, Dejection, Spiritual Loss, Yudhishthira's Inquiries

**Key Quote:** "Or is it that you are feeling empty for all time because you might have lost your most intimate friend Lord Krishna O my brother Arjuna I can think of no other reason for your becoming so dejected."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the 44th verse, focusing on Yudhishthira's inquiry into Arjuna's dejection and suggesting that it stems from the separation from Lord Krishna, referencing Narada's earlier indication of Krishna's departure.

You didn't do your duty because of which you are dejected. The 44th verse, the last verse: कचित् प्रेष्ठतमॆनाथा हृदयेनात्म बन्धुना शुन्योस्मि रहितो नित्यं मन्यसेते अन्यथा नरुक. The meaning of this verse is, "Or is it that you are feeling empty for all time because you might have lost your most intimate friend Lord Krishna? O my brother Arjuna, I can think of no other reason for your becoming so dejected." So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "All the inquisitiveness of Maharaj Yudhishthira about the world situation was already conjunctured by Maharaj Yudhishthira on the basis of Lord Krishna's disappearance from the vision of the world and this is now disclosed by him because of the acute dejection of Arjuna which could not have been possible otherwise." So even though he was doubtful about it he was obliged to inquire frankly from Arjuna on the basis of Sri Narada's indication. If you recollect in the previous chapter, Dhritarashtra quits home, it was indicated by Narada to Yudhishthira that you Pandavas, you remain on the earth as long as Krishna is on the earth and after Krishna's departure you also may leave this world. So Krishna's departure was hinted by Narada when Yudhishthira had inquired from Narada about Dhritarashtra's quitting home. So this was in the back of the mind of Yudhishthira. So he sent Arjuna after that to inquire from Krishna what is the future program of Krishna and Arjuna did not return for seven months. So Yudhishthira became very anxious whether Krishna has departed from this world because of which so many bad omens were being seen by Yudhishthira and those were described in the beginning of this chapter. So now Yudhishthira is directly inquiring from Arjuna, are you feeling so dejected because you have lost your most intimate friend Lord Krishna because Krishna has departed for the spiritual world, Krishna is no longer on this earth planet. So Yudhishthira is even concluding, "I can think of no other reason for your becoming so dejected," and it will turn out that in the next chapter it will be described how Arjuna replies to all these questions with one answer to begin with and later on he recollects how he is feeling separation from Krishna because Krishna has departed for the spiritual abode, for the spiritual abode after winding up his pastimes. So that is what Arjuna is going to reply but Yudhishthira has already figured out by Arjuna not answering in the affirmative for any of the other reasons for Arjuna's dejection. He has denied, "I am not dejected because of all the other reasons that Yudhishthira thought could be the reason for Arjuna's dejection."

**Summary:** Yudhishthira explains to Bhima that he sent Arjuna to Dvaraka to learn about Krishna's plans.

In this session we will be discussing from the 6th verse of the 14th chapter of the 1st canto of Shri Mudbhagavatam Yudhishthira Uvacha Sampreshito Dvarakayam Jisnur Bandhu Didrikshaya Jnatum Cha Punya Shlokasya Krishnasya Cha Vicheshtitam.

**Summary:** Yudhishthira expresses his concern to Bhima about Arjuna's prolonged absence from Dvaraka.

So Yudhishthira begins to describe to Bhima what's happening. First of all he says I sent Arjuna to Dvaraka for what? To find out what is Krishna's next program. And in the next verse, the 7th verse, Krishna Yudhishthira continues to speak to Bhima: Gata Saptadhuna Masa Bhima Sena Tabanujaha Nayatikasyava Hetor Naham Vedaida Manjasa. The meaning of this 7th verse is, "Since he departed 7 months have passed." When did Yudhishthira send Arjuna? Seven months back. Yet he has not returned. I do not know factually how things are going on there in Dvaraka.

**Key Quote:** "Is he going to quit his earthly pastimes as Devarshi Narada indicated? Has the time already arrived?"
**Summary:** Yudhishthira wonders if Krishna is about to leave the earthly realm, as predicted by Narada.

How things are going on I do not know. The 8th verse: Api devarshina diṣṭaha sakāloyaṁ upasthitaha yadātmano angam ākṛdam bhagavān utsi srikshati. The meaning of this verse is, "Is he going to quit his earthly pastimes as Devarshi Narada indicated? Has the time already arrived?" Again Yudhishthira is conjecturing that Krishna has disappeared. Only then there was a reason for all such symptoms to appear. So he is again trying to confirm by asking Bhima, "Is the soul still alive? Yes. Is the Supreme Lord going to quit his earthly pastimes?" And some mention was made about Devarshi Narada. In the previous chapter it is described Narada had told Yudhishthira, "You Pandavas should remain on this earth as long as the Supreme Lord is present, which means that after the disappearance of Supreme Lord you should also quit your position on this earthly planet." Yes. He also stated that "Pralaya montre protege sw Grandi BhoĄ Madonna." So that is exactly what is being referred here as Devarshi Narada had indicated has the Supreme

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is the unlimited personality of Godhead. He expands. That means he is one person, but he is simultaneously present in many forms."
**Summary:** The speaker begins to explain Srila Prabhupada's purport, focusing on the concept of Krishna's plenary expansions and how Krishna manifests in different forms with different functions.

Lord quit his earthly pastimes. So Srila Prabhupada writes elaborate purport to this particular verse. Srila Prabhupada says, as we have discussed many times, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Krishnah, plenary expansions. What is the meaning of plenary expansion? Krishna is the unlimited personality of Godhead. He expands. That means he is one person, but he is simultaneously present in many forms. He himself is present in many forms. And such expansions are called plenary expansions when Krishna's full power is present in each of the expanded forms. Just like Krishna expands, first of all, as Balaram. So Balaram is Krishna only, but Balaram has the full power of Krishna. Balaram is Krishna, but we say he is Balaram because he is Krishna. He has got different function, he's got different, he displays different varied characteristics, he has specific pastimes, he has specific relationships, he has specific characteristics and all appear to be distinctly different from Krishna's own appearance, characteristics, qualities, activities appear to be different.

**Key Quote:** "Whenever wherever there is a decline in religious practice... at the time I descend myself... To deliver the faithful, to annihilate the miscreants, and also to reestablish the principles of occupational duty, I appear in every age."
**Summary:** The speaker continues explaining plenary expansions, citing verses from the Bhagavad Gita to illustrate the purpose and nature of Krishna's incarnations.

So Krishna, the Supreme personality of God, has many plenary expansions. We can't count how many plenary expansions are there and each and every one of them, each and every plenary expansion, although equally powerful, executes different functions. If it were for the same function there is no need. Krishna is all-powerful, so for different functions, different forms, that is Krishna's own personal opulence. Now Srila Prabhupada quotes the Bhagavad Gita. In Bhagavad Gita there are different statements by the Lord and each of these statements is meant for different plenary portions or portions of the plenary portions. Some of them Srila Prabhupada cites here. For example, Shri Krishna, the Lord says in Bhagavad Gita in the fourth chapter seventh verse, what does he say? "Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice or descendant of Bharata and a predominant rise of irreligion at the time I descend myself." Yada yadahi dharmasya glanir bhavati bhavati, that verse is being cited by Prabhupada, the English translation of that verse, so at different times Krishna has different incarnations appear. So these incarnations are possible plenary portions, or they are portions of plenary portions, amsa and kala. Then again, in the fourth chapter, eighth verse, Krishna says, "To deliver the faithful, to annihilate the miscreants, and also to reestablish the principles of occupational duty, I appear

**Key Quote:** "If I should cease to work, then all humanity would be misdirected... and I would thereby destroy the peace of all sentient beings."
**Summary:** The speaker continues with the explanation of plenary expansions, citing another verse from the Bhagavad Gita, emphasizing that Krishna's different expansions perform different activities.

in every age." In every yuga, Krishna incarnates for three purposes, and those are mentioned here. Now these incarnations are different plenary expansions, different plenary portions, different portions of the plenary portions. They come time to time. Each of the incarnations come appropriately. Then again, in the third chapter, twenty-fourth verse, Krishna says, "If I should cease to work, then all humanity would be misdirected. I would also be the cause of creating unwanted population, and I would thereby destroy the peace of all sentient beings." So this also, Krishna is speaking. But, in his different expansions, different incarnations, he performs different activities. Not all incarnations are doing the same thing. Just like in his expansion as Mahavishnu, he is responsible for the primary creation, breathing out universes, and breathing in the universes.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Particularly Krishna incarnates, he teaches by his own example certain things. In every incarnation he teaches by his example."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna teaches by example in each incarnation and that Krishna is a transcendental personality full of opulences and powers.

Then, as in the server- Meng Bo Tao in the third chapter, and his third chapter, it starts by will follow and whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts all the world pursues. Particularly Krishna incarnates, he teaches by his own example certain things. In every incarnation he teaches by his example. So that is being referred to here, different incarnations, different forms, different activities, different purposes, Krishna appears in different incarnations. So now Prabhupada continues after citing these four verses from the Bhagavad Gita, Prabhupada says, "All the above statements by the Lord apply to different plenary portions of the Lord, namely his expansions such as Sankarsana, Vasudeva, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Narayana, Sankara. These are all he himself in different transcendental expansions. Krishna only, only one person, supreme person, unlimited person. He is not ordinary person like us. Transcendental personality full of all so many opulences, so many powers, so many different forms. Still the Lord and Shri Krishna functions in a different sphere of transcendental exchange

**Key Quote:** "Lord Krishna as he is appears once every 24 hours of Brahma's time... There is no difference between the Lord's self and the Lord's transcendental body."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the timing of Krishna's appearances in different universes and emphasizes the identity of Krishna's body and soul.

with different grades of devotees. As Krishna himself, he also appears. And that appearance is the appearance of the original personality we have got it. In Mathura, he is born and then he transfers himself to Vrindavan and then again comes back to Mathura, then Dwaraka, so different sphere of transcendental exchange with different grades of devotees, different types of devotees are there. And yet Lord Krishna as he is appears once every 24 hours of Brahma's time, once in a day or after a lapse of 8 billion 640 million solar years. This one day and night of Brahma together is unparalleled. In our calculation on the earth, 8 billion 640 million, so many solar years elapse after Krishna appears again. In each and every universe Krishna appears once in the day of Brahma. And all his transcendental pastimes are displayed in each and every universe in a routine spool. Just like cinema is running. Like that. Every Brahmanda, Krishna will appear, perform his pastimes and disappear. Once in a day of Brahma only. In his form as Krishna. Of course, in his other forms, other expansions, other incarnations he appears in so many different yugas in different times. But in that routine spool the functions of Lord Krishna, Lord Vasudeva, etc. are complex problem for the layman. A layman cannot understand. It is the same personality of God that is appearing. There is no difference between the Lord's self and the Lord's transcendental body. This is important.

### Krishna's Body, Yogamaya, Viratrupa, Different Manifestations
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/WJuULo7ycKs?t=821

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna's body and Krishna's soul are identical... when Krishna appears in his original form, all the other plenary expansions join in him by his inconceivable potency called Yogamata."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Krishna's transcendental body with the material body and explains how Krishna's different expansions manifest through Yogamaya, including the Viratrupa.

Krishna's body and Krishna's soul are identical. In our case what happens? This material body is completely different from I, the spirit's soul. That's why time and again we have heard many, many times, "I am not the body, you are not your body." But Krishna is identical with his form. The expansions execute differential activities. Now, the important point to understand is when Krishna appears in his original form, all the other plenary expansions join in him by his inconceivable potency called Yogamata. Thus, the Lord Krishna of Vrindavan is different from the Lord Krishna of Mathura. Different means a different expansion is present in Mathura, a different expansion is present in Dwaraka, a different expansion is present in some other Leela. The Viratrupa of Lord Krishna is also different from him by his inconceivable potency. Krishna showed his Viratrupa to Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, but Krishna is sitting and Arjuna is seeing the Viratrupa and Arjuna is talking to Krishna. So Krishna is there, Viratrupa is also there. Inconceivably they can be one and they can be different. The Viratrupa exhibited on the battlefield of Kurukshetra is a material conception of his form. It is not his totality. It is a transcendental form, Viratrupa is a material conception of form. Therefore it should be understood that when Krishna apparently was killed by the bow and arrow of the hunter, the Lord left his so-called material body in the material world. So what did Krishna leave behind? For the atheist it appears like Krishna was killed by the hunter, but what did he leave behind? When we die, we leave behind our body. Krishna went and killed his own body. He came and killed the body, Krishna says leave behind our material body. Krishna also apparently left behind a material body. Krishna has no material body, he has no material form, then what did we leave behind? So, he left behind, that is explained here that he left behind his Viratrupa in the material world, which is always there in the material world. And Viratrupa belongs to the material world and he left behind that Viratrupa. That Viratrupa belongs to the material world.

Viratrupa inconceivably when Krishna comes also is there within Krishna so there is no question of Krishna accepting a material form nor any question of Krishna becoming conditioned like us no he is always transcendental is always liberated and he's apart from all this material energy and material

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains that all opulence and success are due to the causeless mercy of the Lord, a statement by Yudhishthira.

In this session, we are discussing from the 9th verse of the 14th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Yasmanas Sampado Rajyam Dara Prana Kulam Prajaha Asan Sapatna Vijayo Lokascha Yad Anugrahat. The meaning of this verse is: from him only all our kingly opulence, good wives, lives, progeny, control over our subjects, victory over our enemies, and future accommodations in higher planets have become possible. All this is due to his causeless mercy upon us. Here is the statement by Yudhishthira, which is a very important lesson for all of us.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's explanation that material prosperity, including good family and success, is not solely achieved through hard work but also through the mercy of the Supreme Lord.

Srila Prabhupada explains that very nicely in the purport. Srila Prabhupada says material prosperity consists of a good wife, good home, sufficient land, good children, aristocratic family relations, victory over conflict, and that happenings lead to attaining first place position among the competitors and by pious work, attainment of accommodations in the higher celestial planets for better facilities of material amenities. 若突然尊敬uli古 associations을 Sage Prabhatข Thaksosen Koti Rishis vra rasangarigh drinking biryani drinking biryani good home, good children, sufficient land and aristocratic family relations and victorious over competitors and also perform pious work to ensure a better next life in terms of elevating oneself to heavenly powers.

**Key Quote:** "They forget that in addition to the hard work, most important is the mercy of the Supreme Lord in sanctioning the result."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that while personal effort is necessary, the ultimate success depends on the Lord's sanction and mercy, which is often overlooked.

people consider, "I worked hard and I earned some money or some good result in some work and so on. I worked hard and it is my own hard work that is the cause of my success or my achievement." They forget that in addition to the hard work, most important is the mercy of the Supreme Lord in sanctioning the result. That they forget. So Srila Prabhupada says prosperity earned by one's personal endeavour also depends on the mercy of the Lord. Krishna Kripa, Bhagavad Kripa. You also require the mercy of the Lord for success in any endeavour. Personal labour must be there. It is not that Krishna's mercy is enough, I will not do anything. No. Personal labour must be there in this material world, in addition to the Lord's benediction. So both are required. The personal endeavour and the Lord's mercy or Lord's blessing, both are required. But without the Lord's benediction no one is successful simply by personal labour.

### Kali Yuga, ignorance, five factors of action, divine blessing

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "The modernized man of Kali Yuga, believes in personal endeavour and denies the benediction of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how people in Kali Yuga tend to rely solely on personal effort, ignoring the importance of the Lord's blessings, and references the five factors of action from the Bhagavad Gita.

Professor is reiterating this point. Your hard work alone is not enough, anybody for that matter, in this material world. The modernized man of Kali Yuga believes in personal endeavour and denies the benediction of the Supreme Lord. This is the position of most people in the present Kali Yuga. They are ignorant and they are not properly educated and they do not know how subtle laws are working, who is ultimately in control of everything that is going on. Why is it that people do not always succeed in all their endeavors? Actually, most people don't have an answer for this. The answer is given here that there are two things: the personal endeavor and the sanction of the Lord, the blessing or benediction or mercy of the Lord. This is explained very nicely in the Bhagavad Gita: five factors of action are dependent on personal endeavor and one is called diva, that is the Supreme Lord's blessing of the mercy.

**Key Quote:** "Neither personal endeavour is to be ignored, nor should one neglect the Supreme Lord's blessings."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that both personal effort and the Lord's blessings are essential for success, citing Yudhishthira as an example of a devotee who understands this truth.

So clearly these five factors are responsible for successful accomplishment of any action in this material world by anybody. Srila Prabhupada cites one instance: even a great sanyasi of India delivered speeches in Chicago protesting the benedictions of the Supreme Lord, as if Supreme Lord's benediction don't matter at all. This sanyasi was speaking only your own personal endeavor is important and enough. Sense nor is your gift to Sreenivas or your own that is wrong as far as the Vedic shastras are concerned as we find in the pages of Srimad Bhagavatam the ultimate sanction for all success rests in the hands of the Supreme Lord is the fact that it 신 person Maharaja Udeshetira admits this truth in his personal success U William'sennen Yudhishthira is an ideal personality. He is a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord, so he is not ignorant, he is not foolish, he is not a sentimentalist. He is a powerful Kshatriya, but he does his duties properly. He knows that his success is dependent on Krishna's benedictions also, in addition to his personal endeavour. So neither personal endeavour is to be ignored, nor should one neglect the Supreme Lord's blessings. Both are required. Both are required.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "If one could achieve success without the sanction of the Lord, then no medical practitioner would fail to cure a patient."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of medical practitioners to illustrate that even with the best efforts, success is not guaranteed without the Lord's sanction.

Both are essential. Now Maharaj Yudhishthira admits this truth in his personal success and he behooves one to follow in the footsteps of a great king and devotee of the Lord to make life a full success. So Prabhupada is revealing to all of us, how can we ensure full success in our life? We have to personally endeavour and we should also learn to depend on Krishna's blessings. Both are required. Now Srila Prabhupada says one important point and helps us understand the truth, the reality. Prabhupada says, if one could achieve success without the sanction of the Lord, then no medical practitioner would fail to cure a patient. Medical practitioners work very hard, very sincerely to cure somebody who has got a deadly disease. They work very hard. They sincerely work to diagnose, to treat, to administer the medicine, or to do surgery, or to administer specific treatment. And even the most successful people, sometimes they are unable to save the patient. So, one should be very careful. One should be very careful. One should be very careful. One should be very careful. One should be very careful. So, why is it that every time they give good treatment, they are not successful? That is because the Lord's hand is definitely there.

**Key Quote:** "God's sanction is the immediate cause for all happenings, good or bad."
**Summary:** The speaker continues with examples of medical cases where people die despite treatment or survive without it, concluding that God's sanction is the ultimate cause of all events.

In spite of their hard work and very good care, people die. Some people die. So Srila Prabhupada says, despite the most advanced treatment of a suffering patient by the most up-to-date medical practitioner, there is death. And even in the most hopeless case, without medical treatment, a patient is cured astonishingly. I have many instances I can cite. I don't have time now. That there have been cases where people have been rushed to their... to their family doctor, and the family doctor tried his best to treat and cure, and he was not successful. The doctor is the same. The patient is one who has taken treatment earlier, and he has been treated and cured earlier, many, many times. But one particular time, the doctor was not able to cure the patient. The patient died. So, there is... There are instances where people die in spite of the best treatment. And there are instances also where somebody is unable to get treatment, and they are just not having any hope of surviving, because they have got a very deadly disease. And without any treatment, without any medicine, without any kind of intervention, medical intervention, they astonishingly survive. They somehow become cured, without any treatment. There are instances of people following what is called as naturopathy. They purposely don't go to a doctor. They don't take any medicine. They don't take any medical treatment. They just follow a strict diet, and they do fasting. And they become cured. But again, it's not that they're going to live forever. That we have to remember. Whatever be your system of maintaining good health, at a certain time, when the lifespan is over, one has to quit the body in this material world. Death is certain, for one has taken birth after the duration of a certain lifespan. It is certain. Therefore, the conclusion, what is the conclusion? That God's sanction is the immediate cause for all happenings, good or bad.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of gratitude towards Krishna for all achievements, which leads to Krishna consciousness and ultimately, eternal life in the spiritual abode.

So never neglect or ignore God's sanction, Krishna's sanction. Krishna, please remember, Krishna is seated on everybody's heart. He is active in everybody's life. He is a constant companion of the conditioned soul, as long as the conditioned soul is in this material world. So he guides. If I quit this body, Krishna will guide me to my next destination. Krishna knows everything and he will guide me to the next body that I have to accept, if I have to accept the body, or he'll guide me to his personal abode, if I have to go back to God. Exactly everybody is guided by the Supersoul, Paramatma, who is none other than Krishna himself. So Krishna's hand is always there. Any successful man should feel grateful to the Lord for all he has achieved. This is the last statement by Srila Prabhupada in this purport. Have that gratitude. And by having that gratitude for all success in all your endeavors, you become Krishna conscious. Gratitude towards Krishna. You become Krishna conscious. When you become Krishna conscious, that's your success in life. Ultimate success. You get out of this material existence and you go to the spiritual abode of the Supreme Lord to live eternal life full of knowledge and bliss. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

and above all Maharaja Yudhishthira's speculative inquiries. So in the previous chapter we had heard about Yudhishthira seeing bad omens after having sent Arjuna to inquire about Krishna's next program. When Arjuna did not return for several months then Yudhishthira began to conjecture what could be the reason why Arjuna has not returned and what could be the reason why there are bad omens. So he guessed it is only possible because Krishna has returned to his personal abode. He has left this earth planet. Krishna has disappeared. So now this is going to be confirmed by Arjuna and Arjuna has been bewitched He got lost and he returned again. And when Arjuna is there. He is returning again. And Yudhishthira has returned when Yudhishthira was trying to find the cause or the reason for the bad omens and when Arjuna returned immediately Yudhishthira began to inquire why is Arjuna appearing to be very dejected. And therefore he is guessing the cause for Arjuna's dejection and when Arjuna And after, when Arjuna could not immediately reply to Yudhishthira's inquiries, so Yudhishthira went on asking, is it because of this, is it because of that, is it because of something else? And finally, when Arjuna would not reply, either yes or no, then Yudhishthira said, the only reason you are so dejected is because you have lost your dear most friend Lord Krishna, you are separated from him. And now Arjuna is going to reply. So, this verse says, in the Purport Shilaprabha says, being too much aggrieved, Arjuna practically became choked up, and therefore it is not possible for him to reply properly to the various speculations and speculative inquiries of Maharaja Yudhishthira.

**Key Quote:** "This is the whole foundation of the philosophy of Krishna consciousness. Krishna is the supreme lord. Every living being is a very tiny part of Krishna. And every living being has got a specific loving relationship with Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the philosophy of Krishna consciousness, highlighting the loving relationship between Krishna and every living being, contrasting it with material relationships based on the body and mind.

This is the whole foundation of the philosophy of Krishna consciousness. Krishna is the supreme lord. Every living being is a very tiny part of Krishna. And every living being has got a specific loving relationship with Krishna. And in that relationship, Krishna reciprocates perfectly, exactly according to the relationship. So now, how did Krishna relate with Arjuna? That is being explained here. Sri Arjuna is one of the typical pure devotees of the lord, reciprocating in the fraternal relationship. Fraternal. Fraternal relationship means as a friend. Krishna and Arjuna are related as friend. And the lord's dealings with Arjuna are displays of friendship of the highest perfect order. We have friendly relations with different people in this material world. We have experience. But in this world, all relationships with other persons, is tinged with material defects. The first material defect is that all such relationships are based on body. Anything that happens to the body affects the relationship. Body means there is an external body and there is an inside, internal body, the mind. So the gross body and the sub-body. The subtle mind. These are the basis of our relationships in this material world with other persons. Who similarly also have, like I have a gross body and I have a subtle mind. But I am different from these two. I am spirit soul.

### Spirit Soul, Coverings, Soul-Supersoul Relationship, Perfect Relationship, Arjuna's Reaction

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's relationship with every living being is soul to the super soul. Perfect relationship."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the difference between material and spiritual relationships, emphasizing the perfect relationship between the soul and the Supersoul (Krishna), and concludes with Arjuna's reaction to Yudhishthira's inquiries.

Similarly, you, if I have a relationship with you, you are also spirit soul. But you have a covering over your spirit soul. You have a covering of the subtle mind and the gross body. So you are. Your subtle mind, your gross body, is covering you and my gross body and my subtle mind is covering me. And the relationship, the material relationship is between or based on this gross body and subtle mind. It has nothing to do with the soul, factually. So, Krishna's relationship with every living being is soul to the super soul. Or soul to the... Supreme soul. He is a supreme soul. He has no covering. Pure devotees don't have any covering. Pure devotees are their individual pure spirit soul. So the relationship is between soul and supreme soul. Perfect relationship. So, Krishna was not only a well-wisher of Arjuna, but actually a benefactor. And to make it. Still more perfect, the Lord tied him into a family relationship by arranging Subhadra's marriage with him. And above all, the Lord became a chariot driver of Arjuna in order to protect his friend from warfare risks. And the Lord became happy when he established the Pandavas to rule over the world after the battle of Rukshetra. Arjuna remembered all these one after another and thus he became overwhelmed with such thoughts. So, this is Arjuna's reaction when Yudhishthira Maharaj made inquiries. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

### insulting devotees, Draupadi, Kurukshetra

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So here is another very very important lesson for all of us. It is explained by Srila Prabhupada. The Lord can tolerate insults upon himself by any miscreant because the father tolerates even insults from the son. But the Lord never tolerates insults from the son."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the story of Draupadi's insult and the consequences faced by the Kauravas, emphasizing the importance of not insulting devotees.

In this session we will be discussing from the 10th verse of the 15th chapter of the 1st Canto Srimad Bhagavatam: पत्न्यास्तवाधी मख त्लिप्त महाविषेक श्लागिष्ठ चारु कबरं कितवै सभायां स्पृष्टं विकीरिय पदयो पतिताश्रु मुख्या यस्तत्स्त्रियो अक्रत हतेश विमुक्त केशा. The meaning of this verse is: It was he only who loosened the hair of all the women, the wives of the miscreants, who dared open the cluster of your queen's hair, which had been nicely dressed and sanctified for the great Rajasuya sacrificial ceremony. At that time she fell down at the feet of Lord Krishna with tears in her eyes. So this is an incident that happened before the Pandavas went to the temple of Lord Krishna, to the forest for exile. In the gambling match something happened that is described by Prabhupada in the purport. Queen Draupadi had a beautiful bunch of hair which was sanctified in the ceremonial function of Rajasuya Yajna. The Rajasuya Yajna took place before the Pandavas went to exile. So Draupadi was actually sanctified in that ceremonial function. She had a very beautiful bunch of hair, but when she was lost in a bet during the gambling match between the Pandavas and Kauravas, Dushasana touched her glorified hair to insult her. These are demoniac natured people. They have no consideration that a chaste lady is never to be insulted. A chaste lady is never to be insulted. So they thought they can do whatever they like and get away with it. So Dushasana actually insulted Draupadi. Draupadi then fell down at the lotus feet of Lord Krishna, and Lord Krishna decided that all the wives of Dushasana and company should have their hair loosened as a result of the banal activity of the Pandavas, the battle of Kurukshetra. Thus, after the battle of Kurukshetra, after all the sons and grandsons of Dhritarashtra died in battle, all the wives of the family were obliged to loosen their hair as widows. You see, all the wives of the Kuru family became widows because of Dushasana

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the dangers of offending Vaishnavas, emphasizing the loss of pious merits and benedictions.

insulting a great devotee of the Lord. So here is another very, very important lesson for all of us. It is explained by Srila Prabhupada: The Lord can tolerate insults upon himself by any miscreant because the father tolerates even insults from the son. But the Lord never tolerates insults from the son. The Lord never tolerates insults upon his devotees. If someone insults Krishna, Krishna may tolerate. But if someone insults Krishna's devotees, Krishna will never tolerate. And it is explained here, by insulting a great soul, one has to forego all the results of pious acts and benedictions also. So Dushasana, by insulting Draupadi, the chaste, the chaste lady and pure devotee of Krishna, invited trouble for himself. So all the Kauravas, all the sons of Dhritarashtra and his grandsons, were all killed in the battle of Kurukshetra. None of them survived. Not even one surviving descendant for Dhritarashtra. Not even one surviving descendant. And the Pandavas, they were actually killed. They were actually protected by Krishna mystically, that they were completely unharmed in that big battle. It was a world war. It was no small battle. It was the world war. And in that the Pandavas were protected by Krishna. So, the lesson for us is never insult a Vaishnava. Never offend a Vaishnava. It is very dangerous. By offending a Vaishnava, one loses all results of the pious activities and all benedictions also are lost.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the story of Haridas Thakur, highlighting his qualities as an ideal devotee who both practices and preaches Krishna consciousness.

There is another incident described in the Chaitanya Charita Amrita, in the life of Srila Haridas Thakur. Haridas Thakur was a devotee of Lord Chaitanya, and he used to chant the Hare Krishna mantra himself very nicely, and he also preached to people on the order of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. He used to preach others also to take up this chanting of Hare Krishna mantra. He is described as the ideal devotee who not only practices very nicely the Krishna conscious principles, especially chanting, he also preaches on the order of the Lord. So, he is the ideal devotee. Sanatana Goswami glorifies Haridas Thakur as the ideal devotee, because while there are some devotees who practice very nicely but don't preach, and there are others who preach very nicely but don't practice adequately, Haridasa Thakur is a unique devotee who nicely practices and preaches about the chanting of the holy name.

So Haridasa Thakur was once insulted by a priest, and that is described in the Chaitanya Charita Amrita, that in the house of two governmental treasurers called Hiranya Majumdar and Govardhana Majumdar, there was a meeting because they were devotees of Krishna. So there was a meeting of two devotees, and there was a meeting of saintly persons. So in that meeting, one Balaram Acharya, who was a priest of this Majumdar household, that Balaram Acharya was invited for the meeting of saintly persons in Majumdar's house.

So Haridasa Thakur was traveling and preaching, and while traveling and preaching, he happened to come to this village, where these two brothers, treasurers of the government, were staying, Hiranya Majumdar and Govardhana Majumdar. So when he came to that meeting, that village, he accepted prasadam in the house of Balaramacharya, and he used to perform chanting in a solitary place where there was a thatched hut. Living in a simple hut he would chant practically the whole day and take a little prasadam from Balaramacharya's residence. So in that meeting there were discourses taking place and the saintly persons participated in that discourse. So when Haridasa Thakur was invited to come to that assembly in which the discourses were to take place,

**Key Quote:** "Actually, by chanting the holy name without offences, one awakens his ecstatic love for the lotus feet of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts how Haridas Thakur explained that the true result of chanting the holy name is awakening love for Krishna, with liberation being an insignificant by-product.

Haridasa Thakur was invited to come to that assembly in which the discourses were to take place. Haridasa Thakur, accompanied by Balaramacharya, came to the house of the Majumdars. So when all the devotees, particularly these two Majumdars, they saw Haridasa Thakur, they immediately stood up to receive him with great respect, and they fell at his lotus feet, and they gave him a nice place to sit. In that assembly were many people, many learned scholars, brahmanas, and respectable gentlemen. In fact, these two brothers, Hiranya and Govardhan Majumdar, were also very learned. So everyone began to speak of Haridasa Thakur's great qualities. So the brothers were very happy to hear everyone glorifying Haridasa Thakur. So it was mentioned that Haridasa Thakur used to chant three lakh names of Krishna every day. Practically, he would chant the whole day. And the scholars began to discuss the glories of chanting the holy name. Some of them said by chanting the holy name one is freed from all reactions of sinful life. Then somebody else said by chanting the holy name one is liberated from material bondage. Haridasa Thakur, however, said that if you chant the holy name, you will be freed from material bondage. Haridasa Thakur said that if you chant the holy name you will be free from material bondage. These two benedictions are not the true result of chanting the holy name. Actually, by chanting the holy name without offences, one awakens his ecstatic love for the lotus feet of Krishna. Actually, it is described in the scriptures. Chanting of the holy name, offenselessly, awakens the dormant devotion and one becomes a lover of God, Krishna. Now, as regards liberation and becoming free from sinful reactions are concerned, they are insignificant by-products of chanting the holy name. The holy name of the Supreme Lord, insignificant by-products.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "even before one becomes a pure chanter of the holy name, even before that, just by a glimpse of offenseless chanting, immediately all sinful reactions are completely nullified."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of the rising sun to illustrate how even a glimpse of offenseless chanting eradicates sinful reactions, emphasizing that liberation is insignificant compared to love of Krishna.

Now, Haridasa Thakur gives an example to help us understand. Just like, when the sun rises, it dissipates the world's darkness immediately. So, similarly, when one chants the holy name of the Supreme Lord, without offences, automatically all the sinful reactions are completely eradicated. Now, Srila Haridasa Thakur explains that even before the sun rises, there is some first glimpse of sunlight that appears before the sun rises, and even with the first glimpse of this sunlight, the fear of thieves, ghosts, demons, immediately disappears. And when the sun actually rises, everything is manifest and everyone begins performing his religious activities and material duties. So, similarly, at the first hint that somebody is chanting offenselessly the holy name of the Supreme Lord, immediately all reactions to sinful life are completely eradicated. So, when actually one chants the holy name offenselessly, one becomes ecstatic in love of Krishna. So, Haridasa Thakur explains that even before one becomes a pure chanter of the holy name, even before that, just by a glimpse of offenseless chanting, immediately all sinful reactions are completely nullified. So, liberation is actually an insignificant thing for a pure devotee.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates how Gopal Chakravarthy insulted Haridas Thakur and suffered severe consequences, reinforcing the danger of offending devotees.

So, when one particular brahmana, Gopal Chakravarthy, who was the official chief tax collector in that village, he heard this, he became very upset. He said, he had a beautiful body, very nice handsome features, and he began to criticize Haridasa Thakur. He said, look at this emotional devotee saying that liberation is very easily obtained by a glimpse of offenseless chanting of the holy name of the Supreme Lord. Liberation is so difficult. It takes millions of births. When one is perfectly situated in absolute knowledge, only then one may attain liberation. But here is the sentimental person who says very easily you can get liberation. So, then Haridasa Thakur said, why are you doubting the revealed scriptures? I am just quoting the revealed scriptures. So, then this brahmana said, if it is not true, then I will cut off your nose. Haridasa Thakur humbly accepted. If it is not true, then Haridasa Thakur said, yes, you can cut my nose. But others became very, very upset at this brahmana Gopal Chakravarthi insulting Haridasa Thakur. So, they all protested and Haridasa Thakur did not take offense and left that place. But very soon, in three days, this brahmana, he got leprosy and his nose was affected and it fell off. So, this is the result of offending a pure devotee that this Gopal Chakravarthi, he became afflicted by leprosy and he lost his nose when he insulted Haridasa Thakur telling, I will cut off your nose if what you are telling is not true. So, we have to be careful not to insult devotees. Otherwise, it is very dangerous for our spiritual life.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Durvasa Muni's powers, his interaction with Kunti, and Duryodhana's plan to create trouble for Yudhishthira by sending Durvasa Muni as a guest.

So it is described, Durvasa Muni, he was a very powerful mystic Brahmana, and he had performed a lot of austerities. So he had a lot of power, mystic power. And this Durvasa Muni, he was a partial incarnation of Lord Shiva. And when he was satisfied with somebody's service, he would do a lot of good to that person. But if he was dissatisfied, he could bring about the greatest calamity. Once it so happened that he was, this Durvasa Muni was, a guest at the house of Kunti's father. And Kunti was serving him as a young girl, and Durvasa Muni was satisfied with her, and he blessed her with the power to call any devata she desired in order to have a child. Now, Durvasa Muni could foresee that this Kunti, when she grows up, she will not be able to beget children through her husband Pandu. Therefore, Durvasa Muni blessed her in this way. And it turned out that Kunti could beget children only by calling upon some demigods, because she could not beget children through Pandu. So, this Durvasa Muni used to travel in space by his great mystic powers, and he could travel everywhere in the whole universe. Now, once he was a guest at the palace of Duryodhana in Hastinapura. And Duryodhana satisfied this brahmana, Durvasa Muni, and when Durvasa Muni was satisfied, Durvasa Muni wanted to give some benediction to Duryodhana. So, Duryodhana knew that this Durvasa Muni has got a lot of mystic powers. So, what did Duryodhana ask this Durvasa Muni? He requested that Durvasa Muni become a guest of Yudhishthira Maharaj, who is in exile, who was in exile at that time, that you become a guest of Yudhishthira, and you should visit him only after Draupadi has finished her meals. At such a time, on such a day, you should visit the King Yudhishthira in exile.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Duryodhana's scheme, Yudhishthira's anxiety, Draupadi's prayer to Krishna, and Krishna's appearance and request for food.

So, Durvasa Muni agreed because he was very pleased with Duryodhana. Now, Duryodhana's plan was that when Durvasa Muni visits Yudhishthira with 10,000 disciples, and that too after Draupadi has finished her meal, then how will Yudhishthira feed Durvasa Muni and his 10,000 disciples? Because the Pandavas during exile, they had been gifted with one special pot. That pot would give enough food to any number of people, till Draupadi would take her meals. After that, the pot would not give any more food, not produce any more food. So, when Durvasa Muni visited the camp of Yudhishthira in the forest as his guest, he visited after Draupadi had finished her meals. So, Yudhishthira received this Durvasa Muni very nicely and requested the Muni to go to the nearby river and take bath and finish his noon duties and then come for lunch. So, the Muni went, Durvasa Muni went with his 10,000 disciples to the river to take bath. All of them were taking bath and in the meantime, Yudhishthira became very anxious. How is he going to serve lunch for Durvasa Muni and his 10,000 disciples? So, in his anxiety, he was praying to Krishna because they are all devotees of Krishna. So, Yudhishthira realized that Durvasa Muni has come after Draupadi has finished her meals. So, how will they feed? In any case, Yudhishthira requested Draupadi to do something. Then Draupadi began to pray to Krishna. And Draupadi, when she prayed to Krishna, Krishna appeared in front of Draupadi. The Lord is very merciful to his devotees, especially to his devotees. So, because Draupadi was in trouble, she was praying to the Lord and Lord Krishna appeared. Then, when Draupadi told Krishna about their dangerous situation, Krishna just requested Draupadi that you give me some food, then your problem is solved. So, Draupadi, when she heard that Krishna is asking for some food, she felt very bad that she could not serve Krishna with any food because she had finished her meals and there was nothing else in stock.

**Key Quote:** "When Krishna is satisfied, everyone is satisfied."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates how Krishna ate a tiny grain from the pot, satisfying everyone, including Durvasa Muni and his disciples, highlighting the universal connection through Krishna.

So, when she was unable to give any food to Krishna, she began to cry, as is natural for a woman who is in difficulty. But, when she began to cry, Krishna called her and said, Why don't you bring that pot which has been gifted by the Sun God to you? Bring that pot now, immediately. So, Draupadi brought that pot. The pot was empty. The pot was not having any food. So then, Krishna examined very carefully inside the pot. There was one small grain of foodstuff sticking to a corner of the pot. So, Krishna picked up that small grain and ate it immediately. After Krishna had taken that one small grain remaining in the pot, he told Draupadi, Now, you can invite your guests and you can feed them. So, on Krishna's instruction, Draupadi went to Yudhishthira and told him, Now, the guests can be invited. So, Yudhishthira sent Bhima to the river to call Durvasamuni and his 10,000 disciples to come for lunch. And meantime, what had happened, that Durvasamuni and his disciples were taking bath in the river and performing their religious duties. They began to feel completely satisfied, completely satisfied. Their hunger was completely mitigated. That, when Bhima came to invite them, Durvasamuni thought, Oh, Yudhishthira should have arranged a big feast and I am feeling very much full. How can I do justice? I better don't go. I don't accept that invitation because I am already feeling completely full in my stomach, in my belly, just by taking this bath. Though actually, Durvasamuni had not taken his meals at all that day, but still he began to feel full. So, since Durvasamuni thought that he didn't want to disappoint Yudhishthira by refusing outright the lunch, so he quietly went away from that place without going to Yudhishthira's camp. He and his disciples all felt completely full and they went away. Now, how is it that without eating anything, actually the 10,000 disciples of Durvasamuni and Durvasamuni himself began to feel full? It is because yasmintushte jagatushtihi When Krishna is satisfied, everyone is satisfied. When Krishna's hunger is mitigated, everyone's hunger is mitigated.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of offering food to Krishna with devotion, as it pleases everyone and demonstrates Krishna's reciprocity with his devotees.

Because Krishna is the center and everyone else is his part, his amsa. He is a complete whole. So, this incident proves that a householder must always offer food to the Lord and in that way a householder will be able to satisfy or please anybody, any number of guests, including guests numbering 10,000 which Durvasamuni used to travel with. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj was able to actually satisfy Durvasamuni with all his 10,000 disciples simply by Krishna accepting a tiny grain of particle. In fact, Krishna is not in need of anything, but he accepts when something is offered with devotion for the sake of benedicting his devotees, for the sake of reciprocating with his devotees. So, I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "These are words spoken by Arjuna."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam 1.15.12, explaining that Arjuna is recounting his achievements and the grace of Lord Krishna to Yudhishthira after returning from Dwaraka.

Om Agyanati Miran Dhasya Gyananj Nishalakaya Chaksharan Militam Yena Tasmai Shri Gurave Namaha Nama Om Vishnu Padaya Krishna Preshtaya Bhutale Shri Mate Bhakti Vedanta Swamin Nithinamine Namaste Saraswate Deve Gauravani Pracharine Nirvishesha Shunyavadi Pashchatyade Shatarine Jaya Shri Krishna Chaitanya Prabhu Nithyananda Shri Advaita Gadadhara Shiva Sadhi Gauravakta Vrinda Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devim Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet Om Namah Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam In this session we will be discussing from the 12th verse of the 15th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam.

I was able to reach the heavenly planets in this present body and was allowed a half elevated seat.

### Demigods vs. Supreme Lord, Devotion to Krishna, Srila Prabhupada's purport
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/bgJl9llMpcc?t=124
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "By such a conception one becomes an offender ultimately meets with the same end as Ravana and others."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing that pleasing the Supreme Lord Krishna is superior to pleasing demigods, and that devotees of Krishna respect demigods, but those who consider demigods equal to Krishna are offenders.

These are words spoken by Arjuna. He is speaking to Yudhishthira. He has returned from Dwaraka. He has brought the news that Krishna has departed for his personal abode. And he is recollecting the grace of Lord Krishna, by which he was able to do so many wonderful things. So Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport: By the grace of the Supreme Personality of God, Sri Krishna, all the demigods including Lord Shiva were pleased with Arjuna. The idea is that one who is favored by Lord Shiva or any other demigod may not necessarily be favored by Arjuna. But he was certainly a great devotee of Lord Shiva, but he could not be saved from the wrath of the Supreme Personality of God, Lord Ramachandra. And there are many instances like that in the histories of the Puranas. But here is an instance where we can see that Lord Shiva became pleased even with the grace of Lord Shiva. He was pleased with Arjuna. Even in the fight with Arjuna. The devotees of the Supreme Lord know how to respect the demigods, but the devotees of the demigods sometimes foolishly think that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is no greater than the demigods. By such a conception one becomes an offender, ultimately meets with the same end as Ravana and others. The instances described by Arjuna during his friendly dealings with Lord Sri Krishna are instructive for all who may be convinced by the lessons that one can achieve all favors simply by pleasing the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna, whereas the devotees or worshippers of the demigods may achieve only partial benefits which are also perishable, just as the demigods themselves are.

### Perishable vs. Eternal, Awards from Krishna vs. Demigods, Bhagavad Gita

**Key Quote:** "Whereas the Supreme Lord is eternal. His blessings are eternal."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the perishable benedictions received from demigods with the eternal blessings of the Supreme Lord Krishna, referencing the Bhagavad Gita.

In the Bhagavad Gita it is said, Cheene Punye Marthya Lokam Vishanti. In the Bhagavad Gita it is said, the... I am sorry. Less intelligent people worship demigods by which they get benedictions which are perishable, as much as the demigods themselves are perishable, whereas the Supreme Lord is eternal. His blessings are eternal. His alms, awards are eternal. So there is a significant difference between the award given by Krishna and awards given by the demigods.

### Arjuna's heavenly journey, Suitability of bodies, Grace of Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "But Arjuna, by the grace of Lord Sri Krishna, he was able to go in the self-same body to the heavenly planet of Indra Deva."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights Arjuna's unique ability to reach the heavenly planets in his physical body due to the grace of Lord Krishna, contrasting it with the general limitations of bodies and planetary conditions.

Srila Prabhupada further explains, another significance of the present verse is that Arjuna, by the grace of Lord Sri Krishna, was able to reach the heavenly planet even with the self-same body. Generally, we cannot go to the heavenly planet with this body. Each and every body is suitable for certain living conditions on a particular planet. The living conditions are different on different planets. The duration of life is different. The atmospheric conditions are different. Just like Srila Prabhupada gives the example, there are so many creations. There are so many creatures, aquatics, living in the water, but we cannot live in the water. Similarly, there are creatures living in the air. Now, we cannot live in the air. So, every creature, created being, has got a suitable body for residing on a particular planet in a particular atmosphere. This is the reason why it is said here simply somebody cannot just go by some mechanical means and enter the heavenly planets. It is not possible. But Arjuna, by the grace of Lord Sri Krishna, he was able to go in the self-same body to the heavenly planet of Indra Deva. Not only he went there, it is described. He was also honored by the heavenly demigods.

**Key Quote:** "Kshine Punye Marthya Lokam Vishanti one comes down to the earthly planets when they exhaust their Punyakarma"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while pious acts can lead to the heavenly planets, the enjoyment is temporary, and one returns to the earthly plane upon exhausting the merits, referencing the Bhagavad Gita.

started position compared to the human beings on the earth, but Indra offered his seat, shared his seat with Arjuna, which means that Arjuna was able to please Indra Deva all by the grace of Lord Shri Krishna. So Srila Prabhupada says generally one can reach the heavenly planets but a pious acts recommended in the Shastras in the category of fructive activities, karma Kanda portion of the Vedas, it is described how certain types of pious activities, Punyakarya, makes one eligible in the next life to reach the heavenly planet. And as it is stated in the Bhagavad Gita 9th chapter 21st verse, when the reactions of such pious acts are spent, the enjoyer is again degraded to this earthly planet. One elevates oneself by pious acts, when the Punya is exhausted one comes back to the earth. Kshine Punye Marthya Lokam Vishanti, one comes down to the earthly planets when they exhaust their Punyakarma.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Arjuna was allowed to enter into the heavenly planets in the self same body simply by the grace of the Lord otherwise it is not possible to do so"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the traditional path to heavenly planets through pious acts with Arjuna's unique access through Krishna's grace, criticizing modern scientists' attempts to reach heavenly planets without the necessary spiritual qualifications.

So Srila Prabhupada further says, the moon is also on the level with the heavenly planets and only persons who have performed virtues, only performing sacrifices, giving charity and undergoing severe austerities, yagna daana tapa, can be allowed to enter into the heavenly planets after the duration of life of the present body. I do punya karma while in this body, while on the earth, and after I quit this body by dint of the punya karma I am elevated to the heavenly planet in the next life, not in the same life. Arjuna was allowed to enter into the heavenly planets in the self same body simply by the grace of the Lord, otherwise it is not possible to do so. So it's only the grace of Lord Krishna, by the grace of Lord Krishna anything is possible for the devotees. The present attempts to enter into the heavenly planets by the modern scientists will certainly prove futile because such scientists are not on the level of Arjuna. What was possible for Arjuna is not possible for the modern-day scientists. They are trying to go by some mechanical means to the moon planet or nowadays even the Mars planet. They cannot go like that because they don't have a suitable body which is fit for the atmosphere of the earth and they cannot go like that because they don't have a suitable body which is fit for the atmosphere conditions on those planets. Proper further says these modern scientists who are trying to go there, they are ordinary human beings without any assets of sacrifice, charity or austerities. Most of them are atheists in any case they are.

**Key Quote:** "The material body is influenced by the three modes of material nature everyone who is taken birth in this material world is influenced by the three gunas including Lord Brahma"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how the modes of passion and ignorance (Rajoguna and Tamoguna) lead to lust and greed, preventing one from reaching higher planetary systems, and how only those influenced by goodness can access them.

not performed the necessary punya karma, so how can they go? It's not possible. The material body is influenced by the three modes of material nature. Everyone who is taken birth in this material world is influenced by the three gunas, including Lord Brahma. The present population is more or less influenced by the modes of passion ignorance and the symptoms for such influence are exhibited in the becoming very lusty and greedy. Rajasthamo bhava kama lobha, the influence of Rajoguna and Tamoguna, passion and ignorance modes of material nature, is that one becomes lusty and greedy, kama krodha, sorry kama and lobha. So with such a religious consciousness one cannot enter the heavenly planets. Social a proper further says such degraded fellows can hardly approach the higher planetary systems. Above the heavenly planets there are many other planets also which only those who are influenced by goodness can reach. In heavenly and other planets with inhabitants are all highly intelligent. So this is a piece of information.

**Key Quote:** "Become a devotee of Lord Sri Krishna then you have the favor of the demigods also but somebody is simply trying to satisfy some devata not necessarily they will be favored by Krishna"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the superior intelligence and piety of the inhabitants of heavenly planets, highlighting that they are devotees of the Lord, and reiterates that devotion to Krishna ensures the favor of the demigods, concluding the lecture.

authentic fact for the modern-day scientists. Some of them believe that humans are the most intelligent persons in this entire material creation, but they do not know the devatas in the higher planets, the rishis, the sages, they are many times more intelligent than the human beings from the earth. They are all pious in the higher and highest mode of goodness, that's also a qualification. They are pious, Punya, in the higher and highest modes of goodness, that means they are almost situated in entirely in goodness, though in the material world there's nothing like exclusive goodness, there's always a tinge of the influence of rajoguna, tamoguna, always it is there in the conditioned souls. So these inhabitants of the heavenly planets, they are highly intelligent, they are very pious, they have so much of Punya karma and most importantly they are all devotees of the Lord. All of them in the heavenly planets, they are all devotees, Vishnu Bhaktas, Mitho, Daiva and although their goodness is not unadulterated, there's some tinge still they are known as demigods possessing the maximum amount of good qualities possible in the material world. So this is a very important point that we need to understand. This is the description by Srila Prabhupada in this purport. So we should understand become a devotee of Lord Sri Krishna then you have the favor of the demigods also, but somebody is simply trying to satisfy some devata not necessarily they will be favored by Krishna. I'll stop here thank you very.

**Key Quote:** "When I stayed for some days as a guest in the heavenly planets all the heavenly demigods including King Indradeva took shelter of my arms which were marked with the Gandiva bow to kill the demon named Nivartakavacha O King, descendant of Aja Meedha at the present moment I am dead to you. I am bereft of the supreme personality of Godhead by whose influence I was so powerful."
**Summary:** Arjuna remembers his past glories and acknowledges that his power and success were due to Krishna's grace, expressing his current feeling of separation from the Lord.

In this session we will be discussing from three verses, 13, 14 and 15 of the 15th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 13th verse first: Tatraiva Mev Viharato Bhujadanda Yugvam Gandiva Lakshanam Arati Vadhaya Devaha Sendra Shrita Yad Anubhavitam Aaja Meedha Tenah Madhya Mushita Purushena Bhumah. Meaning of this verse is: When I stayed for some days as a guest in the heavenly planets, all the heavenly demigods including King Indradeva took shelter of my arms which were marked with the Gandiva bow to kill the demon named Nivartakavacha. O King, descendant of Aja Meedha, at the present moment I am dead to you. I am bereft of the supreme personality of Godhead by whose influence I was so powerful. So Arjuna is recollecting when he went to the heavenly planets, he stayed there some time under the grace of Krishna, even Indra was taking shelter of the protection of Arjuna because Arjuna was expert in using his Gandiva bow to kill the misguided demon, to kill the miscreants. So there was one demon by name Nivartakavacha, he was troubling the demigods, but he was killed by Arjuna using his Gandiva bow. So that is being recollected by Arjuna. O King, descendant of Aja Meedha, at the present moment I am bereft of the supreme personality of Godhead.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's purport emphasizes that a devotee's power comes from Krishna's grace and is subject to His will, highlighting the importance of surrender.

Arjuna is feeling the separation from Krishna after Krishna departed for his own personal abode where he is eternally situated. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada gives this brief purport. He says, "The heavenly demigods are certainly more intelligent, powerful and beautiful and yet they had to take help from Arjuna because of his Gandiva bow which was empowered by the grace of Lord Sri Krishna." It is not simply another weapon or another bow or another set of arrows, no. It was the Gandiva bow which Arjuna was actually having and which is described as transcendental in the hands of the pure devotees or the Supreme Lord, whatever be the particular item it is all auspicious. The Lord is all powerful and by his grace his pure devotee can be as powerful as he may desire and there is no limit to it. And when the Lord withdraws his power from anyone he is powerless by the will of the Lord. So devotees powerful or powerless according to the will of the Lord is completely surrendered. He does not demand.

**Summary:** Arjuna recalls the formidable strength of the Kauravas during the battle of Kurukshetra and how he was able to overcome them through Krishna's grace, even during the Pandavas' exile.

The fourteenth verse. The meaning of this verse is: The military strength of the Kauravas was like an ocean in which there dwelled many invincible existences and thus it was insurmountable. But because of his friendship I, seated on the chariot, was able to cross over it and only by his grace was I able to regain the cows and also collect by force many helmets of the kings which were bedecked with jewels that were sources of all brilliance. Again Arjuna is recollecting that the battle of Kurukshetra, the Kaurava's strength was formidable, almost unconquerable, but by the grace of Krishna Arjuna was able to conquer it. Arjuna was able to defeat the Kauravas and defeat them. And even in the fight against the Kauravas when they attacked the Pandavas while the Pandavas were in exile, by the grace of Krishna only Arjuna was able to defeat the Kauravas who had defeated them, who had stolen the cows

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's purport highlights Arjuna's unique position in the chariot driven by Krishna and how he single-handedly managed the war, emphasizing Krishna's protection even during the Pandavas' incognito exile and the battle to rescue the cows.

of the king of Virat Pradesh. So all this is possible only by the grace of Krishna. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport: "On the Kaurava's side there were many stalwart commanders like Bhishma, Drona, Kripa and Kripa. And their military strength was as insurmountable as the great ocean. And yet it is due to Lord Krishna's grace that Arjuna was alone sitting on the chariot. Even then he could manage to vanquish the Kauravas one after another without difficulty." Even though their strength was more, but Krishna's grace and Arjuna was able to defeat the Kauravas even though their strength was insurmountable. Now another interesting point Prabhupada says: "There were many changes of commanders on the other side," that means on the Kaurava's side. "But on the Pandava's side Arjuna alone in the chariot driven by Lord Krishna could manage the whole responsibility of the great war." See the mercy of the Lord Krishna on the Pandavas, especially on Arjuna. Similarly when the Pandavas were living at the palace of Virata incognito, that was the challenge offered by the Kauravas, that the Pandavas lost the gambling match and they had to go to the forest, 12 years just live in the forest, and 13th year live in exile. So even while the Pandavas were living in incognito condition in the exile, the Kauravas picked a quarrel and decided to take away his large number of cows of the place where the Pandavas had sought shelter. Arjuna actually fought with those Kauravas even remaining incognito, and he was able to rescue the cows. So Arjuna remembered all this was possible because

**Summary:** The lecture moves to the 15th verse, explaining how Krishna controls the duration of life and influences the battlefield, diminishing the Kauravas' strength and enthusiasm.

of the grace of Krishna. The 15th verse: yobhishmakarana gurushalya chamushvadabhra rajanyavarya rathamandalamanditasu agrecharomamavibhorathayuthapanam ayurmanamsi chadrusha saha oja archat. The meaning of this verse is: It was he only who withdrew the duration of life from everyone, and who in the battlefield withdrew the speculative power and strength of enthusiasm from the great military phalanx made by the Kauravas headed by Bhishma, Karna, Drona, Shalya etc. Their arrangement was expert and more than adequate, but he Lord Shri Krishna was going forward with all this. Sorry. But he Lord Krishna while going forward did all this. He shortened the duration of the life. He enabled Arjuna to cross over the mighty ocean of strength of the Kauravas. So in the purport Shri Ram Prabhupada says: "The absolute personality of Godhead Lord Shri Krishna expands himself by his plenary Paramatma portion in everyone's heart, and thus he directs everyone in the matter of recollection, forgetfulness, knowledge, the absence of intelligence and all psychological activities."

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is seated in everyone's heart regardless of whether they are devotee or not devotee. And Krishna only gives someone intelligence."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's purport explains that Krishna resides in everyone's heart, granting intelligence and knowledge, and that the battle of Kurukshetra was orchestrated by Krishna to establish Yudhishthira as emperor.

This is stated in the 15th chapter, 15th verse of the Bhagavad Gita: sarvasya caaham hrithi sannivitam matta smritir jnanam apohanam ca. Krishna is seated in everyone's heart regardless of whether they are devotee or not devotee, and Krishna only gives someone intelligence, Krishna only gives someone knowledge like that. So it is further described by Shri Ram Prabhupada: "As the Supreme Lord He can increase or decrease the duration of life of a living being." It is in Krishna's hands our duration of life. Thus the Lord conducted the battle of Kurukshetra according to his own plan. He wanted that battle to establish Yudhishthira as the emperor of this planet. So the battle of Kurukshetra was arranged by Krishna. Even though it looked like the Pandavas and Kauravas could not make a settlement of sharing the kingdom, but when a Kshatriya is offered a challenge, he cannot refuse. It is considered that he is not a worthy Kshatriya. So this battle of Kurukshetra was planned by Krishna in order to establish Yudhishthira as the emperor of the planet.

This was Krishna's plan. And Krishna also facilitated the transcendental business to kill all who were on the opposite side by his omnipotent will. Krishna simply has to will. Everything happens whatever he wills. So that was also possible only by the grace of Krishna. The other party, that is the Kauravas party, was equipped with all military strength supported by big generals like Bhishma, Drona, Shalya, and it would have been physically impossible for Arjuna to win the battle had the Lord not helped him by every kind of tactic. So Krishna out of his mercy, causeless mercy, on his affectionate devotee, he enabled Arjuna to actually face the army, defeat the army of the Kauravas, and actually win the battle. And even before the battle, the Pandavas and Arjuna were protected by Krishna. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "protection by the lord means complete protection 100 protection"
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Arjuna was protected by Krishna's grace, comparing it to Prahlad Maharaj's protection by Lord Nrsimadeva from the demons.

In this session, we will be discussing the first part of the sixteenth verse of the fifteenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The sixteenth verse is as follows: Yad doshu ma pranihitam guru bhishma karna, naptra trigarta shalya saindhava bahli kaadyai, astrani amogha mahimani nirupitani, nopas prushur nriharidasam ivasurani. The meaning of this verse is: Great generals like Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Bhurishrava, Susharma, Shalya, Jayadratha, and Balika all directed their invincible weapons against me. But by his, that is Lord Krishna's, grace, they could not even touch a hair on my head. Similarly, Prahlad Maharaj, the supreme devotee of Lord Nrsimadeva, was unaffected by the weapons the demons used against him. So Arjuna is telling, because of Lord Krishna's grace, Arjuna was completely protected, that even the powerful Kaurava generals, they could not touch even one hair of Arjuna. In a fierce battle like that, how is it that Arjuna escaped completely unhurt, only by the grace of Krishna? And a comparison is made, just like Prahlad Maharaj was a pure devotee of Lord Nrsimadeva, and he was unaffected by so much trouble given by the demons, in so many ways, they tried to kill him, but they could not. Similarly, in the battle of Kurukshetra, the enemy party tried to kill the Pandavas, but they could not do anything to the Pandavas. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "The history of Prahlad Maharaj, the great devotee of Nrsimadeva, is narrated in the 7th chapter, Pralad Maharaj, a small child of only five years, became the object of envy for his great father, Hiranyakashyapu, only because of his becoming a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord. The demon father employed all his weapons to kill the devotee's son, Prahlad, but by the grace of the Lord, Prahlad was saved from all the troubles, and he was not killed. He was saved from all sorts of dangerous actions by his father. Hiranyakashyapu attempted in so many ways, let me kill this boy, but Hiranyakashyapu was unsuccessful, because all the while, Prahlad was perfectly protected by Lord Nrsimadeva directly." And Srila Prabhupada lists here how Prahlad was put into dangerous situations: he was thrown in a fire, in boiling oil, he was thrown from the top of a hill, he was attempted to be crushed under the legs of an elephant, he was administered poison, and at last the father himself took up a chopper to kill his son, and thus Nrsimadeva appeared and killed the heinous father in the presence of the son. So protection by the Lord means complete protection, 100% protection. So Srila Prabhupada concludes this portion by telling, "Thus no one can kill the devotee of the Lord. Similarly, Arjuna was also saved by the Lord, although all dangerous weapons were employed by his great opponents like Bhishma, Karna, etc." So it's a fact that Arjuna was really saved only because of...

In the beginning, his name was Vasusena, but when he grew up, he presented his natural bangles and earrings to Indradeva, and thenceforward he became known as Vaikartana.

### Karna's role in Duryodhana's court, Gambling match, Draupadi's humiliation, Karna's anger towards Draupadi

**Key Quote:** "Karna was very enthusiastic to declare the news, and it is he who ordered Dushasana to take away the garments of both the Pandavas and Draupadi."
**Summary:** The speaker details Karna's involvement in Duryodhana's court, his role in the gambling match, and his anger towards Draupadi, leading to her humiliation.

When Duryodhana was in power, he enthroned Karna in the state of Anga. Being baffled in his attempt to win Draupadi, Karna advised Duryodhana to attack King Drupada, and after defeating him, both Arjuna and Draupadi could be arrested. But Dronacharya rebuked them for this conspiracy, and they refrained from the action. Karna was defeated many times, not only by Arjuna, but also by Bhimasena. He was a king of the kingdom of Bengal, Orissa, and Madras combined. Later on, Karna took an active part in the Rajasuya sacrifice of Maharaja Yudhishthira, and when there was gambling between the rival brothers designed by Shakuni, Karna took part in the game, and he was very pleased when Draupadi was offered as a bet in the gambling. That gambling match was ill-fated for the Pandavas. The Pandavas were losing, and Yudhishthira was placing as a bet even Draupadi, and themselves also as a bet. When Draupadi was in the game, Karna was very enthusiastic to declare the news, and it is he who ordered Dushasana to take away the garments of both the Pandavas and Draupadi, because Karna was very much angry against Draupadi, because Draupadi, Swayamvara, Karna was not able to participate, because he was declared as the son of a carpenter, a shudra. So the Pandavas, when they could not protect Draupadi in that gambling match, at that time, Karna asked Draupadi to select another husband, because she was lost by the Pandavas.

**Key Quote:** "I can defeat the Pandavas in five days, if Bhishma would not interfere with my plan of action."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Karna's continued enmity towards the Pandavas, his arrogant claims, and his eventual death at the hands of Arjuna due to Krishna's grace.

Now Karna maintained enmity against the Pandavas, though they had no reason actually. Specifically, he had no reason, but he maintained his enmity against the Pandavas. And he tried to curb them in so many ways. Now, during the battle of Kurukshetra, he could understand that because Krishna was the chariot driver of Arjuna, he understood that the Pandavas will win the battle. And Karna had some difference of opinion on Bhishma, and sometimes he was very, very proud of his prowess, and he said in his pride, "I can defeat the Pandavas in five days, if Bhishma would not interfere with my plan of action." This is the arrogant statement of Karna. Now when Bhishma died, Karna was very much mortified. Karna killed the largest number of Pandava soldiers. When there was a severe fight with Arjuna, then Karna was able to knock off Arjuna's helmet. And that's a big achievement because Arjuna was a very, very powerful fighter. Now when Karna was fighting Arjuna, his chariot wheel got stuck in the battlefield mud. And he got down from his chariot to set the wheel right, but Arjuna took the opportunity and killed Karna when Karna was fixing the wheel of the chariot.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Jayadratha's attempts to approach Draupadi illicitly, his failed kidnapping attempt, and the intervention of Dhamya Rishi, emphasizing the importance of the Kshatriya code of conduct.

Jayadratha was always trying to get in touch with Draupadi after he was not able to win Draupadi's hand in Draupadi's Swayamvara. So how much he tried is described here. When he was going to marry in the Shalya Desha on the way to Kamyavana, he happened to see Draupadi again. And it was too late. He was too much attracted to her. The Pandavas and Draupadi were then in exile and after losing their empire in gambling and Jayadratha thought that he would send news to Draupadi in an illicit manner through one Koti Shasya, one of his associates. See lust when it attacks. A person becomes a victim and unable to remain focused on his actual present situation and still carries that desire I want to enjoy Draupadi in an illicit way. So when Jayadratha tried to... Approach Draupadi in an illicit manner, Draupadi at once refused vehemently the proposal of Jayadratha. But because Jayadratha was so much attracted by Draupadi's beauty, he tried again and again and again and again to approach Draupadi. So finally he made a plan. To forcibly take away Draupadi on his chariot. And while he attempted that, at first Draupadi gave him a good dashing and he fell down like a cut root tree.

And Krishna reminded Arjuna that Jayadratha had a special benediction of Lord Shiva that whoever would cause Jayadratha's head to fall on the ground, such a person's head would actually get chopped off. So Arjuna through the head of Jayadratha died. Jayadratha fell directly onto the lap of his father, who was engaged in penance at the Shamantha Panchaka pilgrimage site.

**Summary:** Arjuna is remembering past events and his intimate relationship with Krishna, highlighting Krishna's mercy and kindness towards his devotees.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Jai Vanarottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 17th verse of the 15th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Sautye Vratakumatinatmada Ishwarome Yadpada Padmam Abhavaya Bhajantibhavya Maam Shrantavaham Arayo Rathino Bhuvishtham Napraharan Yad Anubhava Nirastam Yadpada Padmam Abhavaya Bhajantibhavya. The meaning of this verse is: It was by his mercy only that my enemies neglected to kill me when I descended from my chariot to get water for my thirsty horses. And it was due to my lack of esteem for my lord that I dared engage him as my chariot driver, for he is worshipped and offered services by the best men to attain salvation. So Arjuna is recollecting some past incidents in his intimate relationship with the Supreme Lord Krishna. And it is clearly established that Krishna is very, very merciful to his devotees, especially his pure devotees. He is very, very kind, very merciful, and he is ready to do anything for his devotees. So this is a good point that is being brought out by Arjuna that Krishna, who is worshipped and offered services by the best of men to attain salvation, is a very, very merciful person. That Supreme Lord, Arjuna is thinking, I dared engage him as my chariot driver.

**Key Quote:** "The Supreme Lord, the personality of God is Sri Krishna, is the object of worship, both by impersonalists..."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains the difference between impersonalists and devotees in their worship of Krishna, highlighting that even impersonalists indirectly worship Krishna's effulgence.

So Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport, a little elaborately, this point. The Supreme Lord, the personality of God is Sri Krishna, is the object of worship, both by impersonalists and by the devotees of the Lord. The impersonalists worship his glowing effulgence emanating from his transcendental body of eternal form, bliss, and knowledge. So there are two categories of transcendentalists who are followers of the Vedanta philosophy presented by Vyasa Deva. The first category are the impersonalists, so they worship the impersonal Brahman. Now what is this impersonal Brahman? This impersonal Brahman is a glowing effulgence coming out of the transcendental form of Krishna. So the impersonalists are also worshiping Krishna, but they are unable to approach the personality of Krishna because of their impersonal conception. They cannot go beyond the Brahma Jyothi or the Brahman effulgence. And Krishna says this in the Eshopanishad, it is mentioned that the Supreme Lord, his transcendental form, is covered by his dazzling effulgence emanating from his transient form, the Brahma Jyothi or the impersonal Brahman. And here Prabhupada continues to explain that devotees, the second category of transcendentalists who are followers of the Vedanta philosophy presented by Vyasa Deva, they are the devotees who involve themselves in and on the...

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is not only for the devotees or only for the transcendentalists who follow the Vedanta which is the correct philosophy but he is for everyone because everyone is his part and parcel"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna is the source of everything, including the Brahman effulgence, and that He is accessible to everyone as all beings are His parts and parcels.

they are the devotees who are the together followers of St Karmakaria know Fifuge USA by the Vere verde by Massalan Kah τιςa veni s flats that precise understanding is there pertamata 지금 the seda the sada usthiyab talk us e voln and vesala brother Wis merely at two details this concept can be explained with the hilaryfficient intent we did not understand sense or logic so we want to understand what is the difference between the 21st classويkat geography of Virtual Republic of India. The bhakti yogis or the pure devotees, they worship him as the supreme personality of Godhead. They directly worship the source, the source of everything including the Brahman effulgence. Krishna is the source of the Brahman effulgence. Brahmanohi pratishtaham, in the Bhagavad Gita Krishna explains, I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman, Krishna says. And the Brahmasamhita says yasyaprabha prabhavato jagadhanda koti govindam adipurusham tamaham bhajami, that primeval Lord Govinda Krishna, yasyaprabha, his bodily effulgence is the Brahma Jyoti. So further Srila Prabhupada says, those who are below even the impersonalists consider him to be one of the great historical personalities. Apart from the Vedantas who follow the Vedanta philosophy presented by Vyasa Deva, there are others also, there are other philosophers, other transcendentalists, they consider him to be one of the great historical personalities. The Lord, however, descends to attract all by his specific transcendental pastimes. Krishna is not only for the devotees or only for the transcendentalists who follow the Vedanta which is the correct philosophy, but he is for everyone because everyone is his part and parcel, his own. Mama eva misho jiva loke jiva bhoota sanatana ha sarva bhutani asheshani drakshasi atmani atomai. So in several places in the Bhagavad Gita Krishna explains very carefully, sarva yonisha kaunteya murtriya sambhavanti yaha tasam brahma mahad yonir aham bija pradapita. I am the seed giving father for all the living entities who take birth in this material world. At the beginning of creation, all living beings belong to me, they are mine.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna never forsakes anybody Krishna never disowns anybody Krishna is never away from anyone but we are forgetful"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna is always present and active within every living being, even though we may forget or neglect Him, and that He incarnates to attract everyone through His transcendental pastimes.

they are within me, they are in me, they are my own part and parcel eternally, they are my parts, they belong to me. So Krishna does not disown anybody. Though we may forget Krishna, we may try to be independent of Krishna, we may be neglectful of Krishna, though he is prominent in our life even in this material world. Bhagavad Gita elaborately explains this, how Krishna is prominent in our ordinary life even in this material world as Paramatma has entered our heart and then he is conducting all the affairs of this body. We are totally helpless in this body because we are spirit and this body is made up of the material energy. So for us material energy is foreign, a foreign substance. So we do not know what is this body, we do not know how to use this body, we cannot live in this body and utilize this body, but Krishna facilitates us, Paramatma. So he is active every moment, he is active within every living being, only then the living being can actually live in the body and utilize the body for whatever purposes the living entity wants to. So Krishna never forsakes anybody, Krishna never disowns anybody, Krishna is never away from anyone, but we are forgetful. We means the living entities in the material world who have taken birth by force of karma are the ones who are forgetful of Krishna, are the ones who are neglecting Krishna, are the ones who are wanting to be independent of Krishna. So here Srila Prabhupada says the Supreme Lord Krishna descends, comes down to this material world, that's what we say, he incarnates to attract all by his specific transcendental pastimes and thus he plays the part of the most perfect master, friend, son, and lover. These are the personal relationships Krishna has with his personal devotees: perfect master. He plays the part of the master when the devotee wants to serve him as a servant. When the devotee wants to serve him as his friend, then he acts as a perfect friend. When the devotee wants to act as his father or mother, he plays the part of the perfect son. And when the devotee wants him as her beloved, then he plays the part of the perfect lover.

### Krishna's intimate relationships, Yoga Maya, Devotee's perspective

**Key Quote:** "Intelligent men are attracted by the transcendental acting of the lord with a pure, unalloyed devotee like Arjuna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Krishna engages in intimate relationships with His devotees, facilitated by Yoga Maya, and that devotees are never at fault for engaging with Krishna in this way.

His transcendental relationship, Arjuna was in friendship and a lot, therefore played the part perfectly as he did with his parents, lovers, and wives. While playing in such a perfect transcendental relation, that devotee forgets by the internal potency of the Lord that his friend or son is a supreme personality of God. Arjuna is repenting that how dare I engaged him as my chariot driver. He is a supreme lord. But the fact is Arjuna is made to forget that Krishna is the supreme lord by Krishna's internal potency, yoga maya, so that it can facilitate the intimate pastimes in Krishna's relationship with his devotees. Now Srila Prabhupada says Krishna wants to play the perfect part as the son or the friend or the lover. And sometimes even though the yoga maya practice is not perfect, the yoga maya covers the fact that Krishna is a supreme lord in his dealings with his devotees. Sometimes the devotee is bewildered by the acts of the lord. So after the departure of the lord, Arjuna was conscious of his great friend. But there is no mistake on the part of Arjuna. We should not think Arjuna made a big mistake by engaging Krishna as his chariot driver. Nor any. Arjuna was not wrongly thinking that Krishna is my friend. No. Intelligent men are attracted by the transcendental acting of the lord with a pure, unalloyed devotee like Arjuna. So it requires intelligence to understand Krishna's dealings with his pure devotees. Others who are conversant with the pure devotional, only they can appreciate Krishna's kindness and magnanimity and love for his devotees. Only on a pure devotional platform, we can understand these dealings of Krishna. Otherwise, we may mistake either that Krishna is an ordinary person or we may wrongly think that devotees are too puffed up and proud to engage Krishna as their friend or as their son or as their lover. No. There is no mistake on the part of the devotees. Neither Krishna is an ordinary person. He retains, he is eternally the transcendental supreme personality of Godhead. But he, out of his own sweet will, he wants his devotees to serve him in an intimate way, as his son or, sorry, as his mother or father or lover or friend. Krishna wants that. And therefore, the devotees are never at fault. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

### Krishna's mercy, Devotee-Deity relationship, Intimacy with Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This brings out very clearly how Krishna is very, very kind to his pure devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses verses 18 and 19 of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on Arjuna's remembrance of Krishna's pastimes and highlighting Krishna's immense mercy and intimate relationship with his devotees.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Jai Vanarottamam Deviim Saraswatim Vyasam Tatho Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing from three verses, verse numbers 18, 19, and 20 of the 15th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. So, one verse at a time. The 18th verse to begin with. Narmani Udara Ruchira Smita Shobhitani He Partha He Arjuna Sakhe Kuru Nanda Neti Sanjal Pitani Naradeva Hrudis Prushani Smartur Luthanti Hrudayam Mama Madhavasya. Beautiful verse. Now the translation of this 18th verse. This is spoken by Arjuna to Yudhishthira. He is recollecting the nice pastimes of Krishna in Arjuna's relationship with Krishna as his friend. So, Arjuna is telling, "O King! His jokings and frank talks were pleasing and beautifully decorated with smiles. He addresses unto me. His addresses unto me as O son of Pritha, O friend, O son of the Kuru dynasty, and all such heartiness are now remembered by me, and thus I am overwhelmed." The 19th verse. Shayasana Atana Vikathana Bhojana Adishu Aikyad Vyasya Rutavan Iti Vipralabdhaha Sakhyu Sakheva Pitthana Itruvatthana Yasyasarvam Sehe Mahan Mahitaya Kumater Aghamme. Yet another verse spoken by Arjuna remembering Krishna's intimate dealings with Arjuna. So, the translation of this 19th verse. Generally, both of us used to live together and sleep, sit, and loiter together. And at the time of advertising oneself for acts of chivalry, sometimes, if there were any irregularity, I used to reproach him by saying, "My friend, you are very truthful." Even in those hours when his value was minimized, he, being the supreme soul, used to tolerate all those utterings of mine, excusing me exactly as a true friend excuses his true friend, or a father excuses his son. This brings out very clearly how Krishna is very, very kind to his pure devotees. Krishna is worshipped as He Krishna Karunasindho. Karunasindho means he is the ocean of mercy. Krishna is very, very merciful, even to ordinary beings like us. How can we understand this? Because even though we have almost totally forgotten him, he never forgets us, and personally, he is present in each of our hearts as the Paramatma. He is sitting there, guiding us, providing us, fulfilling our desires, acting as our topmost well-wisher, and instructing us how we can go back to him for eternal life full of bliss and knowledge, in our eternal loving relationship with him.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna relishes more the dealings of his intimate devotees when they regard him as their equal or their subordinate and even sometimes reproach him in their dealings."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Krishna's unparalleled mercy, even towards those who have forgotten Him, and explains that Krishna values the intimate dealings and even reproaches from His pure devotees more than formal Vedic hymns.

He is making so many arrangements in this material world. So certainly Krishna is rightly addressed in this prayer as He Krishna Karunasindho, Dinabandho Jagatpate. He is the Supreme Lord, the Master, the Supreme Master, but still he is Dinabandho. He is the friend of the poor, and the weak, and the fallen, and the downtrodden. He is the friend. He is the true friend because he is an ocean of mercy. He is the ocean of compassion, ocean of mercy for all such souls in this material world. But when it comes to Krishna's dealings with his pure devotees, he is even more merciful to them, even more merciful. As it is, he is very, very merciful to everyone, but he is even more merciful to his pure devotees. Now in the purport to this 19th verse, Srila Prabhupada says, a brief purport. Since the Supreme Lord, Sri Krishna, is all perfect, his transcendental pastimes with his pure devotees never lack anything in any respect either as a friend, son, or lover. The Lord relishes the reproaches of friends, parents, of fiancés, more than the Vedic hymns offered to him by great learned scholars and religionists in an official fashion. Here is a very important point. Krishna relishes more the dealings of his intimate devotees when they regard him as their equal or their subordinate and even sometimes reproach him in their dealings. Krishna likes that. Krishna relishes that more. Those are the words used by Prabhupada here. He relishes the reproaches of friends, parents, or fiancés more than the Vedic hymns. The Vedic hymns are, of course, always glorifying Krishna as the Supreme in all respects, as the Supreme Controller, Supreme Master, Supreme Proprietor, Supremely opulent, Supremely knowledgeable, in every way he is the Supreme in every respect.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts formal glorification of Krishna with the intimate loving relationships He shares with His devotees, highlighting that Krishna cherishes the latter more and introduces the next verse.

But, when somebody glorifies Krishna by chanting those Vedic hymns that just glorify his greatness, Krishna doesn't relish that as much as he relishes the dealings with his pure devotees in which they regard him as their intimate friend or intimate son or intimate lover.

### Krishna's plan, Devotee's surrender, Divine arrangement

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "In order to keep the words of the great Muni, the Lord himself kidnapped his wives from the protection of Arjuna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the apparent contradiction in verse 20, where Arjuna is defeated and Krishna's wives are kidnapped, by narrating a story from the Vishnu Purana and Brahma Purana about a curse and Krishna's arrangement to fulfill it.

The meaning of this verse is, "O Emperor, now I am separated from my friend and dear most well-wisher, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore my heart appears to be void of everything. In his absence, I have been defeated by a number of infidel, and I have heard men while I was guarding the bodies of all the wives of Krishna." After Krishna's disappearance, this was an incident that took place that Arjuna was taking charge of protecting the wives of Krishna and something happened that is very bewildering when we hear that some infidel, coward men, they defeated Arjuna and actually kidnapped the wives of Krishna. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains this point. The important point in this verse is how it was possible that Arjuna could be defeated by a gang of ignoble, coward men and how such mundane, coward men could touch the bodies of the wives of Lord Krishna who are under the protection of Arjuna. So Srila Vishwanachakravarti Thakur, one of our previous Acharyas, has justified the contradiction by research in the Vishnu Purana and Brahma Purana. This is explained in two other Puranas. In these Puranas, it is said that once the fair denizens of heaven pleased Ashtavakra Muni by their service and were blessed by the Muni to have the Supreme Lord as their husband. Ashtavakra Muni was curved in eight joints of his body and thus he used to move in a peculiar curved manner. The daughters of the demigods could not check their laughter upon seeing the movements of the Muni, Ashtavakra Muni. And the Muni being angry at them cursed them that they would be kidnapped by rogues even if they would get the Lord as their husband. Later on, the girls again satisfied the Muni by their prayers and the Muni blessed them that they would regain their husband even after being robbed by the rogues. So, in order to keep the words of the great Muni, the Lord himself kidnapped his wives from the protection of Arjuna. Otherwise, they would have at once vanished from the scene as soon as they were touched by the rogues. Besides that, some of the gopis who prayed to become wives of the Lord returned to their respective positions after their desire was fulfilled. After the departure of Lord Krishna, he wanted all his entourage back to Godhead and they were called back under different conditions only.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna wants back all his entourage, but he is there because he wants back all of his entourage."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating Krishna's desire to bring all His devotees back to Godhead and explains that the events described are part of His divine plan to call them back under different circumstances.

So, here the explanation is given that some incident that took place in the past for some of the devotees that they were first blessed that they would get the Lord as their husband, Lord Krishna as their husband. And then, they displeased the Munis somehow and they were cursed that they would be kidnapped by some rogues. And later on again, they prayed to Ashtavakra Muni to pardon their mistake and being pleased with their prayers, he again blessed them that even after being kidnapped, they would be able to get back the Supreme Lord as their husband. So, Krishna, in order to keep the words of this Ashtavakra Muni intact, he himself disguised as some ignoble covered men and kidnapped his own wives even though they were under the protection of Arjuna. And after being kidnapped by Krishna himself, disguised as ignoble covered men, Krishna later on revealed to them that I am your husband. So, it is described here that after the departure of Lord Krishna, he wants back all his entourage. Krishna wants back all his entourage, but he is there because he wants back all of his entourage. So, he made up his mind for that purpose, for his own sake. And his plan is that people will not be returned to the same state as the ones who have lived all these years in his personal abode. And he calls them under different circumstances as part of this past times. In the ignoble covered men defeating Arjuna and kidnapping the wives of Krishna.

### Krishna's power, devotee empowerment, detachment

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "But in the absence of Lord Krishna, all of them at a moment's notice have become null and void."
**Summary:** Arjuna's realization that his powers were dependent on Krishna's presence, illustrated with analogies of clarified butter on ashes, magic wand money, and seeds on barren land.

In this session we will be discussing four verses, verse numbers twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three and twenty-four of the fifteenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The twenty-first verse is as follows. The meaning of this verse is: "I have the very same Gandiva bow, the same arrows, the same chariot drawn by the same horses. I have the same horses and I am the same Arjuna to whom all the kings offer their due respects. But in the absence of Lord Krishna, all of them at a moment's notice have become null and void. It is exactly like offering clarified butter on ashes, accumulating money with a magic wand or sowing seeds on barren land." So these words are very significant words, which explain to us that as long as it is required, for Krishna's pastimes, He empowers His devotees with extraordinary power. But these powers given by Krishna are not required for the devotees to go back home to Godhead. They were only meant for Krishna to enact his pastimes. So after Krishna's pastimes have been wound up, the devotees do experience that they do not have the same powers they had when Krishna was present. Like Arjuna, he is having the same Gandiva bow, the same chariot drawn by the same horses, he's the same Arjuna, but now he is bereft of all those powers that he had. With the Gandiva bow in his hand, he could defeat many, many, many powerful Kshatriyas. Now when he tried to protect the wives of Krishna, some gnome-like, cavaad men easily defeated him and kidnapped him. So his Gandiva bow was ineffective. So Arjuna is recollecting that in the absence of Lord Krishna, all of them have become null and void. Now Arjuna is giving three examples of how they have become null and void. It is like offering clarified butter on ashes. When you pour clarified butter on it, it's the beginning of the purification process. If you put butter into a blazing fire and there is sufficient fuel, then the fire will blaze even more strongly. But you pour any amount of ghee into ashes, there will be no fire. Or another example given here is accumulating money with a magic wand. Sometimes magicians they show, display some magic. They have got something called a magic wand, like a stick. They just move the stick and suddenly in their hand there will be so much money. But that money is not real money, it is an optical illusion, it is a magical effect for entertaining some audience. There is no real money there. You cannot get money by just waving one stick in a magic show. There is no real money there. Similarly, sowing seeds on a barren land, it is useless. Those seeds won't fructify, they won't grow, they won't germinate. The land has to be fertile. Then only sowing good seeds will have some effect. Then only sowing good seeds will have some benefit. Similarly, in the absence of Lord Krishna, all those empowerments are no longer valid because Krishna has withdrawn them.

### dependence on Krishna, illusory independence, material civilization

**Key Quote:** "All energies and powers are derived from the Supreme Source, Lord Krishna. And they act as long as He desires. And all of them cease to function as soon as He withdraws."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's explanation that all power comes from Krishna, using the analogy of an electrical powerhouse, and that material advancement without Krishna's blessing is futile.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "As we have discussed more than once, one should not be puffed up by borrowed plumes. All energies and powers are derived from the Supreme Source, Lord Krishna. And they act as long as He desires. And all of them cease to function as soon as He withdraws." Prabhupada gives an example to help us understand. "All electrical energies are received from the powerhouse. And as soon as the powerhouse stops supplying energy, the bulbs are of no use. There are so many arrangements for lighting up a big palace or a big mansion. But as long as there is power supply from the electrical source, the powerhouse, these bulbs will glow very nicely. But as soon as the powerhouse stops supplying energy, the bulbs are of no use. In a moment's time, such energies can be generated or withdrawn by the Supreme Will of the Lord. Material civilization without the blessings of the Lord is child's play only. As long as the parents allow the child to play, it is all right. As soon as the parents withdraw, the child has to stop." Prabhupada is giving an example to help us understand. Human civilization and all activities thereof must be dovetailed with the supreme blessing of the Lord. And without this blessing, all advancement of human civilization is like decoration on a dead body. It is said here that a dead civilization and its activities are something like clarified butter on ashes, the accumulation of money by a magic wand, and the sowing of seeds on a barren land. The blessings of the Lord's blessings, all our attempts at independent existence in this material world are futile.

### divine will, fate, intoxication

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Factually this is all due to the supreme will of the Lord, the personality of Godhead. Sometimes people kill one another, and at other times, they protect one another."
**Summary:** Arjuna recounts the demise of the Yadus due to a brahmana's curse and their intoxication, emphasizing that everything happens according to the supreme will of the Lord.

Verses 22 and 23, they are given together. I will read both of them and then we will hear the translation. Rajamstvayanuprishtanam surdamna suratpure viprashapavimudhanam nignatam mushtibhir mithah varunim madhirampitva madonmathita cetasam ajanatam ivaunyonyam chatupanchavasyeshitah The meaning of these two verses is, "O King, since you have asked me about our friends and relatives in the city of Dwarka, I inform you that all of them were cursed by the brahmanas, and as a result they all became intoxicated with wine made of putrefied rice, and fought among themselves with sticks, not even recognizing one another. Now all but four or five of them are dead and gone." Yudhishthira had sent Arjuna to inquire about the well-being of the Yadus. So now Arjuna is bringing the news, after Krishna's disappearance, all of them, except for four or five, are dead and gone. And how did they die? That is also very bewildering. They fought with each other after becoming intoxicated and killed each other. Twenty-fourth verse, prayenaitad bhagavata ishwarasya vicheshtitam mitho nignanti bhutani bhavayanti chayan mithah The translation of this twenty-fourth verse, factually this is all due to the supreme will of the Lord, the personality of Godhead. Sometimes people kill one another, and at other times, they protect one another. So Arjuna is explaining that as a devotee he knows, supreme will of the supreme personality of Godhead always prevails. And by his will, sometimes people may kill each other. And at other times, by his will, people may protect each other.

### divine control, dharma, peace and prosperity

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "They do not know that behind the law of nature is the supreme direction of the supreme personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** Prabhupada's explanation that the law of nature is directed by Krishna, contrasting it with atheistic views, and emphasizing that peace and prosperity result from following Dharma.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "According to the anthropologists, there is nature's law of struggle for existence and survival of the fittest." One class of philosophers in this world, they are mostly atheists, and they say that this world is working according to the law of struggle for existence and survival of the fittest. But Srila Prabhupada says, they do not know that behind the law of nature is the supreme direction of the supreme personality of Godhead. That they do not know, they cannot see, they cannot understand. They do not know how nature is working. In the Bhagavad Gita, Srila Prabhupada says, "It is confirmed that the law of nature is executed under the direction of the Lord." What is the verse? Mayadhyakshena prakritihi suyatesa characharam Material nature is working perfectly according to the direction of Krishna. Whenever therefore there is peace in the world, it must be known that it is due to the goodwill of the Lord. And whenever there is upheaval in the world, it is also due to the supreme will of the Lord. Both peace as well as upheaval. Battles or wars. Both are according to the supreme will of the Supreme Lord. Not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Lord. Tenavina trinam apina chalati Even a blade of grass won't move without the sanction of the Lord. Completely he is in perfect control. Because he is Paramatman everywhere. Everyone's heart. And every single move by every living entity has to be sanctioned by the Lord. Otherwise, the living entity is unable to act or move. Whenever therefore, Srila Prabhupada says further, "There is disobedience of the established rules enacted by the Lord. There is war between men and nations." So there is a reason why Krishna sometimes wills that there be some fighting or battle between men or between nations. Why? Because there is disobedience to the established rules enacted by the Lord. Dharmam tu sakshat bhagavat pranitam Dharma means the code of conduct given by God personally for all of us. Especially for the human beings. So we have to follow those rules of Dharma given by Krishna. Then everything will be fine. There will be peace, there will be prosperity, there will be plenty of supply. There will be very cordial relations between people. Everything will be very, very nice. Just like when Yudhishthira Maharaj was ruling. When Ramachandra was ruling. When Pariksit Maharaj was ruling. There was peace, there was prosperity, there was plenty of all supplies. People were completely satisfied. They were happy in all respects.

**Key Quote:** "The surest way to the path of peace, therefore, is dovetailing everything to the established rule of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by encouraging listeners to embrace Krishna consciousness as the path to peace and prosperity, offering everything to Krishna.

So that is not a utopian idea. It's a fact. You can observe even now in places where there is predominantly Krishna consciousness, God consciousness. People live very nicely, very nicely in communities. You can visit some of these communities if you are not conversant with this fact. And see for yourself how people live very nicely in such communities. So therefore Prabhupada concludes by telling, "The surest way to the path of peace, therefore, is dovetailing everything to the established rule of the Lord." So the rule of the Lord is everything we should do in Krishna consciousness. Everything we should offer to Krishna. Then certainly there will be peace, prosperity and everything will be nice.

**Key Quote:** "This material world is a place for all those souls who belong to God, who belong to the spiritual world, but are forgetful of Krishna due to their desire to independently enjoy and their desire to lord over material nature."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that the material world is a place for souls who desire independent enjoyment and to lord over material nature, leading to the struggle for existence.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, what does this mean? Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "In the material world, the struggle for existence and survival of the fittest are laws because in the material world there is disparity between conditioned souls due to everyone's desire to lord it over the material resources." This is a very, very important point we have to understand. This material world is a place for all those souls who belong to God, who belong to the spiritual world, but are forgetful of Krishna due to their desire to independently enjoy and their desire to lord over material nature. Two very, very specific desires are the cause of our material existence.

**Key Quote:** "The desire to independently enjoy, independent of Krishna because in the spiritual world everyone is blissfully happy in association with Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the two desires that cause material existence: independent enjoyment and lording over material nature, highlighting the illusion of independence.

What are those two desires? The desire to independently enjoy, independent of Krishna, because in the spiritual world everyone is blissfully happy in association with Krishna. But if anybody wants independent enjoyment, it is not possible in the spiritual world. Then the Lord has created this material world, and in the material world, under illusion, one may think, "I am independent," though we can never be actually independent because we are very, very tiny spirit souls. We cannot be independent. But we may get the feeling that I am independent under illusion, and that's why the illusion energy is working to cover the real knowledge of who we are, the reality of Krishna being the maintainer, Krishna being the protector. The illusion energy is covering our vision of the reality, and under illusion, I am thinking I am independent. Each person is thinking like that. And also, not only that we desire independent enjoyment, we also desire to lord over material nature. And not only I desire, everyone desires like that.

So, therefore there is disparity. How can each one think, "I want to be the lord"? There can only be one lord. There cannot be many lords. So, therefore the reality is that under illusion somebody thinks, "I am the boss, I am the lord, I am the master, I am the enjoyer." Under illusion only. And that is created, that illusion is created because of which there appear to be laws which are like struggle for existence and survival of the fittest. So, Prabhupada further explains, "This very mentality of lording it over material nature is a root cause of conditioned life." What is the meaning of conditioned life? Conditioned life means we are subject to the conditions of material nature, which are conditions produced by interaction of the three gunas, the three modes of material nature. They are always interacting and producing different circumstances, conditions, situations. Satvam rajas tamaiti gunas prakriti sambhavaha. This is explained in the 14th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita.

**Key Quote:** "Material nature not only consists of eight elements it also consists of three gunas."
**Summary:** The speaker details the composition of material nature, including the three gunas, and how they create conditions that lead to conditioned life, emphasizing the need for surrender to Krishna.

Material nature not only consists of eight elements, it also consists of three gunas. This is a secret that is revealed in the Bhagavad Gita by Lord Krishna. Generally, people know that material matter or material energy or material nature means the five elements or the eight elements: five gross elements—earth, water, fire, air, sky; three subtle elements—mind, intelligence, ego. But they do not know material nature consists of three gunas: Satva guna, raja guna, tamo guna, and these three gunas are always interacting with each other, producing different conditions. And under those conditions, everyone is living, all those who are under the laws of nature. They are subject to the conditions imposed upon them by the three gunas interacting and producing so many changes. Continuously material nature is imposing different conditions. Adibhutam charo bhavaha. This is also explained in the 8th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. This material nature is constantly changing, in a state of flux, always, as long as material nature is active, as long as this created world is maintained, constantly in a state of flux. So, therefore we are all subject to these conditions, as long as we don't surrender to Krishna, as long as we don't take to devotional service, as long as we don't prepare ourselves to go back to Godhead. We are subject to these conditions. So that situation under which everyone is forced by material nature is called conditioned life.

**Key Quote:** "To give facility to such imitation lords the illusory energy of the lord has created a disparity between conditioned living beings."
**Summary:** The lecture explains that the illusory energy creates disparity and the struggle for existence to facilitate the desires of imitation lords.

To give facility to such imitation lords, the illusory energy of the Lord has created a disparity between conditioned living beings by creating the stronger and the weaker in every species of life. If you carefully observe every species, there are many, many living entities of that particular species. Among them, there are stronger and weaker. That is because the mentality of lording it over others always exists in conditioned souls. So, Srila Prabhupada further explains, "The mentality of lording it over material nature and creation has naturally created a disparity." To facilitate the living entities lording over, there are laws of karma working, and there is naturally a disparity. Some are stronger, some are weaker in each species, and therefore there is the law of struggle for existence.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the material world with the spiritual world, where there is no struggle, everything is provided by Yogamaya, and everyone is blissful.

Now, Srila Prabhupada contrasts this with the spiritual world. He says, "In the spiritual world, there is no such struggle for existence, conspicuous by its absence in the spiritual world." This law of struggle for existence, there is no struggle in the spiritual world at all. Nobody has to work. Nobody has to earn his livelihood. No. Everything is completely perfectly provided by Yogamaya, Krishna's arrangement. Everybody is blissful. Everybody is happy. There is no old age. There is no disease. There is no death. There is no scarcity. There is no creation or destruction. There are no modes of material nature. There is no influence of divine creating. There is no state. There is no material. So,

**Summary:** The lecture describes the spiritual world as a place where everyone desires to serve Krishna, and Krishna reciprocates by wanting to please and serve His devotees.

So, Srila Prabhupada is saying that, so in the spiritual world there is no struggle for existence because everyone there exists eternally. There is no disparity because everyone wants to render service to the Supreme Lord. In this material world, I want to be the boss and I want others to serve me. I don't want to serve anybody because I want to be the boss, I want to be the lord. And the opposite of this is the spiritual world. What is the spiritual world like? Everyone wants to serve Krishna because everyone is a devotee of Krishna, a pure devotee, and Krishna is simply sitting and receiving all service. I am the lord. No, Krishna wants to please his devotees. Krishna wants to serve his devotees in reciprocation.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is inviting, please come to that world of mine. If you follow bhakti yoga, you will come to meet in my abode, spiritual abode."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna invites everyone to return to the spiritual world through bhakti yoga, where He shares His enjoyment with all living beings.

What a wonderful atmosphere, isn't it? So this information we get from the Srimad Bhagavatam, from the confidential devotional literatures, we get this confidential knowledge. We all belong to that spiritual world. In that spiritual world, there is no disparity, there is no struggle for existence, there is no death, there is no disease, there is no old age, there are no modes of material nature, there is no destructive influence of time. Krishna is inviting, "Please come to that world of mine. If you follow bhakti yoga, you will come to meet in my abode, spiritual abode." The Lord being the creator of everything, including the living beings, factually is the proprietor and enjoyer of everything that be. If He has created, He is a proprietor, and He has created it in a particular way, it's for His enjoyment. But His enjoyment doesn't mean in His scheme of things, He is the only enjoyer. No, He wants to share that enjoyment with each one of us.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna shares unlimited love unlimited pleasure unlimited bliss unlimited everything with a tiny living entity who can only enjoy in a limited way."
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by describing the unlimited bliss and love shared by Krishna in devotional service, inviting everyone to escape the struggle of material existence and return to Him.

Even though we are very tiny and the Lord is unlimited, Lord, so obviously when He wants to enjoy, there is unlimited enjoyment available. Now Krishna shares that unlimited enjoyment or pleasure with His part and parcel living being, each and every living being. So in our devotional service interaction with Krishna, Krishna shares unlimited love, unlimited pleasure, unlimited bliss, unlimited everything with a tiny living entity who can only enjoy in a limited way. So Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says when we chant Hare Krishna, we get the experience of being immersed in an ocean of bliss, and what kind of ocean? He says, anandambudhi vardhanam, it's an ever-increasing ocean of bliss, because even in the material world we have experience of ocean, but it is always limited, even though there's a huge quantity of salt water in the ocean, but still it is limited. In the spiritual world, the ocean of bliss is ever increasing. There is plenty of bliss in the spiritual world. The ocean of bliss is ever increasing. There is plenty of bliss, but that is also ever increasing. It's not limited. That's the nature of a spiritual one. So Krishna is inviting us, "Come to that world. Don't remain here and be always engaged in struggle for existence. Get out of this place and come to me." That's Krishna's purpose every week. So that's all I have for now. We might have some questions, any questions like that? That's our time.

in all places at all times. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada very nicely explains the gist of the instructions given by Krishna in Bhagavad Gita. So Srila Prabhupada says, "Herein Arjuna refers to the instruction of the Bhagavad Gita which was imparted to him by the lord of the Bhagavad Gita on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. The lord left behind him the instructions of the Bhagavad Gita not for the benefit of Arjuna alone but also for all time and in all lands. The Bhagavad Gita being spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the essence of all Vedic wisdom." Entire Vedas have been condensed in just 700 verses in the Bhagavad Gita. It is nicely presented by the lord himself for all who have very little time to go through the vast Vedic literatures like the Upanishads, Puranas, and Vedanta Sutras. It is put within the study of the great historical epic Mahabharata which was especially prepared for the less intelligent class, namely the women, the laborers, and those who are worthless descendants of the Brahmana, Kshatriyas, and higher sections of the Vaishyas.

**Key Quote:** "Just to teach all concerned that the Bhagavad Gita can be consulted in all critical times, not only for solace for all kinds of mental agonies, but also for the way out of great entanglements which may embarrass one in some critical hour."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Arjuna's remembrance of the Bhagavad Gita serves as an example for all to consult it in times of difficulty for solace and guidance.

The problem which arose in the heart of Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra was solved by the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. Again, after the departure of the lord from the vision of earthly people, when Arjuna was face to face with being vanquished in his acquired power and prominence, he wanted again to remember the great teachings of the Bhagavad Gita just to teach all concerned that the Bhagavad Gita can be consulted in all critical times, not only for solace for all kinds of mental agonies but also for the way out of great entanglements which may embarrass one in some critical hour. Actually, Arjuna is a pure devotee. There is no need for him to specifically consult some specific literature. His personification of the ideal devotee, ideal person who follows all the instructions of Krishna, but he is teaching us through his example how whenever we have any difficulty we can rely on the teachings given by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna is present in the Bhagavad Gita as a sound representation, making it identical to the Lord himself and offering the same benefits as being in Krishna's personal presence.

Everyone can take the instructions of the Lord. So Srila Prabhupada says further, "The merciful Lord left behind him the great teachings of the Bhagavad Gita so that one can take the instructions of the Lord even when he is not visible to material eyesight." Krishna just didn't speak for his time when he was present; he has spoken this for posterity also. Material senses cannot have any estimation of the Supreme Lord, but by his inconceivable power, the Lord can incarnate himself to the sense perception of the conditioned souls in a suitable manner through the agency of matter, which is also another form of the Lord's manifested energy. Lord is completely spiritual, but he can be present in a material medium by his inconceivable power. Thus, the Bhagavad Gita or any authentic scriptural sound representation of the Lord is also the incarnation of the Lord. Krishna incarnated 5000 years back in his original form, transcendental form, but Krishna is present also in his sound representation in the form of Bhagavad Gita. Therefore, Srila Prabhupada says there is no difference between the sound representation of the Lord and the Lord himself. Krishna is identical with the Bhagavad Gita. One can derive the same benefit from the Bhagavad Gita as Arjuna did in the

**Key Quote:** "Activities of the living being are different varieties of aptitudes which can entrap or liberate the living being within and without material nature."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the five factors, explaining the qualitative oneness and difference between the Lord and the living being, the nature of material nature, and how karma can either bind or liberate.

Out of these, the supreme Lord and the living being are qualitatively one. The supreme Lord is completely spiritual, and we are also, each one of us, we are spiritual beings. The difference between the two, still there is a difference between the supreme Lord and each one of us. What is the difference? The difference between the two has been analyzed as the difference between the whole and the part and parcel. We are a very, very, very, very, very tiny part of the Lord, and parcel means we are inseparable. We cannot be separated from the Lord. We have an eternal connection, eternal relationship. Nature is inert matter. Material nature is inert matter displaying the interaction of the three different modes. Material nature is material energy. Energy means there is some force, and that force is the influence of the three gunas while they interact with each other. Eternal time and unlimited space are considered to be beyond the existence of the material nature. Eternal time, time is eternal, and unlimited space, space are considered to be beyond the existence of the material nature. Now what about the karma or activities? Activities of the living being are different varieties of aptitudes which can entrap or liberate the living being within and without material nature. We do some type of activities by which we become more and more entangled in this material nature. We can do some other types of activities in this material world which will liberate us from the entanglement. So one set of activities will get us out, and the usual normal activities which most people do simply entangles them more and more.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Bhagavad Gita is a preliminary study to the Srimad Bhagavatam, and that material activities can be spiritualized to stop material reactions.

All these subject matters are discussed concisely in the Bhagavad Gita, and later this subject matters are elaborated in the Bhagavatam for further enlightenment. Many times Srila Prabhupada says Bhagavad Gita is the preliminary study of Srimad Bhagavatam. So the topics of the Gita are described in the Bhagavatam in great detail. Now Srila Prabhupada summarizes the Bhagavad Gita that out of the five subjects, the Supreme Lord, the living entity, nature, and time and space are eternal, but the living entity, nature, and time are under the direction of the Supreme Lord who is absolute and completely independent of any other control. The Supreme Lord is supremely independent, completely independent, and we ourselves, each one of us, the living entity and the material nature and time, kala, all the three are under the control, complete control of the Supreme Lord. Material activity of the living being is beginningless, anadi karma phale padhi bhava navajale, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur describes. We cannot trace the beginning of our material activity in this material world, but it can be rectified by transferring into the spiritual quality. We can spiritualize

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of eating ordinary food versus prasadam to illustrate karma and akarma, emphasizing the importance of devotional service to overcome misidentification with the material body. The lecture concludes with thanks.

our activities, our ordinary activities, and then the material reactions will stop. This is exactly the subject matter, the fourth chapter, karma and akarma. Karma means that which binds us, akarma means that which liberates us. Just like you eat ordinary food, you become more and more bound up. You eat prasadam, you become liberated. The same activity of eating, but depending on whether you eat ordinary food or you eat prasadam, Krishna prasadam, there will be a difference in the effect of such eating, the action of eating. So this is what we call, we are devotee of Krishna, we are meant to serve Krishna eternally. So we wrongly identify with material nature or the material body, and the whole Vedic wisdom is given to help us come out of this misidentification and reinstate ourselves as servants of Krishna in devotional service, and the Bhagavad Gita is spoken towards this end. I will stop here.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord is like the sun. The sun's appearance means immediate dissipation of darkness or ignorance."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Arjuna's confusion on the battlefield and how Krishna's instructions dispelled his ignorance, comparing the Lord to the sun that dissipates darkness.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, "Since the Lord is absolute, deep meditation upon him is as good as yogic trance." The highest perfection of Ashtanga Yoga is Samadhi, total absorption in meditation on the Lord. And simply a devotee deeply thinks about the Supreme Lord, Krishna, he is immediately in Samadhi. See the difference between Bhakti and Ashtanga Yoga. Bhakti Yoga and Ashtanga Yoga. The Lord is non-different from his name, form, quality, pastimes, entourage, and specific actions. Arjuna began to think of the Lord's instructions on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. He just began to think, what is it that Krishna told me when I was confused and I was searching for an answer to what is my duty under the circumstances, when I am facing my own near and dear ones as the enemy on the opposite side. I have to kill them, my respectable Supreme Lord, my superiors, my dear relatives. How can I kill them? So this duty, he was confused about his duty. And he asked Krishna to instruct him. Shishya Steham Shadhi Maam Tvaam Prapannam. So now, Arjuna is beginning to think of those instructions after Krishna's disappearance, when he is feeling that separation from Krishna. Now he is thinking of those instructions. Now, Srila Prabhupada says, "Only those instructions which Krishna gave on the battlefield of Kurukshetra began to eliminate the tinges of material contamination in the mind of Arjuna." How does it work? Srila Prabhupada says, "The Lord is like the sun. The sun's appearance means immediate dissipation of darkness or ignorance. And the Lord's appearance within the mind of the devotee can at once drive away the miserable material defects."

**Key Quote:** "Simply we have to remember the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker provides practical advice on remembering the Lord's name, form, qualities, and pastimes to overcome ignorance and confusion, and explains how even the feeling of separation from Krishna can be a source of transcendental bliss.

This is a good instruction for us. Whenever we feel that there is some ignorance, or some darkness, or some confusion, or some lack of direction, simply we have to remember the Lord. Remember the Lord's name, remember the Lord's form, remember the Lord's qualities, remember the Lord's instructions in the Bhagavad Gita, remember the Lord's pastimes described in the Bhagavatam, and immediately the darkness will be dissipated. Lord Chaitanya has therefore recommended constant chanting of the name of the Lord for protection from all contamination of the material world. Hare Nama Hare Nama Hare Namaiva Kevalam. This is a recommendation of Lord Chaitanya. Kalao Nastyaiva Nastyaiva Nastyaiva Gatiranyatam. Kaliva, there is no other remedy, only one remedy: constant chanting of the holy name, form, qualities, pastimes, etc. of the Supreme Lord Krishna. The feeling of separation from the Lord is undoubtedly painful to the devotee, but because it is in connection with the Lord, it has a specific transcendental effect which pacifies the heart. The feeling of separation from Krishna is actually soothing for the heart, even though it is actually a kind of painful situation for a devotee, but even that has got a spiritual effect.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts material and spiritual separation, emphasizing that separation from the Lord is a unique source of transcendental bliss, and introduces the next verse about Arjuna's increasing devotion and the removal of trash from his thoughts.

Of pacifying the, soothing the heart. Feelings of separation are also transcendental bliss. Sorry. Feelings of separation are also sources of transcendental bliss for a devotee. Of course, when he is in association with the Lord, he is very, very happy, very pleased. It's blissful. But feeling of separation is also a source of transcendental bliss of a different kind, and they are never comparable to contaminated material feelings of separation. In this material world, we also sometimes feel that there is some person who is our near and dear one. When we are separated from them, we feel the pain of separation. But what pain of separation Arjuna is feeling now after separation from Krishna, after Krishna's disappearance from this material world, is not the same as our material feelings of separation from some material relationship. They are not the same. In this material world, when there is separation, we feel pain, and we lament about it. But in the spiritual atmosphere, in the spiritual dimension of existence, separation from the Lord is a source of transcendental bliss of a different kind. It's a variety of bliss. Twenty-ninth verse: Vasudeva Angri Anudhyana Paribhramhita Ramhasa Bhaktya Nirmati Tashyesha Kashaya Dishano Arjunaha. The meaning of this verse is, "Arjuna's constant remembrance of the lotus feet of Lord Shri Krishna rapidly increased his devotion and as a result, all the trash in his thoughts subsided."

**Key Quote:** "Material desires in the mind are the trash of material contamination."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that material desires are like garbage in the heart, obscuring our spiritual identity and leading to incompatible and compatible feelings, and discusses the confusion caused by likes and dislikes in the material world.

In the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, "Material desires in the mind are the trash of material contamination." If we have material desires in our mind, they are nothing but garbage, which is somehow sitting in our heart or consciousness. And Srila Prabhupada explains, "By such contamination, the living being is faced with so many compatible and incompatible things." Different kinds of material desires bring about different kinds of compatible and incompatible things that discourage the very existence of spiritual identity. Our spiritual identity is, we are eternally meant to serve Krishna, lovingly. In such service, there is no distress, there is no suffering, there is no pain, there is no ignorance, there is no illusion, there is no misery, none of those things. But, when there is material desire in the heart, then there is so much of incompatible and compatible feelings, and those are opposed to our spiritual identity. They are opposed to devotional service. Birth after birth, the conditioned soul is entrapped with so many pleasing and displeasing elements. Itchadvesha Samuthena dvanva mohena bharata. We are born always with some likes and dislikes, and they are always confusing for us. Because, whole life in a particular body, we are simply chasing something which we think we like, and we are trying to avoid something which we dislike. But, in this material world, there is nothing to like or dislike.

**Key Quote:** "Material existence is not meant for us at all."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts material existence with spiritual life in devotional service to Krishna, explaining that material existence is a source of misery, while spiritual life is total bliss, and discusses how chanting Hare Krishna exposes material desires.

Everything is simply a source of misery. Dukkhalayam, ashashvatam. So, there is nothing to really aspire for. There is nothing which we think if we avoid we will be happy. No. Material existence is not meant for us at all. We are meant for spiritual life in association with Krishna, in devotional service to him, and that is total bliss. There is nothing compatible or incompatible in that spiritual existence. So, all these pleasing and displeasing elements, in material existence, are false and temporary. They accumulate due to our reactions to material desires. How do they get accumulated? Because of the reactions of the material desires. But, when we get in touch with the transcendental Lord in his variegated energies by devotional service, his spiritual energy, devotional service is always under the protection of the devotional energy, spiritual energy. Then, when we touch Hare Krishna, when I say Hare Krishna, I am touching the transcendental sound, spiritual sound of Krishna's name. And by that, what happens? The naked forms of all material desires become manifest. I can clearly see the nature of these material desires which are there in the heart. And the intelligence of the living being is specified in its true color. The intelligence will begin working. Vyavasaya Atmika Buddhi. It will reveal to us, don't chase these material desires. They are all worthless. Don't chase these material desires.

### Bhagavad Gita, transcendence, dissipation of ignorance, spiritual existence

**Key Quote:** "Immediately all material contamination is dissipated."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the power of the Bhagavad Gita to dissipate material contamination and confusion, comparing it to a spark of light that dispels darkness, and encourages remembering Krishna's instructions to achieve spiritual existence.

As soon as Arjuna turned his attention towards the instructions of the Lord, as they are inculcated in the Bhagavad Gita, his true color of eternal association with the Lord became manifest. Arjuna began to feel the effect of associating with the Lord even through his instructions, transcendental instructions in the Bhagavad Gita, in the form of Bhagavad Gita, and thus he felt freed from all material contaminations. Immediately all material contamination is dissipated. It is cleansed away. Instantaneous cleansing. It's exactly like you are sitting in abject darkness. Somebody brings in a tiny spark of light. Immediately darkness dispels, immediately. So like that, even any one instruction of Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, you remember, immediately all your confusion, your ignorance, your illusion, your likes, dislikes, material likes and dislikes, everything will be dissipated, and you simply become situated in transcendence, beyond all material illusion, beyond material duality, beyond material confusion, everything beyond matter. That is spiritual existence. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

### conditioned soul, three gunas, material existence, spiritual platform

**Key Quote:** "Conditioned soul means one who is subject to material conditions enforced by the interaction between the body and the soul."
**Summary:** This segment defines a conditioned soul and explains how the three gunas influence consciousness in material existence, contrasting it with the spiritual platform where one is free from these influences.

Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya, Narayanam Namaskritya, Naram Chayiva Narottamam, Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tatho Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session we will be discussing from the 30th verse of the 15th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. गीतं भगवता ज्ञानं यत्तत संग्राम मूर्धनी काल कर्म तमो रुद्धं पुनर अध्यगमत प्रभुहू The meaning of this verse is, because of the Lord's pastimes and activities, and because of his absence, it appeared that Arjuna forgot the instructions left by the personality of Godhead. But factually, this was not the case, and again he became Lord of his senses. So, Srila Prabhupada explains what does this mean. A conditioned soul, I have explained what is conditioned soul in a previous session. Conditioned soul means one who is subject to material conditions enforced by the interaction between the body and the soul. So, we have the combination of the three gunas. Three gunas means three kinds of influences: Sattvic influence, Rajasic influence, Tamsic influence on our consciousness in material existence. So, we are called conditioned soul. So, we behave, we act, we think, we feel, we have got the drive to work according to the combination of the influence of these three gunas. But that is material existence. When you elevate your consciousness to the spiritual platform, you are above the influence, you are freed from the influence of the three gunas. You simply act spiritually.

### eternal time, internal potency, spiritual activities, transcendental

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "All pastimes or activities of the Lord are spiritual in nature."
**Summary:** This segment explains that the Lord is not influenced by time or the gunas, and therefore His activities are eternal and transcendental, stemming from His internal potency, unlike ordinary activities influenced by the three gunas.

So, here Srila Prabhupada begins his purport by telling, a conditioned soul is enwrapped, enwrapped means completely covered, in his fructive activities by the force of eternal time. Kala, through the influence of the gunas, forces us to act in a way that is according to the past karma. But the Supreme Lord, when he incarnates on the earth, is not influenced by Kala, nor is the Supreme Lord influenced by the material conception of past, present, and future. Neither eternal time in the material world, nor the conception of past, present, and future, is influencing the Lord. So, therefore, the activities of the Lord, which may appear like ordinary activities of this material world, are not ordinary. The activities of the Lord are eternal, sanātana, and they are manifestations of his ātma māyā, or internal potency. Our ordinary activities are due to the interaction of the three gunas. Prakṛte kriyamānāni gunai karmāni sarvaśaha ahankāra vimūdātmā kartāḥ mitimanyate Whatever material activities are happening, they are carried out by the three gunas, but I think I am the doer under the influence of illusion. But spiritual activities are not at all like material activities. They have nothing to do with the three gunas. They have nothing to do with Kala, material time. They are completely transcendental to material time and material modes.

### Krishna's pastimes, transcendence, spiritual nature, devotion

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is no ordinary child. He is the same supreme Brahman who is the object of worship by all devotees who have accepted him as their master."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the transcendental nature of Krishna's pastimes, even seemingly ordinary ones like crawling, and highlights that Krishna is the Supreme Brahman appearing as a child for the sake of pastimes.

And therefore they are called under the internal potency or spiritual potency or spiritual energy, divine energy, transcendental energy, more than divine, transcendental energy. All pastimes or activities of the Lord are spiritual in nature. All activities of the Supreme Lord are spiritual by nature, even stealing the butter, even crawling in the courtyard of Mother Yashoda like an ordinary child. All those activities are completely transcendental. They are not ordinary activities. Therefore Shukadeva Goswami, he is speaking to all the assembled saintly persons and to Pariksit Maharaj. And Shukadeva Goswami is speaking very, very gravely about transcendental subject matter, about spiritual subject matter, trying to enlighten Pariksit and through Pariksit all the other saintly persons. But he is describing Krishna's childhood pastimes, and everybody is seriously sitting and hearing. And Shukadeva Goswami is telling, Krishna was crawling on the floor and Mother Yashoda was enjoying seeing her beloved child very beautifully decorated with nice ornaments and nice dress and nice beautiful smile on Krishna's face. So what is all this got to do with transcendence? Krishna is transcendence himself, and all of Krishna's activities are transcendental activities. How are they different? Ordinary child gives pleasure to its mother by its movements, by its crawling, by its being decorated by the mother. Here Mother Yashoda is also similarly apparently decorating a small child and taking pleasure in the child crawling, smiling, playing. What's the difference? So that is explained by Shukadeva Goswami in the tenth canto of the Bhagavatam. Ittham satam brahma-sukhanu bhutya dasyaṁgatānām para-daivatena māyāśritānām naradārakena sākaṁ vijagru kṛta-punya-punjā Krishna is no ordinary child. He is the same supreme Brahman who is the object of worship by all devotees who have accepted him as their master. And he is the same object of meditation, of worship or the destination of the impersonalists who are after the brahma-jyoti, Brahman effulgence, that is his own bodily effulgence. So that Krishna is appearing as a beloved child of Nanda and Yashoda, simply for the sake of pastimes, that's all.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna wants his pure devotees to rule the world."
**Summary:** This segment explains that the battle of Kurukshetra was part of Krishna's mission to eliminate demonic forces and establish pure devotees to guide the world towards Krishna consciousness.

So they are completely transcendental, discussing them, hearing about them, describing them, participating or being a spectator of such activities is completely spiritual. There is no tinge of any material guna or material reactions, nothing. It so appeared that Arjuna and the Lord were engaged in the battle of Kurukshetra as the other party was also engaged. But factually, the Lord was executing his mission of incarnation and association with his eternal friend Arjuna. Like so many battles are fought. This battle of Kurukshetra was another battle between the Pandavas and Kauravas, and the whole world was divided, all the kings were divided into two parties. Some took the side of Pandavas, others took the side of Kauravas and they were fighting. Whoever wins the battle will rule the world. No, it is not as simple as that. Krishna being present on the battlefield of Kurukshetra and his pure devotees, the Pandavas, under the complete transcendental protection of Krishna, they are present on the battlefield. They are executing Krishna's mission. Krishna wants his pure devotees to rule the world, and Krishna has arranged this battle simply for eliminating all the unnecessary burden in the form of demoniac forces on this earth planet. He has arranged this battle. They will all be killed and Yudhishthira Maharaj and the other Pandavas, they will come out victorious by Krishna's plan, Krishna's arrangement, Krishna's transcendental mission in this material world. Pure devotees should rule this world. Pure devotees should direct the people in general towards Krishna consciousness.

### Arjuna's revival, Krishna's instructions, devotion, eternal truth

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "One should think of the Lord always."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how Arjuna's consciousness was revived by remembering Krishna's instructions and emphasizes the importance of constantly thinking of Krishna, becoming a devotee, and offering obeisances to receive the Lord's blessings and protection.

That is Krishna's mission. Therefore, such apparently material activities of Arjuna did not drive him away from his transcendental position, but on the contrary revived his consciousness of the songs of the Lord as he sang them personally. Krishna, whatever instructions Krishna gave on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, those instructions Arjuna is trying to recollect. And he is remembering the activities of the Lord also in connection with that battle. And simply by remembering them, Arjuna is re-established in his transcendental position as the eternal friend of Krishna, as the associate of Krishna, as the participant in Krishna's Leela. So all illusion, ignorance are absent in such thoughts. Thinking of Krishna is different from thinking of ordinary subject matter. Big, big difference. The revival of consciousness, the way Arjuna's consciousness is revived simply by thinking of Krishna's instructions, is assured by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, in the 18th chapter, 65th verse. What does Krishna say? Man-mana bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam namaskuru. What is the meaning of this verse in the Bhagavad Gita? One should think of the Lord always. Always think of me, Krishna says. The mind should not forget him. One should become a devotee of the Lord, mad-yaji mam namaskuru, and offer obeisances unto him. Devotee means he bows down before the Lord. mam evaisyasi asamsayah. One who lives in that fashion becomes undoubtedly endowed with the blessing of the Lord. Guaranteed to get blessing of the Lord if you live as a devotee, constantly thinking of Krishna, bowing down before him. And in this way, by the blessing of the Lord, what happens? One achieves the shelter of Krishna's lotus feet. mam evaisyasi asamsayah. Get complete shelter at his lotus feet. Completely protected. Always safe under his protection. There is nothing to doubt about this eternal truth. What is told in the Bhagavad Gita is eternal truth for all times, for all people, in all circumstances, in all places.

**Key Quote:** "One should therefore adjust the activities of life in pace with the mission of the Lord."
**Summary:** This segment explains that Krishna disclosed confidential knowledge to Arjuna because of their friendly relationship and emphasizes the importance of aligning one's life with Krishna's mission of reviving our relationship with Him through bhakti to prepare for returning back to Godhead.

Eternal truth. Because Arjuna was his confidential friend, the secret was disclosed to him. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna tells Arjuna, You are my most dear devotee, situated in a friendly relationship. Therefore, I am disclosing the most confidential knowledge. bhakto 'si me sakha ceti rahasyam hy etad uttamam. Arjuna had no desire to fight with his relatives, but he fought for the mission of the Supreme Lord Krishna. So Arjuna's fighting is also participating in the mission of Krishna. So Arjuna was always engaged in the execution of Krishna's mission only, and therefore, after the Lord's departure, he remained in the same transcendental position, even though it appeared like he forgot all the instructions of the Bhagavad Gita. One should therefore adjust the activities of life in pace with the mission of the Lord, and by doing this, one is sure to return back home, back to Godhead. So what is the mission of the Lord now in this material world? The mission of the Lord is that we revive our lost or forgotten relationship with Krishna through the activities of bhakti, and in this way, we prepare ourselves to go back to Godhead.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains that Arjuna's state was not one of ordinary lamentation but of transcendence due to his spiritual assets.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 31st verse of the 15th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Vishoko Brahma Sampradaya Sanchinna Dvaita Samshayaha Leena Prakriti Nair Gunyat Alingatvat Asambhavaha. The meaning of this verse is: Because of his possessing spiritual assets, the doubts of duality were completely cut off. Thus, he was freed from the three modes of material nature and placed in transcendence. There was no longer any chance of his becoming entangled in birth and death, for he was freed from material form.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of duality arising from the misidentification of the material body as the self, drawing from Srila Prabhupada's purport.

This is Suta Goswami describing the position of Arjuna. Don't think Arjuna was lamenting after Krishna's disappearance and he was suffering like an ordinary person feels pain and suffering due to separation from some beloved departed soul. No, it's not like that. So that is explained here. Arjuna is having those instructions in his heart which Krishna imparted, and that is a spiritual asset. And those spiritual assets are useful to cut off all kinds of doubts of duality, and immediately such spiritual asset places one on the transcendental platform above the three modes of material nature. So then there is no question of becoming entangled in birth and death. So Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport: doubts of duality begin from the misconception of the material body, which is accepted as a self by less intelligent persons. This material existence is

characterized by the fact that the material body is a self, and the self is not a self. This material existence is characterized by dvandva, duality, and this duality is only because I am spirit soul, or each person, individual person, is spirit soul, but wrongly one forgets, wrongly one thinks that I am this material body and forgets that I am spirit soul. I am not the body. The most foolish part of our ignorance is our identifying with this material body as the self. This is the most foolish part. You are thinking something you are without knowing that it is not you. Just like I think I am this body. Now, if I think I'm this body, I think I'm made up of this flesh and blood and bones and so many material parts of the body, and this body's becoming old, and the body sometimes becomes sick, and the body is becoming dirty, and the body is having some possessions, some relationships, and I'm trying to secure them. So all because of the misidentification, wrong understanding, everything in relation with the body is ignorantly accepted as our own. It begins with I, I am this body, and then extends to mine, what is mine, everything connected to the body is mine, my father, my mother, my car, my house, my prestige, my, my, my, my. We are completely in an ocean of misconceptions, doubts due to misconceptions of myself and mine, my body, my relatives, my property, my wife, my children, my wealth, my country, my community, and hundreds and thousands of

**Summary:** The speaker explains that everyone is bewildered by the concept of 'mine' and that the remedy is to assimilate the teachings of Bhagavad Gita and understand that Krishna is everything.

similar illusory contemplations cause bewilderment for the conditioned soul. Everyone in this material world who's having such wrong conceptions are bewildered. Bewildered. Everyone is bewildered, no exception. Even the most prosperous materialist, even the wealthiest person, even the most successful entrepreneur, the most powerful devata, everyone is bewildered by this conception of mine, mine, mine, mine, mine. Now Srila Prabhupada says, what is the remedy for this? By assimilating the instructions of the Bhagavad Gita, one is sure to be released from such bewilderment, because real knowledge is knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead Vasudeva, or Lord Krishna, is everything, including oneself. Krishna is everything. Krishna is everything means Krishna is there and his energies are there. So Krishna has his identity as a Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has his energies, his spiritual, the spiritual world is his spiritual energy, the material world is material energy, we are his marginal energy. So Krishna is everything because non-difference between him and his energies. Energies are his, everything is a manifestation of his potency.

**Key Quote:** "Everything belongs to Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that everything is Krishna's energy and part and parcel of Him, emphasizing the concept of non-duality and how perfect knowledge eradicates the illusion of ownership.

As part and parcel, potency means his energy, his Shakti. So everything that we see in this world is his Shakti, and it is present as his own part and parcel. Parcel means inseparable part, cannot be separated. The potency and the potent are not different. Potency means the Shakti, and the potent, the possessor of the potency, the owner of the Shakti. Shakti means the photoЯ un-xaṁepa Iman, Krishna, Krishna and Shakti, Shakti, Shakti, Iman, they are not different. So, the conception of duality is at once mitigated by attainment of perfect knowledge. Like, I think something is mine and something else is somebody else's. But the reality is, what I think is mine is not mine, it is Krishna's. And what I think is somebody else's is not that person's property, it is actually Krishna's.

**Key Quote:** "So, therefore, the instructions of the Bhagavad Gita eradicate all kinds of material conceptions."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Arjuna to illustrate how the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita can eradicate material conceptions, such as grief over the death of a father, by understanding the eternal nature of the soul.

So, this duality is completely eradicated by perfect knowledge. Everything belongs to Krishna. As soon as Arjuna took up the instructions of the Bhagavad Gita, expert as he was, he could at once eradicate the material conception of Lord Krishna, his eternal friend. Material conception is, let's say, somebody has got his father and the father is his son. And when the father dies, then he feels very sad. My father passed away. My father is no more. This is a material conception. Father is no more means the body, material body, which is not the real person, not the real father, is no more. The spirit soul has no death, has no birth, doesn't belong to this world.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is always present in the form of his instructions."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna is always present through his instructions, form, pastimes, and qualities, and that a devotee never feels his absence due to his transcendental presence in different non-dual energies.

So, therefore, the instructions of the Bhagavad Gita eradicate all kinds of material conceptions. So, Arjuna could realize that the Lord was still present before him by his instruction, by his form, by his pastimes, by his qualities and everything else related to him. Consider this, that Krishna is always present in the form of his instructions. Eternally, those instructions are true. So, if Krishna is present, where is the cause for lamentation that Krishna passed away, Krishna disappeared, Krishna went away to his personal abode? No, Krishna is present. He is present in one form, yet another form, yet another form, unlimited form. Unlimited forms. Krishna is always present. So, in a sense, the devotee never feels absence of Krishna if a devotee is Krishna conscious. So, Arjuna could realize that Lord Krishna, his friend, was still present before him by his transcendental presence in different non-dual energies. All energies are Krishna's. So, in the form of energy, Krishna is present. And there is no question of attainment of the association of the Lord by another change of body under the influence of time and space.

**Key Quote:** "The spirit soul has got spiritual identity, which is eternal."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the temporary material form with the eternal spiritual identity of the soul, emphasizing the soul's eternal relationship with Krishna.

Just like sometimes people ask that I lost my father. And you say my father has gone to some other body. Can I actually again associate with my father, whom I am missing, by myself taking another body like he has taken? Because our conception of existence in the material world is simply based on body. That's all. But the truth is, this body is simply some... material form. Temporary material form. It has nothing to do with the real person, the spirit soul. The spirit soul has got spiritual identity, which is eternal. The material form is simply a dress, a covering, a... a form, a... a material... object. It has no life... by itself. Material form has no life by itself. Whereas the spiritual identity is ever-present. Eternally present. In eternal platform. Spiritual platform. In spiritual form. In spiritual relationship with Krishna. Eternally present.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that one can constantly be in association with the Lord through devotional service, especially by hearing and chanting Krishna's name, which allows Krishna to reveal Himself within the heart.

So therefore, Prabhupada concludes by telling, by attainment of absolute knowledge, one can be in association with the Lord constantly, even in this present life. How? Simply by hearing, chanting, thinking of and worshipping the Supreme Lord. What is true for Arjuna, is true for everyone at all times. Even now, if we chant constantly Krishna's holy name, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, we should understand and should realize this fact, that Krishna is appearing in the form of that holy name, transcendental sound on my tongue. And if I hear, Krishna is entering, as the transcendental sound within, through my ears, and He can enter my heart and touch my soul. Touch me. He means my soul. And then, I immediately feel the... loving presence of Krishna. The soothing touch of Krishna. And this is a fact. This is not some kind of sentiment, or some... some material adjustment in the mind. No. It is a transcendental truth. One can see Him, one can feel His presence, even in this present life, simply by understanding the Advayagyana Lord, or the Absolute Lord, through the process of devotional service. You perform devotional service, beginning with hearing and chanting, about Krishna, and then, the Advayagyana Lord, the Absolute Lord, will reveal Himself to you, within your heart, and you will never feel His absence under any circumstances. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

The meaning of this 32nd verse is, upon hearing the word Bhagavad Gita, upon hearing of Lord Krishna's returning to his abode, and upon understanding the end of the Yadu dynasty's earthly manifestation, Maharaj Yudhishthira decided to go back home, back to Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "Bhagavad Gita was not just spoken for Arjuna alone. It is spoken for everyone or anyone who wants to actually go back home, back to Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that both Arjuna and Yudhishthira turned to the Bhagavad Gita for guidance after Krishna's departure, emphasizing the Gita's universal relevance.

Shrila Prabhupada explains in the purport, Maharaj Yudhishthira also turned his attention to the instructions of the Bhagavad Gita after hearing about the Lord's departure, from the vision of earthly people. In the earlier verse, it was described, Arjuna turned towards the instructions of Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. Arjuna was personally instructed by the Lord in the subject matter of the Bhagavad Gita, and that was during the battle, just before the beginning of the battle of Kurukshetra. But now, after the Lord's departure, when Arjuna was heartbroken, then in order to pacify himself, he recollected and remembered and applied the same instructions of Bhagavad Gita, which Krishna had spoken before the battle of Kurukshetra. Now, this verse describes, Maharaj Yudhishthira, the elder brother of Arjuna, also turned his attention to the instructions of Krishna, in the Bhagavad Gita.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's appearance and disappearance is totally transcendental. It is not like the appearance or the birth and death of conditioned souls like us."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the transcendental nature of Krishna's appearance and disappearance, contrasting it with the forced birth and death of conditioned souls.

You see, so Bhagavad Gita was not just spoken for Arjuna alone. It is spoken for everyone or anyone who wants to actually go back home, back to Godhead. According to Krishna's instructions, we understand we belong to Krishna, we are meant to actually prepare ourselves to go back to Krishna in his personal abode. And perfect instructions are given by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. So Srila Prabhupada continues, he began to deliberate on the Lord's way of appearance and departure. So Krishna's appearance and disappearance is totally transcendental. It is not like the appearance or the birth and death of conditioned souls like us. Srila Prabhupada says further, the mission of the Lord's appearance and disappearance in the mortal universe is completely dependent on his supreme will. He is not forced to appear or disappear by any superior energy, as the living beings appear and disappear, being forced by the laws of nature. Our birth and death is forced upon us. We don't choose to either take birth or die. We don't choose. But Krishna's appearance and disappearance looks like the birth and death of ordinary living beings, but it is entirely a transcendental pastime of the Supreme Lord. It is completely dependent on his supreme will. He is completely independent and exactly as he wants it, it will happen.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord is present in many many many many many places in many different forms"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's simultaneous presence in many forms in both the spiritual and material worlds, particularly in relation to devotees' desires.

Srila Prabhupada continues, whenever the Lord likes, he can appear himself anywhere and everywhere without disturbing his appearance and disappearance in any other place. So simultaneously, the Lord is present in many many many many many places in many different forms and he appears and disappears without disturbing the other forms of appearance in other places. So simultaneously, he is in the spiritual world. In the spiritual world also, he is present in many many forms. His original form is Krishna, Shamasundara, and he is present in the spiritual world, in different forms according to the devotees' desire to serve him. And he expands for the sake of devotees as Balarama, as Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Kesava, Narayana, Madhava, Govinda, Madhusudana, so many forms. Each of these forms particularly the Narayana forms are predominators of the spiritual planets, the Vaikuntha Lokas. And in those Lokas, they have their devotees and they are receiving the service and reciprocating with the devotees. Similarly, Krishna also, in his personal abode, Goloka Vrindavana, he is reciprocating with his devotees, the devotees who are serving him out of love. So this is the truth about the personality of Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "He is also present as Guna Avatara, as Brahma, as Shiva."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Krishna's presence in the material world through various incarnations, including Maha Vishnu, Garbhodakshayi Vishnu, Shirodakshayi Vishnu, Paramatma, and other avatars like Rama and Narasimha.

Now, not only in the spiritual world, he is also present in the material world. Which is the first incarnation in the material world? It is the incarnation of the Supreme Lord as Maha Vishnu at the beginning of the creation. Then, Maha Vishnu expands as Garbhodakshayi Vishnu to enter into each universe which he himself generates by his spiritual potency. And, that Garbhodakshayi Vishnu further expands as Shirodakshayi Vishnu, the maintainer Vishnu. And, this maintainer Vishnu further expands as Paramatma in the heart of every living being and enters into everything, every spiritual material atom, every atom of material manifestation, matter, material objects. And, he completely controls everything in existence in the material world in that way. Now, while he is present in the form of Maha Vishnu, Garbhodakshayi Vishnu, Shirodakshayi Vishnu, Paramatma, he also appears in the form of incarnations, past time incarnations, Leela Avatara. He is also present as Guna Avatara, as Brahma, as Shiva. He is present in the form of Shakya Vesha Avatara. Empowered incarnations. He is present as or rather he appears in so many different past time incarnations, Leela Avatara, Rama, Narasimha, Varaha, Krishna, Balarama in the material world.

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "They appear as if they are independent of each other. But it is the same Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of the sun's appearance and disappearance in different parts of the world to explain how Krishna's various incarnations can exist simultaneously without disturbing each other.

Now, this does not disturb or in any way affect any of the other forms or incarnations of the Lord. They appear as if they are independent of each other, but it is the same Supreme Lord. Krishna, Rama in the spiritual world, in the material world, as Mahavishnu, as Garbhodakshayi Vishnu are all the same person, the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. So that is being explained by Srila Prabhupada here. He is like the sun. The sun appears and disappears on its own accord at any place without disturbing his presence in other places. Just like now, at this time, it is 7.30 pm. So, the sun has set for our vision in the place we are now. I am in Bangalore. So, the sun has set now. And, the sun simultaneously is rising somewhere. Simultaneously, the sun is overhead somewhere else, some other part of the world. So, the appearance and disappearance of the sun, the rising and setting of the sun relative to my vision in one place on the earth has nothing to do with, is not disturbing the sun's presence in other parts of the world. So, this is an example that is given by Srila Prabhupada to explain the Lord's appearance and disappearance is undisturbed.

**Key Quote:** "Anyone who factually understands the transcendental appearance and disappearance of the Lord by his inconceivable energy becomes liberated from the laws of birth and death"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that understanding the transcendental nature of Krishna's appearance and disappearance leads to liberation from the cycle of birth and death, referencing the Bhagavad Gita.

His appearance and disappearance in other parts of the world or in other places in other times. So, Srila Prabhupada explains the sun example further. The sun appears in the morning in India without disappearing from the western hemisphere. The sun is present everywhere and anywhere all over the solar system. But, it so appears that in a particular place the sun appears in the morning and also disappears at some fixed time in the evening. The time limitation even of the sun is of no concern. And so, what to speak of the Supreme Lord who is a creator and controller of the sun. If the sun itself is independently appearing and disappearing in different parts of the universe, then what to speak of the Supreme Lord? He can appear and disappear anywhere according to his own sweet will. Therefore, in the Bhagavad Gita, it is stated that anyone who factually understands the transcendental appearance and disappearance of the Lord by his inconceivable energy becomes liberated from the laws of birth and death and is placed in the eternal spiritual sky where the Vaikuntha planets are. Janma karma chame divyam evam yo naithi mamethi sorjuna punar janma naithi. Understanding the transcendental nature of Krishna's appearance

and activities. Janma karma chame divyam. Even though they look like ordinary human beings birth and actions but they are different entirely different. This is what we have to hear from the authentic scriptures from the Acharyas from Srila Prabhupada to hear and understand and and become fixed up in this understanding in the realization and that will clear away all misconceptions about our own self. And then when we have the proper understanding proper we are properly situated without any misconception then we are eligible to become liberated from material influence material and that is called ultimate liberation when we are placed in the eternal spiritual sky in one of the Vaikuntha planets where we belong actually. There that means in the Vaikuntha planets such liberated persons can eternally be liberated from material existence. So all our problems are solved without any separate endeavor simply by becoming Krishna conscious and returning to Krishna. I will stop here. Thank you very

### Mahabharata, Srimad Bhagavatam, devotee's perspective
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/tVgdAvQhC30?t=134
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So, you understand the position of the devotees of Krishna from the Bhagavatam, particularly the incidents in Mahabharata."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Srimad Bhagavatam provides a deeper understanding of the devotees of Krishna compared to the Mahabharata.

Because the descriptions in the Mahabharata about the different difficulties and troubles Kunti went through is kind of bewildering to people that such a great devotee had to undergo so much tribulation in this world. So, it is not at all a tribulation for the devotee, when the devotee is participating in the pastimes of the Lord in a particular role, according to the will of the Lord. So, if we have to understand the real purport of the Mahabharata, then we have to hear that or understand that from the Srimad Bhagavatam. In the Garuda Purana, it is said, Srimad Bhagavatam is... Artho-yam Brahma Sutranam is the explanation of the Vedanta Sutras, is a natural commentary on the Vedanta Sutras by the self-same author, Vyasadeva. And Bharata-artha-minirnayam, it is also giving the purport of the Mahabharata, Bharata-artha, referring to the Mahabharata. The Mahabharata describes so many historical incidents and also describes Krishna's pastimes related to those historical incidents, in connection with those historical incidents. But Mahabharata may not help us understand the exact position of especially the devotees of Krishna.

### Kunti, tribulations, Mahabharata
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/tVgdAvQhC30?t=275
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "So it appears like Kunti was very very very very unfortunate personality simply undergoing one misery after another."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates Kunti's life story as depicted in the Mahabharata, highlighting the numerous hardships she faced.

So, you understand the position of the devotees of Krishna from the Bhagavatam, particularly the incidents in Mahabharata. Just like, to give an example, in the Mahabharata, there is a description that Kunti was feeling very, very sorry that she had to undergo so many tribulations just because of her position in her parents' house, even as an unmarried young girl. She was blessed by Durvasamuni to be able to call upon any demigod and conceive a child through that demigod. Now, she was a young girl. She just happened to try out chanting that mantra, which Durvasamuni had given her. And she is not yet married. She called upon the sun god. And then sun god appeared and said, Now you will conceive a child. But your virginity will be intact. So, she had a child. And she didn't know how to. She is unmarried. She never wanted to have a child. She was so young. So, anyway, she with a very heavy heart, she just abandoned the child. And that was Karna. And then later on she got married to Pandu. And Pandu died an untimely death. Then she was left behind with five sons of Pandu, the Pandavas. And she was the widow mother of these five sons, Pandu's widow. And they were deprived of the kingdom after that. And so many tribulations, one after another, because Duryodhana had some enmity against the Pandavas. So, Duryodhana was giving trouble to the Pandavas. And Kunti, she also had to suffer, because she is not independent. To do anything separately, she is with her sons and whatever difficulty the sons undergo, she is also a part of that, so it appears like Kunti was very, very, very, very unfortunate personality simply undergoing one misery after another.

### Kunti, devotion, Srimad Bhagavatam, perspective
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/tVgdAvQhC30?t=479
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "And I wish that those difficulties or problems come again."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Kunti's lamentation in the Mahabharata with her prayers in the Bhagavatam, where she welcomes difficulties as opportunities to remember Krishna.

So in the Mahabharata there is a description that she is lamenting her miseries, but in the Bhagavatam we see Kunti offering prayers to Krishna and telling, "My dear Lord Krishna, whenever we had difficulty, you are always there to save us from calamities and solve our problems. And I wish that those difficulties or problems come again and again because simply by remembering you when we are in difficulty, because we are devotees, we are dependent on you, we are able to completely get rid of the material bondage, we are assured of ultimate liberation simply by thinking of you, remembering you, by praying to you." So she is not at all lamenting about those difficulties rather, she is welcoming them, so this perspective is the speciality of the confidential knowledge in the Bhagavatam that is given to us. Similarly here it's being explained when she heard that Krishna has gone back to his personal abode and the Yadu dynasty also has ended their earthly manifestation, then she decided...

**Key Quote:** "It disappears along with the Lord out of our sight both the Lord and his pure devotees they appear and disappear apparent to our vision they are all eternally present eternally present in the spiritual world eternally present in the spiritual world they are never absent in the spiritual world."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the disappearance of Krishna and his devotees from our sight does not mean their end, as they are eternally present in the spiritual world.

To completely engage herself in pure devotional service, focus her attention completely on Krishna. As a pure devotee, it's natural for her to do that and she gained release from the course of material existence, finished her material existence is over. She had come for participating Krishna's Leela and it's over. Elsewhere it is described she is the eternal associate of Krishna in the material world for his earthly pastimes, for his material pastimes in the material world. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "The setting of the sun does not mean the end of the sun, it means that the sun is out of our sight." Similarly, the end of the mission of the Lord on a particular planet or universe only means that he is out of our sight. The end of the Yadu dynasty also does not mean that it is annihilating the Lord. It disappears along with the Lord out of our sight. Both the Lord and his pure devotees, they appear and disappear apparent to our vision. They are all eternally present, eternally present in the spiritual world. They are never absent in the spiritual world.

**Verse References:** BG 9.34
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Always be engaged in my devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of engaging in pure devotional service at all times, citing Krishna's instructions in the Bhagavad Gita.

But they also appear in the material world as required for the Lord's pastime in the material world for our sake. As Maharaj Yudhishtira decided to prepare to go back to Godhead, so also Kunti decided, because both are pure devotees of the Lord. So pure devotees only business is devotional service, that's all. Whether in this situation or that situation, whether in distress or in happiness, whether in the presence of the Lord or in the apparent absence of the Lord, in all circumstances, at all times, in all situations, in all circumstances, always they are engaged in pure devotional service and that's what Krishna instructs in the Bhagavad Gita. Always be engaged in my devotional service. Man mana bhava madbhakto madhyaji mam namaskuru. Several places in the Bhagavad Gita Krishna says always engage in my devotional service in different ways. tasmat sarveshu kaaleshu maa manusmara yudhya chak. You always engage in my devotional service. You always think of me. You always remember me. Always worship me. Always discuss about me. Katayantas chamam nityam. So like this the pure devotees are teaching us to always engage in pure devotional service. So Srila Prabhupada further says...

### devotional service, going back to Godhead, passport
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/tVgdAvQhC30?t=778
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Thus she fully engaged herself in the transcendental devotional service of the Lord which guarantees one a passport for going back to Godhead after quitting this present material body."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a passport to explain how devotional service guarantees one's return to Godhead after death.

Thus she fully engaged herself in the transcendental devotional service of the Lord which guarantees one a passport for going back to Godhead after quitting this present material body. See, passport means, as we are citizens of India, the Indian government gives us this document called passport which means our travel in foreign countries may be without any hindrance. So without any hindrance we may be allowed to travel in other countries based on our bona fides of being citizens of this country. So going back to Godhead is guaranteed for pure devotees who are fully engaged in transcendental devotional service of the Lord. When they quit this material world or this place, the earthly planet, it doesn't mean that everything is finished for them. No. They are simply quitting this place to go to the next place where the Lord wants them to go. And they are always guided by the Lord. Even while in this world they are guided by the Lord and even their travel or their transfer from this world to another place where the Lord's pastimes are going on is also guided by the Lord. So they are not destroyed in any way. Their devotional service does not come to an end.

### spiritualizing the body, devotional service, spiritual consciousness, Kunti
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/tVgdAvQhC30?t=921
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So spiritualizing this present body begins when we begin pure devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotional service begins the process of spiritualizing the body and consciousness, leading to detachment from the material world and ultimately, going back to Godhead, as Kunti did.

It is always continuously going on. The beginning of devotional service to the Lord is the beginning of spiritualizing the present body. See, we have a material body when we take birth in this material world. And that is due to our own karma, our material activities. But when we begin spiritual life it means that we want to end this material existence and we want to reinstate ourselves in our spiritual position as eternal devotees of Krishna in His personal abode. So spiritualizing this present body begins when we begin pure devotional service. And thus an unalloyed devotee of the Lord loses all material contact in the present body. As we go on spiritualizing this present body means we spiritualize our consciousness. Then our contact with this body, even though I am in this body, the contact with the body is lost in proportion to our development of our spiritual consciousness. The abode of the Lord is not a myth as is thought by the unbelievers or ignorant people. But one cannot reach there by any material means. One can go there after quitting the present body only if one has prepared oneself by practicing devotional service. And Kunti did that and she went back to God.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and highlights the difficulty in understanding the transcendental activities of Lord Krishna and his devotees, particularly the Yadu dynasty.

In this session we will be discussing from the 34th verse of the 15th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Yes Jaya Harad Bhuvobharam Tam Tanum Vijahav Ajah Kantakam Kantakenewa Dwayam Chapi Shituhu Samam. The meaning of this verse is: The supreme unborn Lord Shri Krishna caused the members of the Yadu dynasty to relinquish their bodies, and thus he relinquished their bodies, to relieve the burden of the world. This action was like picking out a thorn with a thorn, though both are the same to the controller. Now this verse is an explanation of the difficult to understand actions of the Lord Shri Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces Srila Prabhupada's purport and Vishwanatha Chakravarti Thakur's explanation of why the sages of Naimisharanya were disturbed by the account of the Yadus' demise, emphasizing the assurance that the Yadus did not suffer.

And his pure devotees. Many places it is said all the Lord's activities or the pure devotees activities in this world are completely transcendental. But these transcendental activities are not always easy to understand. Some of them are very difficult to understand. Especially the members of the Yadu dynasty, how did they relinquish their bodies, how do they give up their bodies fighting with each other, killing each other, getting intoxicated and when fighting with each other, how can this be understood as a transcendental activity of the pure devotees, the Yadavas, the members of the Yadu dynasty, the associates of Krishna? How can we understand? So that is explained in this verse. So let's hear Srila Prabhupada's purport which will wonderfully, very nicely explain this particular verse. In the purport Srila Prabhupada says Srila Vishwanacharya Chakravarti Thakur, who is one of the previous Acharyas, he suggests that the rishis like Shaunaka and others who are hearing Srimad Bhagavatam from Suta Goswami at Naimisharanya were not happy to hear about the Yadus dying in the madness of intoxication. The sages of Naimisharanya, they are devotees, now they're hearing about other devotees and the Yadus as devotees, are they really fighting in the madness of intoxication and dying due to that fighting? So that is not very pleasing to hear for them. So here Srila Vishwanacharya Chakravarti Thakur explains that to give them relief from this mental agony Suta Goswami assured them that they will not

These must be the people who had come for knowledges. in this world in order to assist the Lord in his leela of reducing the burden of this world which is overburdened by asuras, by demons and to reduce that burden of the earth planet the Lord came along with his associates the members of the yadu dynasty. Now after the Lord had annihilated these demons the yadu dynasty itself remained in this material world and they could not be annihilated by anyone else and after their work was over after their role was completed of assisting the Lord in this material world to reduce the burden of the world then they are no longer required here so for them to return to their original position in the spiritual world the Lord made this arrangement that they kill each

other simply to give up their material bodies that's all. So Srila Prabhupada further explains this point: the Lord and his eternal associates appeared on earth to help the administrative demigods in eradicating the burdens of the world and to remove the burden of the world from the of the world. He therefore called for some of the confidential demigods to appear in the Yadu family and serve him in his great mission. After the mission was fulfilled the demigods by the will of the Lord relinquished their corporeal bodies by fighting amongst themselves in the madness of intoxication. Their material bodies anyway they have to give up after their work is over. Everybody gives up but how they give up? In their case it is by the arrangement of the Supreme Lord. It's not their choice. It's not their Karma. It is the arrangement of the Supreme Lord. So it is the will of the Lord. The demigods are accustomed to drinking the Somarasa beverage and therefore the drinking of wine and intoxication are not unknown to them. Sometimes they were put into trouble for indulging in intoxication. Once the sons of Kuvaira fell in the wrath of Narada for being intoxicated but afterwards they regained their original forms by the grace of the Lord Sri Krishna. This

We are still in the first canto. 10th canto this is explained this pastime of the Lord and how the two demigods the sons of Kuvaira were delivered by Krishna even though they were cursed by Narada they were delivered by Krishna. Now Prabhupada explains one important point here for us to understand. For the Supreme Lord both the Asuras and the demigods are equal. Why? Both of them are his part and parcels. All living beings in the entire creation are part and parcel of the Lord. mamaivamso jivaloke jivabhutasanatanah mama amsa they are my part. In the fourth chapter Krishna also says yena bhutanee aseshani drakshasi atmani ataumayee in the 35th of the sixth chapter that every living being is my part and parcel its mine belongs to me is in me Krishna says in the fourth chapter the Bhagavad-gita. So nobody is independent in their entire being. The Bhagavad Gita asks the personality to be independent of the lord nobody is separate from the lord means nobody is unrelated to the lord everybody is related connected as lord's own so that some of them are asuras and others are devatas does not mean that the asuras don't belong to krishna and the devatas alone belong to krishna no both of them belong to krishna so for the supreme lord both are equal same thing krishna says in bhagavad gita the ninth chapter the difference is however between the demigods and the demons or the devatas and asuras the demigods are obedient to the lord whereas the asuras are not obedient to the lord

### thorn analogy, agricultural experience, practical example

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "So then the person to remove that thorn takes another thorn and and uses that second thorn to actually clear the skin in the area where the thorn is pricked"
**Summary:** The speaker provides a detailed explanation of the thorn analogy, drawing on the practical experience of removing a thorn from one's foot in an agricultural setting.

therefore the example of picking out a thorn by another thorn is quite befitting the example that is given here is explained also by shrina pravpa what is this example one thorn which causes pinpricks on the leg of the lord is certainly disturbing to the lord and the other thorn which takes out the disturbing elements certainly gives service to the lord to understand this it's very common thing in in agricultural fields when somebody is walking barefoot and let us say because they're walking barefoot a thorn pricks the leg the bottom of the foot the sole of the foot then to remove that thorn sometimes may not be possible just by pulling it out because it is gone little deep inside so then the person to remove that thorn takes another thorn and and uses that second thorn to actually clear the skin in the area where the thorn is pricked and thereby making it easy to pull out the thorn with the second thorn the first thorn so this may not be um very much an experience of the city people who never have to walk barefoot who never have experience of a thorn pricking their leg but this is the most appropriate example in this instance

### asuras and devatas, Lord's protection, good to both, liberation

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Because whether he kills the asuras or protects the devatas, both are delivered by the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating the distinction between asuras and devatas, emphasizing the Lord's role in protecting the devatas and destroying the asuras, ultimately doing good to both by granting them liberation.

so Prabhupada explains although every living being is a part of the city as long as they owned some of theين parts and parcel of the Lord still one who is a pin prick to the Lord is called an hasura who is disobedient and unnecessarily gives trouble to others and one who is a voluntary servitor of the Lord is called a devata or demigod both are parts and parcels of the lord both belong to the lord but still one is called an asura another one is called the devata In the material world, the devatas and asuras are always contending. There is competition between them. And the devatas are always saved from the hands of the asuras by the Lord. Both of them are under the control of the Lord. Both the devatas and asuras, both. The world is full of two kinds of living beings. Krishna explains this in the 16th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. So, there are two kinds of created beings, the devatas and asuras. The Lord's mission is always to protect the devatas and destroy the asuras. Whenever there is such a need in the world and to do good to both of them. The Lord does. Good to both of them. Because whether he kills the asuras or protects the devatas, both are delivered by the Lord. The contact with the Lord is assured, guaranteed liberation. For whoever comes in contact, whichever way. So, Lord does good to both. He is not partial to the devatas. So, I will stop here. Thank you very much.

In this session we will be discussing from the 35th verse of the 15th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. Yatha Matsyadi Roopani Dhatte Jahyad Yatha Nataha Bhubharat Shapito Yena Jaho Tacha Kalevaram. The meaning of this verse is: The Supreme Lord relinquished the body which he manifested to diminish the burden of the earth. Just like a magician, he relinquishes one body to accept different ones, like the fish incarnation and others.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So impersonal philosophy is that God is impersonal, God has no transcendental personality no personality and the widest philosophy is God is void, shunya, formless, no form at all."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the impersonal and voidist philosophies, contrasting them with the Vaishnava understanding of God's personal form and Srila Prabhupada's role in countering these philosophies in the West.

This is another difficult verse to understand. The way the Lord appears and disappears in this material world in different forms is very nicely explained by Shri Lasuta Goswami in this particular verse. Shri La Prabhupada elaborates in the purport: The Supreme Lord, personality of Godhead, is neither impersonal nor formless. Shri La Prabhupada elaborates in the purport: Two theories, Maya vada and Shunya vada. And the prayer we offer to Shri La Prabhupada: Nirvishesha Shunya Vadi Pashchakya Deshat Aryane. Prabhupada has come, being empowered by the supreme Lord, for the sake of delivering, especially the western countries, which are filled with this impersonalism and voidism. So, impersonal philosophy is that God is impersonal, God has no transcendental personality, no personality.

**Key Quote:** "the Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead is not impersonal, he is not formless, but his body is non different from him."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the Vaishnava understanding of the Supreme Lord's eternal, blissful form, drawing from authentic scriptures and referencing Brahma Samhita.

And the voidist philosophy is God is void, shunya, formless, no form at all. So, the Vaishnavas, based on the authentic scriptures, explain and understand and realize the fact that the Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead is not impersonal, he is not formless, but his body is non-different from him. Our body is different from our self, Krishna's form or body is not different from his self. Therefore he is known as an embodiment, as the embodiment of eternity, knowledge and bliss.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "That Krishna's form or body is never material, though it may appear like that, it may appear like that, but it is not material, it is completely spiritual."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna's form is entirely spiritual, not material, and quotes the Brihad-Vaishnava Tantra to support this point, highlighting the differences between material and spiritual bodies.

This is the description of the Brahma Samhita. In the Brahad-Vaishnava Tantra, it is clearly mentioned that anyone who considers the form of Lord Krishna to be made of material energy must be ostracized by all means. What's the meaning of this? That Krishna's form or body is never material, though it may appear like that, but it is not material, it is completely spiritual. That means in that spiritual form there is no deterioration, there is no action of the gunas, there is no death, there is no birth, there is no disease, there is no pain, there is no blood, there is no flesh, there is no bones, there is no matter.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "he displays different kinds of forms suitable for the pastime suitable for the past so the pastime requires Krishna to display his form as a small child of mother Yashoda he displays that form"
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the apparent changes in Krishna's form during His pastimes, explaining that these are displays for the sake of the pastimes and do not affect His eternal, spiritual nature.

So, how to understand this? Because when Krishna performs his pastimes, he appears to take birth as a small infant, son of Devaki, then later son of mother Yashoda, and then he appears to grow from a small infant like ordinarily any child will grow up. But if there are changes in the body and the spiritual body is eternal without any change, then how do we understand that in spite of such changes, apparent changes, the Lord's body is completely spiritual, changeless, without deterioration? How do we understand this? So that is explained that for the sake of his pastimes he displays different kinds of forms suitable for the pastime. So the pastime requires Krishna to display his form as a small child of mother Yashoda, he displays that form. If it requires that he display the form of four-handed Vishnu in front of Devaki and Vasudeva to convince them that he is a supreme lord who has appeared as the son, he displays that form. That's all, he is what he is irrespective of what form he displays. This is the point.

**Summary:** The speaker continues quoting the Brihad-Vaishnava Tantra, warning against associating with those who consider the Lord's body material and emphasizing the need for purification from such contamination.

So therefore, the Brihadra Vaishnava Tantra says one should never consider the supreme lord's form to be made of material energy or material matter. It is not a material form. Our form, this form, is made of matter, therefore it has got blood and bones and it is subject to deterioration, it gets diseased sometimes, subject to death. This is material form, whereas Krishna's form is not material form. That's the thing asserted here by Srila Prabhupada quoting the Brihadra Vaishnava Tantra. Further, the Brihadra Vaishnava Tantra says if by chance the face of such an infidel is seen, one must clean himself by jumping in the river with his clothing. That means never hear or never consider that the Lord's body is material like our

body, no never. If you happen to hear from somebody who is an infidel, means he is a non-believer, he is a demon, he is a faithless materialist, then better you cleanse yourself, you cleanse yourself by taking bath in a sacred river because all such contaminations are obstacles on the path of progress in spiritual life. Therefore it is recommended like this. Śrīlāprabhu for further saraśaṉadnikaśyap. Yesterday the Lord's body was born, so Śrīla Prabhupada further says the Lord is described as amrita, or deathless because He has no amrita, deathless, so He doesn't have a material body. Only the material body is subject to birth and death. So what is it that is described as born? It is the body. Body is come to natürlich, body is born, body is changing, body is aging, body is becoming infected with disease, not the soul, not the spirit, not the real you. So please understand this

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a magician to explain how the Lord's apparent death or changes are like illusions, not affecting His true, eternal nature.

point. So further Srila Prabhupada says under the circumstances the Lord's dying or quitting his body is like the jugglery of a magician. This is proper explanation. The magician shows by his tricks that he is cut into pieces, burnt to ashes or made unconscious by hypnotic influences, but all are false shows only. I don't know if you have seen a, been to a magic show, especially the magic show in which the magician himself, he will make a demonstration. You can see that he's put inside one box and then he will call somebody from the audience and say I am in seven, I am inside the box completely closed from all sides, then you take one knife and slit the box into two and then separate the two halves of the box, okay. And then when this is done, after this is done, the magician will come out of one of the parts of the box as if he has not been cut at all. So these are all tricks that magician is performing to make it appear like he was in the box and somebody from the audience came and cut the box into two pieces while he was inside and then after that he comes out of the box intact without any cuts. The magician will remove the

**Summary:** Continuing the magician analogy, the speaker explains that the Lord's various incarnations, like the fish incarnation, are exhibitions of His eternal forms, not transformations.

No. So, it is all appearances, they are false shows. Similarly, just as the magician himself is neither burnt to ashes nor cut to pieces, nor is he dead or unconscious at any stage of his magical demonstration, similarly, the Lord has his eternal forms of unlimited variety, of which the fish incarnation was exhibited within this universe, which was exhibited in this universe is also one of them. So, Lord is not fish, neither is entering a fish body, he is coming in his original spiritual form as a fish, that is just exhibited. Because there are innumerable universes, somewhere or other the fish incarnation must be manifesting his pastimes without cessation.

So, just like Krishna appeared 5000 years back in this material world. So, when he appeared, the next moment Krishna is appearing in another universe as a small child. Meantime, in this universe what is happening, he appears to be grown up, he has been transferred to Mother Yashoda's house from Devaki's lap in the prison. So, in the other universe, after little time where he has appeared, he will again appear in another universe and in that other universe he will be transferred. So, his pastimes are continuously going on, it appears like here some changes are happening, but actually his Leela is going on, he is not changing.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the word 'dhatte,' meaning eternally accepted, to highlight that the Lord's incarnations are not temporary but eternal forms.

In this verse, the particular word dhatte, eternally accepted and not the word dhitva, accepted for the occasion is used. This is explained by the Acharya. Dhatte means eternally accepted, not temporarily accepting something. The idea is that the Lord does not create the fish incarnation, he eternally has such a form and appearance or disappearance of such an incarnation serves particular purposes. So, the Matsya Avatara, the personal form of the Lord, the incarnation of the personal form of the Lord, Swamsha, his personal form, he appears in different incarnations: Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha. Personal. So, these are eternal forms.

**Key Quote:** "They think that I am formless. And they also have a theory that I accept a form to serve a purpose. Because of which I am now manifested as a human being."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes verses from the Bhagavad Gita (7.24-25) to refute the impersonalists' view that the Lord is formless and only accepts forms temporarily, explaining that the Lord's true nature is concealed by His yoga maya from non-devotees.

These are not temporary forms. In the Bhagavad Gita, in 7th chapter, 24th and 25th verses, the Lord says, the impersonalists think that I have no form. They think that I am formless. And they also have a theory that I accept a form to serve a purpose, because of which I am now manifested as a human being. But such speculators are without sharp intelligence. Avyaktam vyaktimapannam manyantemam abuddhaya manyante. They think like that because they lack sufficient intelligence. Though they may be good scholars in Vedic literature, they are practically ignorant of my inconceivable energies and my eternal forms of personality, param bhavam ajananto, they do not know my eternal nature, my supreme eternal form and his energies, Krishna's energy, they don't know. The reason is that I reserve the power of not being exposed to non-devotees by my mystic curtain, naham prakasha sarvasya yoga maya sama vrittaha. I am covered by my yoga maya potency, therefore I am not manifest. Today I will stop here, thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 36th verse of the 15th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining that Kali Yuga fully manifested upon Krishna's departure, bringing inauspicious conditions.

In this session, we will be discussing the 36th and 37th verses of the 15th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 36th verse first.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna's departure from this world to his personal abode in his self-same form, not change of body."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna's departure was not a change of body like ordinary death, but a return to his eternal abode in his original form, contrasting material and spiritual realities and explaining that Kali's influence is limited to those with a poor fund of knowledge.

So Krishna's departure from this world to his personal abode in his self-same form, not change of body. This difference has to be noted. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says, "Death means change of body." Now here, Krishna is departing to his personal abode in the self-same form. He never changes his spiritual form. So eternally he is the Lord. But eternally he has his form. Eternally he has everything. He has his energies. He has his paraphernalia. He has his name. He has his qualities. He has his activities. Everything eternal. So this distinction should be understood between material name, material form, material paraphernalia, material activities, material possessions, material manifestation. Everything is temporary. Everything material is temporary. And everything spiritual is permanent, eternal, changeless. As long as Krishna was present, Kali could not manifest its actual characteristic of inauspicious conditions. But when Krishna left this earthly planet, from that very day, Kali manifested, became fully manifest. And the full manifestation means creating inauspicious conditions for those who are endowed with a poor fund of knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "The influence of Kali can be enforced only upon those who are not fully developed in God consciousness."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that those fully developed in God consciousness and engaged in pure devotional service are beyond the influence of Kali and the material modes of nature.

Prabhupada explains in the purport: The influence of Kali can be enforced only upon those who are not fully developed in God consciousness. So Kali, or for that matter even the material modes of nature, cannot act upon those who are fully developed in God consciousness. Krishna says this in the Bhagavad Gita: those who are engaged in pure devotional service in an unfailing manner, they are always on the spiritual platform, Brahma Bhuyaya Kalpate Guna Tita. They are above the three modes, above the influence of the three modes. And above the influence of the three modes also means above the influence of Kali because Kali acts in the material atmosphere through the three gunas.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes taking complete shelter of Krishna for protection from Kali, contrasting Krishna's transcendental reality with the illusory nature of the material world.

Prabhupada says further, one can neutralize the effects of Kali by keeping oneself fully under the supreme care of the personality of Godhead. Actually, Krishna is our only protector, only maintainer, and we should take complete shelter of Krishna through the proper method. Our material method will not work because Krishna is not a material personality. This material personality is a concoction, is a creation of the illusory energy, whereas Krishna's personality is beyond all material manifestations, beyond illusion, is a sent person reality, eternal reality. So take shelter of Krishna who always does give permanent eternal protection to everyone except those who turn away from him and are in the clutches of the illusory energy, except for them.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the age of Kali began after the battle of Kurukshetra, but its influence was suppressed by Krishna's presence, and upon his departure, ill omens appeared, indicating the full manifestation of Kali Yuga.

That's what Prabhupada is telling here. The age of Kali ensued just after the battle of Kurukshetra, but it could not exert its influence because of the presence of the Lord, because of the presence of Lord Krishna. The Lord, however, left this earthly planet in his own transcendental body, self-same form. That's what is said in this verse, his own transcendental body. And as soon as he left, the symptoms of Kali Yuga as were envisioned by Maharaj Yudhishthira prior to Arjuna's arrival from Dwaraka began to manifest. And Maharaj Yudhishthira rightly conjectured on the departure of the Lord from the earth even before Arjuna could come back with the actual news of the departure of Krishna from Dwaraka. Yudhishthira Maharaj, seeing the ill omens, conjectured that these ill omens are indicating Krishna's departure from this world. As we have already explained, the Lord left our sight just as when the sun sets it is out of our sight. Nothing happens to the sun when it sets, it is just disappeared from our vision, our sight.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the symptoms of Kali Yuga, including greed, falsehood, and violence, and contrasts godless, uncivilized people with God-conscious, civilized individuals.

The influence of the age of Kali began manifesting, and from authentic scriptures it is learned that the age of Kali still has to run on for 427,000 years. If I were to put it in the form of lakhs, the total duration of Kali is 4,32,000, out of which 5,000, if you deduct what remains, this balance is 427,000 years. So, the symptoms of the Kali Yuga as mentioned above, namely avarice, greed (avarice means greed), falsehood, diplomacy (diplomacy means duplicitous behavior), cheating, nepotism, violence, and all such things are already involved in the Kali Yuga. And no one can imagine what is going to happen gradually with further increase of the influence of Kali till the day of annihilation. We have already come to know that the influence of the age of Kali is meant for godless so-called civilized man. They call themselves civilized, but they are not civilized. They are godless. So, therefore they are uncivilized. God conscious or godly people are always civilized, are always properly behaving, properly acting, properly situated, have all the good qualities that are to be found in...

Yesyasti Bhakti Bhagavati Akinchana Sarvair Gunai Stratra Samasate Suraha. In fact, demigod means divine nature. So, divine nature means god conscious people, godly character as defined in the scriptures. This is not somebody's concoction. It is a definite description in the 16th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. The first three verses describe divine qualities, divine characteristics. Yesyasti Bhakti Bhagavati Akinchana Sarvair Gunai Stratra Samasate Suraha. Yesyasti Bhakti Bhagavati Akinchana Sarvair Gunai Stratra Samasate Suraha. And you can see each one of them is good quality, good qualification, good behavior. Those who are under the protection of the Lord have nothing to fear from this horrible age. Maharaj Yudhishtira was a great devotee of the Lord and there was no necessity of his being afraid of the age of knowledge. Yesyasti Bhakti Bhagavati Akinchana Sarvair Gunai Stratra Samasate Suraha. Maheraj Yuddhishtira was a great devotee of the Lord and there was no necessity of his being afraid of the age Kali but he preferred to retire from active household life and prepare himself to go back...

### retirement, spiritual realization, household life

**Key Quote:** "Before death comes one must retire from active household life or one must retire from material activities."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of retiring from material activities, including household life, to focus on spiritual realization and prepare for returning to Godhead, using Yudhishthira's example as a lesson.

Home, back to God. Yudhishthir is a pure devotee, so he doesn't have to actually do any preparation. He is always God conscious. So, but he wants to teach us before death comes, one must retire from active household life, or one must retire from material activities. Even if one is not a householder, even a brahmachari should retire from all material activities and prepare himself to go back home, back to God. So Yudhishthir Mahal is setting the example for us. The Pandavas are eternal companions of the Lord and therefore they are more interested in the company of the Lord than anything else. The eternal companions of the Lord always accompany the Lord in his mission in the material world. That's the meaning of eternal companions in this context. Besides that, being an ideal king, Maharaj Yudhishtira wanted to retire just to set an example for others. As soon as there is some young fellow to look after the family, then after the household affairs, one should at once retire from family life to uplift oneself to spiritual realization. One should not rot in the dark well of household life till one is dragged out by the will of yamaraj. So this is a lesson we should take from Yudhishthira Maharaj's behavior: don't remain in household life till the end of life in the body, before that quit household life.

### Yudhishthira Maharaj, Parikshit Maharaj, Responsibilities of a King, Human Form of Life, Spiritual Guidance

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Human form of life means a life of responsibility, and the king ensures that people take advantage of this human form of life by becoming very responsible."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Yudhishthira Maharaj handing over the kingdom to Parikshit Maharaj, emphasizing the king's responsibility to guide citizens towards spiritual realization and the importance of human life for understanding the difference between temporary and permanent.

In this session we will be discussing from the 38th verse of the 15th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. स्वराट् पौत्रं बिनैनं आत्मनः सुसमं गुनैहि तोय नीव्याः पतिम् भूमेर् अभ्यसिंचत् गजाह्वये The meaning of this 38th verse is: Thereafter in the capital of Hastinapura he enthroned his grandson who was trained and equally qualified as the emperor and master of all land bordered by the seas. So here is the description of Yudhishthira Maharaj retiring from active household life and he is handing over charge of ruling the world to his trained and qualified grandson, Parikshit Maharaj. Parikshit Maharaj was the only surviving descendant of the Pandava family of the Kuru dynasty. Everyone else was killed in the battle of Kurukshetra. So Yudhishthira Maharaj handed over charge to Parikshit Maharaj and he handed over charge as the emperor and master of all lands bordered by the seas, the whole world. He handed over charge of ruling the entire world to Parikshit Maharaj. Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "The total land on the earth bordered by the seas was under the subjugation of the king of the Kuru dynasty, the king of Hastinapura." This is the arrangement. The emperor of the world ruled from the place called Hastinapura. Hastinapura is modern day Delhi. Elsewhere Srila Prabhupada explains. So the capital was always in Hastinapura of the rulers of the entire world. There was subordination. There were subordinate kings and they had their smaller jurisdiction of province or state or some small kingdom, but they were always subordinate to the emperor. So that was actually the system, that there were different territorial kings who were protected by the emperor against any invasion by rogues and thieves and dacoits etc. So they used to rule the citizens very nicely according to the scriptural directions, according to the kshatriya dharma, the perfect system of administration given in the perfect scriptures, coming from the perfect source, the supreme personality of Godhead. So Srila Prabhupada further says, "Maharaja Yudhishtira trained his grandson Maharaj Pariksit, who was equally qualified in state administration in terms of the king's obligation to the citizens." Earlier Srila Prabhupada elaborately explained what were the obligations of the king to the citizens. The king had to essentially ensure that all the necessities were provided for the citizens so that the citizens can actually become responsible for preparing themselves to go back to Godhead after having achieved or after having received a human form of life. So human form of life means a life of responsibility and the king ensures that people take advantage of this human form of life by becoming very responsible, not that they are busy simply earning money or busy with some material activities, busy with some sense gratification, all under the influence of the illusory energy for some temporary effects. No. Human being means should understand the difference between the temporary and permanent, material and spiritual, body and soul, matter and spirit. Clear difference or distinction should be made and the human being has the developed consciousness or intelligence or brain substance to actually be able to do this.

### Bonafide Spiritual Master, Material World, Sense Gratification, Different Bodies, Conceptions of Enjoyment

**Key Quote:** "If I want to enjoy like a dog, I should get a dog's body."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the need for a bonafide spiritual master, describes the material world as an ocean of sense objects, and explains how different desires for enjoyment lead to different types of bodies, referencing the 15th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita.

Under proper guidance. Therefore scriptures say, approach a bonafide spiritual master who is self realized and who has seen the truth, who is conversant with the subject spiritual subject matter by having properly studied it under another bonafide spiritual master in discipline succession coming from Krishna. These things are all very clearly explained. So these are, that's a creature depending on the type of senses they have acquired, the material senses, there are sense objects and to give an example for a dog, a male dog, the form of the female dog is very attractive, is very attractive. For a male deer, the form of the female deer is very attractive. These type of illusory attractions are plenty in this material world. So one of our acharyas, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, says this material world is like vishaya sagara, an ocean of sense objects. Vishaya means something enjoyable by the senses. For the eyes it is all what we say as beautiful form, form, not form, forms, beautiful forms. For the ears it is sweet sounds. For the tongue it is palatable, tasty edibles and as you know different creatures have different things they consider as edible. For a hog, stool is very much relaxable and is an edible. It eats too. It eats rubbish. Camels eat thorns. And there are different creatures with different kinds of a sense of taste according to tongue they have acquired, according to their desire to enjoy eating or seeing or smelling or touching or hearing. This all simply centered around a concoction in the mind to enjoy materially in a particular way. The business of the living being in this material world, having acquired these material senses, centered around a material mind with a certain conception of enjoyment. Why these different types of bodies, different souls are getting in this material world? Because there are different conceptions of enjoyment. If I want to enjoy like a dog, I should get a dog's body. If I want to enjoy like a cat, I should get a cat's body. If I want to enjoy like a tiger, I should get a tiger's body. This is the whole principle of getting a material body. This is very nicely explained in the 15th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. Please read or study the 15th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita very systematically. Krishna explains this. I just quoted two verses, but it is very elaborately, nicely explained by Prabhupada in the translation and the purports of these verses in the 15th chapter.

### Guidance, Goal of Human Life, Material Existence, Kingdom of God, Chanting Hare Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Unless we approach a bona fide spiritual master after receiving such guidance, as to real goal of human life is to go back home, back to Godhead."
**Summary:** This segment stresses the importance of guidance from a God-conscious leader and a bona fide spiritual master to achieve the real goal of human life, which is to return to Godhead, and suggests that chanting Hare Krishna can awaken God consciousness and create the atmosphere of the kingdom of God on Earth.

So, unless we are guided by a God-conscious king, administrator, ruler, unless we approach a bona fide spiritual master after receiving such guidance as to real goal of human life is to go back home, back to Godhead, to get out of this material existence, which is temporary and filled with miseries, and go to that place where there are no miseries, which is full of bliss, which is permanent, eternal, abode full of bliss and knowledge. So, unless we receive proper guidance, we will waste our time. We will waste our time. We will waste our time. We will waste our time. We will waste our time. We will waste our time. We will waste our time. We will waste our time and our life only in pursuit of some temporary sense pleasures which are fleeting. So, it is specifically told Maharaj Pariksit was trained in state administration in terms of the king's obligation to the citizens. Thus, Pariksit Maharaj was enthroned on the seat of Maharaj Yudhishthira prior to Yudhishthira's departure back to Godhead. Now, concerning Maharaj Pariksit, one word is used, Vinayinam. The reason is, this Vinayinam means properly trained. He was trained to actually ensure the happiness of the citizens, which was due to the king's obligation to the citizens, which was due to ample production of natural produce, such as grains, fruits, milk, herbs, valuable stones, minerals, and everything that the people needed. They were even free from bodily miseries, anxieties of mind, disturbances caused by natural phenomena, and other living beings. So, this was the standard of administration when Yudhishthira Maharaj ruling, Pariksit Maharaj ruling. This was the standard. Because everyone was happy in all respects, there was no resentment. Although there were sometimes battles between kings, different state kings, for political reasons and supremacy. So, people were trained to attain the highest goal of life and therefore, they were enlightened enough not to quarrel over some trivial material things. So, the influence of Kali gradually infiltrated the good qualities of both the kings and the citizens and therefore presently we can see there is a tense situation developed between the rulers and the ruled, between the kings and the citizens or between the administrators and the citizens. But even today in this condition there can be spiritual emolument and God consciousness if people follow this program of Krishna consciousness simply by beginning with chanting Hare Krishna or chanting God's name, there can be God consciousness awakened in everyone and there can be the kingdom of God, the atmosphere of the kingdom of God even on this earth planet today now by awakening the God consciousness through simply

**Key Quote:** "So one must quit household life and become detached renounced from all household life attachments from all family attachments from all material attachments saw Srila Prabhupada"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of detachment and renunciation, emphasizing the importance of the Varnashrama Dharma system based on quality and work for real human life.

And one person who we have mentioned, and who has mentioned, everything is related to the Prajapatiya. They affect people, situating themselves. This flows in the way of wholesale. It is meant to be. So, if you remember that before, he had... It will be life, and for quitting household life, he has to actually become detached. Quitting does not mean go away from home and carry within the heart all the attachment for household life. No, that is not the way to quit. So, Srila Prabhupada explained this phrase, "placed in himself the fire for quitting household life." Prabhupada explains in the purport: "Maharaja Yudhishthira, after placing Maharaja Pariksit on the imperial throne of Hastinapura and after posting Vajra, the great-grandson of Lord Krishna, as king of Mathura, accepted the renounced order of life." So, one must quit household life and become detached, renounced from all household life attachments, from all family attachments, from all material attachments. So, Srila Prabhupada explains the system of four orders of life and four castes in terms of quality and work, known as Varna-ashrama Dharma, is the beginning of real human life. Varana ashrama for Varanas according to occupational characteristics, occupational duties: Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra, all are qualified differently according to the acquired nature. Sattvic people, Rajasic people, mixed Rajoguna and Tamoguna, and Tamsic people.

### Varnashrama Dharma, spiritual elevation, detachment

**Key Quote:** "So, human life, real human life means Varnashrama dharma."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the four Ashramas (Brahmacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha, Sannyas) as a system for gradual spiritual elevation, highlighting Yudhishthira Maharaj's example of retiring from active life and becoming detached.

So, they should work to maintain themselves for the sake of fixing the ultimate goal of life as self-realization. Not only for Brahmanas, not only for some people, it's for even the Shudras. It's for every human being within the Varnashrama system. Every human being. Four Varnas. And then four Ashramas. What are the four Ashramas? Brahmacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha, Sannyas. These four Ashramas are for gradual spiritual elevation. So, now Yudhishthira Maharaj is quitting household life in order to enter the stage where one completely dedicates his life for preparing for going back to Godhead, with no other responsibilities, no other duties, because all those responsibilities and duties have been handed over to the son or the grandson or somebody else younger. So, human life, real human life means Varnashrama dharma. This is explained in the scriptures. Maharaj Yudhishthira, as the protector of this system of human activities, timely retired from active life as a sanyasi, handing over the charge of the administration to a trained prince, Maharaj Pariksit. He became detached and renounced after handing over charge.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the importance of Varnashrama Dharma and the four Ashramas for achieving the ultimate goal of going back to Godhead, emphasizing that this goal is for every human being due to their developed intelligence.

So, Srila Prabhupada says further, "The scientific system of Varnashrama dharma divides the human life into four divisions of occupation and four orders of life." So, Srila Prabhupada elaborates what I just explained. The four orders of life as Brahmachari, Grhastha, Vanaprastha, and Sanyasi are to be followed by all, irrespective of the occupational division. If somebody is serious about going back home, back to Godhead, they should follow these divisions that are made in the ashrama system. Brahmachari means student life, and Grhastha means householder life, and Vanaprastha means retired life, and Sanyasa means renounced or detached life. So, these stages are natural and very scientific and progressive for somebody whose ultimate aim of life is to go back to Godhead at the end of this life. Before quitting the body, one has to prepare. Now, this goal is for every human being, because human being has developed, developed intelligence, developed consciousness, developed understanding, developed brain. That is the meaning of human life.

Now, relatively speaking, one may be more intelligent than the other in terms of some material calculation. But as far as spiritual development is concerned, spiritual advancement is concerned, all are eligible. All are meant for spiritual elevation. Of course, this has to be practiced under the proper direction of the bona fide spiritual master. You require spiritual guidance, not of any ordinary person, but one who is actually qualified, a bona fide spiritual master, Acharya. Therefore, you can see in our culture, in our tradition, there have been acharyas who have preached to the mass of people without discrimination: Madhvacharya, Ramanujacharya, Shankaracharya, and acharyas. So, Prabhupada is the acharya for our times.

And he travelled all over the world and preached to everyone, all sections of people in the society. Prabhupada was preaching to everyone tirelessly. He travelled, he wrote books, and he instructed his disciples who were dedicated for this preaching mission in assisting Srila Prabhupada to preach to everyone in the world. He was instructing them to translate these books into all the possible languages of the different parts of the world, because somebody may not be educated in English. So then, they can read their local language. So Prabhupada said, translate his books into the local language and distribute those books in those languages. So, Prabhupada's teachings, Prabhupada's instructions, Prabhupada's explanations are available in all the major languages of the world today. So, people can read that and learn from the devotees how to practice Krishna consciousness simply by beginning with chanting Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare.

Now, by chanting and associating with devotees and hearing or reading these books in their respective languages, people can actually awaken their dormant Krishna consciousness which is already there in everyone's heart.

**Key Quote:** "They can awaken their Krishna consciousness and actually start making progress simply by beginning with chanting"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna consciousness can be awakened through chanting and association with devotees, emphasizing the preciousness of the human form of life and the inherent inquisitiveness of children.

They can awaken their Krishna consciousness and actually start making progress simply by beginning with chanting and gradually becoming more interested in the spiritual subject matter which is appealing to every human being, especially every human being. Actually, it is meant for all living beings, all spirit souls in all forms of life. But, the human form is special, that every human being has already got the brain substance to understand the importance of spiritual life. Every human being has got it. Therefore, you can see the inquisitiveness in a child which is born in any type of family, any type of background, doesn't matter. The inquisitiveness is indicated when the child begins to speak. It begins asking all kinds of questions from the parents. Any child which begins to talk, any mother will testify to this. All mothers will testify that when it begins to speak, it keeps on asking questions, questions, questions. What is this? What is that? What is this? What is that? Why this? Why that? Now, which means that, now this is true for a child born of poor parents, rich parents, Indian parents, American parents, educated parents, uneducated parents. It's true for all children. That is why our scriptures say human form is very, very precious.

### Brahma Jigyasa, spiritual guidance, Prasadam, Krishna consciousness

**Content Type:** practical
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "That's the duty of the parents."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of directing children towards Brahma Jigyasa (spiritual inquiry), seeking guidance from an Acharya, and spiritualizing existence through chanting Hare Krishna and partaking Prasadam (food offered to Krishna), making Krishna consciousness accessible to everyone.

That's why the scriptures say that. So, that inquisitiveness, Jigyasa, should be directed towards Brahma Jigyasa. Athato Brahma Jigyasa. That's the duty of the parents. And the parents are actually meant to direct the child to the Acharya, to the bona fide spiritual master. And Acharyas preach to everyone how to begin spiritual life by chanting Hare Krishna and how to progress by simple, very, very simple practices: offering food and eat, partaking the remnants of Prasadam. Everybody eats. But then don't simply eat like animals. You take Prasadam and spiritualize your entire existence. Ahara Shuddhau Sattva Sattva Shuddhihi. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita by Srila Prabhupada. Ahara Shuddhau Sattva Shuddhihi. You take purified foodstuff, your existence itself, Sattva existence becomes purified. The entire body becomes purified. The mind becomes purified. The intelligence becomes purified. So it's so important that people be taught to chant Hare Krishna and offer the food they are eating to Krishna and then partake the remnants of such food offered to Krishna, Prasadam, Krishna Prasadam. This is possible for every human being irrespective of who they are, what their social status is, or what their economic condition is. It's possible for everybody, because everybody is eating something for their survival. So it's possible for everybody. They have to be properly directed, guided. Guidance is required. Now in taking guidance, there is no discrimination to be made. Even the most intellectually developed person also requires his guidance. And of course, those who are not so intelligent or those who are not so intellectually developed, they also require guidance. Everyone requires guidance. That direction is given by the Acharya. So simply by this, it's possible for everyone to become Krishna conscious and prepare themselves to go back home, back to God. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

Nirmamo Nirahankara. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, "To become purified of material contamination is the necessary qualification for becoming one of the associates of the Lord." What's the meaning of going back home, back to Godhead? We all belong to the Lord as His associates. So, for reinstating ourselves in our original position as the associate of the Lord, Lord Krishna, we have to acquire the necessary qualification, and that qualification is to become purified of material contamination. This association with material atmosphere or material nature has resulted in our developing different kinds of attachment in our heart towards so many material things, both gross and subtle. Grossly, we are attached to material objects: my car, my house, my table, my chair, my furniture, my clothes, my ornaments. And certainly, we are attached to social status, some honor in society, some respectability in some material hierarchy. All these kinds of gross and subtle material attachments, we have to become purified of all such contamination, should become detached materially. No one can become an associate of the Lord or can go back to Godhead without such purification. This is absolutely required, essential for

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on renunciation, referencing the saffron loincloth of a sannyasi and Maharaj Yudhishtira's giving up of royal garments.

everyone. Maharaj Yudhishthira, therefore, to become spiritually pure—spiritually pure means free from all material contamination—this spiritual purity at once gave up his royal opulence, relinquishing his royal dress and garments. So, Srila Prabhupada explains one specific aspect of renunciation in the vanashrama Dharma. Prabhupada says the kashaaya or saffron loincloth of a sannyasi indicates freedom from all attractive material garments. Sympathetically, when one takes sanyasa, then one receives a saffron loincloth. But that is actually indicative of something, not that everybody has to receive a saffron copium. No, it is indicative of freedom from all attractive material garments. We adore the body so much, or we are attached to the body so much, we decorate this body in so many ways, particularly the garments and, of course, the ornaments, garments and the ornaments, decorating this body. So, we have to give up those garments and ornaments and accept some simple clothing. And what did he do? The details will be explained. He actually gave up his royal dress and garments, and the next verse will tell that he dressed himself in some rejected, discarded, torn, old garments simply to cover the body, some simple cloth, any piece of cloth available which is not at all attractive, which is not at all

fashionable. So, he thus changed his dress accordingly. He became disinterested in his kingdom and family and thus became free from all material contamination or material designation. He had ruled as the emperor of the world, and in that position as the emperor of the world, he had his royal dress, he had his royal paraphernalia, he had his royal throne, he had his royal insignia, but it was required for ruling as the emperor of the world. But when he handed over charge, he no longer was keeping any of those garments or ornaments or any of the paraphernalia. Everything he gave up. In this way, he became detached from all those things. Also, it is important to understand becoming free from—it is to understand becoming free from material contamination also means becoming free from material designations. The definition of bhakti is very interesting. One of the definitions of bhakti: sarva upadhi vinir muktam. Bhakti means sarva upadhi vinir muktam. Upadhi means designation, to become free from all designations is the way

**Summary:** Various types of material designations, such as family, society, wealth, and titles, are identified as causes of attachment and bondage.

to actually practice bhakti and advance in Krishna consciousness. So, Srila Prabhupada explains here, "People are generally attached to various kinds of designations: the designations of family, society, country, occupation, wealth, position, and many others." We have different roles in our normal life, householder life, or family life with different roles. I am the head of some family. I am an important member of some society, or I am having a position in the country in the political administration or occupation. I may be an expert technocrat or expert skilled artisan or some very, very expert painter or whatever, or designation of wealth. Oh, he is a trillionaire, he is a billionaire, he is in Fortune 500 list, or in British society, they used to get this designation as lord and earl upon paying some huge amount of money to the government to get such titles. So many of these are the definitions of bhakti: sarva upadhi vinir muktam bhakti sarva upadhi. But too many such institutions are there which have hard according to the the wealth one possess or one can pay for getting such designations, titles. So, all these are designations which are the cause for our attachment and bondage in this material world. As long as one is attached to today's material world, such designations is considered materially impure. This is the material contamination. This is a material impurity. I am having designations. The so-called leaders of men in the modern age are attached by national consciousness, but they do not know that such false consciousness is also another designation of the materially conditioned soul. One has to relinquish such designations before one can become eligible to go back to God

head. All designations will become free. Then somebody might say that in the renounced order of life, somebody calls you Maharaj, addresses you as sannyasi, that's also a designation. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu teaches in this regard how even though you are not a saint, you are not a saint, you are not a saint, you are not a saint, you are not a saint, you are not a saint, you are not a saint. For the sake of renouncing, we accept the renounced order formally, but you can become detached even without formally accepting the renounced order, and you should understand that to renounce means to renounce even these designations and titles within the heart. What does Chaitanya Mahaprabhu teach us? Naham vipro na cha narapati na pi vaisho na shudro naham varni na cha grahapati no vanastho yatirva. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, "If you ask me who am I? I am not a Brahmana, I am not a Kshatriya, I am not a Vaishya, I am not a Shudra, I am not a Brahmachari, I am not a grahastha, I am not a vanaprasad, I am not a sannyasi." So, what does He mean by this? He means that we should not be having any designations and the associated respect and honor and kind of this thing in the society, honor in the society for every position within our heart. We should not have any of those expectations or any of those attachments or any of those false egos. We should not have any of those. Then if Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, "I am not a Brahmin, I am not a Kshatriya, I am not a Vaishya, I am not a Shudra, I am not a Brahmachari, Ghrastha, Vana, Prasad, Sanyasin. What are you?" Kintu Prodhyan Nikhil Paramananda Poonamrata Abder Gopi Bhartuhu Pada Kamalayor Dasa Dasa Anudasaha. "I identify myself only as a servant of the servant of the servant of the servant of the Supreme Lord Krishna who is the protector and maintainer of the Gopis." So, this is our constitutional position, this is our eternal position, this is our actual position.

**Key Quote:** "Everyone, every living being, we are eternally Krishna's servants or Krishna's devotees."
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by emphasizing that being a devotee of Krishna is our eternal position, and the role of a sannyasi is to disseminate spiritual knowledge without expecting anything in return, maintaining humility.

Everyone, every living being, we are eternally Krishna's servants or Krishna's devotees. Now, don't misunderstand the word servant. Servant means devotee. Devotee means devoted to serving Krishna out of love, that kind of servant, loving, devotional servant. And that's a very sweet relationship between each one of us and Krishna, eternal relationship. So, that is our actual position, and that is not a designation. That is what we are at the core of our heart. That's what we are. These material designations are external impositions on that eternal position. So that gets covered. I forget I am a devotee, and then I think in terms of the body or in terms of the social position in the society. So actually, even though I have accepted sannyas and people, they recognize me as a sannyasi, that's only for the sake of social interaction so that people understand that here is a sannyasi means here is a person whom I can approach for any spiritual guidance, any spiritual clarification, any spiritual knowledge without the sannyasi expecting anything in return, free of charge, without. Because sannyasi is renounced, he does not require anything. So, he will not charge you anything. He will not ask anything from you. His life is dedicated for simply disseminating this knowledge, this practice, this understanding, this important valuable lesson, this goal of life. That's why the dress. It's like a policeman performs his duty very nicely with a uniform. The policeman actually, as far as skill is concerned, his activity is concerned, he can do without uniform, but for people to be able to easily approach him for traffic guidance and in driving on the road. So, with a uniform, he can perform very easily his job. Similarly, a sannyasi with this uniform. Treat me with honor. No. Sanyasi, if he thinks like that, he's actually fallen. He's not qualified. He's not qualified. This is very important.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains that they will be using Srila Prabhupada's purport to understand it in a simpler way.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 41st verse of the 15th chapter of the 1st Canto, Sriman Bhagavatam: वाचं जुहाव मनसी तत् प्राण इतरेचतं मृत्याव अपानं सोच्छर्गं तं पञ्चत्वे ही अजोह वीत। What is the meaning of this verse? Then he amalgamated all the sense organs into the mind. Then the mind emulsified. Then the body into life, life into breathing, his total existence into the embodiment of the five elements, and his body into death. Then, as pure self, he became free from the material conception of life. The translation sounds very, very technical, but Srila Prabhupada very nicely explains all these terms in the purport. So let us go through the purport and try to understand this in a simple manner which Prabhupada explains.

### material conception of life, spiritual identity, relationship with Krishna

**Key Quote:** "Because the fact is, as spirit soul, I don't belong to this world. I belong to Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the material conception of life as identifying with the body and forgetting one's true spiritual identity and relationship with Krishna.

So the purport by Srila Prabhupada is as follows: Maharaja Yudhishthira, like his brother Arjuna, began to concentrate and gradually became freed from all material bondage. So, becoming free from material bondage means becoming free from the material conception of life. What is material conception of life? Actually, I am spirit soul, or you are spirit soul. Each person is spirit soul, but I wrongly think I am this body. I wrongly think I belong to this world, because the fact is, as spirit soul, I don't belong to this world. I belong to Krishna. I belong to Krishnaloka. I have a permanent, eternal, loving relationship with Krishna, but in my present condition, I have forgotten Krishna. I have forgotten that relationship. I have forgotten who I am. I have forgotten who is Krishna. I have forgotten what is my relationship with Krishna. I have forgotten the spiritual world, and by association with this material world, I identify I belong to this world. Because I have taken birth in a certain family, I identify I belong to this family. Now, this family itself, consisting of the family members, my mother, my father, my brothers, my sisters, my aunts, my uncles, my neighbors, my friends, my well-wishers, all this is developed around a false conception that I am the body.

**Key Quote:** "Without the body, there is no meaning to a relationship."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how material relationships are based on the false identification with the body and clarifies that becoming free from material bondage doesn't mean destroying relationships but understanding their relative importance.

You can easily understand. Without this body, is there any meaning to relationships? You just think about it. Without the body, there is no meaning to a relationship. So, all these relationships, my father, my mother, my family, or my friend, my neighbor, my relatives, everything is based on my conception that I am thinking I am this body. So, to become free from material bondage means to become freed from the wrong conception of the self, of who I am, and that is made possible by different methods of spiritual practice. Now, don't think that becoming free from material bondage is to completely destroy all our relationships, our responsibilities, our duties, our affection. No, it's not that. Please don't misunderstand that way.

**Key Quote:** "Because only in the human form of body, it is possible for me as spirit soul to hear, understand, I am not this body."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of the human form for spiritual realization and warns about the consequences of not overcoming the misconception of identifying with the body before death.

It is to understand in the correct way what is the relative importance of this body of mine, the relationships I have with my understanding as I am the body, with my parents, with my... Not to simply negate, but to understand the relative importance. There is a certain importance for this human form of body, because only in the human form of body, it is possible for me as spirit soul to hear, understand, I am not this body. So, the body is also important. In my present condition, body is important, but it doesn't have absolute importance because it's temporal. It's going to perish. It's not going to remain with me forever. So, before it perishes, I should actually come out of this misconception that I am the body. Otherwise, what will happen? Supposing I don't come out of the misconception, then I have to face death, which means I am forced to leave this body. What is death? I don't die. As spirit soul, I don't die. This you have heard many times in the Bhagavad Gita.

### devotional service, death, Yudhishthira's detachment

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Only a devotee, at the time of death, because he understands I am not the body, he is also able to understand now I am leaving the body."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how a devotee understands death and continues devotional service in the next life, then introduces Yudhishthira's specific process of detachment.

It's clearly explained. Only a devotee, at the time of death, because he understands I am not the body, he is also able to understand now I am leaving the body. And depending on Krishna, if I leave the body, then Krishna will guide me and take me to my next body and I continue my devotional service in my next body, provided I was engaged in devotional service in my previous body, and I have cultivated the desire to continue my devotional service even after quitting the body. So that's the devotional process. Now, as far as Yudhishthira is concerned, there is a technical difference in the process Yudhishthira Maharaj is actually employing for becoming detached. Let's hear what is Yudhishthira Maharaj doing. First he concentrated all the actions of the senses and amalgamated them into the mind.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "All our senses are centered about the mind. It is the mind which directs the senses."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how the mind directs the senses and how Yudhishthira is concentrating the actions of the senses into the mind to detach from material identification.

What is the meaning of this? All our senses are centered about the mind. It is the mind which directs the senses. You have heard this earlier. So if the mind is directing the senses, if the misconception around this body and based on the bodily actions of the senses, I try to derive happiness. I try to avoid suffering. I try to gather knowledge. I try to use my intelligence, etc, etc. So many things. Now, this has to be replaced with spiritual understanding of my spiritual self, spiritual intelligence, spiritual mind, spiritual senses, everything spiritual, which is inside. Not these material senses, material body, material mind, material intelligence. No, not this. This is a covering for the real mind, the spiritual mind, the spiritual senses, the spiritual intelligence, the spiritual self. It's a covering for all that. So to actually uncover, to remove the covering, to become free from the covering is possible, first of all, by concentrating all the actions of the senses and amalgamating means gathering them and mixing them with the mind, mixing them with the mind, so that these senses I no longer identify as my senses, these material senses.

**Key Quote:** "He turned his mind towards the transcendental service of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that detaching from material senses doesn't mean becoming senseless, but rather using spiritual senses and turning the mind towards transcendental service.

Then if I don't identify these material senses as my senses, then I become senseless? No! My spiritual senses are there, and I am using my spiritual senses through these material senses in my material condition. So stop using your spiritual senses through your material senses. That's what Yudhishthira is doing. So he doesn't want to anymore use his spiritual senses through his material senses. He doesn't want to use that. Similarly, so what does this mean in terms of devotional service? Prabhupada says, or in other words, he turned his mind towards the transcendental service of the Lord. He prayed that since all material activities are performed by the mind in terms of actions and reactions of the material senses, and since he was going back to Godhead, the mind would wind up its material activities and be turned towards the transcendental service of the Lord.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "when this material mind is turned towards transcendental service of the Lord, then the material mind will no longer be engaged in any material activities or material perceptions, material objects, nothing."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of gross and subtle bodies and how Yudhishthira is preparing to quit his body by spiritualizing his mind and cutting off attachments.

See, there is the gross body and the subtle body. The gross body consists of this gross senses of action and senses of perception, karmendya and jnanindya. The subtle body consists of the mind, material mind, material intelligence, and material ego. So, when this material mind is turned towards transcendental service of the Lord, then the material mind will no longer be engaged in any material activities or material perceptions, material objects, nothing, because now Yudhishthira has nothing to do with the material world. He is handed over charge. He is handed over charge to his grandson and to Vajra, Krishna's great-grandson, all the charge of ruling, and he is prepared to quit home after placing the fire of renunciation in his heart, deciding to become completely renounced, preparing for going back to Godhead. Why all this? Preparing for going back to Godhead, quitting this body. So before he quits the body, the attachments have to be cut off. All the links have to be cut off, which were established when he entered the body. So how they cut off the link? By spiritualizing this material mind, by engaging it in transcendental service.

**Key Quote:** "We're chanting Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, but you have to involve the mind in chanting Hare Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker connects Yudhishthira's process to daily practice, emphasizing the importance of mindfully chanting Hare Krishna to spiritualize the mind and engage in devotional service, concluding the session.

And that's exactly what we are doing every day. What are we doing? We're chanting Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, but you have to involve the mind in chanting Hare Krishna. Here, using the mind, mindfully chant, attentively hear, mindfully hear. So that way the mind turns towards the transcendental service of the Lord. The Harinama Japa, Harinama Kirtana, Hare, devotional service, Krishna Seva. That way the mind becomes spiritualized, and when the mind is spiritualized, there is no longer any need for me, a spirit soul, to utilize these material senses for any material activities. Even if I use the material senses, I'll use it only for devotional service. There was no longer any need for material activities, because he decided to stop all material activities. So I will stop here. We'll discuss this same verse more in the next session. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Then as pure self he became free from the material conception of life"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of Yudhishthira Maharaj's detachment and explains the meaning of a verse describing the process of withdrawing from material existence.

In this session, we will continue to discuss the four principles of the Bhagavad Gita. In the previous session, we had discussed the first half of the purport, and in this session, we will discuss the second half of the purport. Here is a little technical description of how Yudhishthira Maharaj actually cut off all the material attachments when he was preparing to actually go back home, back to Godhead, after relinquishing all his responsibilities by handing them over to his grandson and Krishna's great grandson. So, it was already explained, just to refresh your memory of that time, and we started to learn a little bit more about the verse itself: Vacham Juhava Manasee Tatprana Itareya Tam Mrityav Apanam Sotsargaam Tam Panchatve Hi Ajo Havit. The meaning of this verse is that then He amalgamated all the sense organs into the mind, the mind into life, life into breathing, and its total existence as an entire being, existence into the embodiment of the five elements, and his body into death.

**Key Quote:** "Spirit soul material world is a foreign place like a fish out of water"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the nature of material desires, the reason for our existence in the material world, and the incompatibility of the spirit soul with material existence.

Then, as pure self, he became free from the material conception of life. So, in the previous session, I had elaborately explained what is this material conception of life, and then to become free from this material conception is to give up all the wrong identifications with the material coverings for the real self, for this spirit soul. Our existence in this material world becomes possible because of all the material coverings that are possible, provided for the sake of material existence. Just like as spirit soul, we have spiritual senses, we have spiritual mind, we have spiritual intelligence, we have spiritual identity, we can perform spiritual activities. It is meant for living in the spiritual world now, but if we have to live in the material world, why have we got to live in the material world? Because we have material desires for enjoyment, and what are the nature of material desires for enjoyment? Independent enjoyment, separate from Krishna, or trying to lord over like Krishna the resources for our existence. So, all this is only possible in the material world: lording over, independent enjoyment, separate existence. All this is possible only in the material world, and spirit soul, material world is a foreign place, like a fish out of water. Can a fish survive outside of water? It's meant to live in the water.

**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain how Krishna fulfills our material desires by placing us in the material world and contrasts this with the bliss and freedom of the spiritual world.

Similarly, we are meant to live in the spiritual world as spirit soul, but if we want material enjoyment, if we... Krishna, just to fulfill our material desires, Krishna actually places us in the material world, and Krishna also arranges for all these material coverings which we use while living in the material world. Conversely, while drinking, you are not allowed to have material around you. You can... we too have the reasons why living in it by moving our behavior, it's in the way of your breathing. The tools we take, if you also smoked how to do it or that by moving your spirit, this body is a reality can produce it, can act out of it, can разбredit you can now see it's effecting on us because it's it's just me now. I am разделing my mind or understanding wrongly. Is it says that life is just that anybody are in environmental smoke, so we can no longer not delve into the physical self based in a safe selecting at all way but in a particular type of body. Now, if you want to go back to Godhead, now that you realized that I don't belong to this place, some way I didn't stay, but I really can't be happy, I really can't be fully satisfied and live there naturally with full freedom from all these material entanglements, freedom from all material entanglements. That is what awaits us in the spiritual world, full of bliss, full of knowledge, eternal life in loving relationship with Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Mind should wind up all material activities and be turned towards the transcendental service of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the difficulty of giving up material coverings, particularly the gross and subtle bodies, and emphasizes the need to redirect the mind towards transcendental service.

That is what is waiting for us, so you prepare yourself to go back to God and give up this material coverings. Now, giving up the material coverings is not as easy as trying to give up this covering that is a piece of cloth. I just remove this and just discard it. Now, the difficulty with this material covering called the gross body and the subtle body is that the gross gross body to some extent is easy to understand what is this gross body, but the difficulty is my thinking is without the gross body I am unable to work, I am unable to act, I am unable to live. Just like somebody unfortunately has got some problem because of which the hand is amputated, without the hand the person is handicapped, so much of difficulty in doing ordinary things. Similarly, not only the gross body, the gross senses, but also the subtle body, the mind, the material mind, the material intelligence. We can't think if we don't have the material mind. Why is that? Because my thinking is all material, my activities are material, I am dealing with material objects. Material objects I can hold with a material hand. I don't know how to use my spiritual hand to hold material objects. I do not know, neither it is it is practical or feasible. It is not meant. The spiritual hand is not meant to hold material objects. No, it's not required either for spiritual existence. It's meant for spiritual existence in association with Krishna. So, when you have to return to Krishna, then cut off all these attachments and free the soul from material entanglement. There's a whole process. So, how to give up all these material coverings, that's been described, and the previous session had already explained that mind should wind up all material activities and be turned towards the transcendental.

Then, actually, the activities of the mind cannot be stopped, for they are the reflection of the eternal soul. Actually, the material mind, we want to stop all material thinking, but that does not mean totally stop all activities of this mind. The present mind that we have. No. Because, it is the desire of the soul that is expressed through the mind. The activities of the soul are expressed through the material mind. So, therefore, Prabhupada says, the activities of the mind are reflection of the eternal soul. I am spirit. I am soul. I am eternal soul. So, the soul in the material world is reflected through the mind. Therefore, what has to be done is, the activities of the mind can be changed from matter to devotional service. So, there is a need to engage the mind differently. That's all. So, the material color of the mind is changed when one washes it from contaminations of life breathing, and thereby frees it from the contamination of repeated births and deaths.

**Key Quote:** "Begin with spiritual life. Let's say, just chant 108 times Hare Krishna every day."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how purifying the mind stops the cycle of birth and death and recommends starting with simple spiritual practices like chanting Hare Krishna to gradually increase spiritual engagement.

If you are having idea of a continuing material existence, then, when this body, the term of life, in this body is over, if I have to continue material existence, I have to get another material body. That's called repetition of birth and death. So, to purify this mind means to stop this repetition of birth and death. That means to end all activities of the mind, all plans for continuing material existence, or rather, change material existence to spiritual existence. Now, Srila Prabhupada says, one has to situate oneself in pure spiritual life. Therefore, we should practice. Therefore, we should practice. Begin with spiritual life. Let's say, just chant 108 times Hare Krishna every day. It just takes about 10 minutes. So, out of 24 hours in a day, 10 minutes at least, perform spiritual activity, whereby 10 minutes you are not engaging the mind in material activity. The mind becomes engaged in spiritual activity. So, this is a very important point. And gradually go on increasing the spiritual activity, thereby reducing the engagement of the mind in material activities. And by the time you retire from all your material responsibilities, you should have completely changed all your engagements of the mind from material to spiritual. It means go on increasing your spiritual activities

**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of Sadhana Bhakti, the 64 principles of devotional service, and emphasizes the importance of associating with dedicated devotees to learn how to manage material duties while minimizing material engagement of the mind, ultimately leading to liberation.

by which you engage the mind in spiritual life. Therefore, the program of Sadhana Bhakti is how to increase the activities that we perform through the body, words, and mind, more and more in devotional service. So, there are 64 principles of Sadhana Bhakti, different varieties of engagement in spiritual life. Why 64? Why so many? Because in different ways, we are engaging our body, words, and mind in material activities. So, if we have to spiritualize our engagement of the mind, we have to find different varieties of engagement for the mind through the body, through the words, and through the mind. So, therefore, there are 64 activities. And one by one by one, we should start adding those activities to our daily routine. Just like chanting Hare Krishna, then singing Hare Krishna, then offering food to Krishna, either a picture of Krishna or a deity of Krishna, accepting Prasadam after offering food, then reading the spiritual literature, Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavatam, hearing about Krishna's pastimes, like that. So many different engagements are possible and increase the engagements. Now, how do the engagements become more and more? When you associate with devotees who are already engaged in such spiritual activities, especially the devotees who are dedicated for Krishna Consciousness. Throughout the day, they are engaged in varieties of activities simply meant for engaging the mind in Krishna Consciousness. So, you also associate, you learn, you become interested, you become attracted. You also get some practical tips about how to manage your material duties, material responsibilities while minimizing the material engagement of the mind. You learn from the devotees. And in this way, the mind becomes purified. When the mind is purified, and that means the mind is constantly engaged in the service of the Lotus Feet of the Lord, then at the time of death, the mind will not produce another material body, but the mind will actually enable the soul to go back home, back to God. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Now, this is a highly technical description of how Yudhishthira Maharaj freed himself from all material attachments."
**Summary:** This segment introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam describing Yudhishthira Maharaj's detachment and sets the stage for understanding the process through Srila Prabhupada's explanation.

In this session we will be discussing from the 42nd verse of the 15th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Tritve Hutvacha Panchatvam Tachayi Katve Ajuhon Munihi Sarvam Atmani Aju Habid Brahmani Atmanam Avyaye. The meaning of this verse is, "Thus annihilating the gross body of five elements into the three qualitative modes of material nature, he merged them in one science, and then absorbed that science in the self, Brahman, which is inexhaustible in all circumstances." Now, this is a highly technical description of how Yudhishthira Maharaj freed himself from all material attachments. But Srila Prabhupada explains very nicely in the precepts.

**Key Quote:** "So the basic understanding is, I am not this body."
**Summary:** This segment explains the concept of Mahat-Tatva, the origin of material elements, and emphasizes the distinction between the living entity and the material body, mind, and ego.

How to understand this process that Yudhishthira Maharaj is applying. So in the precepts, Srila Prabhupada says, "All that is manifested in the material world is a product of the Mahat-Tatva Avyakta, and things that are visible in our material vision are nothing but combinations and permutations of such variegated material products." So the basic understanding is, I am not this body. And this body is one of the many different products of the material elements, which are generated at the beginning of the creation out of the material energy called Mahat-Tatva Avyakta. The material energy in its dormant condition, inactive state, is Avyakta. And when it is activated at the beginning of creation by the glance of Mahavishnu, it becomes Mahat-Tatva, the state in which the material energy becomes activated. Activated means the three gunas become, start working. And those three gunas, they interact with the Mahat-Tatva and produce so many material elements. And those material elements are combined to form this variegated material universe. Different products, different material elements, different objects, and different bodies, everything. So now, whatever we see in our material vision is nothing but the combination of different material objects or products. But the living entity is different from such material products. They are completely different from the body, from the mind, from the intelligence, from the false ego, from the material objects, varieties of material objects.

**Key Quote:** "It is due to the living entity's forgetfulness of his eternal nature as eternal servitor of the Lord, and his false conception of being a so-called Lord, that he is obliged to enter into the existence of false sense enjoyment."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the root cause of material existence as forgetfulness of our eternal nature as servants of Krishna and the false desire to be the Lord of material nature.

We are completely different from all that. Further, Srila Prabhupada says, "It is due to the living entity's forgetfulness of his eternal nature as eternal servitor of the Lord, and his false conception of being a so-called Lord, the Lord of material nature, that he is obliged to enter into the existence of false sense enjoyment." The very fundamental statement Prabhupada is making here to help us understand why this material existence, why this false sense enjoyment. It is because of our forgetfulness of our eternal nature. I am eternal. I am an eternal spirit soul. And as eternal spirit soul, I am eternal servant of Krishna, or servitor of Krishna, or devotee of Krishna, eternally. And also, not only I forget my eternal position as eternal devotee of Krishna, but I also have got a wrong conception that I want to be the Lord of material nature. I want to be the Lord. There is only one Lord, that is Krishna. Material nature, spiritual nature, living entities, everyone, everything. Krishna is the only Lord. Ekala, Eeshwara, Krishna. Nobody else is Lord. All others are very, very, very tiny, insignificant living entities. So this tiny living entity simply foolishly desires, says, I want to be the Lord of material nature. Then you are forced to enter into the existence of false sense enjoyment.

### material energies, mind affected, gross body, three modes of material nature

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Our actual mind is materially affected because of which there is a need for so many different material products to be generated to give us the facility for the mind to be materially affected."
**Summary:** This segment explains how the mind becomes materially affected, leading to the generation of the gross body and the need for material facilities, and how Yudhishthira Maharaj reversed this process.

Why false? Because it is a concoction for your sake. It is temporarily created and enabled. So, Prabhupada next says, "Thus, a concomitant generation of material energies is a principal cause of the minds being materially affected." Our actual mind is materially affected because of which there is a need for so many different material products to be generated to give us the facility for the mind to be materially affected. Thus, the gross body of five elements is produced. Birth means what? A gross body of five elements, combination of five elements, is produced in the mother's womb. Actually, there is no need of this gross body if we are not having any material engagement. For spiritual life, there is no need. But our present condition is material life. So for that, this is necessary. So Prabhupada explains, Maharaj Yudhishthira reversed the action and merged the five elements of the body in the three modes of material nature. The beginning of creation, the three modes of material nature combined, interacted, and produced the different bodies. Now, this body which is generated by the combination of the three gunas, interaction, it has to be reversed so that the body will go back to the three gunas. The qualitative distinction of the body as being good, bad, or mediocre is extinguished. When the body is dismantled, then there is no question of whether the body is good or bad or it is in between.

**Key Quote:** "When one is thus inclined to become an associate of the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, in one of the innumerable planets of the spiritual sky, especially in Goloka Vrindavana, one has to think always that he is different from the material energy."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the irrelevance of judging the body as good or bad and emphasizes the need to detach from material energy and focus on one's spiritual identity to become an associate of the Lord.

So, we know that the body sometimes when it is in a healthy condition, a very nice body. The same body when it becomes diseased and gives us pain or suffering, or I don't like this body. Or identifying the body with some possessions, I have so many different varieties of things to enjoy, a very nice body. But if I don't have many things that I desire to enjoy with, then this body is not a very nice body. Like that, we have our own conception of body being good, bad, or mediocre. But all these are irrelevant, these distinctions between different types of bodies, when the body itself, we think is unnecessary, un-artha, superfluous. It is unwanted, unwanted. Then when the body is unwanted, then the body becomes merged in the material energy. That means body means the elements, body is transformed into the elements. And the elements become, go to the reservoir of all the elements. When one is thus inclined to become an associate of the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, in one of the innumerable planets of the spiritual sky, especially in Goloka Vrindavana, one has to think always that he is different from the material energy. The whole thinking process has to completely change no more thinking in terms of material body, material enjoyment, material activities, material relationship, none of those. So one has to always think that I am different from the material energy, I am completely spiritual.

### pure spirit, spiritual training, freedom from material relations, servant of the Lord

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So one has to always think that I am different from the material energy, I am completely spiritual."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes realizing oneself as pure spirit, equal in quality to the Supreme Lord, and how spiritual training helps achieve freedom from material relations and engagement, allowing one to act as a servant of the Lord.

He has nothing to do with the material energy and therefore he has to realize himself as pure spirit. Spirit is always pure but I think otherwise. So that thinking has to change, has to completely be completely absorbed in the thought of I am pure spirit. And as pure spirit I am qualitatively equal with the Supreme Brahman or the Parameshwara or the Supreme Lord, Krishna. Then by such thought process which is possible by training, by spiritual training, Prabhupada further explains Maharaja Yudhishthira after distributing his kingdom to Pariksit and Vajra, did not think himself the emperor of the world or head of the Kuru dynasty. See when he gave away charge, he is no longer thinking I am the emperor or I have got to do anything with ruling the kingdom. Because training, handing charge, everything is over. Pariksit is fully ready to take over. And he is taken over also when Yudhishthira Maharaj is handed over. Now Yudhishthira Maharaj is not going to worry or be concerned how he is going to rule, what if he makes a mistake, what if he wants advice, nothing. Because his job is over, his business is over, he is only thinking of going back to Godhead. This sense of freedom from material relations as well as freedom from the material engagement of the gross and subtle encirclement makes one free to act as a servant of the Lord even though one is in the material world.

**Key Quote:** "So this is complete freedom to act as servant of Krishna, devotee of Krishna and for that the spiritual senses, the spiritual mind, the spiritual intelligence is very much required and is there as the devotee, as a pure devotee."
**Summary:** This segment explains that freedom from material entanglement can be achieved even before death by handing over responsibilities and engaging in devotional service, leading to a liberated stage known as Jeevan Mukta.

Now it is not that exactly when death comes and obviously I have to leave this body, only then I become free from this body. No, even before death comes. If I hand over charge of all my material duties and responsibilities to someone else, a younger person, then by engaging completely in devotional service, I get a freedom from all material relationships. All material relationships I get freedom, no more material relationships. Then freedom from the entanglement or imprisonment in the material gross body of the five elements. The body is there but I have no need for this body, neither I am concerned with any activities of this body, nor the activities of the material mind or the material intelligence, not required. Though they are there, before death they are there, but I don't require to use them, I don't require to engage them, no. So this is complete freedom to act as servant of Krishna, devotee of Krishna and for that the spiritual senses, the spiritual mind, the spiritual intelligence is very much required and is there as the devotee, as a pure devotee. It is there. So this is called liberated stage, even in the material world, Jeevan Mukta. And Yudhishthira Maharaj actually attained that. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces and translates Srimad Bhagavatam 1.15.43, describing Yudhishthira's renunciation of material life.

In this session, we are discussing two verses, the 43rd and the 44th verses of the 15th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. So, to begin with, the 43rd verse: Chiravasa Niraharo Baddhavan Mukta Murdha Jaha Darsayan Atmano Rupam Jadonmatta Pishachavat Anavekshamano Niragad Ashranvan Badhiro Yatha. The meaning of this verse is, after that, Maharaj Yudhishthira dressed himself in torn clothing, gave up eating all solid foods, voluntarily became dumb, and let his hair hang loose. All this combined to make him look like an urchin or madman with no occupation. He did not depend on his brothers for anything, and just like a deaf man, he heard nothing.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the meaning of the verse, emphasizing the importance of detaching from material activities and engaging in devotional service, explaining Yudhishthira's actions as a way to avoid material distractions.

So, these are all the verses. These are all different steps towards totally becoming materially free. Freedom from material entanglement, material engagement, material activities. Completely stop all that. And do what? Fully engage only in devotional service. We don't require any of these material activities. We don't require any of these facilities or material senses or material anything. Don't require. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains – Thus being freed from all external affairs, Yudhishthira Maharaj had nothing to do with imperial life or family prestige. And for all practical purposes, he posed himself exactly like an inert mad urchin and did not speak of material affairs. Basically, now he doesn't want to be bothered by anybody for anything material. He himself has cut off from all material engagements, but he doesn't want other people, as long as he's living in the body before he quits the body, doesn't want other people to come and bother him with some material things. So, so let others will not bother him, he was dressed in torn clothing, and he posed as if he is a mad person, some street vagabond simply roaming aimlessly, there's nothing to do, so who will even approach him or think of talking to him or asking him or associating? Nobody will bother.

**Key Quote:** "as long as there is any material relationship or material connection always there is the factor of fear"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the concept of fear in the material world and how spiritualization leads to freedom from fear, highlighting the incompatibility of the spirit soul with the material atmosphere.

They'll rather keep distance, oh, some mad man, better I stay away from him. He had no dependence on his brothers who had all along been helping him. See, when Yudhishthir Maharaj is ruling, he was in family life, so his brothers were assisting him, his brothers were strategizing with him, discussing with him, but all that completely stopped. No more any dependence on brothers or any connection with brothers, nothing. This stage of complete independence from everything is also called a purified stage of fearlessness, purified stage of fearlessness. As long as there is any material relationship or material connection, always there is the factor of fear. Fear in this material world is only due to the material existence. It's called the, it is the second kind of atmosphere in which the pure spirit soul is placed, for an atmosphere incompatible. Spirit soul is meant to live in the spiritual world, spiritual energy in spiritual atmosphere, but the spirit soul is placed in material energy, material atmosphere, material world, it's incompatible, so immediately what happens? Fear. So the purified stage where one is completely spiritualized is freedom from all fear, no material existence, that is complete freedom from all fear.

**Key Quote:** "towards the north, treading the path accepted by his forefathers and great men, to devote himself completely to the thought of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces and translates Srimad Bhagavatam 1.15.44, explaining Yudhishthira's journey north and his devotion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, addressing potential questions about his seemingly strange behavior.

44th verse, 44th verse, 44th verse translation is as follows: the 44th verse, você empezou go para, towards the north, treading the path accepted by his forefathers and great men, to devote himself completely to the thought of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And he lived in that way wherever he went. So in the Purport, Shrila Prabhupada says, it is understood from this verse that Maharaja Yudhishthira followed in the footsteps of his forefathers and the great devotees of the Lord. We have discussed many times before that the system of Varnashrama Dharma, as it was strictly followed by the inhabitants of the world, specifically by those who inhabited the Aryavarta province of the world, emphasizes the importance of leaving all household connections at a certain stage of life. Aryavarta means the tract of land which is now called India, between the Himalayas and the Indian Ocean. This tract of land, India, what we now call India. So this is Aryavarta. And people who inhabit, live in this place, their culture was in the past to leave all household connections at a certain stage of life to completely free oneself from material entanglement, prepare oneself for going back to Godhead. The training and education was so important, and thus a respectable person like Maharaja Yudhishthira had to leave all family connection for self-realization and going back to Godhead. Now somebody may wonder, Yudhishthira was such a respectable person as the emperor of the world, he is dressing in tone clothing and he is acting as a madman. So what's gone wrong with this person? Why is he doing this? Why is he doing that? If somebody recognizes him, oh, he is the same person who was the emperor, now he is like a mad urchin. What has happened to him? Something has gone wrong with his mind, he has become deranged, mentally deranged. No, it is necessary for becoming free from all material entanglement.

**Key Quote:** "No king or respectable gentleman would continue family life till the end."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Vedic culture and the importance of detaching from family life for self-realization, mentioning the stages of spiritual development: Brahmacharya, Grahastha, Vanaprastha, and Sannyas.

For self-realization, for going back to Godhead, this is a necessary step. So Srila Prabhupada further explains the culture, the Vedic culture. No king or respectable gentleman would continue family life till the end. Till the end means till death comes. No respectable person will continue to live in the family atmosphere. It cannot be possible, who knows, he would keep at that side, might abandon carbohydrates to the end, very simply because of somebody's jumpscare. Take theala pie. We sing Geeta M standalone. Estabs the whole body to late a time, if we listen to some kind of music for the duration of life, after that even the lived persons watch the body to death at 9 pm, and right away the body of the physical body is rock solid just like that of Mr. Narayan Rami, Opportunity valuable opportunity in the uniform of life to free himself from material entanglement. So therefore it's considered suicide. In order to be free from all family encumbrances and devote oneself sent person to the devotional service of Lord Krishna. This system is always recommended for everyone because it's the path of authority. See, it is different stages of spiritual development: Brahmacharya, Grahastha, Vanaprastha, Sannyas. Now Brahmacharya is a student life, and Grahastha is the householder life. After this householder life, before death comes, Vanaprastha, freeing oneself from all material restlessness, responsibilities, and duties, and going away from family comforts, separating oneself from all family comforts and family life, so that one can completely devote oneself fully for devotional service of the Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "That one must become a devotee of the Lord at least at the last stage of one's life"
**Summary:** The speaker quotes the Bhagavad Gita, emphasizing the importance of devotion to the Lord, especially in the last stage of life, and explains that 'Brahmaparam' refers to Lord Krishna.

Complete engagement. Now Prabhupada quotes the Bhagavad Gita. The Lord instructs in the Bhagavad Gita in the 18th chapter, 62nd verse, that one must become a devotee of the Lord at least at the last stage of one's life. A sincere soul of the Lord like Maharaj Yudhishthira must abide by this instruction of the Lord for his own interest. Now earlier it was described, Yudhishthira Maharaj also turned towards the Lord, the instructions of the Bhagavad Gita, which Krishna instructed not only Arjuna but the whole world. So Yudhishthira Maharaj also turned towards the Bhagavad Gita instructions of the Supreme Lord, in which it is said that at least the last stage of one's life, one must become a devotee of the Lord. Of course, Yudhishthira Maharaj was a devotee all through, but to set an example, he is teaching how one must renounce all material attachments and become devoted to devotional service of Krishna. The specific words Brahmaparam indicate Lord Sri Krishna. In this verse, Hrithi Brahmaparam Dhyayan, he is meditating completely or thinking completely of Brahmaparam Dhyayan. What does Brahmaparam mean? Prabhupada says it specifically means Lord Krishna. Now this is corroborated in the Bhagavad Gita 10.13, when Arjuna with reference to great authorities like Asita, Devala, Narada, and Vyasa says Krishna is Parabrahman or Brahmaparam. What does Arjuna say in the Bhagavad Gita? Param Brahma Paramdhama Pavitra Paramam Bhavan. Krishna, you are the Parambrahma. You are the Brahmaparam.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna you are the Parambrahma You are the Brahmaparam"
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain how Arjuna identifies Krishna as Parabrahman, supported by other great authorities, and concludes by reiterating Yudhishthira's devotion and journey towards the north.

And Arjuna is telling, it is not just that I am declaring, because somebody may think Arjuna is Krishna's friend, so he will glorify Krishna, he will flatter Krishna, he will eulogize Krishna. No, Arjuna says, Ahustvam Rishya Sarve Devarishi Narada Sthatha Asito Devalo Vyasa Swayam Chaivam Bravishime. Arjuna is telling, not only I am declaring that you are Parabrahman, it is also so described by Devarishi Narada. He is one of the greatest authorities in the ancient times, in the Vedic times. He declares Krishna is the Supreme Brahman. And Asita, Devala, Vyasa, all the great sages who are Vedic authorities, they all declare Krishna to be the Supreme Brahman. Thus Maharaj Yudhishthira, while leaving home for the north, constantly remembered Lord Sri Krishna within himself, following in the footsteps of his forefathers as well as the great devotees of old times. So he absorbed his mind completely in thinking only of Krishna. And that is what Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, Man Mana. Yudhishthira Maharaj cut off all material connections and began to think of Krishna and proceeded towards north in what we say as Mahaprastha. This will be further described in the next verse. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

So in the purport Shri Lapa Prabhupada says, "The younger brothers of Maharaj Yudhishthira were already obedient followers of the great emperor, and they had sufficiently been trained to know the ultimate goal of life." So in the former times, the brahmanas, the kshatriyas and the vaisyas, the upper three sections of the society, they received systematic training in a gurukul from the teacher. The teacher would teach about spiritual and material knowledge. Material knowledge was meant for their livelihood, and spiritual knowledge was meant for their ultimate goal of life. So this ultimate goal of life is very important. Even nowadays there is training, there is education, but only in terms of how to keep this body fit for living in this world. There is no training for understanding that we are spirit souls, we belong to the spiritual world, we have to prepare for stopping the cycle of birth and death, we should prepare for going to the spiritual world.

**Key Quote:** "Srila Prabhupada many times says that in India, in the Vedic culture, even the most illiterate person in a remote part of any village will know that I am not this body, I am spirit soul."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how even the lower classes in Vedic society were aware of the ultimate goal of life, contrasting this with the ignorance of modern educated individuals regarding the nature of the self.

But formerly, all of them used to be trained in this. So not only the brahmanas, kshatriyas and vaisyas, even the shudras, though there was no training in a gurukul, in their homes, they would be following the elders and the general population was guided by the brahmanas as to what are their duties, material duties, spiritual duties. Everyone had to perform their material and spiritual duties as guided by the brahmanas, who were strictly following the directions of the shastras given by the Supreme Lord Krishna for the whole civilized human society. So everyone knew the ultimate goal of life. Srila Prabhupada many times says that in India, in the Vedic culture, even the most illiterate person in a remote part of any village will know that I am not this body, I am spirit soul. Will know that I am eternal. Will know that my goal is to get out of the cycle of birth and death. Will know that he has to actually perform his material and spiritual duties in order to get out of the entanglement of material existence. Everybody knows, everyone. And today there are so many so-called educated philosophers, scholars, scientists, but they do not know I am not the body, I am spirit soul. They do not know that. They do not know about material entanglement.

**Key Quote:** "So what is the spiritual duty of everyone? Simply to render devotional service to Lord Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the spiritual duty is to render devotional service to Krishna, simplified in this age by chanting Hare Krishna, and discusses the Vedic injunction to retire from family life for self-realization.

So here it is clearly said the younger brothers of Maharaja Yudhishthira were already obedient followers of the great emperor and had sufficiently been trained to know the ultimate goal of life. Therefore they decidedly followed their eldest brother in rendering devotional service to Lord Krishna. So what is the spiritual duty of everyone? Simply to render devotional service to Lord Krishna. That's all. It's very simple. And it has been further simplified in this age by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu that to render devotional service to Lord Krishna means to simply chant Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. This can be done by anybody. It doesn't require any qualification. It is not difficult. It is very very easy. So Sri La Pravapada further says according to the principles of Sanatana Dharma one must retire from family life after half the duration of life is finished. Panchashodram vanam vrajayet. This is the Vedic injunction and must engage himself in self-realization. You see. Engage oneself in self-realization in spiritual activities. But the question of engaging oneself is not always decided. What will they do after becoming retired? So Sri La Pravapada says sometimes retired men are bewildered about how to engage themselves for the last days of life. They don't know what to do. They sometimes think it is very boring to sit and chant all the time or to sit and read some scriptures or do some Deity worship. Oh it's very boring.

Sri La Pravapada says, "Here is a decision by authorities like the Pandavas. All of them engage themselves in favorably culturing the devotional service of the Lord the Supreme Personality of Godhead." You see. They had trained, they had been trained and they were engaged before retiring, they were engaged in devotional service. So they continued their devotional service with greater emphasis because they are freed from material responsibilities. So further Sri La Pravapada says, "According to Swami Shridhara he is the original commentator on the Srimad Bhagavatam Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha or fruitive activities philosophical speculations and salvation as conceived by several persons are not the ultimate goal of life." See this is something we have to carefully understand. Why is it being said that Moksha even Moksha is not the ultimate goal of life. Why? Because Sri La Pravapada says they are more or less practiced by persons who have no information

And the Pandavas were intelligent enough to follow it without hesitation. Krishna is the ultimate goal of life. Maamey vaisyasi Maa manusmara Madhyaji Maam namaskuru Bhavamad bhakto Matkarmakrth Matparamo. See all the Bhagavad Gita statements clearly indicate Krishna to be the ultimate goal.

The 46th verse te sadhukrtha sarvartha nyatavya atyantikam atmanah manasa dharayam asuhu vaikuntha charanam bujam. The translation of this 46th verse, "They all had performed all the principles of religion and as a result rightly decided that the lotus feet of the Lord Sri Krishna are the supreme goal of all. Therefore they meditated upon his feet without interruption." You see the ultimate goal of life is clearly indicated here.

**Key Quote:** "Arjuna, even though he knew that this was a fair battle for a just cause, still, when it came to actually killing his own kinsmen, he hesitated."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Arjuna's hesitation to kill his kinsmen as a sign of being a pure devotee, naturally kind and soft-hearted, and averse to sinful activities.

This is very evident that Arjuna was hesitating to kill his kinsmen even though they were so unjust. They were so corrupt. They troubled the Pandavas in so many ways, the Kauravas. But Arjuna hesitated to kill them because Arjuna is the pure devotee. Pure devotees never do any sinful activity. If there is even the slightest doubt whether they are acting sinfully or not, they refrain if they even have the slightest doubt that they may be indulging in sin. So Arjuna, even though he knew that this was a fair battle for a just cause, still, when it came to actually killing his own kinsmen, he hesitated. And he told Krishna, I cannot kill my kinsmen. So Srila Prabhupada says, that is because he is a pure devotee of the Lord. He is kind and soft-hearted. A pure devotee of the Lord is naturally endowed with all good qualities.

**Key Quote:** "This is very significant that the Pandavas went back to Godhead in the self-same body."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces verses 47 and 48 of the 15th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining that pure devotees like the Pandavas can attain the spiritual sky and even return to Godhead in their same bodies due to their constant devotional remembrance of Krishna.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet In this session we will be discussing from two verses, 47 and 48, of the 15th chapter of the first canto, Srimad Bhagavatam. Tadhyana Udriktaya Bhaktiya Vishuddha Dhisana Pare Tasmin Narayana Pade Ekanta Matayogatim Avapur Duravapamte Asadbhir Vishayatmabhihi Vidhutakalmashasthanam Virajena Atmanayivahee The meaning of these two verses is given together: Thus, by pure consciousness, due to constant devotional remembrance, they attain the spiritual sky, which is ruled over by the spiritual sky, and by the supreme Narayana, Lord Krishna. This is attained only by those who meditate upon the one supreme Lord without deviation. This abode of the Lord Sri Krishna, known as Goloka Vrindavana, cannot be attained by persons who are absorbed in the material conception of life. One of us, being completely washed of all material contamination, attained that abode, in their very same bodies. This is very significant that the Pandavas went back to Godhead in the self-same body. Generally, at the end of life, we quit this body. We leave behind this material body. Even those who go back to Godhead, generally, leave the material body behind. But the Pandavas, in the self-same body, they went back to Godhead, because they were purified of all material contamination by constant devotional remembrance of Krishna. This is the situation of the pure devotees: constantly thinking of Krishna, constantly engaged in Krishna's service, pure devotional service, no tinge of any material sense gratification in any of their activities. Such devotees' bodies are all spiritual. They are not material.

**Key Quote:** "Srila Jiva Goswami says, a person freed from the three modes of material qualities, goodness, passion and ignorance, and situated in transcendence, can reach the highest perfection of life without change of body."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Jiva Goswami and Sanatana Goswami, explaining that freedom from the three modes of material nature and engaging in pure devotional service under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master allows one to attain perfection and even the status of a twice-born brahmana.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains this point in the purport. According to Srila Jiva Goswami, a person freed from the three modes of material qualities, namely goodness, passion, and ignorance, and situated in transcendence, can reach the highest perfection of life without change of body. This is the explanation of one of the previous Acharyas, Srila Jiva Goswami. He is one of the six Goswamis of Vrindavan, the direct disciples of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Srila Jiva Goswami says, a person freed from the three modes of material qualities, goodness, passion, and ignorance, and situated in transcendence, can reach the highest perfection of life without change of body. So generally we are engaged in one of the three gunas, because we are influenced by the gunas, the material modes. So our actions are either sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic, or a combination of one or more of these qualities. So we have material activities and material reactions, which bind us to this world. Now those who are freed from these three qualities, because they are constantly engaged in the pure devotional service, Krishna explains this in the Bhagavad Gita, as Srila Prabhupada will quote later, this very verse, that one who is engaged in pure devotional service, without deviation, such a person is completely free from the influence of all the three gunas. All actions of such a person are completely transcendental. And further, Srila Prabhupada quotes Sanatana Goswami. What does he say? Srila Sanatana Goswami in his Haribhakti Vilas says, that a person, whatever he may be, can attain the perfection of a twice-born brahmana by undergoing the spiritual disciplinary actions under the guidance

of a bona fide spiritual master. yatha kanchanatam yati kamsyam rasa-vidhanatah tatha deeksha-vidhanena vijatvam jayate nirunam rasa-vidhana and deeksha-vidhana This is a comparison made by Srila Sanatana Goswami, that just like the bell-metal can be turned into gold by chemical manipulation, by treating it with an alchemical process using mercury, rasa-vidhana. Similarly, any person from any material background, how much ever contaminated he may be, if he undergoes the spiritual disciplinary actions under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, he can attain the perfection of a twice-born brahmana. vijatvam jayate nirunam So, that process is described as sadhana bhakti. sadhana bhakti. And, it is given in the scriptures, anyone who adopts the process of sadhana bhakti under proper guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. One cannot independently do anything in spiritual life, no. You require the proper guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. And under such expert guidance, strictly following the rules and regulations and the process, one becomes purified. And that purification results in one becoming a perfect twice-born brahmana. Perfection of a brahmana is to become a devotee. So one becomes a devotee. So Srila Prabhupada says, it is therefore the actual guidance that matters in the process of becoming a brahmana, even without change of body, or in going back to Godhead without change of body. It is the actual guidance of an expert and engaging properly

in the activities of sadhana bhakti. Now, Srila Jeeva Goswami says here that the use of the word he in this connection positively affirms this truth. What is the word? In the verse, virajena atmana eva he This word he, ending word of the 48th verse, that affirms positively this truth that there is no need to change body if one has to go back to Godhead after having executed pure devotional service. So this fact is affirmed here. And the Bhagavad Gita confirms this that anyone who systematically executes pure devotional service without deviation can attain this perfection of Brahman. Brahman perfection needs to be situated on the spiritual platform above the three gunas. And on the Brahman platform then one engages in pure devotional service. Pure devotional service is only possible on the Brahman platform, on the spiritual platform. Then one becomes completely perfect. Becomes completely perfect. And such a person actually is eligible to directly go to the spiritual world and that also the supreme planet, Koloka Vrindavana,

### Transcendental Body of Krishna, Ajopisan Avyayatma, Eternal Spiritual Form, Deteriorating Material Bodies, Pure Devotees, Spiritualized Body, Constant Chanting, Hare Krishna Mantra, Iron and Fire Analogy

**Key Quote:** "Even if we practice constant chanting of Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, then we don't have to change our body."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by explaining that Lord Krishna always remains in his transcendental form and that pure devotees, through constant engagement in devotional service, especially chanting the Hare Krishna mantra, can spiritualize their bodies and potentially avoid changing them at the time of death.

without change of body. Now this has already been explained by Srila Prabhupada in an earlier verse where it was said Lord Krishna returned to his own abode without a change of body, because Lord's body is completely transcendental. Even when he comes to this world he comes in his original spiritual form. Ajopisan avyayatma. Avyayatma means Krishna never changes his body. His body never deteriorates. His body is always spiritual. Material bodies are deteriorating. They change. And we have to quit this body at the time of death or at the end of this life or when we are when we are transferred to another body. We have to quit this body. But Krishna never accepts any material body. He never comes in touch with matter. He is always situated in his eternal spiritual form, spiritual body, which may be of different forms according to the need, but all of them are the same spirit, same supreme Lord without any change. The same supreme Lord. So when Lord Krishna returns to his abode he returns in his personal form, the same supreme spiritual form. There is no change of body. Similarly, pure devotees simply because they are engaged in pure devotional service always, constantly, 24 hours a day, they don't change their body because their body is a spiritual one, spiritualized by pure devotional service, spiritualized by pure devotional service. So, even if we practice constant chanting of Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, then we don't have to change our body. Our body becomes spiritualized by constantly engaging in chanting and hearing the holy name. Just like iron in contact with fire becomes red hot and fire-like. Similarly, of course this is a crude example, but in the case of our own material body, that we have now, it also becomes spiritualized by our engagement in devotional service, pure devotional service. So I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

So now Vidura himself, he was constantly absorbed in thought of Krishna. Therefore, when he left his body, he went back to his original post in Pitraloka. So Srila Prabhupada explains this point in the purport. The difference between the Pandavas and Vidura is that the Pandavas are eternal associates of the Lord, the Personality of Godhead.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Yama-Raj's role as a pure devotee who punishes the sinful but is a friend to devotees.

Vidura is an incarnation of Yama-Raj. Yama-Raj is always a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord. Even in his Pitraloka planet, he is always in the position of being a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord. So his devotion and service is eternal. He also has got a responsibility of punishing the sinful people, extremely sinful people in the post of Yama-Raj. So he is not like the other devatas who have got a desire for material enjoyment and therefore they occupy a post. No. Yama-Raj is not like that. Vidura is not like that. So Srila Prabhupada says about Vidura as Yama-Raj, Men are afraid of Yama-Raj because it is he only who awards punishment to the miscreants of the material world. Those who are very very sinful, they are punished by Yama-Raj by being sent to hellish planets for punishment. Hellish planets are not places of inhabitation for any kind. They are not places of inhabitation for any condition. So it is exclusively meant for giving punishment to extremely sinful persons. So these miscreants, sinful people, they are afraid of Yama-Raj. But those who are devotees of the Lord have nothing to fear from him because he himself is a devotee. Yama-Raj is devotee, pure devotee. So other devotees, pure devotees of the Lord have nothing to fear from Yama-Raj.

**Summary:** The speaker recounts the story of how Yama-Raj was cursed by Manduka Muni to be born as Vidura, the son of a maidservant.

To the devotees, Yama-Raj is a cordial friend. But to the non-devotees, he is fear personified. He is doing his duty of punishing the non-devotees who are engaged in grievous sinful activities. As we have already discussed, it is understood that Yama-Raj was cursed by Manduka Muni to be degraded as a Shudra. Once Yama-Raj made a mistake in the past that this Manduka Muni who did some mistake when he was a small boy, he was punished later on for the mistake innocently committed. So Manduka Muni became angry and he cursed Yama-Raj to take birth as the son of a Shudrani, a maidservant, Dasiputra. So that curse, because the curse, even though he is a pure devotee, he accepted the curse and therefore he had to take birth as Vidura. But as the son of a maidservant.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Vidura's pious life and devotional service, which even led to the salvation of the materialistic Dhritarashtra.

So he was, Yama-Raj was born as Vidura, considered as a Shudra. Therefore Vidura was an incarnation of Yama-Raj. Because he is cursed to take birth as a Shudra. As an eternal servitor of the Lord, he displayed his devotional activities very ardently and lived a life of a pious man. Devotees always live a pious life. They don't commit sinful activities. This is the wonderful nature or characteristic of a devotee. Even in this material world. Even if they are harassed. Even if they are insulted. Even if they are cheated. Even if the others try to mislead them. They are fixed in devotional service. They don't get misled. On the other hand, it is described here, such pure devotees as Vidura, about them Prabhupada is telling, that Vidura lived a life of a pious man so much so that a materialistic man like Dhritarashtra also got salvation by his instruction. Dhritarashtra was very materialistic. But even Dhritarashtra got salvation or moksha by the instructions of Vidura.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the relationship between Vidura and Dhritarashtra, highlighting their different births and how Vidura's instructions led to Dhritarashtra's salvation.

What is the connection between Vidura and Dhritarashtra? Both are born as sons of Vichitravirya. But Vidura was born as a son of a maid servant of one of the queens of Vichitravirya. And Dhritarashtra was born as the son of the queen of Vichitravirya. So Dhritarashtra had a share in the inheritance of the kingdom. But Vidura had no share. So Vidura accepted his position as the Shudra. But Dhritarashtra as a Kshatriya, he became the caretaker king of the entire world. So Dhritarashtra was very materialistic, but by the instruction of Vidura, he was able to get moksha,

**Summary:** The speaker explains how Vidura's constant remembrance of the Lord's lotus feet purified him from any contamination due to his birth as a Shudra.

salvation. So therefore Prabhupada says, Vidura by his pious activities in the devotional service of the Lord, was able to always remember the lotus feet of the Lord. So remembering constantly the lotus feet of the Lord is a devotional service. And that is possible by constant engagement in devotional activities. This remembrance is not some idle meditation or lazily sitting in the excuse of doing meditation and actually sleeping. No, it's not that. Now by constantly remembering the lotus feet of the Lord, Vidura became washed of all contamination of a Shudra-born life. Actually as a pure devotee there is no contamination, but even if there were any contamination due to taking birth as a Shudra and engaging in such Shudra activities, still he became free from all contamination by his constant remembrance of the lotus feet

of the Supreme Lord. In many places in scripture it is said one who constantly thinks of Krishna becomes fully purified. At the end he was received again by the denizens of Pitraloka and posted in his original position. He came from Pitraloka he went back to Pitraloka. So Srila Prabhupada says the demigods are also associates of the Lord without personal touch whereas the direct associates of the Lord are in constant personal touch with him. What is the difference between Pandavas and Vidura? Pandavas are in constant touch with the Supreme Lord as his direct associates. The demigods like Yamaraj they are also associates of the Lord but they don't have that personal touch.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord and his personal associates incarnate in many universes without cessation...the Lord remembers all of his previous incarnations whereas the associates forget due to their being very minute parts and parcels of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Lord remembers all his incarnations, while his associates do not, due to their minute nature, using the example of Krishna and Arjuna.

They participate in the Lord's pastimes when they are given an opportunity because Lord's pastimes are an internal potency. So unless they are given an opportunity they have to engage in such devotional activities as constantly remembering the Lord constantly hearing the glories of the Lord from the Bhagavatam constantly chanting and hearing the Holy Name there is constant association constant engagement in devotional service. So Srila Prabhupada says further the Lord and his personal associates incarnate in many universes without cessation. Without cessation no stopping. No stoppage. They continuously incarnate in many many universes. Now the difference is between the Lord and his associates is the Lord remembers all of his previous incarnations whereas the associates forget due to their being very minute parts and parcels of the Lord. We are very very tiny parts and parcels of the Lord. Just like Arjuna Krishna tells Arjuna many many births you and I have taken in the past. You and I have taken many many births in the past. Now the Lord remembers all his previous incarnations. I remember all of them but you do not. So Prabhupada explains Arjuna is a pure devotee. Arjuna is a constant companion of the Lord. But he cannot remember his past appearances with the Lord. He can't remember. That Lord only knows. Lord only can remember. Because the Lord is supreme Lord unlimited Lord. He has unlimited memory. We are very very tiny part so we have limited memory. Therefore this difference always exists. I will stop here.

**Key Quote:** "Arjuna said O King, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Hari, who treated me exactly like an intimate friend, has left me alone."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam 1.15.5, focusing on Arjuna's feeling of separation from Krishna and the loss of his divine power after Krishna's departure.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Jai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudhirayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 5th verse of the 15th chapter of the 1st Canticle. The meaning of this verse is, Arjuna said, O King, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Hari, who treated me exactly like an intimate friend, has left me alone. Thus my astounding power, which astonished even the demigods, is no longer with me. So immediately Arjuna's response is that the Supreme Lord has returned to his abode and Arjuna is feeling separation from that dear most Lord Krishna. And the immediate response of Arjuna is that Arjuna's astounding power, which he displayed in the presence of Krishna, is no longer with Arjuna. And that power was astounding even to the greatest of demigods in the heavenly planets.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces Srila Prabhupada's explanation of Arjuna's statement, referencing Bhagavad Gita 10.41, which describes Krishna as the source of all opulence and power.

And that power is no longer with Arjuna. So, Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport very nicely. What is the significance of this statement by Arjuna? Srila Prabhupada explains on the basis of what is said in the Bhagavad Gita by Lord Krishna. Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, In the Bhagavad Gita, in the 10th chapter, the 10th chapter of Bhagavad Gita is entitled The Opulence of the Absolute. What is the meaning of that? The opulences of Krishna, which are displayed by him in the material world. So those opulences are described in the 10th chapter, specifically on the request of Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita. So, one such verse, 41st verse, in the 10th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna says, Anyone specifically powerful and opulent in wealth, strength, beauty, knowledge, and all that is materially desirable, is to be considered but a product of an insignificant portion of the complete whole of my energy. Everything, this Krishna statement in the Bhagavad Gita, the 41st verse and 10th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita.

**Key Quote:** "all wealth all strength all knowledge all beauty is actually Krishna's own energy in different forms in different varieties"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept that all forms of wealth, strength, beauty, and knowledge are manifestations of Krishna's energy, emphasizing the dependence of everything on Krishna.

So, what does it mean? Anybody may have some wealth, or they may have extraordinary beauty, or strength, or knowledge, or any possession, anything glorious, anything magnificent, wonderful, anything astounding, but that is only Krishna's own energy, which is a tiny fragment of that energy being displayed. So this is to be understood, all wealth, all strength, all knowledge, all beauty is actually Krishna's own energy in different forms, in different varieties, Krishna's own beauty. Each one of us, if we have some beauty, it is a tiny portion of Krishna's total beauty. Even for a matter, this material body that we have, which is made up of the five elements, earth, water, fire, air, and sky, this material body is also a tiny portion of the earth, water, fire, air, and sky, which is Krishna's material energy. From that a small portion is taken, combined, and this body is formed. So the body is also part of Krishna's material energy. I, a spirit soul, I am also part of Krishna's marginal energy. So everything is Krishna's own energy, everyone is.

**Key Quote:** "no one therefore can be independently powerful in any measure without being endowed by the Lord"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotees are empowered by Krishna to participate in His mission, receiving the necessary wealth, strength, and knowledge.

Krishna's own energy. This is very carefully understood. So therefore, Srila Prabhupada says, no one therefore can be independently powerful in any measure without being endowed by the Lord. So if I have any wealth, it is bestowed upon me by Krishna. Now, if somebody else has more wealth or less wealth than me, even they are having that greater wealth or lesser wealth bestowed by Krishna only. Now this is irrespective of somebody's being a devotee or a non-devotee. Independent of that, everyone's wealth actually is a portion of Krishna's own wealth. Everyone's strength, everyone's beauty, everyone's knowledge. It is a portion of Krishna's knowledge. Now further, Srila Prabhupada explains, when the Lord descends on the earth along with his eternal, ever-liberated associates, he not only displays the divine energy possessed by himself, but also empowers his associate devotees with the required energy to execute his mission of incarnation. Lord Krishna comes. Lord Krishna comes to this world as incarnation. He comes with his associates, eternal associates from the spiritual world. Now he comes with his energies, with his power, with his wealth, with his beauty. His devotees also, they come here and they are bestowed with required wealth, strength, beauty, knowledge, etc. by the Lord in order for them to participate in Krishna's mission in this material world. So, they are endowed with the required, necessary wealth, strength, etc. And Krishna comes, of course, with his totality of his wealth, strength, knowledge, beauty, etc.

### incarnation, memory, Krishna's associates

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "both you and I have come to this earth many many times in the past I remember all those previous appearances but you have forgotten them"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the concept of Krishna's incarnations and the role of His eternal associates like Arjuna, highlighting Krishna's perfect memory and the limited memory of the jivas.

Now, in the same Bhagavad Gita, in the fourth chapter, fifth verse, it is stated, The Lord and his eternal associates descend on the earth many times, but the Lord remembers all the different roles of incarnations whereas the associates by his supreme will forget them. Now in the fourth chapter, Krishna explains to Arjuna, both you and I have come to this earth many many times in the past. I remember all those previous appearances, but you have forgotten them. So it is a fact that the eternal associates of Krishna like Arjuna, whenever Krishna incarnates, Arjuna also incarnates with Krishna, but Arjuna cannot remember. In his present life, he cannot remember his past lives, but Krishna remembers everything, all his past appearances, everything. Krishna's incarnation and even Krishna remembers with whom he has appeared in which incarnation, that also remembers because Krishna's memory is unlimited, our memory is limited. Krishna's knowledge is unlimited, our knowledge is limited, like that. So Krishna remembers everything, we don't remember everything. That difference eternally exists between us.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is always the Supreme Lord as much as all of us are subуется to ob Arms and we are always limited"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the eternal difference between Krishna as the unlimited Supreme Lord and all living beings as limited, and explains that Krishna withdraws powers when they are no longer needed for His mission.

Each one of us, all the jivas, they are always limited and so it is for that release and the life of us on Earth and the Supreme Lord. So Krishna is always the Supreme Lord as much as all of us are subjected to his arms and we are always limited or finite and we can't for even be in material terms. This difference in the unmanageable, unlimited jiva exist in this this height completely Wayne. Even in the case of pure devotees, even in the case of liberated souls, and definitely so in the case of conditioned souls or beings, living beings who are entangled in this material world. In all cases, all circumstances, all situations, all positions, every jiva, liberated jivas, all souls, all living beings, they are always limited and Krishna is always unlimited. Now further, Srila Prabhupada says, the Lord takes away with him all his associates when he disappears from the earth. The power and energy which were bestowed upon Arjuna were required for fulfillment of the mission of the Lord. But when his mission was fulfilled, the emergency powers were withdrawn from Arjuna. Arjuna was bestowed some extraordinary powers by Krishna, but when the mission was over, Krishna withdrew the powers of Arjuna. Why? Because Prabhupada says, because the astounding powers of Arjuna, which were astonishing even to the denizens of heaven or the demigods, were no longer required.

### detachment, humility, service to Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "the lesson is therefore that no one should be puffed up for his powers borrowed from the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of humility and detachment from material possessions and powers, advocating for the use of all resources in the service of Krishna.

As they were not meant for going back home, back to Godhead. So now what Arjuna requires to do is to go back to Godhead, because that's where he actually is eternally present. He had come when Krishna came along with Krishna for the sake of participating Krishna's pastimes. So when Krishna's pastimes are wound up, then Arjuna's powers are gone. Then Arjuna's power is also withdrawn by Krishna. It is Krishna only who gave Arjuna the power, extraordinary power. And Krishna only withdraws it when the power is no longer required by Arjuna. So that extraordinary power is not required for Arjuna to go back home, back to Godhead. If endowment of powers and withdrawal of powers by the Lord are possible even for a great devotee like Arjuna, or even for the demigods in heaven, then what to speak of ordinary living beings who are but fixed compared to such great souls, even any person in this world, however great he or she maybe. They display certain extraordinary power or knowledge or strength or skill or wealth because Krishna has bestowed it upon them. And when Krishna withdraws or takes away what is best for them, then they will be unable to possess them. They will be unable to use them. They will feel the absence of such extraordinary power or wealth when Krishna withdraws. So Srila Prabhupada concludes by telling, the lesson is therefore that no one should be puffed up for his powers borrowed from the Lord. Whatever anyone may have, they are actually borrowed from Krishna. And don't be proud about the borrowed power thinking, I have power or I have become powerful on my own, which means that nobody's independent. Independently, nobody's powerful. The same man should rather feel obliged to the Lord for such benefactions and must utilize such power for the service of the Lord. Such power can be withdrawn at any time by the Lord. So the best use of such power and opulence

is to engage them in the service of the Lord. So if you have got some extraordinary wealth or whatever wealth you have in your possession, it is best utilized in the service of Krishna. If you have any power, if you have any skill, if you have any knowledge, if you have any strength, please use it in Krishna's service. Otherwise, if you use it for something else, you will be completely bewildered. You will be baffled in your attempts to use it some other way because it will be withdrawn when it is no longer required by the Lord who bestows it. So don't be proud. Don't use it for anything other than the Lord's service. That's a lesson to be learned. I'll stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.

### Separation from Krishna, Loving relationship with Krishna, Forgetfulness of Krishna

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "For a living being, there is no one dearer than the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse and explains that everyone has a loving relationship with Krishna, but we have forgotten it.

In this session we will be discussing from the 6th verse of the 15th verse. The meaning of this verse is, I have just lost him whose separation for a moment would render all the universes unfavorable and void like bodies without life. Arjuna is further describing to Yudhishthira the feeling that he is having after having lost the association of Krishna. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport that factually for a living being, there is no one dearer than the Lord. For any living being, not only for devotees, for every living being, who is the dearest person? It is Lord Krishna. So, which means that we should understand, if we are not experiencing that loving relationship with Krishna right now, in our present condition, it is because we have forgotten Krishna, somehow. We don't know exactly how. We cannot trace back, how did I lose my dear most friend, my relationship with my dear most friend Krishna, how did I lose? We cannot trace it. So, we have to accept on the authority of the scriptures that we have lost our dear most friend. We have lost Krishna. We have lost the relationship with our dear most friend Krishna, dear most person.

### Svamsa, Vibhinamsa, Expansions of Krishna, Paramatma, Jivas

**Key Quote:** "Lord Krishna has got His own expansions, His personal expansions."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concepts of Svamsa (personal expansions of Krishna) and Vibhinamsa (living beings as expansions of Krishna's energy).

Prabhupada says, the Lord expands himself by innumerable parts and parcels as Svamsa and Vibhinamsa. I will explain what this means. Svamsa. Lord Krishna has got His own expansions, His personal expansions. He himself expands in forms called Svamsa. His own personal expansion. Just like Krishna expands as Balaram, Narayana, Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Ram, Sankarsana, Vibhinamsa, Svamsa. Lord Krishna has got His own personal expansions. Lord Krishna has got His own personal expansions. Lord Krishna has got His own personal expansions. Lord Krishna has got His own personal expansion. Like Adha, Rama, Narasimha, Varaha, Vamana. Like that He expands in so many forms of incarnation, of different expansions in the spiritual world, incarnations in the material world. He expands Himself, His own Self. That means all these Swamsa expansions or incarnations, meditators from the Yantlingam, our nations are actually Lord Krishna himself. So, Swamsa is equal in power with Lord Krishna himself. So, Krishna only is present in another form as Rama, Narasimha, Varaha. And Krishna expands himself in another kind of expansion called Vibhinamsa. Vibhinamsa is the expansion of Krishna as the living beings. That is an expansion of Krishna's energy, expansion of Krishna's energy. So, those expansions are very, very, very, very, very, very tiny. They don't have equal power as that of Krishna. The expansion called Vibhinamsa, which is the living beings, they don't have the same power as Krishna. They have a very, very, very, very, very, very, very tiny fraction, fragmental portion of Krishna's energy, Krishna's power, Krishna's wealth, Krishna's beauty, Krishna's strength, Krishna's knowledge, very tiny bit of that. That is what

### Paramatma, Swamsa, Vibhinamsa, Living beings, Material body, Soul

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Without the living being, the material body has no value."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the difference between Paramatma (Swamsa) and Jivatma (Vibhinamsa) and emphasizes the importance of the soul within the body.

says further in the purport, Paramatma is the Swamsa part of the Lord. Who is Paramatma? The Lord seated on everybody's heart in this material world. Paramatma is the Swamsa part of the Lord. Who is Paramatma? The Lord seated on everybody's heart in this material world. Paramatma. He is the Swamsa part. That means he has full power as Krishna. Whereas the Vibhinamsa parts are the living beings. Vibhinamsa parts, the living beings have got every, very, very, very less power. So, the English terms that are used by Prabhupada, we are infinitesimal part of Krishna and the incarnations of Krishna are infinite incarnations of Krishna. So, infinite and infinitesimal. Unlimited, limited. Param Brahma and Brahma. So, the difference always exists, eternally exists in all conditions. The living being is always tiny, limited. The Lord, including all his incarnations of his personal self, are always unlimited, always full with all power, all strength, all beauty, all knowledge, etc. Therefore, all those incarnations are called Bhagavan, Bhagavan Rama, Bhagavan Varaha, Bhagavan Narayana, Bhagavan Krishna. Therefore, whenever Krishna speaks in the Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavan Narayana, Bhagavan Krishna. Therefore, whenever Krishna speaks in the Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavan Narayana, Bhagavan Krishna. mijita-vedavyasa records it as Shree Bhagowanu Aacha. When the Lord incarnated as Kapila, then the description in the Bhagavatam is, Shree Bhagawanu Aacha. When Kapila speaks, the Samkhya philosophy explains. So, that is recorded by Vyasadeva in the Bhagavata, the Bhagavatam as Shri Bhagavanu Acha. So, this is important to understand. As the living being is the important factor of the material body, now all living beings, the important factor is the spirit soul, the living entity, the living being. Without the living being, the material body has no value. We know what happens when we say a person died. What happens? The living being, the spirit soul, has left the body. The body is a lump of matter, flesh and bones and skin and all that material covering. That's all that is left. Then we immediately dispose it off, because the person is not there.

### Paramatma, Brahman, Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Subordinate features of Krishna

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna is the Supreme Personality of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Brahman and Paramatma are expansions of Krishna and do not have independent existence, emphasizing Krishna's supreme position.

Now, the soul also in the same way, body has its existence based on the Paramatma within the heart of the living being, within the heart of the soul. It is only because of Paramatma's presence in the heart of the soul that the soul is able to utilize the body and do some activity while in the body. Without the presence of Paramatma we are completely helpless, we are totally lost, we are incapacitated. So Paramatma enters to facilitate our life in this body. Now further Srila Prabhupada says, Brahman or Paramatma has no locus standing without the Supreme Lord Krishna. Now Krishna the Supreme Personality of the Supreme Lord Krishna is the Supreme Personality of the Supreme Lord. You've got it? He expands as Paramatma, He expands as Brahman. Now both Brahman and Paramatma expansion of Krishna, they have no independent or separate existence without Krishna. Krishna only expands as Paramatma. Krishna's bodily effulgence only is Brahman or the impersonal feature or the energies. In different ways this Brahman is explained in the scriptures, which is one of the features of the Supreme Lord Krishna, the Absolute Truth. So that feature is a subordinate feature to Bhagavan, Krishna. Krishna says this in the Bhagavad Gita, brahmanohi pratishta aham. I am the basis of the Brahman, impersonal Brahman. Elsewhere in the Brahma Samhita it is said, yasya prabha prabhavato jagadandakoti. This entire jagadandakoti, the crores of universes, they are a rest. They are resting in the Brahman effulgence, which is the bodily luster of the Supreme Lord Krishna, yasya prabha. His bodily effulgence is the Brahman. And in that Brahman all the universes are resting, they are sustained. So that is explained also. This is all explained

They are all interrelated. They are linked with one another or independent factors. It appears like each one is existing independently, but actually none of them are independent of Krishna. So Krishna is the source of the Paramatma. Paramatma is the source of the Jivatma. Jivatma is the source of the body. . . I am just talking only of Jivatma and so there is no other source of the Paramatma. You have to Wohn the . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

**Key Quote:** "Drupada Maharaj decided to hand over his daughter to Arjuna only, this was Drupada's desire."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Drupada's desire for Draupadi to marry Arjuna and the circumstances surrounding the Pandavas' supposed death in the shellac house.

Srila Prabhupada says Draupadi was the most beautiful daughter of King Drupada, and when she was a young girl, almost all the princess desired her hand. The Kshatriyas, they want to marry the most beautiful princess of their time in their, in the neighborhood. So it was well known in the different parts of this Bharat Varsha during the time of Draupadi that this daughter of Drupada, she was the most beautiful princess of her time. And when Drupada announced that she is going to be married to the prince who can actually successfully pass a test, then so many princess came. So here Srila Prabhupada explains something confidential, that Drupada Maharaj decided to hand over his daughter to Arjuna only. This was Drupada's desire. He wanted to marry his daughter Draupadi only to Arjuna, and therefore Drupada contrived a peculiar way. Drupada is very intelligent, because it's not explained in the purport by Srila Prabhupada, the details are there in the Mahabharata, that Drupada actually could have directly approached Arjuna and expressed his desire to marry his daughter to Arjuna, but Arjuna was reportedly killed in a fire accident. This was the time when Duryodhana was plotting to kill the Pandavas, and Duryodhana along with the support and the encouragement by his father Dhritarashtra, Duryodhana built a palace, separate palace for the Pandavas in another place, and that palace was made of combined combustible materials, shellac, and the Pandavas were told by Dhritarashtra, you don't have to share the palace in Hastinapura with the Kauravas, you go and stay separately in a beautiful palace that I have specially arranged to be built for you, and you stay there comfortably. Now Pandavas, they came to know through some secret messages, basically from Vidura, the Pandavas came to know that this was a plot to kill them by setting fire after they went to that new palace and in that way burn them alive. So this was the plot, and the Pandavas what they did, because they knew that they are being sent there to be killed alive, so Vidura secretly had arranged to dig a tunnel from underneath that new palace to escape, to escape and save themselves. This was also another secret not known to Duryodhana or Dhritarashtra or any of the Kauravas. So when Pandavas agreed to go, Dhritarashtra thought now somehow eliminate the Pandavas. So then the Pandavas actually escaped after going there, and even though the palace was set on fire, the people thought Pandavas were living inside, and they were very, very unhappy that the Pandavas were killed in apparently a fire accident, and externally the Kauravas who knew the real reason why the Pandavas were sent there to be killed alive, burnt alive, so they externally expressed some sorrow, very unfortunate the Pandavas were burnt alive, some accident, but actually practically nobody knew that the Pandavas had escaped. Drupada was doubtful whether the Pandavas were really killed in that fire accident. So in order to discover where are the Pandavas, he decided to actually contrive a peculiar way of arranging a test for the princess to discover where is Arjuna if he is in hiding.

**Key Quote:** "The condition was that out of the princely order the contending prince must be able to pierce the fishes eyes through the wheel of protection."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the difficult test Drupada devised for the Swayamvara and how Draupadi avoided Karna.

So what was the test for the prince who wanted to marry Draupadi, which was arranged such a way only Arjuna could pass? What was the test? There was a fish hanging on the inner roof of the house under the protection of a wheel. There is a fish hanging on the inner roof of the house, and that underneath the fish there was a wheel. The condition was that out of the princely order, the contending prince must be able to pierce the fishes eyes through the wheel of protection. The eye of the fish has to be pierced by the prince who shoots an arrow, that eye has to be pierced through the wheel, and no one will be allowed to look up at the target. They can't directly look up and aim the arrow at the eye of the fish. On the ground there was a water pot in which the target and wheel were reflected. The target, which is the eye of the fish, and the wheel were reflected in the water pot, and they can only look down into the reflection, and one has to fix his aim towards the target by looking at the trembling water in the pot. The water is not steady, the target is steady, but the water is shaking, is trembling, and the water is not steady. The water is not steady because the water is not. So what did he do? In the assembly of the princely order, when Drishtadyumna, the brother of Draupadi, introduced all the princes to his grown-up sister, Karna was also present in the game. But Draupadi tactfully avoided Karna as the rival of Arjuna, and she expressed her desires through her brother Drishtadyumna that she was unable to accept anyone who was less than a Kshatriya. So Karna was also there. Karna came forward, but Draupadi expressed through Drishtadyumna that she will not marry anybody who is less than a Kshatriya. Karna was known as the son of a carpenter or a shudra, and in those days, the Vaishyas and the Shudras are considered to be less important than the Kshatriyas. So Draupadi... Draupadi avoided Karna by this method. Karna was known as the son of a shudra, so he was called a shudra. So Draupadi said, I don't want to marry a shudra or a Vaishya. I want to marry a Kshatriya.

**Key Quote:** "Then Arjuna, actually in the dress of a poor brahmana, he pierced the difficult target. And everyone was astonished."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates how Arjuna, disguised as a brahmana, succeeded in piercing the target, defeating Karna with Krishna's grace, and winning Draupadi's hand.

When Arjuna, who was also present in that assembly, he was disguised as a poor brahmana. When the Pandavas escaped from that shellac house when it was set on fire, they actually came away to the forest, and in the forest they were disguised, because they were still not clear how they are going to reveal to everyone that they have escaped, and how will they protect themselves against the attack of Duryodhana and the other Kauravas, who are always thinking of how to kill the Pandavas. So how to protect themselves and how to reveal to the others that they are alive. So they were disguising themselves. So in this Swayamvara ceremony they came disguised as poor brahmanas. Arjuna was disguised as poor brahmana. So Arjuna, when none of the other princes were able to pierce the target, who were Kshatriyas, they all failed to pierce the target. It was not possible for them. Then, Arjuna came forward, though he was dressed as a poor brahmana, because a brahmana is superior to a Kshatriya. So he came forward and said, let me try, even though I am not a Kshatriya, let me try, if I am permitted to. So, Drupada, Draupadi and Drishtadyumna all were very curious. Who is this brahmana who is going to try? Let us see. When everyone else has failed, whether this brahmana will succeed. Let us see. So he was allowed. Then Arjuna, actually in the dress of a poor brahmana, he pierced the difficult target, and everyone was astonished. This brahmana is able to pierce the target which everyone else has failed to do so. Who is this brahmana? Then, especially Karna offered a stiff fight to Arjuna. That in Swayambara, the others who have lost, they will not allow the winner to simply take away the beautiful bride, Draupadi. So when Karna put up a fight against Arjuna, then Arjuna was able to defeat Karna only by the grace of Krishna, and he thus was successfully able to win the hand of Draupadi. Now Arjuna remembered this incident that only because of Krishna, because having that extraordinary strength to fight against all the princes, including Karna, and thus win the hand of Draupadi. So Arjuna remembered that.

So here the description so far has been how Yudhishthira is curious to know, anxious to know, not just curious, he is anxious to know why Arjuna has returned from Dwaraka and is very much aggrieved. And Yudhishthira asked so many questions as to the cause for Arjuna's grief. And when Arjuna did not reply, Yudhishthira guessed that actually it is only because Krishna has left the planet and Arjuna is feeling the intense separation. He has become his dearest friend. So, Arjuna is now recollecting the different incidents in the presence of the Supreme Lord. How Arjuna had a very nice, wonderful companionship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As is Diyamohar Xin. As is Diyamo's friend. Arjuna had a wonderful friendship with Krishna. So he is describing to Yudhishthira

**Summary:** This segment discusses Yudhishthira's devotion to Krishna and Krishna's desire for a pure devotee to rule the world, emphasizing Yudhishthira's intention to glorify Krishna through the Rajasuya Yajna and the worship of Krishna in the assembly.

This was during the Rajasuya sacrifice that Yudhishthira actually performed after this assembly house was built. Now Yudhishthira himself is a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord Krishna. He was interested in performing his Rajasuya Jnana for his own sake. Generally a king declares himself as the emperor of the world and he offers a challenge to those who do not want to be subordinate to him, that they fight and defeat the emperor or the would-be emperor. If they do not want to be under his subordination. So Yudhishthira was not very much interested in himself becoming the emperor. It was actually Krishna's desire that a pure devotee rule the world and lead people on the path of devotional service to achieve the ultimate liberation. Now, Yudhishthira himself, he wanted to glorify Krishna. And in order to glorify Krishna, he wanted an assembly of all the state princes. And when they assembled, in that assembly, Yudhishthira worshiped Krishna as the foremost among all the personalities in the entire creation. Because Yudhishthira's yajna was attended to by even the devatas. So in the presence of all great kings and devatas and saintly persons, in that assembly, Yudhishthira wanted to glorify Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "The modern demons are the harmful material scientists."
**Summary:** This segment explains the nature of demons and divine beings, drawing from the Bhagavad Gita, and equates modern demons with harmful material scientists who create disturbances in society, using the example of nuclear weapons.

by Arjuna, he constructed this wonderful assembly house which was used to perform the Rajasuya sacrifice. Then Srila Prabhupada says, the demons possess wonderful and supernatural powers to create material wonders, but they are always disturbing elements to the society. That is a demoniac nature. There are people in this world, Dvabhuta Sarge Lokesmin, Daiva Asura Evachara. In the 16th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna explains there are two kinds of created beings. Some with divine qualities and some with demoniac qualities. Daiva Asura. So these demons, they have some supernatural powers. Supernatural powers to create material wonders. But they are disturbing elements because of their demoniac nature. That is why they are called demons. The modern demons are the harmful material scientists. In our age also now, there are demons. Who are the demons? The harmful material scientists. Why? Because they create some material wonders for disturbance in the society. And Prabhupada gives the example here. For example, the creation of nuclear weapons has caused some panic in human society. So much of nuclear weapons are there all over the world in different countries. So the intelligence of a demoniac natured person is always used for destructive purposes. And the intelligence of a divine natured person is used for constructive purposes. So there is a difference between the divine nature and the demoniac nature. Therefore Prabhupada says they create disturbance in society.

**Key Quote:** "So it is described devotees are more merciful than the Lord."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Maya's materialism and how he sought shelter from Arjuna to escape Krishna's Sudarshan Chakra, emphasizing the mercy of devotees and the importance of pleasing the devotee to please the Lord.

Always they are disturbing the people in general. So Maya was also a materialist like that. But he knew the art of creating wonderful things. And yet, when Lord Krishna wanted to kill him. So Maya Dhanava was chased both by the fire and by the wheel of Lord Krishna. Krishna wanted to eliminate this demon by using Sudarshan Chakra. And this Maya Dhanava was also in danger because of the fire in the Khandava forest which was his place of residence. So he was chased both by the fire and the Sudarshan Chakra of Lord Krishna. Then what did Maya Dhanava do? He simply took shelter of Arjuna. Arjuna who is a great devotee. Now when Arjuna saw that Maya Dhanava's life is in danger. Arjuna saved him from the wrath of the fire of Lord Sri Krishna. So it is described devotees are more merciful than the Lord. So by the mercy of a devotee, even the Lord will pardon someone who is an offender. So when somebody is given shelter by a devotee, they are actually blessed by the Lord. They are actually benedicted by the Lord. So therefore it is more important to please the devotee of the Lord, pure devotee of the Lord, even more than trying to please the Lord. And the Lord is automatically pleased when we please his pure devotee. Asya Prasada Bhagavata Prasada. So this is the moral to be learnt from this incident.

**Key Quote:** "Out of curiosity, she joined the two parts and the child became complete and regained life."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's purport explains the unusual birth story of Jarasandha, involving a king, two queens, a mango, a she-demon named Jara, and the joining of two body parts.

And this Krishna Mantra Prasurtyamantra was a very powerful king of Magada, and the history of his birth and activities was also very interesting. His father, King Brihadratha, was also a very prosperous and powerful king of Magada, but he had no son, although he married two daughters of the king of Kashi. Being disappointed in not getting a son from either of the two queens, the king, along with his wives, left Kashi home to live in the forest for austerities. But in the forest, he was blessed by one great Rishi to have his son, and that Rishi gave him one mango to be eaten by the queens. The queens did so and were very soon pregnant. The king was very happy to see the queens bearing children, but when the right time approached, the queens delivered one child in two parts, one from each of the queens' wombs. The two parts were thrown in the forest where a great she-demon used to live, and she was glad to have some delicate alnya flesh and blood from the newly born child. Out of curiosity, she joined the two parts, and the child became complete and regained life. The king was in a haste. He thought the queens have delivered two parts which are not complete. He thought they are useless. Both the queens have delivered something which is incomplete. So, they simply discarded the parts. But when the she-demon joined the two parts, they became complete and regained life. The child became complete and regained life because the child was born due to the blessing of the rishi in the forest. The rishi blessed that the king have only one child through the two queens, one child. Becoming common, the class 4 queen came out. So, therefore, the she-demon was known as 'jara', that was her name, who lived in that forest where the king had retired, and being compassionate on the childless king, she went to the king and presented him with the nice child. Instead of, she presented the king with the child. The king was very pleased with the she-demon and wanted to reward her according to her desire. The she-demon expressed her desire that the child be named after her. And thus, the child was surnamed Jarasandha, or one who was joined by Jara, the she-demon. Sandha means to join.

**Key Quote:** "Shiva is the lord of all ghostly and demoniac men."
**Summary:** The lecture explains that Jarasandha was born with demoniac qualities, making him a devotee of Lord Shiva, who is easily pleased and often worshipped by demons.

So, this child got the name Jarasandha. So, it is also explained here that this Jarasandha was born as one of the children of the king. He was also one of the parts and parcels of the demon Viprachitti. So, he was also a demon, this Jarasandha, as a part and parcel of another big demon, Viprachitti. The saint by whose benedictions the queens bowed, the child was called Chandrakaushika, who foretold of the child before his father, Brihadratha. Now, this child, since he possessed demoniac qualities from birth, this is what the Bhagavad Gita explains, by birth, somebody is born with divine qualities, somebody else is born with demoniac qualities. So, this child was born with demoniac qualities. Naturally, he became a great devotee of Lord Shiva. Now, Shiva, who is Shiva? Shiva is the lord of all ghostly and demoniac men. Because Shiva is very easily pleased, these demons, they try to appease Shiva and get some material benedictions from him. And Shiva is very powerful, so he bestows material benedictions very easily. He is easily pleased. So, therefore, you can find many demons are devotees of Lord Shiva. So, Srila Prabhupada gives the example here: Ravana was a great devotee of Lord Shiva, and so also was King Jarasandha.

**Key Quote:** "Jarasandha became very angry against Krishna."
**Summary:** The lecture details how Jarasandha became an enemy of Krishna after Krishna killed Kamsa, who was Jarasandha's son-in-law, leading to Jarasandha's daughters becoming widows.

Jarasandha also was a devotee of Lord Shiva. This Jarasandha used to sacrifice all the demons, all arrested kings before Lord Mahabhairava or Shiva. And by his military power, this Jarasandha defeated many small kings and arrested them to butcher before Mahabhairava. This is offering as a tribute to Mahabhairava, another form of Shiva. So, Srila Prabhupada also says here that there are many devotees of Lord Mahabhairava or Kalabhairava in the province of Bihar. This was called formerly Magadha. Jarasandha was a relative of Kamsa, the maternal uncle of Krishna. And therefore, after Kamsa's death, King Jarasandha became a great enemy of Krishna. Why? Because Jarasandha's daughters were married to Kamsa. So, when Kamsa was killed by Krishna, Jarasandha's daughters became widows. After becoming widows, they went back to their father's house, Jarasandha's house. And Jarasandha was very unhappy that his daughters became widows, and he thought the cause of their becoming widows is Krishna. He never considered that Kamsa was doing all kinds of atrocious activities. Kamsa harassed Vasudeva and Devaki so much. So, Krishna, in order to actually give protection to Vasudeva and Devaki, who are devotees, he had to kill this Kamsa. So, Jarasandha became very angry against Krishna, and that way, Krishna became Jarasandha's enemy, simply because Krishna tried to protect his own parents and had to kill this Jarasandha.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is the real cause for all these happenings."
**Summary:** The lecture describes how Krishna orchestrated Jarasandha's death through Bhima, leading to the release of imprisoned kings who then paid tribute to Yudhishthira, highlighting Krishna's role as the prime mover.

So, Jarasandha became enemy. Actually, Lord Krishna wanted to kill Jarasandha, but he also wanted that those who served as military men for Jarasandha might not be killed. Therefore, a plan was adopted to kill this Jarasandha by Lord Krishna. What is the plan? Krishna, Bhima and Arjuna disguised themselves as poor brahmanas and went to Jarasandha and begged charity from him. Jarasandha never refused charity to any brahmana. So, when Krishna, Bhima and Arjuna asked Jarasandha for the facility of fighting him, to settle that Jarasandha would fight with Bhima only. So, all of them were guests and combatants of Jarasandha. So, Bhima and Jarasandha fought every day for several days, and Bhima became very disappointed that he could not kill Jarasandha, could not defeat or kill Jarasandha, because both were very powerful. Then Krishna gave hints that, he gave hints to Bhima about Jarasandha being joined together as an infant. Two parts of a child were joined together. That's why Jarasandha was born. So, Bhima dissected him again and killed him. So, all the kings who were detained in the concentration camp to be offered as Bali in front of Mahabhairava, they were released by Bhima. Now, when the kings felt obliged to the Pandavas, they paid tribute to King Yudhishthira. In this way, Arjuna is recollecting how by Krishna's mercy, Bhima was able to kill Jarasandha. And because the kings who were arrested by Jarasandha were released by Bhima, after Bhima killed Jarasandha, so the released kings, they paid tributes to Yudhishthira in the Rajasuya Yajna. So, Krishna is the real cause for all these happenings. Though Krishna remains in the background, he is the prime cause for all these incidents. This is the way of the Lord's pastimes in this world. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the new chapter about Pariksit Maharaj and explains how he ruled as a devotee, guided by Brahmanas, and possessing qualities foretold at his birth.

In this session, we will be discussing the importance from the first verse of the 16th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. This is a new chapter we are beginning in this session. The chapter is entitled, "How Pariksit Received the Age of Kali." So, in the previous chapter, we heard that the Pandavas retired timely. They handed over charge of ruling the world to Yudhishthira, who handed over charge to Pariksit Maharaj, the only surviving descendant of the Pandavas. And now, how did Pariksit rule? That is going to be described in this chapter. So the first verse: sutavvaca tata pariksit vijavariya shikshaya mahi mahabhagavata shashasaha yatha hi sutyam abhijatko vidaha samadhisan vipra mahagunas tatha. The meaning of this verse is: Suta Goswami said, remember Suta Goswami is speaking to the sages of Naimisharanya. They are asking different questions and Suta Goswami is replying to them. So, he is describing how Pariksit Maharaj began to rule. Suta Goswami said, O learned Brahmanas, Maharaj Pariksit then began to rule over the world as a great devotee of the Lord under the instructions of the best of the twice-born Brahmanas. He ruled by those great qualities which were foretold by expert astrologers

**Summary:** The speaker explains that good qualities develop naturally through devotion to Krishna and stresses the importance of preaching Krishna consciousness for world peace.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, at the time of Maharaj Pariksit's birth, the expert astrologer Brahmanas foretold some of his qualities. Why some of his qualities? Because a devotee has so many good qualities. So, they just foretold some of the good qualities at the time of the birth ceremony. Maharaj Pariksit developed all those qualities of the Lord and gradually all the good qualities worthy of possession develop. In the twelfth chapter of the Bhagavad-gita, Shila Prabhupada says when Krishna describes the wonderful qualities of a pure devotee, Prabhupada says one does not endeavor to develop each quality by separate effort. No, that's not the main way to develop good qualities by a devotee. Simply one has to become a devotee of the Supreme Lord, then naturally, automatically, very easily one develops all the good qualities gradually while practicing bhakti. So therefore, it is important everyone practices bhakti and naturally, automatically they all will develop good quality. Therefore, there is a great need to preach this Krishna consciousness among all classes of people in this world simply to make them devotees and thereby they become first-class citizens and there will be peace and prosperity in

the whole world. So further, Shila Prabhupada says Maharaj Pariksit was a Mahabhagavata or a first-class devotee who is not only well versed in the science of devotion but also able to convert others to become devotees by his transcendental instructions. Why is this being said of Pariksit as a devotee? He naturally had all good qualities, but being a first-class devotee, Mahabhagavata, Mahi mahabhagavata shahrhah, so Pariksit is described in the verse as Mahabhagava, first-class devotee, the topmost devotee, the pure devotee. So pure devotee, his specialty is that he is himself got all the good qualities that are we found in a devotee and then he is well versed in the science of devotion and therefore, such a first class pure devotee of the Lord is able to convert others to become devotees by his transcendental instructions. His instructions are very, very effective, very practical, very powerful. They impact the heart. Association with pure devotees impacts the heart of the person who takes such association, who contacts such pure devotee. So as a leader, Parikshit is the leader because he is the king, emperor of the world, of the citizens. They have all these common people. So he influences them, himself being a first class devotee, himself being a Mahabhagavata, so that they also become devotees. They also develop all good qualities. They also become prepared to go back to godhead. They are also completely liberated from the cycle of birth and death.

He travelled to the west on the order of his guru and he began preaching to the English speaking people and later on he travelled to different parts of the world and established this Krishna consciousness society, Hare Krishna movement, ISKCON movement meant for preaching to people to become devotees and thereby people become pure, people become purified, they become well behaved, they become peaceful, they become sober, they become good devotees and they go back to Godhead all of them.

is to one person, one pure devotee. Similarly we described how Maharaj Pariksit himself being a pure devotee he ruled perfectly as a first class devotee. He was a pure devotee, he was a leader. Maharaj Pariksit, further Srila Prabhupada says Maharaj Pariksit was therefore a devotee of the first order. There are three classes of devotees. I think that is also explained by Prabhupada. No, not in this purport. So there are three classes of devotees, first class devotee, second class devotee and third class devotee: Uttam Adhikari, Madhyam Adhikari, Kanishad Adhikari. So Pariksit was first class devotee, the top most class, the pure devotee, perfected devotee. Thus he used to consult great sages and learned brahmanas who could advise him by the shastras how to execute the state administration. Just because he is a first class devotee does not mean he acts independently. This is the important point to note. Even a first class devotee does not act independently. He will consult the right people for specific purposes. So it is said here, Srila Prabhupada, Pariksit

**Key Quote:** "The rules and regulations were already set forth by great sages like Manu, Yajnavalkya, Parashara and other liberated sages and the enactments were all suitable for all ages in all places."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the rules and regulations set forth by liberated sages in Dharma Shastras are perfect and suitable for all times and places, unlike the flawed laws made by imperfect people in modern systems.

They are great authorities. They are themselves first class leaders because they follow the proper authority and thereby they are able to give perfect guidance to the common people. There was no need for impractical fools to enact daily a new legislative bill and to conveniently alter it again and again to serve some purpose. See, this is important. In the modern system of administration, we see that the laws are made by imperfect people. So therefore, what is working for one time or one situation may not be working for another time with changing times. The laws have to be amended but Srila Prabhupada says the rules and regulations were already set forth by great sages like Manu, Yajnavalkya, Parashara and other liberated sages and the enactments were all suitable for all ages in all places. See the wonderful thing about the Dharma Shastras. There is Parashara. There is Parashara Smriti. There is Manu Smriti. Yajnavalkya Smriti. And these are instructions given for different classes of human beings including the kings. How they should rule over the citizens? Perfect instructions because they are given by liberated sages. They are not conditioned. They are not having the defects of a conditioned soul. So when they give some advice or instruction or direction, they are perfect. So when they give some advice or instruction or direction, they are perfect. So when they give some advice or instruction or direction, they are perfect. They are good for all times, they are good for all places, all kinds of people. They are good for all times, they are good for all places, all kinds of people. They are good for all times, they are good for all places, all kinds of people. Therefore the rules and regulations were standard and without flaw or defect. Therefore the rules and regulations were standard and without flaw or defect. Therefore the rules and regulations were standard and without flaw or defect. No defect, no mistake, no limitation of time or place. No defect, no mistake, no limitation of time or place. No defect, no mistake, no limitation of time or place.

**Key Quote:** "The state would get the best advice without expenditure."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the council of advisors of kings like Pariksit, consisting of great sages and Brahmanas who provided selfless advice without expecting salaries, highlighting the benefits of the Vedic system.

No defect, no mistake, no limitation of time or place. Kings like Maharaj Pariksit had their council of advisors. Kings like Maharaj Pariksit had their council of advisors. And all the members of that council were either great sages or brahmanas of the first order. So who constituted this council of advisors of Parikshit Maharaj? All great sages, liberated souls. They did not accept any salary, nor had they any need for such salaries. These brahmanas, they were not paid by the king. Unlike modern day advisors, the IAS officers or the council of ministers, everyone is paid. Of course they need to take some salary, because they don't have any other means of subsistence. But in the former times, the brahmanas would give advice, they would not accept any salary. The state would get the best advice without expenditure. You see, this is the wonderful system in the Vedic times. The state would get the best advice because they are the topmost people, intelligent people, well versed in chastity. And they would not charge any fees. They would not take any salary. So without any expenditure, the state is getting the best advice. Now these kings, they were themselves samadarshi, equal to everyone, both man and animal. Sorry, the brahmanas. They were equal to both man and animal. This is important in the modern context. They would not advise the king to give. They would not give protection to man and instruct him to kill the poor animals. That is not the way to run the state administration. That human beings, they deserve protection. But animals, they can be sent to the slaughterhouse.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the superficial happiness of a 'fool's paradise' with the genuine happiness that self-realized souls can provide, ensuring well-being in both this life and the next.

Now, such council members were not fools or representatives to compose a fool's paradise. What is a fool's paradise? A person who in ignorance thinks he is very happy and everything is fine, without being able to perceive potential trouble or impending danger. That's called a fool's paradise. So these brahmanas simply would not give instructions in such a way that, oh, everything is very nice. Everything is going on first class. No. There is no internal dwelling. They were all self-realized souls. And they knew perfectly well how all living being in this state would be happy, both in this life and the next. Both in this life and the next. People can be happy in this life, as well as in the next, in the future, also. They were not concerned with hedonistic philosophy of eat, drink, and be merry and enjoy. No. So they were actually able to give perfect advice, perfect instruction for everyone to be happy.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam 1.16.10, explaining that it describes how Maharaja Parikshit perceived the influence of Kali Yuga entering his kingdom.

In this session we will be discussing from the 10th verse of the 16th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Sūta Vāca Yadā Parikṣit Kuru Jāngale Avasat Kalim Praviṣṭam Nija Chakra Vartite Nishamya Vārtām Anathipriyāṃ Tatah Sharāsanam Samyuga Saundirādade. The meaning of this verse is: Sūta Gosvāmī said while Mahārāja Parikṣit was residing in the capital of the Kuru Empire, the symptoms of the age of Kali began to infiltrate within the jurisdiction of his state. When he learned about this, he did not think the matter very palatable. This did, however, give him a chance to fight. He took up his bow and arrows and prepared himself for military activities. So, as the title of this chapter indicates, how Parikṣit received his military service.

**Key Quote:** "Actually, Kali Yuga began when Krishna departed for his personal abode after winding up his pastimes."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the timeline of Kali Yuga's influence, connecting it to Krishna's departure and Yudhishthira's retirement.

He received the age of Kali. So, the appearance of Parikṣit was at the end of Dwapar Yuga and the beginning of Kali Yuga. And the age of Kali is symptomized, as Srila Prabhupāda will explain in this purport, by so many sinful activities. Kali is called Adharma Bandhu, friend of irreligion. So, irreligion is prominent in Kali Yuga. So, therefore, this Kali Yuga began when Parikṣit Mahārāja was ruling. Actually, Kali Yuga began when Krishna departed for his personal abode after winding up his pastimes. But, still, as long as Krishna was there, sorry, Kali Yuga began when the battle of Kurukshetra ended. But, as long as Krishna was present, Kali Yuga could not exert its influence on the people. As soon as Krishna departed from this world, after winding up his pastimes, the influence of Kali began to affect the people of this earth planet. So, it is said here, Yudhishthira Mahārāja, he decided to retire from his kingly duties when he learnt about the disappearance of Lord Krishna. And he handed over the charge to Mahārāja Parikṣit to rule the entire world.

**Key Quote:** "A king is responsible for people to understand the real ultimate goal of life as human beings, that is self-realization."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the responsibilities of a king, highlighting that a king should guide citizens towards self-realization and spiritual culture.

Now, the description is being given that Parikṣit Mahārāja performed Ashwamedha Yajña and he was ruling. So, it is described here, while he was residing in his capital, the symptoms of the age of Kali began to infiltrate within the jurisdiction of his state. And he was not very happy about it, because the symptoms of the age of Kali are all indicative of people taking to sinful activities. Parikṣit being an ideal representative of the Supreme Lord, he protects his citizens from engaging in sinful activities. Because a king rules the kingdom, not only for providing the people with their material needs, or arranging for their material necessities, but more importantly, a king is responsible for people to understand the real ultimate goal of life as human beings, that is self-realization. And he arranges for their preparation to go back home, back to Godhead, by having spiritual culture disseminated in the entire kingdom.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Parikshit Maharaja decided to act against the symptoms of Kali Yuga, which are defined as illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication, and gambling.

So when Parikṣit learnt about the symptoms of the age of Kali infiltrating his kingdom, then he decided to deal with the matter by taking up his bow and arrows and prepared himself for military activities. He decided to go and examine where exactly are these symptoms very prominent, in which part of the kingdom. So Śrīla Prabhupāda says in the purport, the state administration of Mahārāja Parīkṣit was so perfect that he was sitting in his capital peacefully. He was such an able administrator that all the subordinate kings were paying the taxes properly and carrying out their duties in their own respective smaller zones very nicely. And they had the full protection of Parīkṣit himself and his army. So everything was going on nicely, but he got the news that the symptoms of the age of Kali had already infiltrated into the jurisdiction of his state and he did not like this news. So Śrīla Prabhupāda now explains what are the symptoms of the age of Kali. This is very important for us to understand. We are all living in Kali Yuga. What are the symptoms of the age of Kali? They are four. Four symptoms of the age of Kali, particularly prominent. What are they? The first one is illicit connection with women. The second one is indulgence in meat eating. The third one is intoxication. And the fourth one is taking pleasure in gambling.

**Summary:** The speaker connects the four sinful activities to the age of quarrel (Kali Yuga) and explains that Parikshit wanted to prevent unrest by addressing these issues.

Over and above this, it is mentioned here, the age of Kali literally means the age of quarrel. Kali means, it comes from the word Kalaha. Kalaha means quarrel. And the above mentioned four symptoms in human society are the root causes for all kinds of quarrel. You see how these four symptoms of the age of Kali are linked up to so many quarrels taking place in Kali Yuga over trifles. So Maharaj Parikshit heard that some of the people of the state had already taken to those symptoms. And he wanted to take immediate steps against such causes of unrest. That means, as long as people are not sinful

**Key Quote:** "Nowadays you see the symptoms of Kali that it is prevalent amongst so many people."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the restricted nature of sinful activities in earlier times with their widespread prevalence in Kali Yuga, using the example of the increase in non-vegetarianism in India.

with regard to these four sinful activities, particularly meat eating, intoxication, gambling, and illicit sex. As long as people don't take to these four sinful activities as a routine, it's not that in early ages, nobody was eating meat, no. Meat eating was under heavy restriction. And that also some real low-class people, they would indulge in meat eating or intoxication, gambling or illicit sex very restrictedly. So it is not prevalent in human society in a big way. Nowadays you see the symptoms of Kali that it is prevalent amongst so many people. Just to give you an idea how as Kali progresses, these sinful activities become more and more prominent among the mass of people. When India got independence, this is the statistics I am giving from some census data that was published recently. When India got independence in 1947, overall population of the whole country, the percentage of vegetarians was 75% and non-vegetarians was 25%. Sometime in 2010, the census was again done and they said, according to the census, I'll survey, the percentage of people who are non-vegetarians had jumped up to 75%. And percentage of people who are still vegetarians in 2010 was 25%. So you see, just tripled the number of non-vegetarians. So, this is the influence of the age of Kali, how the mass of people take to sinful activities, that means they unrestrictedly indulge in sinful activities.

**Key Quote:** "Pariksit Maharaj being the ideal king...he wanted to take action or steps against such causes of unrest."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates Parikshit's role as an ideal king who took action against sinful activities, contrasting it with the open promotion and ignorance surrounding these activities in modern times.

Now, Pariksit Maharaj being the ideal king at the beginning of Kali Yuga, he wanted to take action or steps against such causes of unrest. So, Prabhupada says, this means that at least up to the regime of Maharaj Pariksit, such symptoms of public life were practically unknown. And as soon as they were slightly detected, he wanted to root them out. That means people could not freely indulge in meat-eating, intoxication, gambling, publicly. Some remote place, some rare instance, some real low-class fallen person may do it occasionally. But not that there are advertisements everywhere. Come, enjoy meat-eating, intoxication, gambling, illicit sex. Of course, we don't see advertisements in India for illicit sex openly, but neither for gambling, but for intoxication, you see boats, bar, bar and restaurant, pub, and non-vegetarian food, so much advertisement. So, this means that people openly indulge in it and they are not conscious, they are not aware many times that it is sinful and sinful activities are the cause of our suffering. People are ignorant.

**Key Quote:** "It is only by bad association it is only by bad influence it is only by enticement by other sinful people that somebody really becomes addicted or habituated to sinful activities"
**Summary:** The speaker argues that sinful habits are not innate but are acquired through bad association and influence, emphasizing the importance of culture and religion in avoiding such activities.

People are victimized by bad influence. It's not that people are born with some habit like meat-eating or intoxication. Prabhupada says that. Nobody is born with a cigarette in his mouth no, and as soon as a child is born what is he fed? He's fed the mother's milk, correct? So it's not true that right from birth somebody is a non-veteran or a person who indulges in the sinful activities no, it is only by bad association, it is only by bad influence, it is only by enticement by other sinful people that somebody really becomes addicted or habituated to sinful activities. So Pariksit Maharaj he decided to root out these symptoms of Kali. So even though Kali Yuga is destined to be an age of sinful activities, it doesn't mean that the king should sit back and say after all it is destined so I don't have to bother about it no. Maharaj Pariksit as his duty to save the citizens from the association of agents of Kali, he wanted to punish the miscreants indulging in the symptoms of Kali and thus save the innocent citizens were pure in habit by culture of religion, you see our culture is very culture is to avoid sinful

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by highlighting the vegetarian culture in certain Indian states and reiterating the king's duty to protect citizens from sinful activities, praising Parikshit's actions.

activities almost completely, that is the culture. Just like even today in the state of Gujarat and Rajasthan it is recorded in the census data, most of the people are vegetarians in these two states particularly Gujarat and Rajasthan, maximum people are vegetarians, so that is the kind of culture that is there, that was the culture that is prevalent in the whole country, but in course of time people became more and more degraded and the influence was more. So Srila Prabhupada says it is a duty of the king to give such protection and Maharaj Pariksit was perfectly right when he prepared himself to fight against miscreants who indulge in sinful activities. I'll stop here.

### royal procession, Vedic aesthetics, Pariksit Maharaj, Arjuna

**Key Quote:** "Even a royal procession...is a sign of a civilization that is aesthetic even on the fighting front."
**Summary:** This segment describes Maharaj Pariksit's procession and compares it to Arjuna's, highlighting the Vedic culture's aesthetic sense even in warfare.

In this session we will be discussing from two verses, the eleventh and the twelfth verses of the sixteenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The eleventh verse. The meaning of this verse is, Maharaj Pariksit sat on a chariot drawn by black horses, Shyamaturanga. His flag was marked with the sign of a lion, Mrigendra Dhwajam, being so decorated and surrounded by charioteers, cavalry, elephants and infantry. Cavalry is soldiers on horseback, infantry is soldiers on foot. And there were warriors or soldiers on chariots and soldiers on elephant back. He left the capital to conquer in all directions. So, Pariksit Maharaj is going to root out the symptoms of Kali from his kingdom, when Kali is just trying to conquer and to infiltrate his kingdom. So, that's the description given here. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, Maharaj Pariksit is distinguished from his grandfather Arjuna, for black horses pulled his chariot instead of white horses. You remember the description of Arjuna's chariot being pulled by white horses. This is the description of the first chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. Both Krishna and Arjuna were seated on a chariot, on a great chariot, Mahatishyandane, Shwetahayai, drawn by white horses. And in contrast to that, Maharaj Pariksit was the grandson of Arjuna. His chariot was being pulled by black horses, Shyamaturangayojitam. Then again, Srila Prabhupada says, the distinction between Pariksit's chariot and Arjuna's chariot. Again, one more difference is, Pariksit marked his flag with the mark of a lion, Mrugendra Dhwajam, and his grandfather Arjuna marked his with the mark of Hanumanji, Kapit Dhwajam. Kapi refers to Hanuman. A royal procession like that of Maharaj Pariksit, surrounded by well decorated chariots, cavalry, elephants, infantry, and band, not only is pleasing to the eyes, but also is a sign of a civilization that is aesthetic even on the fighting front. There is a good sense of aesthetics in everything people did in the Vedic culture, even a royal procession. The king is proceeding to conquer all directions. The emperor. He is not just a king. He is an emperor. So he is surrounded by beautifully decorated chariots, elephants, infantry. So this is very very pleasing to the eyes to see, and also this indicates how well prepared he was to actually give protection to the citizens, innocent citizens, or the well behaved citizens.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Pariksit then conquered all parts of the earthly planet...and exacted tributes from their respective rulers."
**Summary:** This segment explains Maharaj Pariksit's conquests and the division of the earth into Dvipas and Varshas, focusing on Jambudvipa.

The twelfth verse. Bhadrashvam ketum alamcha bharatam chottaran kuram kim purushadini varshani vijitya jagrihe balim. So these are names of different parts of the earthly planet that Pariksit conquered. So in the translation. The translation is as follows. Maharaj Pariksit then conquered all parts of the earthly planet, Bhadrashva, Ketumala, Bharata, the Northern Kuru, Kim Purusha, etc., and exacted tributes from their respective rulers. The system was the subordinate kings had to pay a portion of the tax they collected from their citizens to the emperor. So Maharaj Pariksit went to different parts of his kingdom, that means the whole world, earthly planet, and exacted the taxes from the respective rulers. So Srila Prabhupada gives a brief description of these different parts that were the parts of the earth, as divided during the time of Maharaj Pariksit. So first of all in the purport he describes Bhadrashva Varsha. It is a tract of land near Meru Parvata, and it extends from Gandhamadana Parvata to the salt water ocean. There is a description of this Varsha in the Mahabharata, in the Bhishma Parva 7th chapter verses 14 to 18. Mahabharata is the history of greater India. So it is called Itihasa. It is compiled by Vyasadeva. So Srila Prabhupada is quoting from this, that this Bhadrashva Varsha is described in this particular portion of the Mahabharata. The description was narrated by Sanjaya to Dhritarashtra about this Bhadrashva Varsha. Maharaj Yudhishthira also conquered this Varsha, and thus the province was included within the jurisdiction of his empire. Maharaj Pariksit was formally declared to be the emperor of all lands ruled by his grandfather, but still he had to establish his supremacy while he was out of his capital to exact tribute from such states. The king is not simply a namesake king. He has got his power to rule, and he challenges the subordinate kings. If they accept his supremacy then there is no fighting. Otherwise there is a battle fought between the two kings, and whoever is victorious becomes the ruler. Ketumala Varsha. Another part of his kingdom. This earth planet is divided into seven Dvipas by seven oceans, and the central Dvipa called Jambudvipa is divided into nine Varshas, or parts, by eight huge mountains. See. The whole earth planet, even as we know it today, there are so many oceans, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Atlantic Ocean, like that. So there are seven oceans dividing the earth planet into seven islands. The land mass between two oceans, surrounded by water is called an island.

**Key Quote:** "So, a description of this Varsha or this part of the world is available in the Mahabharata in Sabha Parva, 28th chapter, 6th verse."
**Summary:** This segment details the different Varshas within Jambudvipa, referencing descriptions from the Mahabharata and highlighting the characteristics of each region and its inhabitants.

Dvipa. So Saptva Dvipa Vasundhara. This is a description in the Mahabharata. The earth planet is divided into seven islands, and the central island is called Jambudvipa. Dvipa means island. Jambudvipa. And this Jambudvipa, the central part, central island, is divided into nine Varshas, or nine parts, called Varshas. Dvipa and Varsha. So the names here, Ketumala Varsha, Bhadrasho Varsha, and, sorry, Bharata Varsha, Ilaavrata Varsha, Kimpurusha Varsha, like that. There are nine Varshas, nine divisions. And how are these nine divisions made? In the central island, in the Jambudvipa, by eight huge mountains separating some tracts of land. So, a description of this Varsha or this part of the world is available in the Mahabharata in Sabha Parva, 28th chapter, 6th verse. So, Prabhupada gives the reference also. Somebody is interested in the details of the description of this Varsha can refer Mahabharata, that particular portion. Further, Srila Prabhupada says, it is said that this part of the world is situated on the western side of Meru Parvata and inhabitants of this province used to live up to 10,000 years, as per the reference in the Mahabharata, Bhishma Parva, 6th chapter, 31st verse. Human beings living in this part of the globe are of golden color and the women resemble the angels of heaven. The inhabitants are free from all kinds of diseases and grief. This is the description of the Mahabharata. Next is Bharata Varsha. This part of the world is also one of the nine Varshas of Jambudvipa, Bharata Varsha. A description of Bharata Varsha is given in the Mahabharata, Bhishma Parva, chapters 9 and 10. In the center of Jambudvipa is Ilaavrata Varsha and south of Ilaavrata Varsha is Hari Varsha. The description of these Varshas is given in the Mahabharata, Sabha Parva, 28th chapter, verses 7 and 8. That Prabhupada quotes here. It is mentioned here that the women in both these Varshas are beautiful and some of them are equal to the Apsaras or heavenly women.

**Key Quote:** "In other words, Maharaja Parikshit conquered all the world, all the different parts of the world."
**Summary:** This segment continues describing the Varshas, including Uttarakuru and Kimpurusha, referencing the Mahabharata, and summarizes Maharaj Pariksit's conquest of the entire world.

That's the description in the Mahabharata. Next, Srila Prabhupada describes Uttarakuru Varsha. According to Vedic geography, the northernmost portion of Jambudvipa is called Uttarakuru Varsha. Uttara means north. It is surrounded by the saltwater ocean from three sides and divided by Sringavan Mountain from the Hiranyamaya Varsha. That's the description in the Mahabharata. Next, Kimpurusha Varsha is stated to be situated north of the great Himalayan mountain, which is 80,000 miles in length and height and which covers 16,000 miles in width, the Himalayan mountain. These parts of the world were also conquered by Arjuna as described in Mahabharata's Sabha Parva, chapter 28, verses 1 and 2, the Kimpurushas are descendants of a daughter of Daksha. When Maharaja Yudhishthira performed a horse sacrifice, the inhabitants of these countries were also present to take part in the festival and they paid tributes to the emperor Yudhishthira. This part of the world is called Kimpurusha Varsha or sometimes the Himalayan provinces. It is said that Sukadeva Goswami is born. He was born in these Himalayan provinces and that he came to Bharat Varsha after crossing the Himalayan countries. So, to summarize this whole thing, Srila Prabhupada says, In other words, Maharaja Parikshit conquered all the world, all the different parts of the world. He conquered all the continents adjoining all the seas and oceans in all directions, namely the eastern, western, northern and southern parts of the world. So, all the Dvipas and in the central Jambudvipa, all the Varshas. He conquered all the parts and became the emperor of the entire, and actually, he exacted the taxes from all the rulers of these different provinces.

**Key Quote:** "Wherever the king visited, he continuously heard the glories of his great forefathers who were all devotees of the Lord."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's translation of the verses is read, followed by an explanation of the verses, focusing on Parikshit's hearing the glories of his forefathers and Krishna's protection.

given by Srila Prabhupada is as follows: Wherever the king visited, he continuously heard the glories of his great forefathers who were all devotees of the Lord. That means basically the Pandavas. All the Pandavas were great devotees of Krishna, Keshava, and also of the glorious acts of Lord Krishna. People used to describe the forefathers of Parikshit and even the glorious activities of Krishna, because Krishna was also ruling Dwaraka when Yudhishthira was ruling in Hastinapur. So Parikshit also heard how he himself had been protected by the Lord from the powerful heat of the weapon of Ashwatthama. Parikshit's birth was extraordinary. He's protected by Krishna even when he was in his mother's womb. He was attempted to be killed by Ashwatthama at the end of the battle of Kurukshetra, but Krishna saved him in his mother's womb. So that also people were glorified. People also mentioned the great affection between the descendants of Vrishni and Prutha due to the latter's great devotion to Lord Keshava. The descendants of Kunti, that is the Pandavas, and descendants of Vrishni, that means the family members of Krishna, there was a very nice affection between these two families because Kunti was a pure devotee of Krishna. So therefore, there was a nice affectionate relationship between the Vrishnis and the Pandavas.

So King Parikshit, being very pleased with the singers of such glories, opened his eyes in great satisfaction. Out of magnanimity, he was pleased to award them very valuable necklaces and clothing. He was very pleased to hear. What was he pleased to hear? The glories of Lord Krishna and the glories of Krishna's pure devotees, the Pandavas. And when he was pleased by such an act of glorification of Krishna and his pure devotees, he rewarded the singers with very valuable necklaces and very valuable clothing.

### Vedic culture, welcome addresses, Krishna Samhita

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The subject matter of those welcome addresses was Krishna. This is the most important point."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Vedic culture involves welcoming great personalities with addresses focused on Krishna, highlighting that Srimad Bhagavatam is also known as Krishna Samhita.

So Srila Prabhupada explains a significant point to be noted in these verses. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "Kings and great personalities of the state are presented with welcome addresses." This is the Vedic culture. This is a system from time immemorial, and Maharaj Parikshit, since he was one of the well-known emperors of the world, was also presented with addresses of welcome in all parts of the world as he visited those places. He was a very great emperor, so naturally people would welcome him. A great personality is welcomed when he visits a certain place. People who are conversant with his greatness, they will glorify him for the benefit of everyone else. The subject matter of those welcome addresses was Krishna. This is the most important point. How is it that Krishna is the subject matter of all those welcome addresses when Parikshit was travelling in different parts of his kingdom? Because Parikshit was a great devotee of Krishna. Parikshit's forefathers who were ruling the earth planet, the Pandavas, they were also great devotees of Krishna. So whether somebody glorifies Krishna or Krishna's pure devotees, always the subject matter of such glorification is Krishna. That's why the Bhagavatam, which contains nothing but the glorification of Krishna and his pure devotees, is also called Krishna Samhita. That means it is that special Vedic literature, Samhita means Vedic literature, which is exclusively devoted to descriptions of the glorifications of Krishna.

### Krishna and devotees, inseparability, Bhakti
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/d30rNAe9YZg?t=477

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna and his unalloyed devotees cannot be separated. And therefore, glorifying the devotee means, glorifying the Lord and vice versa."
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the inseparability of Krishna and His devotees, explaining that glorifying a devotee is equivalent to glorifying Krishna, and that true Bhakti is devotion to Krishna alone.

That is the speciality of the Bhagavatam. So therefore, it is called Krishna Samhita. It is a very special literature. Similarly, here it is said, wherever Parikshit went, the welcome addresses that were given to Parikshit, the subject matter was Krishna. So Srila Prabhupada clarifies, "Krishna means Krishna and his eternal devotees as the king means the king and his confidential associates." A king is never alone. When a king travels, he has got his confidential associates. Similarly, Krishna is never alone. Krishna is always with his confidential associates, who are all his devotees. All are his devotees. Krishna is the one and only one Supreme Lord, and everyone else, especially in the spiritual world, everyone else is a devotee. Actually, everyone in the material world also is a devotee of Krishna, but in the material world, people are forgetful of their devotional relationship with Krishna. That is the difference between the spiritual world and the material world. So Srila Prabhupada says, "Krishna and his unalloyed devotees cannot be separated, and therefore, glorifying the devotee means glorifying the Lord and vice versa." So glorification of devotee means it is nothing but glorification of Krishna only, because the object of the devotion of the devotees is Krishna only and nobody else. So when Shastras say Bhakti, Bhakti refers to devotion towards Krishna only and not devotion towards some other material personality, some other object of glorification.

### Bhakti, Krishna consciousness, Parikshit's remembrance
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/d30rNAe9YZg?t=621
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "devotees are all the time thinking of Krishna, speaking about Krishna, remembering Krishna, do every activity for the sake of pleasing Krishna. That is Bhakti."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to define Bhakti as constant remembrance and service to Krishna, illustrating how Parikshit's experiences reminded him of Krishna.

No. Just like they say, Desh Bhakti, devoted to the country. That word Bhakti cannot be used, strictly speaking, for somebody who is very devoted to, who is patriotic. The word Bhakti cannot be used. Bhakti refers to devotion to Krishna only. So even if somebody glorifies the devotee, that glorification will necessarily be glorification of Krishna only, because devotees are all the time thinking of Krishna, speaking about Krishna, remembering Krishna, doing every activity for the sake of pleasing Krishna. That is Bhakti. So Srila Prabhupada further says, "Maharaj Pariksit would not have been glad to hear about the glories of his forefathers like Maharaj Yudhishthir and Arjuna had they not been connected with the activities of Lord Krishna." This is a characteristic of a devotee. He is not simply attached to his family members like ordinary people are. No. His attachment is for devotees. His attachment is for Krishna and Krishna's devotees. The devotees are glorified by the presence of the Lord because they cannot live for a moment without the presence of the Lord and His different energies. This is the symptom of a devotee. A devotee always wants the presence of the Lord. And how does a devotee always be in the presence of the Lord? By constantly thinking of Him, by constantly remembering Him, by constantly chanting His name, by constantly hearing about His glories, by constantly engaging in different acts of devotion and service to Lord Krishna. So therefore, Maharaj Pariksit felt the presence of the Lord when Krishna was glorified by His activities, especially when Pariksit was saved by Lord Krishna in the womb of His mother. So that reminded him of Krishna. Whatever glorification people did simply reminded Pariksit of Krishna.

### Krishna's protection, dangers in material world, Krishna Leela
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/d30rNAe9YZg?t=796
**Verse References:** BG 1.1
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The material world is full of joy. There are dangers at every step."
**Summary:** The lecture discusses how Krishna protects devotees in the dangerous material world, using the example of the Pandavas' involvement in the battle of Kurukshetra as part of Krishna's Leela.

So therefore, Krishna was the only object of glorification in all such welcome addresses. That is the important point. So Srila Prabhupada explains, "The material world is full of joy. There are dangers at every step." That's the description of the Bhagavatam, padam, padam, yat vipadam, every step there is danger, and the devotees sometimes are apparently placed into dangerous positions, and when they are saved by the Supreme Lord Krishna, Krishna becomes glorified. See, this is the description that is there in the scriptures. Sometimes devotees are also put into dangers, but devotees have no other shelter other than Krishna. So when they are in danger, especially devotees pray to Krishna, they think of Krishna, they seek shelter in Krishna's lotus feet, and Krishna is always very, very, very attentive to his devotees. First of all, devotees cannot be harmed by anybody. In case, apparently, they are harmed by anybody, immediately Krishna is there to save the devotees, as is in the current Bhagavad Gita. So Srila Prabhupada says, "Krishna would not have been glorified as speaker of Bhagavad Gita had his devotees like the Pandavas not been entangled in the battle of Kurukshetra." See, the Pandavas' involvement in the battle of Kurukshetra is part of Krishna's Leela for what purpose? Many multiple purposes, that Krishna came to reduce the burden of this earth planet which is overburdened by demons. So Pandavas assisted Krishna by fighting in the battlefield of Kurukshetra and killing those demons or demoniac Nietzsche persons. So they are simultaneously participating in Krishna Leela and also reducing the burden of this world, which was Krishna's purpose of descent.

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "nowadays also there are presentations of welcome address but people glorify or flatter"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the authentic glorification of the past with the often insincere flattery prevalent in modern welcome addresses, also noting the lack of genuine rewards.

So Srila Prabhupada also says nowadays also there are presentations of welcome address, but people glorify or flatter, that's the correct word, the leaders, even though it's allowed to say the word of God of abundance, these people, junkies, or leaders, or the great personalities, but always such glorification is not factual, simply for pleasing the person. They may say so many things. He or she may or may not be actually worthy of all such glorification. The singers of the glories of the great kings would not simply flatter them by some false statements, no never. And also the Kings would actually reward the singers with nice presentations, but nowadays where is such a reward being given? Because they themselves are not sufficiently rich, and if they are rich, they are not willing to part with their wealth. So there is a difference between the way formerly great personality used to be received and welcomed and rewarded.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Pariksit heard that out of his causeless mercy Lord Krishna, or Vishnu, who is universally obeyed, rendered all kinds of service to the malleable sons of Pandu"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 16th verse of the 16th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining how Lord Krishna, despite being supreme, served the Pandavas, inspiring devotion in Maharaj Pariksit.

In this session we will be discussing from the 16th verse of the 16th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is a very important verse. It is a very nice verse. Sarathya Parashada Sevana Sakya Dautya Veerasana Anugamana Stavana Pranaman Snigdheshu Pandushu Jagat Pranathimcha Vishno Bhaktim Karo Tindrapathish Charanara Vinde. Beautiful verse. What is the meaning of this verse? Maharaj Pariksit heard that out of his causeless mercy Lord Krishna, or Vishnu, who is universally obeyed, rendered all kinds of service to the malleable sons of Pandu by accepting posts ranging from chariot driver to president, to messenger, friend, night watchman, etc. according to the will of the Pandavas, obeying them like a servant and offering obeisances like one younger in years. When Pariksit heard this, he became overwhelmed with devotion to the lotus feet of the Lord.

### pure devotion, material contamination, bhakti

**Key Quote:** "When somebody performs bhakti for some material benefit, then such bhakti is called materially contaminated bhakti."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of pure devotion (unalloyed bhakti) versus devotion contaminated by material desires, emphasizing that true bhakti aims to awaken love for Krishna and purify oneself.

What a beautiful description here. So the people were describing, glorifying Krishna, that Krishna, even though he is a supreme Lord, he is obeyed universally by everybody, everyone else is a servant. He is the only master. But, because of his affection for his devotees, Krishna agrees to become a servant of his devotees. He is willing to pay obeisances to his devotee even though he is the superior in all circumstances. He is the supreme in all circumstances. So, Shrila Prabhupada says in the purport, Lord Krishna is everything to the unalloyed devotees like the Pandavas. Unalloyed devotees means pure devotees. Their bhakti is not mixed with any material contamination. What are the material contaminations in our rendering devotional service? When somebody performs bhakti for some material benefit, then such bhakti is called materially contaminated bhakti, because bhakti should be rendered only for the sake of awakening our love for Krishna, awakening our devotion to Krishna, for the sake of becoming purified of all material contamination, not increasing the material contamination, not keeping the material contamination very, very securely. No. That's not real bhakti.

### pure devotion, material desires, gold analogy

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Similarly, when we say bhakti in the scriptures, when it is said bhakti, it means pure devotion. 100% devotion to Krishna."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of gold purity (carats), the speaker explains that pure devotion is free from any material desires and is 100% dedicated to Krishna.

Though sometimes that also is called bhakti. When somebody prays to Krishna, I want some wealth or I want some relief from some disease, this is called bhakti. Bhakti which is contaminated by material desires. So the Pandavas and many such great devotees described and glorified in the Bhagavatam are all pure devotees, unalloyed devotees, just like pure gold. So unalloyed, that is no mixture of any other metal. Pure gold. Similarly, pure bhakti. Bhakti means pure bhakti. Of course, nowadays they have a concept of 18 carat gold or 16 carat gold. That means it's not pure gold. 16 parts out of 24 are gold. So that means 8 parts, 1/3 of that ornament is actually some other cheaper metal like copper or some other metal. So that's not pure gold. So 16 carat gold strictly cannot be called gold. When you say gold, we mean pure gold. Similarly, when we say bhakti in the scriptures, when it is said bhakti, it means pure devotion, 100% devotion to Krishna. And what is that 100% devotion? No material desires, free from all material desires. So whenever somebody renders devotional service to Krishna, it should be free from any material desires. That's called unalloyed devotion.

**Key Quote:** "Simply to please Krishna by one's service. That's all."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the sole purpose of rendering devotional service to Krishna is to please Him, as exemplified by the pure devotion of the Pandavas.

Pure devotion. Real devotion. If there is no material desire or material ambition to be fulfilled while rendering service to Krishna, then why render service at all? So there is a certain particular purpose in rendering devotional service to Krishna and that is only for one purpose: simply to please Krishna by one's service. That's all. So all pure devotees render service to Krishna only to please him and for no other purpose. So the Pandavas, they are pure devotees. They render service to Krishna simply for the sake of pleasing Krishna. So for the Pandavas, Krishna was the supreme lord, the spiritual master, the worshipable deity, the guide, the chariot driver, the friend, the servant, the messenger, and everything they could conceive of.

**Key Quote:** "In their intimate relationship, devotees forget Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the intimate relationship between devotees and Krishna, where devotees sometimes forget Krishna's supreme position, allowing for deeper loving service, using the examples of Arjuna and Mother Yashoda.

Why would the Pandavas make Krishna their chariot driver, Arjuna? Why did he make Krishna his chariot driver? If he has got devotion to Krishna, how can he even think of asking Krishna, can you please be my chariot driver when I fight in the battle? This is because of the intimate relationship between Arjuna and Krishna. That's described in the scriptures. Intimate relationship. In their intimate relationship, devotees forget Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead. And Krishna also likes the devotees reciprocating with him or serving him intimately while not being conscious of Krishna's supreme position, because that supremacy of Krishna comes in the way of their rendering intimate loving service. Just like Mother Yashoda. If she is conscious that Krishna is the supreme lord, then she cannot show her motherly affection to Krishna. If Krishna becomes naughty, Mother Yashoda does not chastise Krishna, then where is motherly affection? Nor can Mother Yashoda actually do any service in terms of her motherly affection? If she knows Krishna is the supreme lord, where is the question of feeding Krishna? If Krishna is the supreme lord, he never becomes hungry, he is never in need of any food. He is the one who is supplying everybody. He is completely self-satisfied. He is full in himself. He is not in need of any food. He never gets hungry. So, the service is simply for the sake of loving reciprocation between the lord and his pure devotees.

### reciprocity, servant and master, absolute positions, Kurukshetra example

**Key Quote:** "The servant is the master. The master is the servant. There is no difference."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of reciprocity between Krishna and His devotees, where Krishna also serves His devotees to please them, highlighting that the relationship is not like a material master-servant dynamic, using the example of Krishna as Arjuna's chariot driver.

This should be understood. Now, when the devotee renders service to Krishna, to please Krishna, Krishna reciprocates by himself becoming the servant of his devotees, or himself rendering service to the devotees, again to please the devotees. Just like devotees want to please Krishna by serving Krishna, Krishna wants to please his devotees by serving them. Please understand, when scriptures say we are servants of Krishna, the concept of servant of Krishna is not like the concept of servant in the material world. Never mistakenly think that servant means servant like in the material world. No. In the spiritual world, all positions are absolute positions. Prabhupada explains this in another place. The servant is the master. The master is the servant. There is no difference. What is the meaning of that? Like Krishna demonstrated, before the battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna is the lord, or playing the role of the lord, and Arjuna is playing the role of the subordinate to the lord. But on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, Krishna agreed to become the chariot driver of Arjuna, and Arjuna ordered Krishna, please take my chariot between the two armies, so that I can see with whom I have to fight. He is ordering Krishna. Krishna says, okay, according to your order, I will take the chariot between the two armies. So, this is the kind of reciprocation between the lord and his devotees.

### transcendental reciprocation, Krishna's kindness, night watchman, Veera Asana, ecstasy

**Key Quote:** "Krishna acted as a night watchman for the Pandavas, because they were exiled."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how Maharaj Pariksit was overwhelmed by Krishna's kindness and willingness to do anything for His devotees, such as acting as a night watchman for the Pandavas, leading to tears of love and ecstasy.

So, Maharaj Pariksit, as a pure devotee of the lord, he could appreciate the lord's transcendental reciprocation of the feelings of his devotees. And thus, he himself was also overwhelmed with the dealings of the lord. He began to feel Krishna is so kind to his devotees, that he is willing to do anything for his devotee. Just like the Pandavas, Krishna acted as a night watchman for the Pandavas, because they were exiled. And in the forest, you see, they are not with all their army and the security. No. They are without that. So, if there is danger, what happens? Krishna's devotees. So, naturally, when they are in danger as devotees, they think of Krishna. And Krishna immediately responds to his devotees. So, because Pandavas were in forest, and there was danger at night, Krishna used to be guarding the Pandavas as the night watchman. Then they have to take some rest. You see, there is a word used here. Prabhupad says that in this description of what all Krishna was to the Pandavas, Veera Asana. Veera Asana, Krishna accepted the post of Veera Asana means acceptance of the post of a watchman with a drawn sword at night. Like he is holding a sword and waiting upon the Pandavas that nobody should harm the Pandavas. If somebody comes or attempts to even attack the Pandavas, they are going to be immediately killed with the sword. So, that kind of service Krishna accepted out of his affection for the Pandavas, simply because of affection. So, in this way, Pariksit heard that the dealings of the Lord and his pure devotees is so very sweet, so very relatable, that Pariksit began to feel himself, his devotion towards Krishna being aroused into ecstasy. And out of ecstasy, he began to shed tears of love for Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Hearing about Krishna's activities itself is devotional service. It is completely a transcendental activity. And it purifies us and makes us eligible to go back, come back to God."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing that Krishna's dealings with His devotees are transcendental and free from material contamination, and that hearing about these activities is a form of devotional service that purifies and leads one back to God.

And that is being described here. So, Srila Prabhupada says, even though the Lord's feelings towards, dealings with his devotees appear to be like ordinary human dealings, but the truth is that they are all completely transcendental. They are spiritual reciprocation between Krishna and his pure devotees. They have no tinge of any material contamination in them. There is no material sentiment, that Krishna did this to me, gave me this favour, so now I have to actually do some other favour to Krishna. No. None of those calculations are there. Neither they think, oh, Krishna is powerful, so he is capable of protecting me. No. No such calculation. So, there is a distinct difference between Krishna's activities, his dealings with his devotees, his incarnations, and the conditioned souls performing some activities or relating with other conditioned souls. There is a lot of difference between the two. So, therefore, hearing about Krishna's activities itself is devotional service. It is completely a transcendental activity, and it purifies us and makes us eligible to go back, come back to God. So, I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "So this is the wonderful relationship that exists between Krishna and his pure devotees in the spiritual world. And even in the material world when Krishna incarnates, he comes down with his confidential associates and he demonstrates to us what is life like in the spiritual world."
**Summary:** This segment describes Maharaj Pariksit's rule, the devotion of the Pandavas, and Krishna's willingness to serve his devotees, highlighting the relationship between Krishna and his pure devotees.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devim Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session we will be discussing from two verses, the seventeenth and the eighteenth verses of the sixteenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The seventeenth verse is as follows: Tasyaivam Vartamanasya Purvesham Vrittim Anvaham Natidhure Kilashcharyam Yadasi Tannibodhame. The meaning of this verse is as follows: Now you may hear from me of what happened while Maharaj Pariksit was passing his days hearing of the good occupations of his forefathers and being absorbed in thought of them. So this has reference to the previous few verses in which Suta Goswami is describing the regime of Maharaj Pariksit. If you remember, the Pandavas retired after they heard that Krishna has gone to his personal abode after winding up his pastimes. And before retiring they, Yudhishthira Maharaj handed over charge of ruling the world to Pariksit Maharaj. So Pariksit Maharaj was trained, he took charge and he performed, he got married, he had good sons, headed by Janamejaya and he performed three hard sacrifices under the able guidance of qualified Acharyas, Brahmanas and he was ruling very nicely. So when he went out for conquest, he heard everywhere he went how the Pandavas who were ruling before him, actually were great devotees of the Supreme Lord Krishna and how the Pandavas were able to actually get from Krishna anything they desired because of their service attitude towards the Supreme Lord. So it was described, that Krishna, who is the Supreme Lord, he rendered service to the Pandavas by accepting posts ranging from chariot driver to president to messenger to friend to night watchman. Like that, Krishna is willing to do anything for his devotees. And devotees are completely surrendered to Krishna. They simply want to please Krishna in whichever way Krishna wants them to actually serve him. So this is the wonderful relationship that exists between Krishna and his pure devotees in the spiritual world. And even in the material world when Krishna incarnates, he comes down with his confidential associates and he demonstrates to us what is life like in the spiritual world. So that's what Krishna is demonstrating.

**Key Quote:** "So, actually each one of us have got a relationship with Krishna. And we are meant to actually revive that relationship, especially when we have this human form of body."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the importance of reviving our relationship with Krishna, the fundamental questions answered by the Vedas, and the unfavorable conditions of Kali Yuga.

In his relationship with the Pandavas, in his relationship with Kunti, in his relationship with Draupadi, in his relationship with Yashoda, Nanda Maharaj, the whole Brajavasis, the Mathura Nivasis, the Dwarka Nivasis, the Yadu, members of the Yadu dynasty, they were all so attached to Krishna. So, actually each one of us have got a relationship with Krishna. And we are meant to actually revive that relationship, especially when we have this human form of body. Because we realize in the human form of body, I don't want suffering, but it is forced on me. I want to know who am I, I want to know what is my source. Okay. Where was I before birth? What will happen to me after death? So, these questions are best answered in our Vedic literature, the Vedas. They are very special because they answer these fundamental questions. And not only they answer the questions, they show us the way how to be living, really. They continue to stay out of this predicament that we are in right now. We don't want suffering, but suffering is forced on us. So, we can become free from all suffering if we study the Vedas, hear from the Vedas, or learn the Vedas, and adopt a lifestyle which is in accordance with the Vedic principles. The Vedic principles meant for those human beings who want to make a permanent solution to all their problems and get out of all this entanglement. So now Suta Goswami is going to describe when Parikshit Maharaj is ruling and he was passing his days hearing of the good occupation of his forefathers, what happened? I mean, already it has been told that Parikshit was ruling when Kali Yuga was just beginning. So what are the symptoms of Kali and what are the remedies for the specific conditions in Kali Yuga which are unfavorable for peaceful and living and for prosperity of the people. So he is, Suta Goswami is going to describe this now. In the 18th verse he says,

**Key Quote:** "The personality of religious principles, Dharma, was wandering about in the form of a bull, and he met, that is, Dharma, met the personality of earth in the form of a cow, who appeared to grieve like a mother who had lost her child."
**Summary:** This segment explains the symbolism of Dharma as a bull and Mother Earth as a cow, describing their condition at the beginning of Kali Yuga and the state of moral principles.

The meaning of this verse is, now Suta Goswami is addressing the sages of Naimishananya. He is telling, The personality of religious principles, Dharma, was wandering about in the form of a bull, and he met, that is, Dharma, met the personality of earth in the form of a cow, who appeared to grieve like a mother who had lost her child. She had tears in her eyes and the beauty of her body was lost. Thus, Dharma questioned the earth as follows. So what will follow after this 18th verse are the questions, various questions asked by Dharma to Mother Earth. So in the Purport, Srila Prabhupāda comments on this condition of mother earth in the form of a cow in which Dharma found her wandering when he was wandering so Srila Prabhupada says the bull is the emblem of the moral principle what's the meaning of emblem emblem is a symbolic representation of something just like the moral principles that human beings follow in human society are reflected in the condition of the bull and the cow is the representative of the earth so mother earth in the form of a cow is indicating what is the status of the earth in Kali Yuga and bull is indicating the status of the population in terms of moral principles that they follow or don't follow so Srila Prabhupada says when the bull and the cow are in a joyful mood it is to be understood that the people of the world are also in a joyful mood people are happy and are very joyful if the bull and cow are in a joyful mood

**Key Quote:** "Among all the domestic animals, the most important are the bull and the cow."
**Summary:** This segment contrasts domestic and wild animals, emphasizing the importance of protecting the bull and cow in Vedic culture.

these bull and cow are very important domestic animals perhaps you are aware that animals are divided into two categories the domestic and the wild animals wild animals live in the forest and there the law of the jungle prevails. There is no... Ultra virgin. There are so many other words. I have to... They're trying to bring restrictions different governments are telling that animals wild animals should not be exploited for entertaining the people in general. And taming a wild animal that is no longer encouraged or permitted by so many governments. Anyway, so the wild animals live in the jungle and there the very nature of those animals is such that nature regulates them in nature's own way. Whereas these domestic animals, they are dependent for protection and engagement in a specific way on the human society. Just like cows, bulls, goats, sheep, and dogs, and cats. All these are domestic animals. They very easily are befriended by any human being. Very easily. And they give some service and they are also taken care. They are given some food or they are given some shelter or they are given some kind of protection. There is reciprocation also with these domestic animals. So, among all the domestic animals, the most important are the bull and the cow. Why? So, Prabhupada says because the bull is the emblem of moral principles in human society and cow is the representative of the earth. And scriptures, the Vedic scriptures especially recommend that human society should particularly protect the bull and the cow.

**Key Quote:** "So, if the cow and bull are protected for the good of human society, then there is advancement of Brahmanical culture."
**Summary:** This segment explains the benefits of protecting the bull and cow for human society and the negative consequences of mistreating them, linking it to the decline of Brahmanical culture and spiritual values.

Particularly they should protect the bull and the cow. Why? Because the bull helps production of grains in the agricultural field. Not only production of grains. The bulls are used in so many ways, at least in the Vedic culture, for drawing water from the well, for removing the husk from the grains after they are grown, for extracting oil from oilseeds, for transportation. The bull can pull. It has got an immense amount of strength to do all these activities. And the cow delivers milk, the miracle of aggregate food values. So, cow is specially meant for giving us milk, which is meant for our well-being, that it contains all the nourishment and nutrition that we require as human beings, particularly the cow's milk is highlighted. So, if the cow and bull are protected for the good of human society, then there is advancement of Brahmanical culture. Brahmanical culture is a culture meant for self-realization, spiritual realization, spiritual advancement. And if the bull and cow are neglected, or worse still, they are killed for being eaten as food. So, that is done by people who do not know the value of Brahmanical culture. They are uncultured, uncivilized, non-Brahmanical people. They have no spiritual values in life. They have no higher goal in life. Simply they live like for eating, sleeping, mating, defending, like animals they live. So, then if the cow and bull are mistreated, then the whole human society has to suffer in so many ways. And that is what is going to be described in the next few verses. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker presents the translation of Srimad Bhagavatam 1.16.19, where Dharma, in the form of a bull, inquires about the well-being of Mother Earth, represented as a cow, and notices her grief.

In this session we will be discussing from the 19th verse of the 16th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Dharmavacha Kachit Bhadre Anamayam Atmanaste Vichayasi Mlayateshan Mukhena Alakshaye Bhavateem Antaradhim Dure Bandhum Shochasi Kanchanam Ba The translation of this 19th verse. Dharma in the form of a bull asked madam, addressing the cow, "Are you not hale and hearty? Why are you covered with the shadow of grief? It appears by your face that you have become black. Are you suffering from some internal disease? Or are you thinking of some relative who is away in a distant place?"

**Key Quote:** "You are covered with the shadow of grief... Are you suffering from some internal disease? Or are you thinking of some relative who is away in a distant place?"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the verse, explaining the meaning of each question posed by Dharma, highlighting the cow's distress, potential internal suffering, and possible separation from a loved one.

So this symbolic representation of the condition of human society reflected in the condition of the cow, the representative of mother earth, the cow. And even the condition of the bull, that will be described in the next verse, the condition of the bull. So dharma is inquiring from mother earth, madam addressing Bhadre. This is a respectful way of addressing a lady in the samsara. In Sanskrit language, Bhadre, madam. Are you not hale and hearty? Are you not keeping good health? Are you not happy? Why are you covered with the shadow of grief? That means not only is mother earth unhappy, but she is unhappy about something which seems like it is a cause for distress or unhappiness. Continues to linger for a long time. It's not something which comes and immediately goes away. It's not like a pinprick. That momentarily there is some pain and after the cause for the pinprick is removed then the pain is gone. It's not like that. You are covered with the shadow of grief. And it appears by your face that you have become black. That means the pain has been there. The problem of this cause for the pain has been there, and your face has become black because you have been suffering for quite some time, a good length of time. Are you suffering from some internal disease? And what is the cause of your pain? Why are you suffering? Some internal disease? Is there some disease that has afflicted you? Or are you thinking of some relative who is away in a distant place? You are separated from your relative, and you are not able to live together happily. You are separated, and you are not able to actually be together due to some reason.

### Kali Yuga, Anxiety, Suffering, Sadhus, Devotees

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "This exactly reflects the condition of people in this present age Kali Yuga... Sadhus means they live for welfare of others... He is unhappy because of others unhappiness."
**Summary:** The speaker connects the verse to the current age of Kali Yuga, explaining how the anxieties and suffering described are prevalent today, and defines the role of a sadhu as someone who is compassionate and concerned about the suffering of others.

So Aushriya Prabhupada very nicely explains that this exactly reflects the condition of people in this present age, Kali Yuga. We can relate with it because as Prabhupada explains, this is our position today in Kali Yuga. Shriya Prabhupada says in the purport, "The people of the world in this age of Kali are always full of anxieties." In the beginning of the first chapter, when the sages Naimisharanya could foresee the conditions of people in Kali Yuga, fourth coming age Kali Yuga, at the end of Dwapar Yuga, then they were anxiously inquiring from Suta Goswami, what is the remedy for people's problems in Kali Yuga? Because these saintly persons, they are called sadhus. And sadhus means they live for welfare of others. They themselves are situated in Krishna consciousness, God consciousness so they are happy, and they have solved their problems by God consciousness, by being in God consciousness. But they can't tolerate to see the suffering of the other people who are not in God consciousness, who suffers in this material world especially in Kali Yuga, those who are not God conscious. So the saintly persons who are happy because of being God conscious, they can't tolerate to see the suffering of others. Therefore they want a remedy to remove the suffering of the people in general. How can their suffering be removed? How can they become happy? This is the position of the sadhu. Sadhu is not a person with a big beard, with some big tilak, with some saffron dress. That is not a real sadhu. Those may be external symbols to indicate to somebody else that I am a sadhu, but real symptom of a sadhu is, Paradukhe Dukhi. Actually sadhu means a devotee, a genuine devotee of Krishna, because a genuine devotee is, Paradukhe Dukhi. He is unhappy because of others unhappiness.

**Key Quote:** "A devotee of Krishna has no reason to be unhappy on his own account. But he is unhappy looking at the condition of the suffering souls... The people of the world in this age of Kali are always full of anxieties."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to describe the suffering in Kali Yuga, emphasizing that devotees are happy in Krishna consciousness but are pained by the suffering of others, and highlights the anxieties and diseases prevalent in this age.

Himself he is not unhappy on his own account, because a devotee by practicing Krishna consciousness, by being in Krishna consciousness, he is always happy in Krishna consciousness. Krishna is the protector, Krishna is the maintainer, Krishna is the provider, Krishna is the servitor of his devotees. So a devotee of Krishna has no reason to be unhappy on his own account, but he is unhappy looking at the condition of the suffering souls who are bereft of God consciousness, who are non-devotees. So in this age of Kali, the sages of Naimisharan were pointing out to Suta Goswami, Upadrutaha. People are always disturbed in the mind. That means the mind is full of anxieties. That is what Prabhupada is telling here, "The people of the world in this age of Kali are always full of anxieties." Some reason will be there for them to be filled with anxiety. So it is said here by Srila Prabhupada, "Everyone is diseased with some kind of ailment." Needless to say, hospitals are prospering in business, in doing business. The private hospitals of course, not the government hospitals. The private hospitals are prospering, and hospital beds are not available, not easily available, specially during the pandemic and after the pandemic. So many cases of sickness, ailments. People are suffering in so many ways, even before the pandemic, because of Kali Yuga. People have some heart problem, people have some cancer, some people have some kidney problem, some people are diabetic, some people have got high blood pressure, and there are accidents, and there is nutritional deficiency. Constitutionally some people are weak, so they are susceptible to fall sick because of not having the necessary nourishment. The food is, I mean I can go on like this. It can be very lengthy tale of woe, but it is a fact. People suffer in so many ways in this present age, but some kind of ailment. Very few people are very healthy and very cheerful, free from anxieties, very few people. Then further Prabhupada says, "From the very faces of the people of this age, one can find out the index of the mind." This is another saying in the scriptures, "The face is the index of the mind." If you look at somebody's face, you can understand whether they are internally happy or not happy. You can make out. So you look at the face of people in general in Kali Yuga, most people, you can make out that they are not happy.

**Key Quote:** "Everyone practically feels the absence of his or her relative who is away from home... The particular symptom of the age of Kali is that no family is now blessed to live together."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the breakdown of the joint family system and the separation of family members due to work and other circumstances in Kali Yuga, contributing to unhappiness and anxiety.

Everyone feels the absence of his relative who is away from home. First thing is, people are, people's mind is always disturbed because of some anxiety that they go through. Second symptom is being described here, that they have some kind of ailment, some nutritional deficiency, or some weakness, or some particular condition, heart, condition of the heart, or condition of the kidney, or condition of the digestive system, or some kind of skin rashes, or some kind of allergy. So many, we can go on listing so many problems in terms of the poor health of the people in general in this Kali Yuga, majority of the people. And the third thing is that everyone practically feels the absence of his or her relative who is away from home. And what does this mean? Srila Prabhupada says, "The particular symptom of the age of Kali is that no family is now blessed to live together." It's very rare. As you know, the joint family system is already broken. Very few joint families are there. So there are very very small family units, husband, wife, and children, at the most. And even that husband, wife, and children, it is described by Prabhupada, this small unit, even if they have just one son or one child, to earn a livelihood, the father lives at a place far away from the son because the job demands. The father has to travel, or the father is transferred from one city to another city. You see. Or the wife lives far away from the husband. Sometimes the wife is working, she has to work in a different location, and the husband is working in a different location, and both of them have to work for making ends meet, although they can't maintain the family. So in this way, the family members are not together. They are not able to stay together. There are sufferings from internal suffering, but from internal diseases, separation from those near and dear, anxieties for maintaining the status quo proper summarizes three specific problems of people in Kali Yuga mentioned in this verse. These are but some important factors which make the people of this age always unhappy that's reflected in

### Family Relationships, Vedic Marriage, Gotra

**Key Quote:** "Even though they are cousin brother and sister, they can get married if they don't belong to the same gotra."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the family relationships between Parikshit, Uttara, and Arjuna, explaining the Vedic custom of gotra and its importance in marriage.

So this chapter describes how Parikshit received the age of Kali. Parikshit ascended the throne as the emperor of the world after Yudhishthir Maharaj. Then he married and begot four sons. He married the daughter of King Uttara. So Srila Prabhupada explains the purport. Maharaj Uttara was the son of Virudhara. And this Maharaj Uttara was the maternal uncle of Maharaj Parikshit. Why? Or how is this relationship? Because when the Pandavas were living incognito in the kingdom of Virudhara, Arjuna was instructing Virudhara's daughter. So, of course Arjuna was in disguise as a dance teacher. Then when later on Virudhara came to know that this Arjuna as a dance teacher was not ordinary dance teacher but he was Arjuna. Then Virudhara wanted to marry his daughter to Arjuna. But Arjuna refused because Arjuna said as a teacher I am like the father. I am in the position of a father. So I can't marry her. But my son can marry her. So Arjuna's son Abhimanyu, he married Virudhara's daughter. Now Parikshit is the son of Abhimanyu. So Uttara, sorry, Iravati, the daughter of Maharaj Uttara, who is the brother-in-law of Abhimanyu, is actually a cousin to Parikshit. So Iravati was a cousin sister of Maharaj Parikshit. Maharaj Uttara's daughter and Abhimanyu's son Parikshit were cousins. So Srila Prabhupada says cousin brothers and sisters were allowed to get married if they did not belong to the same gotra or family. So this is the important point. Even though they are cousin brother and sister, they can get married if they don't belong to the same gotra. Gotra means family.

**Key Quote:** "In the Vedic system of marriage, the importance of the gotra or family was stressed."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain the importance of gotra in Vedic marriages, providing examples from the lives of Arjuna and Krishna, and then returns to the topic of Janamejaya's birth and parentage.

In the Vedic system of marriage, the importance of the gotra or family was stressed. Sagotra marriage is not allowed because the progeny will be weak. Sagotra marriage. The children they conceive will be weak. So therefore, different gotra, belonging to different gotra, is important for consideration of marriage. And Prabhupada gives another example. Arjuna also married Subhadra, although she was his maternal cousin sister. Arjuna married Krishna's sister. Krishna was the cousin brother of Arjuna because Arjuna's mother Kunti and Krishna's father Vasudeva were sister and brother. So therefore, Arjuna and Krishna were cousins. But therefore, Arjuna and Krishna, not only Arjuna and Krishna, Arjuna and Subhadra were also cousins. How could they marry each other if they were cousins, brother and sister? That is because they belong to a different gotra. Now Srila Prabhupada in the purport explains the brief history of Janamejaya. Janamejaya was the eldest son of Parikshit. Parikshit begot four sons headed by Janamejaya. So Janamejaya's brief history is given by Srila Prabhupada. He says, one of the Rajarshi kings and the famous son of Maharaj Parikshit, Janamejaya, is a Rajarshi, a saintly king, Raja, Rishi. Both Raja and Rishi. That means he is a saintly king. His mother's name was Iravati. Janamejaya's mother's name was Iravati. Or according to some, Madravati.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Janamejaya's sons and his eventual succession to the throne, emphasizing the importance of qualified leadership and proper training of successors.

Maharaj Janamejaya begot two sons of the names Gnatanika and Shankukarna. He celebrated several sacrifices in the Kurukshetra pilgrimage site. This Janamejaya, later on it will be described that Maharaj Parikshit handed over charge of ruling the world to his eldest son Janamejaya. When Parikshit retired from his royal duties, when he was cursed to die within seven days by a snake bite. Those incidents will be described in the later chapters. So therefore it is described when Janamejaya took charge of ruling the world from his father Parikshit. He also got married and he begot two sons of the names Gnatanika and Shankukarna. These emperors or kings were very responsible in leaving behind a well trained, qualified successor. For the welfare of the world, for ruling the world properly, there is a need for a good Kshatriya, a qualified Kshatriya, a proper Kshatriya to rule the world for the welfare of the citizens. So these emperors, they themselves were very good rulers and they also begot good children, satsantana, by the proper process, by the proper methods, by following the proper instructions

**Key Quote:** "This Janamejaya, when he learnt about it, he wanted to take revenge against the snake which bit his father."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Janamejaya's performance of sacrifices at Kurukshetra and his subsequent attempt to avenge his father's death by performing the Sarpayagna to kill all snakes.

Then it is described here, Janamejaya celebrated several sacrifices in the Kurukshetra pilgrimage site. Kurukshetra is famous for being a holy place. Dharmakshetre Kurukshetre. The beginning of Bhagavad Gita, it is described, Kurukshetra is Dharmakshetra, holy place. A place where religious rituals are performed. It is a very sacred place. So, this Janamejaya, he performed several sacrifices in Kurukshetra. Why would they perform sacrifices? For the welfare of the citizens. They are really responsible kings. And it is also described here, Janamejaya had three younger brothers named Shrutasena, Ugrasena, and Bhimasena II. So he had three younger brothers also. He invaded Takshashila Rajanta and he decided to avenge the unlawful curse upon his great father, Maharaj Pariksit. Later on it will be described that is, Pariksit was cursed to die by snake bite. So this Janamejaya, when he learnt about it, he wanted to take revenge against the snake which bit his father. According to the curse. So what did he do to take revenge? This is Janamejaya. He performed a great sacrifice called Sarpayagna. To kill the race of serpents. He wanted to kill all the snakes. Because one serpent bit his father. Of course, his real anger was against Takshaka, one of the serpents. One of the serpents who bit his father. Because his father was cursed to die by snake bite. Particularly Takshaka's bite. So this Janamejaya arranged a Sarpayagna to be performed by qualified Brahmanas. And his aim was to kill the race of serpents, including Takshaka. Now on request from many influential demigods and sages, he had to change his decision to kill the race of serpents. That means, when he undertook this sacrifice, he was told by, advised by many influential devatas and sages and saintly persons, don't do this. Don't simply kill all the serpents. This is unfair. This is not proper. And then he actually agreed to stop the sacrifice when he was instructed or advised by many saintly persons and even devatas not to do this kind of sacrifice to kill all the serpents.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how Janamejaya was convinced to stop the Sarpayagna and how he compensated those involved, also mentioning the presence of Vyasadeva and the narration of the Kurukshetra battle.

But in spite of stopping the sacrifice, what did Janamejaya do? He satisfied everyone concerned in the sacrifice by rewarding them properly. He gave the proper Dakshina, even though the sacrifice was stopped. It was not conducted. But he did give the Dakshina to the sages, to the brahmanas who were appointed for performing the sacrifice. In this ceremony, Maharaj, sorry, Mahamuni Vyasadeva was also present in the sarpayagna, preparation for sarpayagna. And he personally narrated the history of the battle of Kurukshetra before King Janamejaya. So Vyasadeva, he is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord for the sake of preparing the scriptures, especially the scriptures for the people of Kali Yuga and the common people. So Mahamuni Vyasadeva was present in that sacrifice and he personally narrated the history of the battle of Kurukshetra to Janamejaya. How? Janamejaya's great grandfather, Pariksit's grandfather is Arjuna. So Janamejaya's great grandfather is Arjuna.

**Key Quote:** "Janamejaya was affected very much by the father's untimely death."
**Summary:** The speaker details the narration of the Mahabharata to Janamejaya, his desire to see his father again, and his generous offering of Dakshina to the brahmanas.

Later on, by the order of Vyasadeva, Vyasadeva's disciple, Narayana, narrated before King Janamejaya the subject matter of Mahabharata. Now the Bhagavad Gita is a small portion of Mahabharata. The Mahabharata is the history of greater India. It is a very, very big scripture. While Bhagavad Gita has 700 verses, Mahabharata has 100,000 verses or one lakh verses. Mahabharata has lakh shlokas. Bhagavatam has only 18,000 shlokas. Mahabharata has one lakh shlokas. So that Mahabharata was narrated to Janamejaya by Vaishampayana, Rishi, who was a disciple of Vyasadeva. On the instruction of Vyasadeva, he did so. So this Janamejaya was affected very much by the father's untimely death. And he expressed his desire to Vedavyasa, I want to see my father again. And Vyasadeva fulfilled his desire. So when his father was presented by Vyasadeva, that is Pariksit, then both Pariksit and Vyasadeva were worshipped. They were worshipped by Janamejaya. And being fully satisfied when he was able to see his father due to the mercy of Vyasadeva, then he very liberally gave Dakshina to all the brahmanas present at the sacrifice

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of charity, especially towards brahmanas, and the responsibilities of a king in providing for their welfare.

This is very important. A king's duty to give in charity to especially the brahmanas because brahmanas, they don't charge any fees. They don't collect any amount as their fees for giving advice or instructions or directing the people. But that doesn't mean that people simply take advice or instructions or directions without giving anything. They give something according to their means. Dakshina, that's called dana or dakshina. And the brahmanas are satisfied with very minimum. But kings, they reward brahmanas very liberally because kings are very rich. So that the brahmanas needn't have any anxiety about their maintenance. That's the principle. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "So different questions raised by Dharma are indicative of the different ways people suffer in Kali Yuga due to this age."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 20th verse of the 16th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining that it describes Dharma's lamentations to Mother Earth about the suffering in Kali Yuga.

In this session we will be discussing one verse, the 20th verse of the 16th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, but since the purport is a big one, we will discuss this verse in two different sessions. So, this session we will be discussing part one, the first half of the purport of this verse, as Prabhupada explains this elaborately, it is a very important verse. So, the 20th verse: Padair Nyunam Shochasi Maikapadam Atmanam Vavrushalair Bhokshamanam Aaho Suradeen Hruta Yajna Bhaagaan Praja Uthasvin Maghavatyavarshati. Further, here is a description of the conditions in this Kali Yuga of people in general, in various ways they suffer, in so many ways. Okay. So, the meaning of this 20th verse is as follows: Dharma is speaking to Mother Earth, Dharma in the form of a bull is speaking, addressing Mother Earth in the form of a cow. So, what is Dharma telling the cow? I have lost my three legs. If you have lost your six legs, you are now standing on one leg only. Are you lamenting for my state of existence? Or, are you in great anxiety because henceforward the unlawful meat eaters will exploit you? Or, are you in a sorry plight because the demigods are now bereft of their share of sacrificial offerings because no sacrifices are being performed at present, or are you grieving for living beings because of their sufferings?

**Key Quote:** "With the progress of the age of Kali, four things particularly namely the duration of life, mercy, the power of recollection and moral or religious principles will gradually diminish."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's purport is introduced, focusing on the diminishing qualities of life, mercy, memory, and morality in Kali Yuga, referencing the 12th canto of Srimad Bhagavatam.

In the purport Srila Prabhupada says, with the progress of the age of Kali, four things particularly, namely the duration of life, mercy, the power of recollection, and moral or religious principles will gradually diminish. Diminish means they will keep reducing. So the duration of life is reducing. This is already explained in the beginning of the Bhagavatam that Kali Yuga people's maximum duration of life is 100 years, about 100 years. Actually the Chastras say maximum duration of life in Kali Yuga is 120 years. That's how you hear sometimes in Japan somebody is living whose 107 years, 110 years. So the maximum duration of life in Kali Yuga is 120 years, which means that people in the earlier ages called Satya Yuga, Tretha Yuga, Dwapar Yuga, they used to live a longer life span. And that is described in the Bhagavatam. What is the life span of people in earlier ages? In Dwapar Yuga, people used to live an average of 1000 years. That is the duration of life. So 20 years is equivalent to 10 times more than that in Kali Yuga approximately. And previous to Dwapar Yuga and Tretha Yuga people used to live 10,000 years. Now you may not believe this. People may have difficulty in accepting this fact. Chastras are speaking facts, saint person facts. There is no exaggeration. There is no mythology. There is no fiction. These are all sent person facts, perfect knowledge is available accurately described in the scriptures and in Satya Yuga, the first in the cycle of four yugas, the best age on this earth planet, Satya Yuga millions of years back, the duration of human form of life was 100,000 years. What is 100,000 years? Come to 1 lakh years in our Indian system of counting, 1 lakh years, a 100,000. So as the deterioration sets in when time progresses then the duration of life reduces. In fact even in Kali Yuga the duration of life further reduces from 120 years maximum to 100 years, 80 years, 60 years, 40 years and towards the end of Kali Yuga people will live maximum of 20 years. This Kali Yuga will last 4 lakh 32,000 years. Specific calculation has given the bhagavata say 4 lakhs of years and towards the end of Kali Yuga the duration of life would have been reduced so much that if somebody is 20 years old he be considered a grand old man. This is the nature of Kali Yuga. So here the 12th canto specifically described proper is quoting from the 12th canto the bhagavata with a proses of the age of Kali 4th things keep on diminishing. What is that?

**Key Quote:** "People are losing that sense of compassion for the fellow human being"
**Summary:** The speaker illustrates the decline of compassion in Kali Yuga with the example of people's indifference to those in need, contrasting it with past behavior and highlighting increasing selfishness.

conditions and other things reduce, people become more hard-hearted, they become indifferent, they don't care. And we can see this even in our own lifetime, like just about 30 or 40, 50 years back if a person is on the street affected by some accident or something immediately a passerby would try to do something to help that person, but nowadays with the progress of the age of Kali we can see that most people are so very concerned about their own family, their own business, their own personal things that they won't even turn and look at others on the street when they are walking. You can particularly see this especially I've seen this in New York. New York people are so busy, busy, busy, busy that they are straight looking and keeping on walking with their own thing, they're not just even turning and seeing this side of that's it what's happening. So people are losing that sense of compassion for the fellow human being, that humanitarian quality. Fellow human being society means we concerned about fellow human beings not just about ourselves, we're not so selfish but that

**Key Quote:** "People are becoming more and more irreligious, immoral, immoral, irreligious."
**Summary:** The lecture continues discussing the diminishing power of recollection and moral/religious principles in Kali Yuga, emphasizing the rise of irreligion, immorality, and cruelty, especially towards cows and bulls.

selfishness increases in Kali Yuga and the third thing is power of recollection. Memory power, memory power reduces in Kalyug, that is also very obvious. We have got devices like mobile phone because of which we do not have to remember phone numbers, but you just speak to somebody who was not living in the, with the mobile phone. The elderly people in your house, you talk to them, they used to remember so many phone numbers. I used to remember phone numbers, so many phone numbers I used to remember. But now there is no need, besides that even the power of recollection is reduced. With these gadgets it has made our memory power less and less and less. And, this has got a particular significance why this being mentioned, memory power is reduced what way memory power we will discuss that and moral or religious principles also reduce, go on reducing with Kalyuga, progress of Kalyuga. People are becoming more and more irreligious, immoral. They go on hand-in-hand, morality and religious principles, they are not disconnected, please don't think they're disconnected. So people are becoming more religious and there hence more immoral, they don't hesitate the lies, they are more cruel, especially they are cruel towards innocent creatures like the cow and bull. This is one symptom of Kali Yuga, present age of Kali, they become more and more and more sinful, cruel, sinful means cruel, cruel towards the cow and bull. So therefore the indication of this reducing duration of life, reducing memory power, reducing moral values in society and compassion people have for fellow human beings or other creatures, this presentation of the therefore the indication of

**Key Quote:** "Since dharma or the principles of religion would be lost in the proportion of three out of four, the symbolic bull was standing on one leg only."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the symbolism of Dharma standing on one leg, representing the loss of religious principles, and notes that three-fourths of the world's population is becoming irreligious at the beginning of Kali Yuga.

This is indicated by dharma standing on one leg, bull standing on one leg. Why? What is the indication? Dharma standing on one leg. Since dharma or the principles of religion would be lost in the proportion of three out of four, the symbolic bull was standing on one leg only. Why? The condition of the cow was described in the previous verse. The condition of the bull is being described. Dharma is addressing mother earth. Dharma in the form of a bull. The personality of religious principles is addressing mother earth in the form of a cow. And asking. Three-fourths of the population of the whole world becomes irreligious. That means the number of atheists, faithless people is increasing more and more as Kali Yuga progresses. So this is the beginning of Kali Yuga. Three-fourths of the population is irreligious.

**Key Quote:** "Chanting Hare Krishna is the best way of atoning for all sinful activities"
**Summary:** The speaker describes the extreme degradation expected towards the end of Kali Yuga, focusing on the widespread killing of cows and the severe karmic consequences, and emphasizes chanting Hare Krishna and avoiding sinful activities as a means of atonement and salvation.

but as Kali Yuga progresses towards the end of Kali Yuga the 12th canto describes most people will be living like animals, they will be living like animals, there will be no human values left, practically zero, almost zero. Of course it will never be zero but almost zero, very very very very few people who follow religious principles, who are kind, who have compassion, who are having some good memory power, who know what is the goal of life, who care for others, all this type of symptoms of human society will vanish as Kali Yuga progresses towards the end of Kali Yuga will be very bad situation. But even now we can see although it's not as bad as it can get towards the end of Kali even now for the animals particularly there is no protection, there is no one to voice their their grievances that millions of cows are killed every day simply for being eaten as beef in the United States of America particularly and in general in many other countries also it is being killed so many cows are being killed and cow killing is the greatest sin. The greatest punishment in hell for as many years as there are hair on the body of the cow. Cow killing is the greatest sin. Cow killing is the greatest sin commanding absolute most painful disease. The greatest punishment also has to rot in hell. Punishment is the greatest punishment in hell. Yamadutas will come and take us to hell if we have been very very sinful and we are not atoned for these sinful activities so chanting Hare Krishna is the best way of atoning for all sinful activities and of course stopping meat-eating, intoxication, gambling, illicit sex we can be saved.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the godless nature of Kali Yuga, explaining how people directly deny God or indirectly defy Krishna's authority by accepting bogus incarnations, giving the example of a man worshipping Hitler for material gain.

So, one by one we will discuss. In the purport which I have read already in the previous session, I will continue further. In the age of Kali, godless civilizations will create so many so-called religious societies in which the personality of godhead will be directly or indirectly defied. Basically, people are godless, but externally they want to make a show of religion. Some people openly say, "I am atheistic, I don't believe in God." But there are other godless people who actually are faithless when it comes to God, but they will profess to follow some so-called religion. "I don't believe Krishna is God. Then who do you think is God? Some bogus incarnation, I accept him as God." Because they want to deny or defy Krishna, Krishna's authority. And why will they accept somebody else as God? Because they are getting some sense gratification out of that person. Prabhupada gives a very nice example. In the Bhagavad Gita, in the 18th chapter it is mentioned, those in the mode of passion, they worship, and those in the mode of passion, human beings, who are actually bewildered by the material energy, influence of the material energy, illusory energy, they worship some powerful person as God. They don't worship real God. Krishna they won't worship, but they worship some powerful person as God. Now why is it, Prabhupada says, during the Second World War, which lasted about six years or so, there was one man in Calcutta, Prabhupada was living in Calcutta at that time. So one man in Calcutta, he was worshipping Hitler. Hitler was the chief of the government in Calcutta. Then, in 1939, he came to India. In that year, he worked there in Australia, Vietnam, Germany. So why was this person in Calcutta worshipping Hitler? What is the connection? Because, thanks to the world war due to Hitler, he amassed a lot of wealth in the black market, dealing in the black market. So he attributed this whole black market phenomenon due to the world war, and world war was a responsibility of the government. So, he dabbed a lot of effort in understanding of the black market and at that time of this work of secularism and Christianity. He was a very big supporter of the community of the Black Market. He often carbonoed, he was an afternoon expert, and was the chairman of the organization of the Black Market and the United Nations. In those days for many years, he was an violations dizerer and he lived in the same battle fields of military administration in the United States. the world war and world war who is responsible of course we can't say hitler is the only one responsible but there was some reason to be attributed world war to be attributed to hitler so this foolish person instead of worshipping krishna he is worshipping hitler

**Key Quote:** "They say there is God, but God is no form. God has no eyes, God has no hands, God has no legs, God has no ears, God has no hands, God is crippled, God is blind."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how people indirectly deny God by claiming God is impersonal and without form, which he equates to blasphemy and atheism.

So people will in Kali Yuga directly or indirectly deny God. Like some people, they directly say there is no God or there is no need to worship God or that there is, everyone is God. Different ways they deny God. So directly, those who deny, they say there is no God. Indirectly, how do they deny God? They say, "Yeah, there is God, but God is no form." See how they cleverly deny God in an indirect way. They say there is no God because externally or for the sake of making a show of being religious say, "Yeah, yeah, there is God, I believe in God." Who is God? If you ask this person, "Oh, God is something impersonal." Impersonal means, "I believe God has no form." That means God has no eyes. Do you mean to say God has no eyes means God is blind? And indirectly that's what they're telling. God has no eyes means what? God is blind. And they even have prayers like this, "Oh, you who have no eyes, oh, you who have no legs." This is the way they worship. They offer prayers to God. If you say somebody, a person, you say, "Oh, you have no eyes," that means what are you telling a person who has no eyes? What do you call him? Blind. Person who has no legs? Lame. Blind person who has no eyes, what do you call him? Blind. A person who has no ears? Deaf. So is this the way to pray to God? This is outright atheism and this is blasphemy of God. "You have no eyes, you have no ears." So this is another class of people. They say there is God, but God is no form. God has no eyes, God has no hands, God has no legs, God has no ears, God has no hands, God is crippled, God is blind.

**Key Quote:** "God certainly has got a very, very, very beautiful transcendental form, indestructible. That form cannot be destroyed, doesn't deteriorate, has no material limitations."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that God does not have a material form but possesses a transcendental, spiritual form, explaining the meaning of 'Nirakar Brahman' as having no material form but possessing a transcendental one.

This is their God. This is actually not the truth. God certainly has got a very, very, very beautiful transcendental form, indestructible. That form cannot be destroyed, doesn't deteriorate, has no material limitations. God's form is spiritual, transcendental. So when the scriptures say, "God doesn't have a form," it is to be understood that God does not have a material form like I and you have. That's what the scriptures are describing. God as having no material form. Nirakar. Nirakar. Nirakar Brahman. Nirakar Brahman means Brahman who is completely transcendental, has no material eyes, has no material hands, but Brahman has got transcendental form, transcendental eyes, transcendental hands, transcendental legs, transcendental ears, transcendental body.

**Summary:** The speaker describes how godless civilizations create religious societies that blaspheme God and criticize genuine devotees, emphasizing the importance of a standard interpretation of scriptures like Bhagavad Gita, similar to the standard understanding of scientific laws.

So that is God, you see. So these godless civilizations, they create so many religious societies in which simply they will criticize the genuine devotees. They will blaspheme God, real God, create their own incarnation, bogus incarnation. "I believe so and so is God." What's your basis of believing? No standard scriptures are followed. No proper authority from whom the spiritual knowledge is received. Everyone interprets their own way, the Bhagavad Gita. So many translations of Bhagavad Gita. Why? Because each one wants to interpret, give his or her own interpretation. So this is blasphemy of God. This is godless civilization. Godless civilization. Only when it comes to understanding Bhagavad Gita, people will think, "Oh, each person can have his or her own understanding." Do you say that for a physics, book of physics, book of chemistry, book of science, will you say? "Oh, you can have your own interpretation. You can have your own understanding. You can have your own meaning. Newton's laws of physics." Will each person interpret Newton's laws in his or her own way in the physics field? No, no way. It is standard. Whichever university you go, whichever school you go, whichever college you go, whichever scholar you go, the scholar or the school or the college or the university cannot give their own definition of Newton's laws of motion in physics. Anywhere you go, it is the same. This is standard. Similarly, Bhagavad Gita, there is a standard. You cannot have your own interpretation

**Key Quote:** "Krishna says, I am the source of everything. Everything emanates from me."
**Summary:** The speaker criticizes those who misinterpret Bhagavad Gita, specifically denying Krishna's personal form and authority, highlighting Krishna's statement in BG 10.8 that He is the source of everything.

or somebody else cannot have their own interpretation. Krishna says, "I am the source of everything. Everything emanates from me." And the symptoms of one who is in knowledge of me is that they are engaged in pure devotional service to me, knowing me as the ultimate cause of all causes. Clearly, this is told in the Bhagavad Gita, 10th chapter, 8th verse, aham sarvasya prabhava. Who is speaking? Krishna is speaking. The Supreme Personality of God is speaking. Bhagavan. Vacha. Bhagavan is telling, Aham. I. Person is speaking. And person is telling, I. But one other translator, he is translating, "Oh, you should not worship the person Krishna. You should worship something inside Krishna." Where is it said and how is he understanding something else inside Krishna is there? As if Krishna's body is like our body? In our case, inside this body I am seated as spirit soul. You think Krishna also has got one material body and in that body Krishna has the spirit, Supreme Spirit is sitting there? No. Krishna doesn't have a material body. Never. Krishna's form is identical with Krishna's soul. In fact, the form of the soul only, spiritual form. Krishna appears in his original spiritual form. Ajop is an avyayatma. Avyayatma means his form never deteriorates. His form is transcendental. Janma karma cha me divyam. So clear in the Bhagavad Gita. But some people they interpret. Godless people. They interpret.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by describing how faithless societies in Kali Yuga make the world a hellish place for saintly persons, who are targeted and troubled by the godless.

Their own meaning they give. So, this is another symptom of the people in this Kali Yuga. Thus, faithless societies of men, what happens if people become faithless? They will make the world uninhabitable for the saner section of people. There are some sensible people who know who is real God and they live according to some moral principles. They follow some religious principles, genuine religious principles that we should not tell lies. We should not hurt others. We should not kill the innocent animals when you got plenty of supply of fruits and vegetables and grains. So there are saner people. Now for these saner people, the faithless, godless atheists make this world a hellish place. They make it very very difficult for saintly persons to stay. They unnecessarily target saintly persons and criticize them, harm them, deny their rights, become obstacle in their life like that. Unnecessarily give trouble. So, like this, the description is given in this Bhagavatam. So, we will discuss more in the next session. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam 1.16.20, discussing Dharma as a bull and Mother Earth as a cow, and the symptoms of Kali Yuga.

In this session, we will continue to discuss from the 20th verse of the 16th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. We already have discussed this verse in two previous sessions. So, this is part 3 of the same verse. The 3rd session will be discussing the remaining portion of the purport because it is a very big purport. Just to refresh your memory, this 20th verse: 'I have lost my three legs and I am now standing on one only. Are you lamenting for my state of existence? Or are you in great anxiety because henceforward the unlawful meat eaters will exploit you? Or are you in a sorry plight because the demigods are now bereft of their share of sacrificial life? Because no sacrifices are being performed at present? Or are you grieving for living beings because of their sufferings due to famine and drought?' These are the various questions raised by Dharma in the form of a bull to Mother Earth in the form of a cow. So, this is actually describing the symptoms of the Kali Yuga. Of course, Dharma in the form of a bull, the symbolic representation of Dharma in the form of a bull, and Mother Earth symbolically represented by the cow, form of a cow, shape of a cow. So, Srila Prabhupada describes these things in the purport.

**Key Quote:** "Real faith is completely based on perfect knowledge, is based on reality, is based on knowledge, is based on knowledge, is based on reality, is based on truth and facts."
**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between real faith and blind faith, emphasizing that real faith is based on knowledge and truth, using the example of knowing about China without having visited it.

There are gradations of human beings in terms of proportionate faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Actually, Bhakti means 100% firm faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And Bhakti means 100% firm faith in Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in real God. That is Bhakti. But this faith should not be mistaken to be something like blind faith, what they say blind faith. Now, what's the difference between real faith and blind faith? What's the difference? Is there a difference? Yes, there is a difference. What's the difference? Now, blind faith is not having the foundation of proper knowledge. Proper facts, is not having the foundation of reality. That's called blind faith. Now, real faith is completely based on perfect knowledge, is based on reality, is based on knowledge, is based on truth and facts. For example, if I have not seen, let us say, I have not seen China, I never been to China, I never seen China, the country called China. But then, my faith that there is a correct knowledge, there is another country called China, people are living there, and it is another country as much as our India, present day India is a country. It's one of the many countries in the world. And they have their own culture, they have their own kind of living conditions, they have their mountains, they have their plains, they have their lands, they have their rivers, they grow some different food items like we grow. So, this faith is not blind faith. Why? Because it is based on the solid foundation of knowledge, proper knowledge from authoritative sources have gathered this fact that there is another country called China, even though I have not seen it, I have not actually visited that place. I can visit if I want to, but I don't have to necessarily visit that place in order to actually know for certain and be 100% sure that there is a country called China. You understand? So this understanding and the firm faith is based on solid foundation of perfect knowledge. So I don't have any reason to doubt, though I have not seen the place called China, I have no reason to doubt that there is a place called China.

**Key Quote:** "We have to know about Krishna we have to hear from the perfect authority perfect source and that perfect source are the authentic scriptures like Srimad Bhagavatam Srimad Bhagavad Gita"
**Summary:** The speaker explains how to develop faith in Krishna through hearing from authorized scriptures and Acharyas, emphasizing that Krishna has a transcendental form not visible to material eyes.

Which is really existing. Similarly with God Krishna. Now a devotee of Krishna knows Krishna actually is real, is the real person, is the Supreme Lord. How does he know? How does he have that faith even though he may not have seen Krishna in the sense of seeing with these eyes a person that we know in this world? It's not like that. Seeing Krishna is not possible to see with these eyes because Krishna is not a person who has got a material form. Krishna has no material form. Krishna has only transcendental form, spiritual form. These eyes cannot see spiritual form. Therefore we have to know about Krishna, we have to hear from the perfect authority, perfect source and that perfect source are the authentic scriptures like Srimad Bhagavatam, Srimad Bhagavad Gita, the authorized devotees, the Acharyas, Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. All these are authorized perfectly perfect sources, authorized sources for hearing about Krishna, knowing about Krishna, establishing that firm faith simply by hearing Prabhupada and practicing Krishna consciousness. Of course the hearing leads to the practice, leads to a certain transformation of heart which is what establishes that firm faith. So try to understand the difference.

**Key Quote:** "Real faith has to be ascertained by perfect knowledge from the perfect source has to be ascertained by by a transformation of heart through a through the process of Bhakti"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts real faith (Shraddha) with sentimental belief systems, emphasizing the importance of perfect knowledge and transformation of heart through Bhakti.

Between Shraddha, which is a Sanskrit word for real faith, and ordinary belief systems. Material, there is something called I believe, I believe so and so is God, Tittaasakhyama, Durga is God. Somebody else will say no no I don't believe Durga is God I believe Ganesha is God. So this belief system is something of a sentiment, something of a feeling that is effective or it has an immediate meaning. We usually believe or act along the line of will whether it is personasope, helping or what's outside the organizations, as in the nature of the nature of God. And it is important to build one's heart with the correct mind and spirit. Within the heart is something of a benefit, a material benefit somebody might have got by believing, by doing something based on a belief but that is not the proper way of ascertaining the fact, the reality, the truth. Simply going by some belief which is a sentimental belief or going by a similar sentimental belief that another close friend of yours has or another family member has in whom you have got a good amount of faith or trust, whom you trust, who's trustworthy okay but it is not just that you see. It has to be real faith has to be ascertained by perfect knowledge from the perfect source, has to be ascertained by a transformation of heart through the process of Bhakti, the process of hearing chanting, process of following instructions to

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is not a new person to any of us previousitem number hard Realm knowledge within the heart which is already there see mind you Krishna is not a new person to any of us this questionnaire seated in ever heart"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna is not new to us and that the process of Krishna consciousness awakens the knowledge already within our hearts, leading to a permanent eradication of doubts through purification.

Awaken that real knowledge within the heart which is already there. See, Bhakti, the process of hearing chanting, process of following the instructions to remind you, Krishna is not a new person to any of us. This Krishna is seated in every heart. Krishna is seated in every heart, Intelligence every moment as we use the intelligence. Krishna is our eternal, we are eternally related to Krishna. As spirit soul we are eternal beings. Krishna as a supreme spirit is eternal lord and we have an eternal relationship. So, these are all facts, hard facts. These are cent percent truth. This is reality. Not because I am just saying it in a very very forceful way. No, it is actually based on shastra, authorized shastra. It is based on the acharyas. See Prabhupada travelled all over the world and preached and actually convinced and made people realize through the authentic process of Krishna consciousness. Anybody who practices Krishna consciousness by receiving that knowledge and the proper instructions from the proper source, they can become convinced, they can develop the firm faith. They can awaken their knowledge. Their heart can undergo transformation by which doubts are eradicated permanently. It is not that somebody has got doubt and somehow by some argument or logic or some kind of feeling their doubts are gone. But again something else happens by which again the doubt comes back. You see. Not that kind of eradication of doubt. Some temporary mitigation of the doubt. No. This change of heart by which doubts are eradicated is due to the purification of the heart by the authorized spiritual process. So therefore when Prabhupada says there are gradations of human beings in terms of proportionate faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, what he means is the real faith, the transcendental faith. That's the correct word. The transcendental faith, which is nothing to do with material sentiments, material beliefs, material knowledge, material experience, material relationships. Nothing to do with any of those. It is completely different.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the gradations of human beings in terms of faith within the Varnashrama system, emphasizing transcendental faith as distinct from material sentiments and beliefs.

So this is explained by Prabhupada here. As first class faithful men are the Vaishnavas and the Brahmanas, qualified ones. The second class faith are those qualified Kshatriyas. The third class faith are those for qualified Vaishyas. And the fourth class faith are the qualified Shudras. So this is the proportionate faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the gradations of human beings in the Varnashrama society. So I'll stop here. We'll continue this in the next section, next session. Thank you very much.

At the end of life when we have to quit this body, Yamadutas will come and take us to hell if we have been very very sinful and we are not atoned for these sinful activities. So chanting Hare Krishna is the best way of atoning for all sinful activities. And of course stopping meat eating, intoxication, gambling and illicit sex, we can be saved from going to hell. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "There is widespread sinful activities, particularly four kinds of sinful activities characterizing this Kali Yuga, meat eating, intoxication, gambling, illicit sex."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the degradation of human character in Kali Yuga due to the influence of sinful activities like meat-eating, intoxication, gambling, and illicit sex.

They two are completely different. As I mentioned earlier, the word Shraddha that is used, that's a beginning of Bhakti. Shraddha is the beginning of Bhakti, real faith in Krishna. That is a beginning of Bhakti. So till one actually has got that Shraddha, the real faith in Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no question of Bhakti at all. So what passes off as Bhakti or devotion is some sentiment, some blind faith, some belief system. Like sometimes people ask, do you believe in God? One person may ask another person. The other person may say, yeah, yeah, I believe in God. Somebody else may say, I don't believe in God. So this belief system is not what we are talking about here. When you say faith, this is different. This is completely, it is coming from the core of the heart. It's a transformation of the heart by purification through the authorized process of executing Bhakti, devotional service. So it is not just a mental state or it's not an intellectual exercise. It is actually a transformation of the heart by purification. Heart means here we are talking of consciousness, which is a symptom of the soul, conscious symptom of the soul. So let me continue the purport. The degradation of the human instinct begins from the mlechas and the Chandala state of life is the last word in human degradation. Why is Prabhupada telling this? He's telling in Kali Yuga, the human beings degrade, become degraded in their character, in their consciousness due to the evil influence of the age, the Kali Yuga. And what is the evil influence of Kali Yuga? There is widespread sinful activities, particularly four kinds of sinful activities characterizing this Kali Yuga: meat eating, intoxication, gambling, illicit sex. So these

**Key Quote:** "A good person a cultured person a pious person becomes sinful so that's what we are talking about degradation in this Kali Yuga"
**Summary:** The lecture explains how even those born into good families can be influenced by sinful activities and emphasizes that designations like Mlecha or Brahmana are based on qualifications, not birth.

four sinful activities are prominent in Kali Yuga. And it is, it is practiced, it is these sinful activities are very much prevalent among more and more people in Kali Yuga. Even though somebody may be born in a very, very comfortable state of consciousness, you can feel the presence of the soul, human being. Even though somebody may be born in a very, very cultured and very good family, by mixing with other people outside the family in the society who are sinful, who are breaking these four principles of no meat eating, no intoxication, one becomes influenced and a good person, a cultured person, a pious person becomes sinful. So that's what we are talking about degradation in this Kali Yuga. So Prabhupada says all the above terms mentioned in the Vedic literatures are never meant for any particular community or birth. When you say Mlecha, it's not because somebody is born in a particular family or belongs to a community that we call the person. Which I know, they are different qualifications of human beings in general. Any human being, what is this qualification? Based on that we say he's a brahmana, he's a chatriya, he's a mlecha, he's a yamana, based on qualifications. And if somebody practices bhakti, then their qualifications can change. Just like a child is born ignorant, but you send the child to school and the child gets trained in mathematics, then it becomes knowledgeable in mathematics. So it's no longer ignorant of mathematics. So ignorant person becomes a knowledgeable person by training, by education, by culture. Same way, a mlecha means a person who is not following, a mlecha who is following the Maekas, but they call such a religious, the Vedic principles, uncultured, uncivilized according to the Vedic standard, not having cleanliness, not having good habits, not, does not know how to show respect to elders. Such a person by training, by education, spiritual education, by association with transcendentalists can become completely a changed person, can become a nice devotee, can become a wise, no ma, can become a first-class human being, possible. So it's not that permanently somebody is labeled as malecha, Sudra, no, never. That is not the orderly medical system. That is the principle of a person. This is the principle of spiritual education,

authorized Vedic tradition or Vedic culture. No. Nowadays, there is a tendency to label people like that. Somebody says, I am a Brahmin. How do you say you are a Brahmin? I was born in a Brahmin family. Or my forefathers were very nice, first class qualified Brahmin. That's fine. Your forefathers are first class qualified Brahmin because of which you have a good possibility of getting trained up in first class behavior, first class qualities. Yes. But unless you get trained and unless you actually exhibit those qualities, you are not a Brahmin. You cannot be called a Brahmin. So, that is what Prabhupada is telling. Never these designations as Brahmana, Chhatriya, Vaishya, Shudra, Mlecha, Yavana are never meant for any particular community or they are not to be, these designations are not to be given based on birth. They are based on qualifications. There is no question of birthright or community. No. That is not the way. One can acquire the respective number of birthrights by birthright. One can acquire the respective number of birthrights by qualification by one's own efforts and thus the son of a Vaishnava can become a Mleksha, born in a nice Vaishnava family but by bad association by not following the principles of Vaishnava conduct one becomes a Mleksha, or the son of a Chandala can become more than a Brahmana, can become first-class Vaishnava all in terms of their association and intimate

**Summary:** The lecture defines a Vaishnava and then distinguishes between Mlechas (unregulated meat-eaters) and those who regulate their meat-eating according to scriptural injunctions, explaining that the latter are not considered Mlechas.

relation with the Supreme Lord. Vaishnava means one who connects with Krishna through the process of bhakti, devotional service, bhakti yoga. And then when the connection is established by qualification, by practice, by association, by behavior, by culture, then even though a person by birth was not having any good qualities or any good behavior can become qualified, can exhibit all the good qualities by training, by culture, by association, develop that relationship and become a first-class Vaishnava. Next Prabhupada talks about the meat eaters. The meat eaters are generally called Mlechha's. Mlechha means meat eaters who are particular kind of meat eaters. Prabhupada says all meat eaters are not Mlechha's. Those who accept meat in terms of scriptural injunctions are not Mlechha's. In scripture there is a concession given to somebody who is very much habituated to eating meat. If they want to regulate their meat eating according to scriptural directions because they can't totally give up eating meat immediately when they come to know about the fact that meat eating is sinful activity because of which they have to suffer sinful reactions. So they don't want suffering, so they have to stop meat eating. But they can't immediately stop. They can regulate their meat eating according to scriptural injunctions.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Those who want to regulate their meat eating so that they don't get very very ghastly sinful reactions. Severe suffering. No. They should avoid cow killing."
**Summary:** The speaker details the scriptural regulations for those who cannot immediately give up meat-eating, emphasizing the restriction to goat flesh, once a month, after sacrifice to Kali, and the absolute prohibition of beef due to the Vedic culture's protection of cows and bulls.

So in one place in the scriptures it is said meat eating is sinful. You should not eat meat. Avoid meat eating. Now that may not be possible for everyone on hearing such a scriptural direction or injunction. A person cannot immediately stop because of habit. So such a person who is habituated to meat eating but would like to gradually reduce and give up over a period of time. So then the scriptural injunctions are there that in a restricted way such a person can accept meat. What is that restriction? In this Kanda Purana it is said those who want to regulate their meat eating so that they don't get very, very ghastly sinful reactions, severe suffering. No. They should avoid cow killing. They should only take the flesh of a goat. Only one creature. Goat. Goat flesh. Not any animal flesh. Not any bird flesh. No. Only goat. And that also only one the way as say that goat attacks the goat. Once a month they can take this flesh. Once a month only on a mavasya. A mavasya occurs once in a month. Lunar month. And only by sacrificing a goat to Goddess Kali. Performing a sacrifice. Yajna. Yajna is the way of performing a sacrifice. Yajna. Yagya is the way of using money. Lifting up. Islam wish-doing, Yajna is the way of took freshner比如 So a cow that is going crazy with its father and said me에는 purifying our existence. So, that is the regulation to be followed. So, those who are following these regulations are called descriptional directions are not natures even if they are eating meat. So, those meat eaters who accept meat without any regulation or restriction are called natures. This is the accurate definition of who is a nature. Beef is forbidden in scriptures. Beef means the flesh of a cow and the bulls and cows are offered special protection by the followers

**Key Quote:** "In this age of Kali people will exploit the body of the bull and the cow as they like and thus they will invite sufferings of various types."
**Summary:** The lecture discusses the exploitation of cows and bulls in Kali Yuga and the resulting suffering, contrasting it with the Vedic principle of cow protection, and then introduces the concept of designated food for different species.

of the Vedas. So, in the Vedic culture nobody, even meat eaters, never touch the flesh of a cow or a bull, never. So, on the other hand the cows and bulls are offered special protection. They are going to die. Natural death of course, but they never killed for the sake of eating the cow meat. No, never. In this age of Kali people will exploit the body of the bull and the cow as they like and thus they will invite sufferings of various types. See, this is the unfortunate situation Kali Yuga. They are ignorant. They don't care for any restrictions or regulations. They don't follow Shastra or they don't have proper guidance. So, they are going to die. They are having needs of animal Wars. They are hungry. They are going to die. But the necessarily eating the animal flesh is out of blood debate. So, they cannot searching out forerkind neuroimaging of the individual. Thank you they are very good but just to have proper guidance, they say it is my choice which kind of flesh I eat, eating is my choice. You like to eat vegetables, you eat vegetables. I like to eat them vegetables and some meat also or somebody else likes to eat fish. Somebody else likes to eat eggs. Astrology. So whatever one's choice one may eat, this is not correct understanding. There is consideration of what a person should eat. Every living being by arrangement, higher arrangement has got designated food. Just like a cow will never eat any flesh. A tiger will never eat grass. See that designated food for tiger is the flesh of certain animals. Designated food for cow is grass.

**Key Quote:** "If you have to eat meat there is restriction by which if you follow this restriction only goat flesh, only once a month, only after sacrificing the goat to Kali then that person is saved from grievous sinful reactions."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while humans have some freedom in choosing food, it is restricted to vegetables, fruits, grains, and dairy, and that if one must eat meat, it should be done according to strict regulations to avoid sinful reactions, which are often ignored in Kali Yuga, leading to suffering.

So this is by higher arrangement in nature. But among human beings there is no such thing. There is a certain freedom given that you may eat different kinds of edibles. But that is restricted to vegetables, fruits, grains, dahl, cow's milk like this. It is restricted to that for human beings. Designated food for human beings. Now if somebody thinks that I will eat what I like to eat or I will eat what is good for my health. Somebody may say for you vegetable may be okay, for me vegetable is not enough to be healthy, to develop good strength. I require to eat some non-vegetarian food. So that may be some consideration some people may have. But if you have to eat meat there is restriction by which if you follow this restriction only goat flesh, only once a month, only after sacrificing the goat to Kali. Only to Kali, not to any Devata, not to any, not to Krishna, not to Vishnu, no. And it must be sacrificed. There is a procedure for sacrificing according to Shastra. Then that person is saved from grievous sinful reactions. But in Kali Yuga people don't care. For all this restriction they don't bother. Therefore they invite sufferings of so many kind. So that is one unfortunate situation in Kali Yuga.

**Key Quote:** "What is the reason for all suffering in this material world is our sinful activities."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the degradation in Kali Yuga due to godlessness and faithlessness, emphasizing the importance of performing yajna to become free from sinful reactions.

In this session, we will continue to discuss from the 20th verse of the 16th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is the fifth part of the discussion on this verse from the purport. This is a very big purport. So we were discussing about the degradation in Kali Yuga due to people becoming godless and they become faithless. And they are unrestricted in meat eating and they don't follow the very principles because they think they are, they can't believe, or they are not superstitious, various reasons they get like that. So here, Prabhupada says that people in this age, they suffer in Kali Yuga because they don't perform any sacrifice, yajna. So, Prabhupada says the Mleccha population will care very little for performance sacrifices, although performance of sacrifice is essential for persons who are materially engaged in sense enjoyment. What is the reason for all suffering in this material world is our sinful activities. What are sinful activities? For the sake of satisfying my senses, I don't care for any restrictions or regulations or rules that are actually enforced in this material world. I don't care for them, or either I'm ignorant, or even if I have knowledge, I don't bother about it. So, therefore, those who are engaged in sense enjoyment, material sense enjoyment, which is majority of the population, they have to perform yajna in order to become free from sinful reactions.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that performing work as a sacrifice, as directed in scriptures, prevents one from being bound by sinful reactions and suffering.

So, in the Bhagavad Gita, it is said, if work is done as sacrifice, as it is directed in the authentic scriptures, then you don't become bound up by sinful reactions. You don't become bound up by reactions. Otherwise, those who don't perform yajna, but keep on doing yajna, you don't become bound up by sinful reactions. You don't become bound up by yajna. If a mortal body and one plant tries to stop their yajna, it needs to do something or another, or he should not do something involving it. So the eternal behavior, to be a material intention I am trying to send to you, the ultimate, to be the ultimate Thinking and religion is somewhere where he is doing some work for their different purposes. They become bound up more and more and more and more and get entangled to material existence and are forced to suffer against their wish. Suffering material reaction. It is forced on somebody who is not performing yajna. So, Bhagavad Gita says,

you want to avoid suffering, you want to get free from the future reactions, then now you stop all sinful activities, follow the injunctions of the scriptures, and perform work as yajna. So, Srila Prabhupada says that this world is created in such a way that for maintaining the living beings, there is the system of working according to one's guna and karma. Guna, karma, Varnashrama. Varnashrama is the way of classifying the civilized human beings into four social orders, and four spiritual orders. And thereby they do the appropriate kind of work for maintaining them off earning their livelihood. And, they also follow the restrictions of the scriptures in the work they do... what they eat, how they dress, how they interact with other fellow human beings and what is their ultimate goal, what should be their ultimate goal in life. Everything is directed, is regulated,

past. They don't accumulate any fresh reactions and they become purified. For example, we have to eat to survive, but eat only vegetarian food. That also, after preparing the vegetarian food, it has to be offered. Offered to Krishna as yajna, sacrifice. And then yajna shishta asinaha santaha. Devotees always offer food for sacrifice called naivedya. Offering to Krishna and then parting the remnants as prasadam, Krishna prasadam. So by eating Krishna prasadam, you are purified of the old reactions. And you don't get any fresh reactions. Rather you develop your bhakti. So this is the way of performing yajna in the matter of eating, worshipping Krishna and offering him foodstuff which we have cooked, only vegetarian foodstuff. And that also cooked without any contamination in a pure way, cooking in a pure way. So that is now a very important point.

**Key Quote:** "Proper rainfall is possible only by performance of yajna."
**Summary:** The speaker connects sacrifice to proper rainfall and food production, contrasting this with the practices of 'mlechas' who misuse resources by feeding grains to livestock and then slaughtering them.

It is said that there will be sufficient grains, agricultural produce, if there are proper rains. And proper rainfall is dependent on performing sacrifice. So if people perform sacrifice, there will be cause. It says parjanyad annasambhavaha in the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna says this. Parjanya means rain. Yajna bhavati parjanya. Rainfall, proper rainfall, not too much, not too little. Proper rainfall is possible only by performance of yajna. If people perform yajna, there will be proper rainfall. If there is proper rainfall, there will be proper production of grains, vegetables, fruits, etc. And then there will be plenty of grains. Food, all edibles for the human beings and the animals also. So the mlechas, they don't grow proper food grains. Or if they grow food grains, they use that to feed the livestock. They feed the cows. They feed the chickens. And then they slaughter them for their own food. They eat chicken flesh or cow flesh. Instead of growing some grains and vegetables and themselves eating and also leaving the remnants for the other creatures like chickens and cows, instead of that, they misuse

their superior position in society. The dumb animals, the innocent animals, they are killed unnecessarily. So this is the anomaly in Kalyuga. But people must know that there is severe sinful reactions for cow killing. For unnecessarily killing even a chicken, unnecessarily killing. When there is plenty of food grains, after all the same grains they are using to feed the livestock. Why don't you eat the grain? Instead of feeding the chicken or the cow and then killing that poor animal and then eating the flesh. Why do you do this? So therefore, by spiritual culture, by spiritual education by spiritual training a person can actually change his or her life and become peaceful become happy become free from sinful reaction become free from suffering and have a very bright future all that is

**Key Quote:** "Sacrifice means to please Vishnu and how to please Vishnu by practice of bhakti yoga"
**Summary:** The speaker advocates for Bhakti Yoga as the most feasible sacrifice in Kali Yuga, particularly chanting Hare Krishna, hearing the Bhagavatam, and offering vegetarian food to Krishna.

so sacrifice means to please Vishnu and how to please Vishnu by practice of bhakti yoga the most feasible type of sacrifice packet india the the sacrifice of chanting and hearing the holy name of krishna the sacrifice of worshipping Krishna, Deity of Krishna or picture of the Deity of Krishna. All these methods of practicing Bhakti are called different varieties of sacrifices performed in Bhakti Yoga. Shravanam, Kirtanam, Smaranam, Padasevanam, all these are sacrifices performed by Bhakti Yogis. When we chant Hare Krishna, we are performing sacrifice to Vishnu called the Kirtana sacrifice, Sankirtana sacrifice, Sankirtanayanya. When we hear the Bhagavatam, we are performing Shravanam sacrifice, Shravanam sacrifice, hearing. Hearing what? About Vishnu, about Vishnu's devotees, about Vishnu's glorious activities like that. So, this is the sacrifice that is most recommended. It is simple, it is effective, it is very very powerful. And easily performed by anyone, any human being without any previous qualification. Therefore, that is what is being recommended here by Prabhupada that Lord Chaitanya, he recommended only one type of Yagna, that is Sankirtanayanya, chanting Hare Krishna, hearing the Bhagavatam, offering nice vegetarian foodstuff to Krishna and partaking the remnants, Krishna Prasadam.

A portion of the prepared food has to be kept in a particular bowl or a plate in front of a picture or deity of Krishna. And then you pray to Krishna, please accept this offering. You can just say this in English or your own language. Better still, you pray to Krishna to accept the offering by chanting the Hare Krishna Mantra three times. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Three times you chant. And then leave that for five minutes in front of the picture or the deity of Krishna. And after five minutes, you take it out and you mix it with whatever you have cooked. And then that becomes prasadam, remnants of what is offered to Krishna. That becomes prasadam.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (1.16.21) which poses questions about the suffering in Kali Yuga, specifically concerning the plight of women, children, and the degradation of Brahmanas.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 21st verse of the 16th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The meaning of this verse is: are you feeling compunction for the unhappy women and children who are left forlorn by unscrupulous persons, or are you unhappy because the goddess of learning is being handled by brahmanas addicted to acts against the principles of religion, or are you sorry to see that the brahmanas have taken shelter of administrative powers?

**Summary:** The speaker explains the context of the verse, where Dharma, in the form of a bull, questions Mother Earth, in the form of a cow, about her sorrow for the suffering in Kali Yuga, focusing on the meaning of 'compunction' and the abandonment of women and children.

So this verse is a continuation of dharma questioning mother earth. Dharma in the shape of a bull is asking mother earth in the shape of a cow. Three more questions are raised here. All these are symptoms of suffering of the people in Kali Yuga. Mother earth is feeling for the people of this earth planet who are suffering in this Kali Yuga in different ways. So, dharma is questioning mother earth, "Are you feeling compunction?" What is the meaning of compunction? Compunction means, are you feeling sad or sorry for the unhappy women and children who are left forlorn? Forlorn means they are completely deserted.

Prabhupada will explain how this is happening in the purport, but I am just going through the verse itself. This is the first question. Then the next question being asked by dharma in the same verse, in these 21st verses, "Or are you unhappy because the goddess of learning is being handled by brahmanas addicted to acts against the principles of religion?" That means knowledge is in the hands of brahmanas. They learn and they disseminate that knowledge to the people in society. Now, these brahmanas, if they don't have the knowledge to follow the principles of religion, the dharmic principles, then they become disqualified as brahmanas. Then they are no longer able to properly either learn or properly disseminate or set a right example or teach people the right values, right principles. They are unable to do.

We don't have qualified brahmanas. We have teachers, but they are not qualified brahmanas. They don't follow principles. Then the third question is, "Or are you sorry to see that the brahmanas have taken shelter of administrative families that do not respect brahmanical culture?" These brahmanas, then knowledgeable or learned people, they work for the government, and they are not treated properly by the government. They are forced to commit sinful activities in spite of having knowledge because they are dependent for their livelihood upon the government's salary. So, they cannot say, "I won't do something" that they are asked to do. So, they will do it, even though they know it's wrong, it is bad, it is sinful, it is going to bring about a lot of misery, suffering for the people. Still, they cannot avoid, they cannot refuse, they cannot instruct the administrators that this is not correct, what you are doing. They cannot do that.

**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada on the neglect of women, children, Brahmanas, and cows in Kali Yuga, emphasizing the need for protection and the dangers of exploitation, particularly for women and children without proper care.

degradation or the bad, evil influence of Kali. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "In the age of Kali, the women and the children along with brahmanas and cows will be grossly neglected and left unprotected." This is Kali Yuga symptom. In the scriptures it is said very clearly, in a civilized society five categories of people deserve to be protected by the government and by the respective guardians, respective leaders, or respective protectors. The women had to be protected by men, especially in the young age by the father, a girl has to be protected in the middle age by her husband, and in old age by her son or another guardian family guardian. So this is the protection that shastras say must be given to women. What happens if they are not given protection? Then they are exploited by unscrupulous ruffians, rogues, and uncultured mlechas, yavanas, gundas, drunkards, meat-eaters, womanizers, woman hunters, prostitute hunters. Women are exploited, therefore women should be protected. But in the age of Kali there is no protection. Children definitely require protection. Children should be protected by the state government and children should also be protected by the parents. In case the parents, the child doesn't have parents because it's an orphan, parents died or separated from parents, then the state has to give protection to such children, orphans. So children require protection, again they will be exploited, they will be uncared for, there will not be proper upbringing, there will be no proper development of the child for a...

**Key Quote:** "Brahmanas they require protection because they don't have time for earning their livelihoods they are supposed to be busy with worshipping God and learning the scriptures and disseminating that knowledge in society free of charge to everyone else who is ignorant."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why Brahmanas and cows require special protection, highlighting the Brahmanas' role in spiritual education and the importance of cow's milk for physical and spiritual development.

good future etc. Now brahmanas, they require protection because they don't have time for earning their livelihoods. They are supposed to be busy with worshipping God and learning the scriptures and disseminating that knowledge in society free of charge to everyone else who is ignorant or who doesn't have the aptitude to learn this by the system of gurukula. So brahmanas have got a very irresponsible task and brahmanas they are not strong enough to defend themselves against any attack. They have to be protected by the Kshatriyas government. Government has to give protection, law and order situation has to be maintained by the government. So brahmanas specially require protection for the welfare of the entire society. Cows require special protection because cow is the only animal that gives the human society what is called as cow's milk, which is a miracle food which contains the aggregate of all nutritional values required for a human being. It's required for our subsistence, it's required for our development and growth and development of finer brain tissues to understand spiritual subject matter.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the lack of protection in Kali Yuga and illustrates the problem with examples of broken families and uncared-for women and children, especially in Western countries.

We discuss this many times earlier, so cow should be specially protected. So in Kali Yuga there is no proper protection for these four categories of persons. They'd be grossly neglected and they left unprotected in this age of Kali. Illicit connection with women will render many women and children uncared for. You can see this specially in the western countries in America. So many women, because somehow they get married or even if they are not married, they have their living partner. Then they have a child and the person who is supposed to be the father of the child that is born, he just walks out due to divorce or separation or broken family.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the dangers of women seeking independence outside of marriage, arguing that it makes them vulnerable to exploitation and that marriage provides necessary protection and guidance.

And one more problem in this Kali Yuga's present age is circumstantial. The women will try to become into the relationship independent of the protection of marriage. Sorry, independent protection of men through marriage. They want to be independent. This independent is dangerous for the woman. Why? Because then she is prone to be exploited by rogues, ruffians. As long as they are married and there is a proper family unit, where they are married, they are given proper protection, they are guided and they are cared for, women will be exploited.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the degraded state of Brahmanas in Kali Yuga, who may be highly educated but lack moral and religious principles, leading to a disconnect between intelligence and character.

The brahmanas, they are traditionally intelligent people who can pick up knowledge, who can learn, who can teach. But in Kali Yuga, they will acquire modern education, but as far as moral and religious principles are concerned, they don't care for that. They shall be most fallen in terms of following good moral principles. Very intelligent, very educated, very learned, but as far as morality is concerned, very, very poor, very bad. So, education and bad character don't go together, normally, but in Kali Yuga, they will run parallel. The person is very intelligent, very educated, very learned, but as for, don't ask what is his character, character is worst character, because they don't care to follow the principles, moral principles, religious principles, they don't care to follow.

And, what about the administrators? They call themselves secular. Because of it, they don't follow any of the eternal Vedic principles. So, they say we don't believe. And, they have their own so-called system of administration. They don't follow the standard authorities, Manusamhita, etc. So, they have some concocted system of governance. And, they will actually not give protection to the genuine brahmanas, to followers of real dharma, because of which, there will be so much of degradation in society, because people don't get proper guidance from a qualified brahmana, they become degraded. The innocent people, the common people become degraded. And, society will actually become very, very, very, very fallen.

So, these are some of the symptoms of the age of Kali, which are harmful to the general welfare of the human society. That's why this is being raised here.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 22nd verse of the 16th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 22nd verse is as follows: Kim Chhatra Bandhun Kalinopa Srishtan Rashtrani Vaatair Avaropitani Itas Tato Vasana Pana Vasaha Snana Javayon Mukha Jeevalokam. The meaning of this verse is: The so-called administrators are now bewildered by the influence of this age of Kali, and thus they have put all state affairs into disorder. Are you now lamenting this disorder? Now the general populace does not follow the rules and regulations for eating, sleeping, drinking, mating, etc., and they are inclined to perform such any business whether they are staying in their inner community that they have been advised by God how to behave in this global and they have too much to stay in them to live anyway. How can one save himself? How to take care of one's life, every life in the world? Cow because mother earth was very much agreed and dharma is trying to find the cause for her grief, her condition. So different questions are being raised which are basically indicative of the

**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the influence of Kali Yuga, highlighting the prominence of irreligion and the resulting disorder in state affairs due to irreligious administrators.

degraded condition of the Kali Yuga, the present age. So here the administrators are being particularly mentioned as biblical by the influence of this age of Kali. What are the influence of age of Kali? Adharma Bandhu. Kali is described as Adharma Bandhu, friend of irreligion. So irreligion becomes prominent. Same thing in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says, yada yadahi dharmasya gladi bhavati bharata dharmasya gladi means the religion is going down and down and down, people are not following religious principles, abhyutthanam adharmasya religion becomes very prominent and that is exactly what Kali does, makes irreligion very prominent. So the administrators, they don't follow religious principles, they themselves are religious and the people they have to administer are also irreligious, so all the State affairs are in disorder. There is no proper law and order situation prevailing, which was the, which was the law and order was much, much better in the earlier ages.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of rules and regulations in a civilized society, contrasting it with the unregulated behavior prevalent in Kali Yuga, comparing human and animal needs.

There were very strong administrators, the kings, and they had excellent administration. So things were very much well maintained. But now, due to the influence of Dejav Kali, there is disorder in the state affairs. And one more thing pointed out here is general populace, general people in general do not follow the rules and regulations for eating, sleeping, drinking, meeting, etc. Civilized society means there should be some regulation, otherwise people who are unregulated, they simply perform these activities anywhere and everywhere without any restriction, unrestrictedly they eat, they drink, and they create nuisance. So in general, there is no peace, there is no law and order, so Dharma is questioning mother earth, are you unhappy because of this? So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, there is some necessities of life on a par with those of lower animals and there is some necessity of life on a par with those of lower animals, common activities, but for humans and animals what are they? Eating, sleeping, fearing, and meeting, ahara nidra bhaya my tuna, these bodily demands are for both the human beings and the animals.

**Key Quote:** "The influence of the age of Kali is bewildering people that means they are overwhelmed by the prospect of becoming irreligious not following the the rules and regulations given in the scriptures."
**Summary:** This segment focuses on the code of conduct for human beings, the bewildering influence of Kali Yuga, and the resulting moral decline as people disregard scriptural rules and regulations.

We require to eat as much as the animals have to eat to maintain themselves, sleeping is required, but the human being has to fulfill such desires, not only to fulfill such desires, but also to fulfill the position they have on them and the human human desire to act or be considered a public nuisance and to personally criminally prosecuted. So human beings, there is the code of conduct. 601 Singapore immigrants have not been lied to as the iwo Hong Delta human equal. There is a code of conduct, civilized society of education, civilized society of education, civil behavior, they cannot openly engage in sex. So proper says therefore for the human being there are some rules and regulations even for fulfilling common demands. The human society avoid such rules and regulations when it is bewildered by the influence of the age of Kali. The influence of the age of Kali is bewildering people, that means they are overwhelmed by the prospect of becoming irreligious, not following the the rules and regulations given in the scriptures are traditionally being followed that they do not do so. Sheila proper says in this age, the age of Kali, people are indulging in such necessities of life without following the rules and regulations. They don't want to follow the rules and regulations, they are unrestricted in doing these activities and this deterioration of social and moral rules is certainly lamentable.

**Summary:** The speaker laments the gradual social decline, even in India, and emphasizes the challenges faced by parents in raising children amidst bad influences in the age of Kali.

It is a very sorry or sad state of affairs the present age. Of course, we are seeing a gradual decline. It's not so bad in our country as it is in the Western countries, it's much worse condition. But even in India where the very culture is still prominent, still there are people who are in a small number, a minority of the section of the human population here are not so much strict in following the rules, traditional rules and regulations in their social and moral behavior. They are not so strict in following the rules because of the harmful effects such beastly behavior. Proper is a strong words, they are behaving like animals, their behavior is not up to the mark, not up to the standard of a human being, a civilized human being. And particularly proper says in this age the fathers and the guardians are not happy with the behavior of their wards. The children have become disobedient to the parents or to the elders, they don't know how to respect the elders and the children also are misguided by bad advertisement by too much of freedom to do whatever they like to do without any restriction without any curtailment of their so-called freedom. So proper says here particularly the parents should know that so many innocent children are victims of bad association awarded by the influence of

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Ajamila, illustrating how a single instance of bad association can lead to moral corruption, even for someone from a cultured background.

this age of Kali. Even though the house household atmosphere may be good because parents are very cultured, they their upbringing is very good and the child is very small, but once the child starts going to school it is exposed to so many bad things outside the house. Outside the house there's so much exposure to the wrong things, bad things, bad behavior. Now from the Srimad Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada says we know from Srimad Bhagavatam that a Jamila, an innocent son of a Brahmana was walking down a road and he saw a Sudra pair sexually embracing. If you're not familiar with this, it is described in the sixth canto of the Bhagavatam, this a Jamila story. This is something that happened very, very, very long back in a bygone age and a Jamila was the son of a Brahmana and he was well behaved, very, very cultured. He had gone to pick pick some flowers from the forest just outside the village and on the way when back when returning to his village after picking flowers, he happened to see a low-class pair of man and woman sexually embracing each other and this disturbed his mind very much disturbed his mind. So it said here this attracted the boy and later on the boy became a victim of all debaucheries, all kinds of bad habits. He got attracted to that it was a prostitute who was entertaining one customer, but this Brahmana is nothing to do with prostitutes and all such low-class behavior, but somehow he happened to glance and lusty desires awakened in his heart and he became very mischievous and even then he got attracted to these women with this man. I have she let me tell you something he didn't get a chance to know and at first I thought this was a very nice one, but this was a very nice man, he actually saw him as an important man and the man he was attracted to and he was tormented by that desire to enjoy like that low-class man was enjoying with the prostitute. He also developed a strong desire, lusty desire to enjoy and he later on he sought out that prostitute, brought her home, deserted his wife and elderly parents, chaste wife, he sent her away and he started enjoying with a prostitute. So from a pure brahmana he fell down to the position of a wretched urchin. It was all due to bad association just because he happened to see a prostitute embracing a low-class person.

**Summary:** The lecture concludes by reiterating the pervasive influence of Kali Yuga, leading to social problems and challenges, particularly for those trying to maintain a cultured upbringing.

So Sushila Prabhupada comments there was but one victim like a Jamila in those days, but in this age of Kali the poor innocent students are daily victims of cinemas which attract men only for sex indulgence. What they show in cinemas is not very much commendable, it's not very good, it has a very adverse impact. So therefore by the influence of the age of kali everywhere politically, socially, religiously everything is topsy-turvy. Therefore for the same person it is all regrettable, it's a very serious problem for sober people, behaved cultured people, it's a big challenge that the atmosphere is presenting for their upbringing of their children in a proper way. It's a it's quite a difficult thing.

**Key Quote:** "So, one more reason for Mother Earth to be aggrieved, feeling that grief is because the Kali Yuga began after Krishna's disappearance, after Krishna wound up His pastimes on the earth."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains the 23rd verse of the 16th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on the earth's grief after Krishna's departure and the beginning of Kali Yuga.

In this session, we will be discussing from two verses, the 23rd and the 24th verses of the 16th chapter of the Shri Advaitha Gadadhara. This is the 16th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. The 23rd verse first: Yadva Amba Te Bhuri Bharaavatara Krataavatarasya Hare Dharitri Antarhitasya Smarati Vishrishta Karmaani Nirvana Vilambitani. The meaning of this 23rd verse is, "O Mother Earth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Hari incarnated Himself as Lord Shri Krishna just to unload Your heavy burden. All His activities here are transcendental and they cement the path of liberation. You are now bereft of His presence. You are probably now thinking of those activities and feeling sorry in their absence." So, one more reason for Mother Earth to be aggrieved, feeling that grief, is because the Kali Yuga began after Krishna's disappearance, after Krishna wound up His pastimes on the earth. So, as long as Krishna was present, there was no possibility of any evil influence of any sort. And not only that, the Supreme Lord Himself incarnated to reduce the burden of the earth, which was overburdened by demoniac persons posing as kings. And as long as Krishna was present, His activities were all completely transcendental. And because of that, there was no possibility of any bad influence. So, in the absence of Krishna, those transcendental activities are not there anymore. And maybe Dharma is asking Mother Earth, maybe you are feeling sorry in the absence of Krishna and His transcendental activities.

**Key Quote:** "In fact, those seriously practicing pure devotional service are not at all interested in liberation, are not interested in any of the four Purusharthas, not interested in dharma, artha, kama, moksha."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing that pure devotional service is far more relishable than liberation, making devotees disinterested in the four Purusharthas.

So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, nirvana vilambitani. That is explained specially by Srila Prabhupada in the purport. What does it mean? In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The activities of the Lord include liberation, but they are more relishable than the pleasure derived from nirvana or liberation." This is a very important point. In bhakti, liberation is a secondary benefit or a secondary result of practicing Bhakti. In fact, those seriously practicing pure devotional service are not at all interested in liberation, are not interested in any of the four Purusharthas, not interested in dharma, artha, kama, moksha. Why? Because the activities of the Lord, which are the essence of all activities of Bhakti, they are more relishable than the pleasure derived from liberation. Millions and billions of times more relishable. The description is given in the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, Nectar of Devotion, this book, written by Srila Rupa Goswami, describing the characteristics of pure devotional service. Srila Rupa Goswami says, quoting authentic Vedic references, he says, "The pleasure derived from liberation is so very insignificant as compared to the pleasure derived from pure devotional service, that even one drop of pleasure of pure devotional service cannot be compared with an ocean of pleasure that may be derived from liberation. The two cannot be compared at all." That means, the pleasure derived from pure devotional service is billions upon billions of times greater than the pleasure of liberation. So therefore, devotees who are seriously practicing in knowledge the system of pure devotional service, they are not at all interested in liberation.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the term 'nirvana vilambitani' and how devotional service minimizes the value of liberation, leading to eternal service in Krishnaloka.

So, according to Srila Jeeva Goswami and Vishwanath Chakraborty, two previous acharyas, the word used here is nirvana vilambitani. What's the meaning of this? These two terms? That which minimizes the value of liberation. Pure devotional service is such that it minimizes the value of liberation. It makes it insignificant. To attain nirvana, liberation, one has to undergo a severe type of tapasya or austerity. But the Lord is so great, so merciful, that He incarnates to diminish the burden of the earth. Krishna comes down, He definitely removes the burden of the earth. Simply by remembering such activities of the Lord, one can defy the pleasure derived from nirvana and reach the transcendental abode of the Lord to associate with Him and eternally engage in His blissful loving service. So Krishna comes to attract us by His activities. And if we become attracted, we straight go to Krishnaloka, after quoting this body, and there we are eternally engaged in the wonderful loving service of Krishna, which is many, many, many billions of times more relishable than the pleasure derived from nirvana.

**Key Quote:** "Kala deteriorates everything that is created in the material world. That's a fact."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains the 24th verse, discussing the deteriorated condition of the earth after Krishna's departure due to the influence of time (kala).

The 24th verse: idam mamachakshva tavadhi moolam vasundhare yena vikarshitasi kalena vate balinam baliyasa surarchitam kim hrutam amba saubhagam. The meaning of this verse is, "Mother, you are the reservoir of all riches. Please inform me of the root cause of your tribulations by which you have been reduced to such a weak state. I think that the powerful influence of time which conquers the most powerful might have forcibly taken away all your fortune which is adored even by the demigods." So dharma is making a reference to the condition of the earth when Krishna was present here, and the present condition of the earth after Krishna's disappearance. So there is a big difference between the two. So why has the earth been reduced to such a weak state after the disappearance of Krishna? So it is mentioned here in the verse itself, "the powerful influence of time which conquers the most powerful." Kala. Kala deteriorates everything that is created in the material world. That's a fact.

**Key Quote:** "The problem with material existence is people think they are independent. While the truth is we are entirely dependent on the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of recognizing our dependence on Krishna, contrasting it with the illusion of independence in material existence.

Including our own body and all the other things in the surrounding atmosphere. They go on gradually reducing in strength, reducing in potency, reducing in their vitality. So it goes on reducing, reducing, reducing, reducing, reducing. So that is very much experienced by us now. So Srila Prabhupada says, "By the grace of the Lord, each and every planet is created fully equipped." Earth is fully equipped for maintenance of the inhabitants of this earth planet. But when the Lord comes, Krishna comes to this earth planet, the earth becomes enriched with so many different opulences that even the devatas who have much better conditions of living in the heaven as compared to earth, they become impressed by the extraordinary opulence on this earth planet. So Srila Prabhupada says, "We should always remember that by the will of the Lord, the whole earth can at once be changed." Either the earth is lacking resources, then by Krishna's will, earth can become enriched to a great extent. Or if earth is having lot of opulences, then by the will of the Lord, all those opulences can be lost in a fraction of a moment. So Srila Prabhupada says, "Therefore no one should consider himself to be self-sufficient or independent of the Lord." The problem with material existence is people think they are independent. While the truth is we are entirely dependent on the Supreme Lord. In all conditions of existence, in the spiritual world, in the material world, in the liberated state, in the conditioned state, any condition, we are completely dependent on the Lord. Fully dependent. And the Lord being the actual maintainer, protector, guardian, well-wisher of everyone, He happily maintains us. He doesn't have to exert himself, He is full of all opulences. So He does maintain us. But if we foolishly think why should I depend on Krishna? I want to be independent. This is exactly the mentality of people in this world, in this material world. That they somehow mistakenly think that they can be independent and they turn their face away from the Supreme Lord in the spiritual world.

**Key Quote:** "This material nature is completely controlled by Krishna under His superintendence everything is working, everything is happening."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that material nature is controlled by Krishna and that the illusion of independence leads to suffering, ending with a thank you and Hare Krishna.

They are placed in the material world. And in the material world the laws work by which they don't get everything they really need very freely. They have to work and they have to get their needs according to the work they do and according to what they deserve and desire. Both are considered. And foolishly people think that this material nature is meant for our exploitation or can be brought under our control. No. From the Bhagavad Gita we get the information, the knowledge: mayādhyakṣeṇa-prakṛteḥ sūyateśa-carācaram. This material nature is completely controlled by Krishna, under His superintendence everything is working, everything is happening. He's got many agents to maintain everything. He doesn't have to exert himself. He directs. So, material nature is not independent. This earth planet is not independent. The conditions on this earth planet are not simply because of some human endeavor or effort. No. So, it is completely dependent on the Lord. So, nobody should think I am self-sufficient. I am independent. Nobody should think like that, because that's the truth. That's the reality. If they somehow think like that and live like that then under illusion they will actually have to suffer so many bad consequences of such a wrong thinking that I am independent. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "The principles of religion are laid down by the Lord himself"
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, discussing the origin of religious principles from the Lord, the role of Yama Raja, and the full implementation of Dharma in Satya Yuga.

Mother Earth to Dharma. So Srila Prabhupada comments on this, he says in the purport, "The principles of religion are laid down by the Lord himself, Dharmaṃ tu sākṣād bhagavat pranītam and the executor of such laws is Dharma Rāja or Yama Rāja." Yama is a very powerful Devata. He is responsible for enforcing the laws of Dharma given by God. Such principles work fully in the age of Satya Yuga. There are four cycles of four ages that rotate like calendar months. So the first Yuga is called Satya Yuga and then Treta Yuga and then Dvapar Yuga and then Kala Yuga and after Kala Yuga again Satya Yuga begins.

**Key Quote:** "Kali Yuga is the lowest of the four yugas but in Kali Yuga the religious principles are reduced to one-fourth means seventy-five percent is lost"
**Summary:** The speaker describes the cyclical decline of Dharma through the four Yugas (Satya, Treta, Dvapara, and Kali), highlighting the increasing influence of irreligion and the eventual devastation at the end of Kali Yuga when religious principles are practically nonexistent.

So in Satya Yuga, the first of the four ages, the principles of Dharma are fully followed by the people in general, this earth planet. In the Treta Yuga they are reduced by a fraction of one-fourth. That means by the time Treta Yuga starts, Satya Yuga is over. Then the irreligion creeps in to the society and one-fourth of the religious principles are lost. In the Dwapar Yuga, the third Yuga, they are reduced to one-half. Irreligion has increased and religion keeps on decreasing. So irreligion has become half and religion is only the other half. And in Kali Yuga they are reduced to one-fourth, gradually diminishing to the zero point and then devastation takes place. So Kali Yuga is the lowest of the four yugas, but in Kali Yuga the religious principles are reduced to one-fourth, means seventy-five percent is lost and this twenty-five percent also it will go on reducing, reducing, reducing as Kali Yuga progresses and towards the end of Kali Yuga devastation takes place because all the religious principles have been reduced to zero, practically nobody follows anything, so that is when there

Happiness in the world depends proportionately on the maintenance of the religious principles individually or collectively. So if you want to be happy in this material world then we should follow the religious principles and it applies to following individually and collectively. That means I myself should follow the religious principles what is set for me and I should also follow the religious principles which are meant for others. So this is a very, very important point here, then only there can be happiness in human society, if people follow the religious principles. Srila Prabhupada further says, "The best part of valor is to maintain the progress for all." Jesus of Gospel, the holy water of onc Yasodharosa. Vahara wouldn't lose aat忘cycle. principles despite all kinds of odds one can be happy if one follows the rules and regulations which are not very difficult to follow, it just requires some proper knowledge, training and a certain frame of mind to apply these principles properly and nicely. So individually and collectively we have to follow the rules regulations and there is benefit. What is the immediate benefit? Individually somebody follows then they are, they are able to maintain their health and their situation very nicely according to the scriptural directions. So by following these rules one can be happy while we live in this earth planet and ultimately

### Qualities of the Lord, Truthfulness, Cleanliness, Tolerance, Knowledge, Leadership, Beauty, Eternity, Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "In him reside means the supreme lord 40 qualities will be mentioned now by mother earth"
**Summary:** The speaker lists 40 qualities of the Supreme Lord as described by Mother Earth, emphasizing that these are just a few of the Lord's innumerable transcendental qualities and that Krishna has closed his transcendental pastimes on the face of the earth.

These are the five verses and the translation of this verse as given by Prabhupada in the Bhagavatam, "In him reside," means the Supreme Lord, 40 qualities will be mentioned now by mother earth, 40 qualities, 4-0. What are those 40 qualities? She mentions here: truthfulness, cleanliness, intolerance of another's happiness, the power to control anger, self-satisfaction, straightforwardness, steadiness of mind, control of the sense organs, responsibility, equality, tolerance, equanimity, faithfulness, knowledge, absence of sense enjoyment, leadership, chivalry, influence, the power to make everything possible, the discharge of proper duty, complete independence, dexterity, fullness of all beauty, serenity, kind-heartedness, ingenuity, gentility, magnanimity, determination, perfection in all knowledge, proper execution, possession of all objects of enjoyment, joyfulness, immovability, fidelity, fame, worship, pridelessness, being as the personality of Godhead and 40th one, eternity. And these 40 qualities are not the only qualities that are to be found in the Lord. Earth and many other transcendental qualities which are eternally present and never to be separated from him. Another place Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur says, samastha guna gana dhama, the Supreme Lord is the reservoir of all good qualities, samastha guna gana and they are innumerable, we cannot count them. So it is said here, the personality, that personality of Godhead, the reservoir of all goodness and beauty, Lord Shri Krishna has now closed his transcendental pastimes on the face of the earth. This is a fact, as long as Krishna was present there were wonderful pastimes going on always, but moment Krishna left this earth planet for returning to his personal abode and since then the influence of the age of Kali is spreading everywhere and therefore mother earth is saying, "I am sorry to see this condition of existence on the earth planet after the Lord has left for his personal abode."

### Qualities of the Lord, Unlimited Qualities, Anantadeva, Shastra, Acharyas

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The lord is the reservoir of all good qualities and his unlimited good qualities to an unlimited extent"
**Summary:** The speaker prepares to discuss the qualities of the Lord further, referencing Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the Lord's unlimited and wonderful qualities, and the attempt by Anantadeva to enumerate them, emphasizing the importance of accepting knowledge from the shastras and acharyas.

So we will discuss these qualities. Before discussing the qualities we will hear what Prabhupada says about the qualities of the Supreme Lord. Supreme Lord is full of wonderful qualities, unlimited qualities he has got and all are wonderful qualities, very nice qualities and we as living beings we possess some of those qualities in a very, very, very, very tiny quantity. Krishna has unlimited qualities and he has to an unlimited degree. So we will hear Prabhupada's explanation of what it means, unlimited degree he has got unlimited qualities. We will understand first of all Prabhupada says in the purport, "Even if it were possible to count the atoms after smashing the earth into powder still it would not be possible to estimate the unfathomable transcendental qualities of the earth." What are the transcendental qualities of the Lord? Lord has so many wonderful qualities that even a scientist if he could count the number of atoms after smashing the earth into powder, the earth planet, humans planet, still he could not estimate the number of wonderful qualities present in the Supreme Lord. And Prabhupada says that Lord Anantadeva, one of the expansions of the Lord has tried to enumerate these transcendental qualities of the Supreme Lord with his numberless tongues. He has millions of faces and in each face he has one tongue. So with his numberless tongues he is trying to describe the unlimited qualities of the Supreme Lord but it has not been possible for him to estimate all the qualities of the Lord even though he is going on describing the qualities of the transcendental qualities of the Lord with his numberless tongues, he is not able to exhaust it. So therefore we should accept from the shastra and from the acharyas that the Lord is the reservoir of all good qualities and his unlimited good qualities to an unlimited extent and we will understand this further more in the next few sessions. So I will stop here, thank you very much.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So in these verses, 5 verses, 40 of the unlimited number of qualities the Lord has are being enumerated."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of the Lord's unlimited good qualities, mentioning that 40 of these qualities are listed in the verses being discussed, contrasting them with the lack of such qualities in Kali Yuga.

This is part 2 of the description of these verses. Now we heard how the Supreme Lord is full of wonderful qualities, of which some 40 qualities have been listed by Mother Earth when she was questioned as to the cause for her grief in this Kali Yuga. So people in general lack these good qualities in Kali Yuga, whereas the Supreme Lord and Mother Earth, they always are having good qualities. So here the description is given by Srila Prabhupada in the purport that nobody can estimate how many good qualities the Lord has. So in these verses, 5 verses, 40 of the unlimited number of qualities the Lord has are being enumerated.

### prowess of Vishnu, Trivikrama, Vamandeva

**Verse References:** SB 2.7.40
**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Who can describe completely the prowess of Vishnu?"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the immeasurable nature of Vishnu's prowess, using the example of Trivikrama's expansion to cover the universe and pierce its coverings, allowing the water from the causal ocean to enter this world.

We will try to discuss some of them. So before that, it is described in another place in the Bhagavatam. It says in the 40th verse of the 7th chapter of the second canto of Bhagavatam, it is said, "Who can describe completely the prowess of Vishnu? Who can describe completely the prowess of Vishnu?" By asking this question, it is understood that nobody can describe completely the prowess of Vishnu. Even the scientist who might have counted the particles of the atoms of the universe cannot do so. Is it a small thing? For the scientist, the achievement is to have discovered the atom, the tiniest particle of matter. But even if a scientist can count by scientific advancement the particles of atoms in the whole universe, still such a scientist cannot actually estimate how many qualities the Supreme Lord has. Now an example is given here that only in his form as Trivikrama, the Supreme Lord, he moved his leg effortlessly beyond the topmost planet Satyaloka up to the neutral state of the three modes of material nature. The Lord as Vamandeva or Trivikrama, he tricked Bali Maharaj into giving him charity of three paces of land. And when he actually wanted to measure three paces of land, he said, "According to my measurement." So it was agreed that according to this small boy's measurement it will be awarded. But actually the boy started growing and growing and growing and growing, and he extended his leg, one of his legs, to pierce the coverings of the universe and touch the shell of the universe and make a hole there by which the water from the Causal ocean, the spiritual water, started coming to this world.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Cleanliness means not only external cleanliness, which all of us know, but also internal cleanliness."
**Summary:** The speaker begins to discuss the 40 qualities of the Lord mentioned in the verses, focusing on truthfulness and cleanliness, emphasizing the importance of both external and internal cleanliness, with internal cleanliness being achieved through chanting Hare Krishna.

So this is the prowess of Vishnu, one prowess of Vishnu being described here. So actually nobody can estimate how much, how many qualities, wonderful qualities Vishnu has got. And now these forty qualities mentioned here in these five verses, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, the qualities will be divided into many subheadings. So I'll just read the qualities, and then some of them are elaborated in the purport. We will discuss them in a little more detail. So these forty qualities that are listed here are to be found completely in the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna. The first quality is truthfulness, Satyam. Truthfulness is a virtue that is absolutely essential for everyone. Then only we can, we can be free from sinful reactions. Anybody who tells lies, they are punishable by the laws of God, which are always working. So one should not tell lies, one should tell the truth, and that is called truthfulness. People who follow this, this being truthful, this quality, they are respected in society, they are held in great esteem, like that, truthfulness. Second is cleanliness. Cleanliness means not only external cleanliness, which all of us know, we take a bath, we wash our clothes, we keep our surroundings clean, etc., not only that external cleanliness, but also internal cleanliness. This is very, very important. Internal cleanliness is cleanliness of the consciousness, and that is possible by the appropriate method of chanting Hare Krishna. We can cleanse the heart.

### qualities of the Lord, intolerance of unhappiness, Daya

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Daya refers to not being able to tolerate another's unhappiness."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the third quality, 'Daya' or intolerance of another's unhappiness, explaining that it encompasses protection of surrendered souls and well-wishing for devotees, based on Srila Jiva Goswami's teachings.

By chanting Hare Krishna and by executing pure devotional service, our heart becomes cleansed. Otherwise the heart is filled with so many material contamination by our long association with this material nature from time immemorial. So the third quality described here is intolerance of another's unhappiness. See, very interesting. The Sanskrit for that third quality being mentioned in this list is Daya. Daya literally means, one of the meanings is kindness, but here specifically Daya refers to not able to tolerate another's unhappiness, intolerance of another's unhappiness. So about Daya, Daya refers to not able to tolerate another's unhappiness. So about this quality, Srila Prabhupada is telling in the purport, quoting Srila Jiva Goswami, one of the previous Acharyas. Srila Jiva Goswami says that this quality can be subdivided into two divisions, subdivisions. The first one is protection of the surrendered souls, and the second one is well wishes for the devotees. Protection of the surrendered souls and well wishes for the devotees are two subdivisions of the third quality called intolerance of another's unhappiness.

### surrender, protection, well-wishing
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/ywd495Suhz4?t=595
**Verse References:** BG 18.66
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna says don't fear, don't worry about some sinful reactions from the past, I will free you from all those reactions, you simply surrender to me."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the Lord's intolerance of suffering, explaining that He protects surrendered souls from sinful reactions, referencing Krishna's assurance in the Bhagavad Gita to provide protection upon surrender.

The Lord cannot tolerate our suffering. We are unhappy because of so many sinful reactions that we have to undergo, suffering. And the Lord is not happy about it. So how does he exercise his intolerance? He protects the surrendered souls. He protects the surrendered souls because of which they don't suffer the reactions in his material world. And second is well wishes for the devotees. Krishna is the topmost well wisher of all the devotees. Actually Krishna is well wisher of every living being, but particularly devotees of single doubt, those who are surrendered to Krishna, those who are engaged in serving Krishna through devotion, they are particularly maintained by the Lord in such a way that the Lord acts as their topmost well wisher. So these two are indicative of the Lord's intolerance towards another's unhappiness. Now Srila Prabhupada explains, why is it said protection of the surrendered souls? Why not protect the unsurrendered souls also? Why not protect everybody? Why is the Lord selective about whom he protects? Prabhupada explains elaborately in the purport. Prabhupada says, to understand this, we have to remember in the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord states that he wants every soul to surrender unto him only, and he assures everyone that if one does so, Krishna will give protection from the reactions of all sins. Krishna says, "Don't fear. Don't worry about some sinful reactions from the past. I will free you from all those reactions. You simply surrender to me. You leave it to me. You surrender to me and leave it to me. I will take care. Take care means I will free you from all sinful reactions."

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Because they don't surrender and they want to be independent, Krishna does not interfere in their life and therefore they are not particularly protected by the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why the Lord specifically protects surrendered souls, noting that those who choose independence and do not surrender are not particularly protected, as Krishna does not interfere with their choices.

So he gives assurance. But there are people who are not surrendered to the Lord in this material world. In fact, majority of people are not surrendered. They don't want to surrender to Krishna, either because they think themselves independent, or they think God is another ordinary person of this world, or they think that they can compete with God. Even if he is powerful, they can compete with him. They think God's position as powerful personality, if at all they know something about God, is a relative position. Just like we see people around us, somebody is more powerful than us, somebody is less powerful than us. So they think like that. God may be another more powerful person than me, but I can eventually by working my way to become more powerful, I can become as powerful as God. I can become more powerful than him. So these are all some of the misconceptions because of which people don't surrender to Krishna, don't surrender to God. Then because they don't surrender and they want to be independent, Krishna does not interfere in their life, and therefore they are not particularly protected by the Lord.

### general protection, laws of karma, devotee maintenance

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Devotees Krishna maintains completely perfectly in all respects, 100% maintenance, all desires are fulfilled."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the general protection provided to all living beings with the complete and perfect maintenance offered to devotees, highlighting that non-devotees are provided for according to the laws of karma, and concludes by announcing the topic for the next session.

Though in general Krishna protects everybody, that means what is this general protection of everyone, even the unsurrendered people? It is that Krishna only provides for them, for their maintenance, even in the material world, in the material world, in the spiritual world, everywhere Krishna is the only maintainer of everyone else. His maintenance is different of the devotees and non-devotees. Devotees Krishna maintains completely, perfectly, in all respects, 100% maintenance. All desires are fulfilled. They are completely blissful under shelter of Krishna directly. The living beings in the material world who are not surrendered to Krishna, they are provided for by the Lord according to certain laws of karma, laws of karma. Because why the laws of karma? Because they are not surrendered and they have a tendency to exploit others, to lord over others, to ill-treat others, like that. So they are not provided like the devotees are provided. So this difference exists, and we will discuss in the next session how this difference comes about. We will discuss in the next session. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the unlimited nature of the Lord's transcendental qualities, contrasting it with the finite number of atoms in the universe, setting the stage for discussing some of these qualities.

So the discussion is very important because to understand, actually, what is dharma and to also understand the different transcendental qualities which are there in the Supreme Lord is very important for anyone interested in Krishna Consciousness. So Srila Prabhupada writes a very elaborate purport for these verses in the Srimad Bhagavatam. And we have already finished discussing in the past two sessions, part one and part two, some of the qualities described here, particularly the first point that Prabhupada makes in this purport to this set of verses. He says that it is not possible to count the number of transcendental qualities the Lord possesses. Even if one were to compare this number to the number of atoms one can obtain by smashing the entire universe into small particles of dust, still you cannot compare that number of atoms in the universe, total number of atoms, to the number of transcendental qualities possessed by the Lord, which means that the number of transcendental qualities of the Lord are unlimited, whereas the number of atoms in this universe is a finite number, is not unlimited.

**Key Quote:** "So, since we are a very, very insignificant part of the Lord, we have some qualities of the Lord in a very, very minute quantity."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Mother Earth (Dharini) is replying to Dharma's questions about the Lord's qualities, highlighting that all good qualities are present in the Lord and that living beings possess minute quantities of these qualities due to being part of the Lord.

It is not unlimited. So therefore, some qualities are being mentioned here just for our understanding, still the number is not a small number. Forty qualities are mentioned here by Mother Earth while replying to Dharini, Dharini Vacha. That is the beginning of these words, Dharini Vacha. She is replying to the questions asked by Dharma. The previous set of verses before this, Dharma Vacha, that is the principle of, sorry, the personality of religious principles, Dharma, in the shape of a bull, is inquiring from Dharini, Mother Earth, in the shape of a cow. And Dharini is replying that in the Supreme Lord, there reside all good qualities which are to be found among different people in this world. So, since we are a very, very insignificant part of the Lord, we have some qualities of the Lord in a very, very minute quantity. So, we should remember, Lord is completely spiritual, we are also completely spiritual beings, but the Lord is unlimited personality and we are always limited. Unlimited transcendental qualities we have and he has those qualities to an unlimited extent.

**Key Quote:** "So, he cares for every one of us and his compassion is so much that he personally comes to this world in the form of three Vishnus and incarnates as three Vishnus."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Krishna's unlimited compassion, explaining how He incarnates as three Vishnus and expands as Paramatma to reside in the heart of every living being, fulfilling their desires.

Just like the prayer we offer to Krishna, we say, Hey Krishna, Karuna, Sindho, you are an ocean of compassion. Now, comparison to the ocean means that he has got unlimited compassion. And what is the proof? That even though there are so many millions and billions and trillions of living entities who are almost completely forgetful of the Lord in this world, still the Lord out of compassion for each one of them, because they are insignificant. They are many and they are insignificant, but still, as far as Krishna is concerned, every living being, he says, is my part and parcel. Cannot be separated from me, Krishna says. So, he cares for every one of us and his compassion is so much that he personally comes to this world in the form of three Vishnus and incarnates as three Vishnus: the Mahavishnu, the Padmanabha Vishnu, and the maintainer Vishnu. Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, you would have heard these three names. So, that maintainer Vishnu, that maintainer Vishnu expands as Paramatma and enters the heart of every living being. Why? Why does he do so? In order to actually direct and satisfy the desires and give the intelligence and make the living entity, the Jeeva, in a particular body for the Jeeva to live in that body and to utilize this bodily functions, the Lord is facilitating as Paramatma. So, that is his kindness.

**Key Quote:** "Even though we are not meant to live in the material world, we are not meant to have material body, we are not meant for material enjoyment, we are not meant for that."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the nature of material desires and how they lead to suffering, contrasting them with the spiritual pleasure and existence that living beings are truly meant for, emphasizing the stubbornness with which people cling to material enjoyment despite its inherent miseries.

He fulfills the desires of the living being. Even though those desires are not really very conducive for the actual happiness of the living being, still, because we are very, very adamant, we are stubborn, we want to fulfilment of our material desires. Even though we are not meant to live in the material world, we are not meant to have material body, we are not meant for material enjoyment, we are not meant for that, because we are spirit soul. So, we are meant for spiritual pleasure, we are meant for spiritual existence, we are meant for spiritual body. We are meant for spiritual happiness, and that is wonderful. That is very, very nice. That is everlasting. But anyway, as long as we desire and we are stubborn, we desire material enjoyment and we are stubborn about it, we don't want to give up. Even though, in all the scriptures it is said, if you give up these material desires, then immediately you become free from so much of suffering. All the material desires are the cause of our suffering and the cause of our suffering and the cause of our material existence are the cause of so many problems and complications in our life. But still, if we are very stubborn, and we are about to give up all our catacombs, and we are about to give up our service, we must, we have to give up everything. That is, if I don't give up, they will come after me. If we don't give up the service, the service will not come after us. If we don't give up everything, the service will not come after us. That is the only way. So, we have to fear our universe, sitting next to the particular soul who has got that body, so he is actually fulfilling the desires.

**Key Quote:** "The tenth quality of equality the lord is equally kind to everyone."
**Summary:** The speaker transitions to discussing specific qualities of the Lord, focusing on the tenth quality: equality, explaining that the Lord is equally kind to everyone, like the sun distributing its rays without discrimination.

So that is proof of his compassion. So some of the qualities of the Lord are being analyzed by Srila Prabhupada in the purport based on the commentaries by the previous acharyas. So we already discussed about the third quality mentioned among the 40 qualities, intolerance of another's happiness. So this quality, it was explained in a previous session. I'll proceed next to the tenth quality of equality. The Lord is equally kind to everyone. What does it mean? The Lord has got this quality of equality. He is equally kind to everyone, as the sun is equal in distributing its rays over everyone. The sun is shining in the sky. Is there any discrimination on the part of the sun regarding who actually will get that sunshine?

### surrender, protection, material miseries, bad association

**Key Quote:** "You just surrender to him and he will guarantee all protection. But unfortunate persons are unable to accept this proposition."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that surrendering to the Lord guarantees protection, but unfortunate individuals, influenced by bad association, are unable to accept this proposition and thus suffer material miseries.

No discrimination, but there are people who are unable to take advantage of the sunshine. Similarly, Prabhupada says the Lord says that surrendering unto him is the guarantee for all protection from him. He will give protection. You just surrender to him and he will guarantee all protection. But unfortunate persons are unable to accept this proposition. There are some people who won't surrender to the Lord. In the Bhagavad Gita in the seventh chapter it is described, there are four kinds of people who surrender to Krishna and there are four other kinds of people who don't surrender to Krishna. So the ones who don't surrender to Krishna, they don't get his personal protection. And therefore, because they don't have his personal protection, such people who don't surrender to Krishna suffer from all material miseries which are there in the material world. Material world means material existence means miseries. This is also explained in the Bhagavad Gita. This material world is described as Dukkhaalayam Ashashvatam, it's a temporary place filled with miseries, Dukkhaalayam. Dukkha means miseries, alayam means filled with, full of miseries and so many miseries. So even though the Lord is equally well-wishing to everyone, he does not say some people I will not give you protection. He doesn't say if you are a non-devotee, I will not give you protection, no he doesn't say that. Neither he acts in that way. But the unfortunate living being due to bad association only, it is bad association. Such a person due to bad association is unable to accept the Lord's instructions in toto.

**Key Quote:** "We have foolishly come to this material world desiring material enjoyment."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that the desire for material enjoyment leads to suffering in the material world, contrasting it with the pure happiness of the spiritual world, and emphasizing that surrender to God can free one from this suffering.

Means they don't completely accept and for this the Lord is never to be blamed. We have foolishly come to this material world desiring material enjoyment. There is no material enjoyment in the spiritual world and we as spiritual beings, we belong to the spiritual world. But then we desire material enjoyment. Then we insist on that. We are stubborn about it. Then the Lord makes arrangement for us to come to this material world because that material enjoyment is possible only in the material world. Now the material world, the characteristic is such that it is filled with miseries. There is no pure happiness in this material world. Pure happiness is only in the spiritual world. Spiritual world there is no distress. There is no unhappiness. There is no misery. There is no old age. There is no disease. There is no death. So that is spiritual world. So having come here, now that we may realize in the human form that I am suffering even though I don't want to suffer miseries. And we are also trying to avoid suffering. You have not been able to suffer this suffering in so many ways, our own ways but when one comes in touch with Shastra scriptures one understands that if we surrender to God then God will free us from this suffering but people don't surrender then they have to blame. They have to suffer. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

Now Srila Prabhupada further explains in the purport that when the Lord gives, makes a promise, he never deviates from his word of honor, because he is the Supreme Lord. So he gives a promise, Kaunteya Pratijaanihi Name Bhakta Pranashyati. He promises. And even in the 18th chapter he says, Pratijaane Priyosime. I promise you this because you are very dear to me. Sarva Guhyatamam Bhuyaha Shuname Paramam Vachaha. Ishtosee Medhudam Iti Tato Vakshaami Tehitam. Now in the 9th chapter he says that Man Mana Bhava Madh Bhakto Madhyaji Maam Namaskuru.

So when Krishna gives assurance for protection, the promise is executed in all circumstances.

### Krishna's Protection, Devotee's Duty, Surrender

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Arjuna's life was saved by Krishna, even at the cost of Krishna breaking his promise."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Krishna protecting Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, even to the point of seemingly breaking his own promise, and connects this to the duty of a devotee to follow the instructions of the Lord or spiritual master.

All circumstances. There are many examples given. Just like Arjuna's life was in danger on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, and Krishna will protect Arjuna under all circumstances. So once it so happened that Bhishma was fighting on the side of Duryodhana, he was attacking Arjuna and Arjuna's life was in danger. Bhishma is much, much more powerful and expert in fighting than Arjuna, definitely, even though Arjuna is a great warrior. But still, Bhishma is experienced. He is very, very expert, and he has fought many battles before. He is much, much, much, much more experienced than Arjuna. So Bhishma was fighting very, very, very valiantly, and very bravely, he was attacking Arjuna, expertly shooting arrows, and it appeared like Arjuna's life was in danger. Arjuna was going to get completely destroyed. So Krishna, in order to protect Arjuna, he personally took up a weapon, a wheel of a chariot, and went to stop Bhishma from attacking Arjuna. Now, in doing so, Krishna had actually broken his promise. He had promised that he will not take any weapon. He will not fight in the battle. He will not take any weapon, though he will drive Arjuna's chariot and give Arjuna some strategic directions, how to fight and how to conquer, etc. But Krishna said he will never fight. He will not take any weapons. As long as he is in the battlefield, he will never do that. So, but when Arjuna's life was in danger, Krishna took up one wheel of a chariot and rushed towards Bhishma, got down from the chariot of Arjuna, rushed towards Bhishma to stop Bhishma from attacking Arjuna. And what happened? Bhishma said, Krishna is coming to kill me. What better death can I have? So, Bhishma simply surrendered to Krishna. He stopped attacking Arjuna. He stopped. Arjuna's life was saved. For the moment, Arjuna's life was saved. And after that, when Bhishma surrendered to Krishna, Krishna actually did not attack Bhishma at all. Krishna's purpose is served. Arjuna is saved, and Bhishma is also Krishna's devotee. So, when he surrenders, that means, he is not going to fight anymore. So, when Bhishma surrendered, seeing Krishna is coming to kill me, oh, what better opportunity for me to die than at the hands of the Supreme Lord. Bhishma is a devotee, he knows. So, Krishna never went ahead, did not go ahead to kill Bhishma. He himself also stopped, because Kshatriya code of conduct is, if somebody surrenders, they don't attack, they don't kill. So, Bhishma is surrendering. So, Krishna said, okay, I am not going to attack you, I am not going to kill you. And then, after that, Bhishma never fought again. He said, enough fighting, enough fighting I have done. Now that I have surrendered, I am not going to fight anymore. So, Arjuna's life was saved. Arjuna's life was saved by Krishna, even at the cost of Krishna breaking his promise. So, when Prabhupada says here, where Krishna will never deviate from his word of honour, he will execute his promise under all circumstances. Therefore, Prabhupada says, it is the duty of the pure devotee to be fixed in the discharge of the duty entrusted to him by the Lord or the Lord's bona fide representative, the spiritual master. Guru or Krishna, their instruction we have to follow under all circumstances.

### Responsibility, Krishna's Energies, Upanishads
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/R6BYi1xzKfs?t=479
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna has no responsibility because all his work is done by his different appointed energies."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while everyone has responsibilities, Krishna's responsibility is unique because his energies carry out his desires, referencing the Upanishads to support this point.

And we should be assured that while we are engaged in serving the Supreme Lord or the spiritual master, we have full protection of the Supreme Lord, and we have full guarantee of safety. Now, as far as the responsibility of the Lord is concerned, Srila Prabhupada says that responsibility of the Lord is also unique. We all know what responsibility is. That means we have got certain duties and we have to carry out those duties as far as possible under all circumstances. We carry out the duties. Of course, we are tiny living beings, so sometimes it may be not possible to do our duty. Except such circumstances where we cannot do our duty, we will otherwise, a dutiful person will always, a responsible person will always do his or her duties. But when it comes to Krishna, whatever Krishna's responsibility, so Prabhupada says it is unique. What is the meaning of the uniqueness of Krishna's responsibility? Actually, Krishna has no responsibility. What does it mean? Prabhupada says, Krishna has no responsibility because all his work is done by his different appointed energies. He has many energies: parashya shaktir vividhaiva shruyate svabhaviki jnana balakriyacha, the statement in the Upanishads. So, Krishna has got many, many energies and those energies are simply carrying out whatever he desires to be done according to his will. They carry out whatever he desires that should happen. So, he has nothing to do. Therefore, the Upanishads say, natasya karyam karanam ca vidyate. He has no responsibility. He has no duty. He has no work. So, does it mean he is inactive? If he has no work to do, he has no responsibility because all his responsibilities and duties are carried out by his energies?

### Krishna's Pastimes, Cowherding, Responsibility

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Still, he accepts voluntary responsibilities in displaying different roles in his transcendental pastimes."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that despite not needing to, Krishna voluntarily accepts responsibilities in his pastimes, giving the example of Krishna as a cowherd boy in Vrindavan, diligently caring for 108 groups of cows.

No. Still, he accepts voluntary responsibilities in displaying different roles in his transcendental pastimes. See, Krishna has nothing to do but doesn't mean he is inactive. He is active in performing his lila, his transcendental pastimes, divya lila. And those transcendental pastimes are always performed in his association with his pure devotees, and he accepts different roles in those pastimes. Prabhupada gives an example. As a boy in Vrindavan, he was playing the part of a cowboy, Gopalam. As a son of Nanda Maharaj, he discharged responsibility perfectly. He would dutifully go cowherding in the forest, take the cows for grazing, and he would go with his friends and he would bring back the cows after they finished grazing in the evening before sunset. So he would supervise the milking of the cows and he would ensure that the cows have all properly returned. He would count the groups of cows. There were 108 groups of cows Krishna was taking care of. It's very interesting, this number 108. We chant 108 times the Hare Krishna mantra in one mala, one round we say. The beads which we use for chanting japa, counting and chanting japa, there are 108 beads. So where is this number 108 coming from? One of the reasons this 108 number is fixed is because Krishna in his transcendental pastime of cowherding in Vrindavan when he appeared 5000 years back, he used to take 108 groups of cows for cowherding after he grew up. And when Krishna returns with those cows, he will count the number of groups that have come back when each group he calls and they come near Krishna and Krishna directs them to enter their particular, what do you say, cow shelter, cow pen, the particular designated area where the cows will stay. So he would count the groups, 108 groups he used to take and ensure that all the groups of cows have come back. It was a huge number. So he would count. And for that Krishna had a string of 108 pearls, a mala made of 108 pearls and he would count on them how many have come back. So when all the 108 have been counted, then yes, all the cows have come back. So he would do, my point is that he would do his duty responsibly as a son of Nanda Maharaj, who was a cowherd, a king of the cowherds.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Krishna's role as a cowherd with his role as a Kshatriya prince and king in Dwaraka, highlighting his martial skills and strong leadership, setting up the discussion for the next session.

Similarly, when he was playing the part of a Kshatriya as a son of Maharaj Vasudeva, he displayed all the skills of a martially spirited Kshatriya. The Kshatriya is the son of Vasudeva and when he grew up and he went back to Mathura from Vrindavan and later on he went to Dwaraka. He was ruling as the king. He was a very strong and powerful ruler in Dwaraka, and he displayed the skill of a martially spirited Kshatriya. So this point we will discuss in the next session in detail, but Prabhupada has explained the purpose. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** This segment focuses on the unique and unparalleled beauty of Lord Krishna, highlighting the Srivatsa mark on his chest and his ability to attract even Radharani and Madana.

5 to 30 of the 16th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is part number 6. We are discussing the various qualities of the Supreme Lord, the transcendental qualities. Now, Srila Prabhupada explains the quality of the Lord's beauty. As far as the beauty of the Lord is concerned, he has some special features that distinguish him from all other living beings. Krishna, when he appears in his original form, human-like form, Manushin Tanumashrit, it's not a human form, it's not a material form. It looks like a material form of the human being. So he still has some special features by which you can recognize him as completely different from all the other humans. So he has some special features, just like Krishna has got a mark on his chest called Srivatsa. Srivatsa. It's the hoof print of a calf. Srivatsa. Vatsa means calf. On the chest, which is the residing place of Sri, Lakshmi. Lakshmi is residing on the bosom of the Lord, the chest of the Lord. So he's also called Srinivasa. The Lord, Srivatsa is the one who, that is the place where Srinivasa resides on his chest. So that place where Lakshmi resides, that place there is one mark called Srivatsa. So that Srivatsa is only there on the chest of the Lord. Only the Lord has that marking. Nobody else can have that marking. So like this he has got some special features that distinguish him from everyone else. Over and above those special features which distinguish him from all other living beings, he has some special attractive beautiful features regarding his beauty, by which he attracts the mind of even Radharani, who is the supermost beautiful creation of the Lord. Radharani is very, very, very, very, very, very beautiful, most beautiful among everyone else other than the Lord. So she is most beautiful. And Krishna, he is so beautiful, he attracts even Radharani. So how much more beautiful Krishna should be to attract even Radharani, who is the most beautiful creation of the Lord. Therefore, he is known as Madana Mohana, one who attracts the mind of even Cupid, Madana. Madana is the most beautiful personality in this universe among the created beings of the material world. So Krishna attracts even Madana, Madana Mohana, he captivates the mind of Madana. So he is millions and billions of times more beautiful than Madana, that is described in the Brahma Samhita. So Krishna attracts even Madana, Madana Mohana, he is known as Madana Mohana.

### Transcendental qualities, Mystic powers, Yogeshwara, Jiva Goswami

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is the one who is the master of all mystic powers Yogeshwara"
**Summary:** This segment discusses how Jiva Goswami ascertained Krishna as the Supreme Lord based on his transcendental qualities and unlimited mystic powers, emphasizing Krishna's position as Yogeshwara.

Now, Srila Jiva Goswami Prabhu, who is one of the previous Acharyas, he has scrutinizingly analyzed other transcendental qualities of the human being. He has studied the qualities of the Lord, and he says affirmatively that Lord Sri Krishna is the absolute supreme personality of God, Param Brahman. How do we ascertain somebody is God? Because he looks like another created being, but he is not. But how do we ascertain he is God? By his qualities. So, his analyzed the transcendental qualities displayed by the Lord when he incarnates, Srila Jiva Goswami Prabhu has concluded that the Lord is, Krishna is the Supreme Lord, absolute supreme personality of God. So, Srila Jiva Goswami explains that omnipotent by his inconceivable energies. Omnipotent means he has got all kinds of powers, because he has so many energies. And he is the Yogeshwara or the supreme master of all mystic powers. There are so many mystic powers. But a yogi who is practicing Ashtanga Yoga can have only Ashta Siddhi, eight major mystic powers, eight minor mystic powers, and four auxiliary mystic powers. Elsewhere, Prabhupada explains. Totally, different types of mystic powers are twenty: eight major, eight minor, and four subsidiary. So, Krishna has unlimited mystic powers. So, nobody else can have unlimited mystic powers. They can have some limited mystic powers, eight at the most, or some rare cases, ten. But Krishna has unlimited mystic powers. Not only that, he is the one who bestows mystic power on somebody who desires to have it after practicing yoga. Devotees never want any mystic powers. Devotees don't want any favor from the Lord. They don't desire for it, they don't aspire for it, they never want it. So that is Lord's greatness. So he is the one, Krishna is the one who is the master of all mystic powers, Yogeshwara in the

**Key Quote:** "When Krishna shines the divine knowledge, transcendental knowledge within our heart, he says this in the Bhagavad Gita."
**Summary:** This segment explains that Krishna's eternal form is spiritual, a combination of eternity, bliss, and knowledge, and that He dispels the darkness of ignorance through transcendental knowledge.

Bhagavad-gita it is said in the 18th chapter last words yatra Yogeshwara Krishna yatra partho dhanur dharah. Krishna is addressed as Yogeshwara by Sanjaya, Yogeshwara Krishna. So Krishna is the master of all mystic powers, unlimited powers. So because he is the Yogeshwara, Ashwada Prabhupada says his eternal form is spiritual, a combination of eternity, bliss, and knowledge. Our form is spiritual, a combination of eternity, bliss, and knowledge. Our form, our material form, however a person may be learned, however intelligent he may be, but our form is basically a form of ignorance. Material form is filled with ignorance, and this ignorance, even if we try to learn whole life, this ignorance cannot be eradicated by that acquisition of material knowledge. Material knowledge does not counteract the ignorance due to our accepting a material body. It's only by the supreme Lord's blessing that we get his mercy to eradicate the ignorance within our heart. When Krishna shines the divine knowledge, transcendental knowledge within our heart, he says this in the Bhagavad Gita: tesham eva anukampartham aham ajnanajam tamaha nashayami atmabhavastho jnana deepena bhāsvat. So, Krishna dispels the darkness of ignorance in every living entity who so desires. Krishna only will dispel the darkness by giving them the enlightenment in transcendental knowledge. So, I will continue...

**Key Quote:** "His beauty is... He looks ever fresh, and newer and newer beauties are every moment being displayed by him this is called dynamic quality of beauty dynamic ever increasing ever fresh beauty Krishna displays"
**Summary:** This segment describes Krishna's dynamic and unfathomable knowledge and ever-fresh beauty, emphasizing that devotees can never equal the Lord's qualities but possess enough to be blissful.

to explain the nature of this knowledge that Krishna possesses. Krishna's knowledge is not static. It is of dynamic nature. The knowledge of the Lord is unfathomable. Nobody can estimate how much knowledge the Lord has got. And it is dynamic means according to the situation, time, place, circumstances, he can actually apply knowledge suitably in different situations. His knowledge is dynamic. Dynamic knowledge. Now, regarding his beauty. Shri Lasuta Goswami says in the Bhagavatam that even though Krishna was observed by the citizens of Dwarka every day, they were always increasingly anxious to see him again and again. Shri Lasuta Goswami says... So, what is the nature of his beauty? His beauty is... He looks ever fresh, and newer and newer beauties are every moment being displayed by him. This is called dynamic quality of beauty, dynamic, ever increasing, ever fresh beauty Krishna displays. So the residents of Dwaraka every day they would want to see Krishna's beauty and to be attracted more and more and more, increased attraction, increased appreciation of Krishna's beauty, and they become, there's no saturation also. So this saturation in transcendental qualities of the Lord, there's no saturation. So even though those devotees who appreciate the Lord's beauty every day, you, but they cannot attain by any amount of work the equality with the Lord in his beauty, not possible. That's not possible. So none of the qualities, even though the living it is put possessed in small quantity the qualities of the Lord, they can never equal him or excel you in those qualities by their efforts, different endeavors, that's never possible. So the Lord is always the Lord, eternally is the Lord, unlimited qualities, unlimited number of qualities, and unlimited extent, unlimited quantity of those each quality, and the living entities have some of the qualities which the Lord has, and they possess in very, very, very, very, very insignificant quantity, but that insignificant quantity of whatever good qualities we have is sufficient, more than sufficient for us to be happy, to be blissful, to be situated always in transcendent etc. It's enough. We don't have to strive for more qualities or greater quantity of those qualities. We don't have to strive for any of those qualities.

**Key Quote:** "It appears from this verse that interplanetary travel by the denizens of higher planets is easy."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, focusing on the ease of interplanetary travel for demigods and their presence at sacrifices performed by influential kings.

And at these sacrifices, even the common man could see demigods. So in the purport, Shri La Prabhupada says, "It appears from this verse that interplanetary travel by the denizens of higher planets is easy. We may have difficulty, or rather, we definitely do have difficulty in travelling to other planets. But for the inhabitants of the upper planets to come to this earth planet, there is no difficulty." Further, Shri La Prabhupada says, "In many statements in Bhagavatam, we have observed that the demigods from heaven used to visit this earth to attend sacrifices performed by influential kings and emperors. Herein also we find that during the time of the horse sacrifice ceremony of Maharaj Parikshit, the demigods from other planets were visible even to the common man."

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the nature of demigods, their subtle bodies, and the exceptional circumstances under which they appear on Earth, emphasizing the respect accorded to pure devotees.

Due to the sacrificial ceremony. You should remember the devatas, they live in upper planets. They don't have gross bodies like we have, we human beings have on the earth. They have subtle bodies. And in their subtle body, they are not visible even if they come to the earth planet. First of all, they don't come to the earth planet very often. There is no reason to come here. Only under exceptional situations or circumstances like being invited by a first class devotee, Mahabhagavata Parikshit Maharaj, he invites the devatas to come for the sacrifice. Then they accept the invitation very graciously because of the stature of Parikshit Maharaj. A pure devotee, a first class devotee, is respected and honored everywhere in the whole universe by all the great sages, by all great devatas, by all great jnanis, yogis, tapasvis, everyone, by realized souls,

**Summary:** The speaker explains that demigods and Krishna are not generally visible to common people but can become visible by their own grace, similar to Krishna's avataras.

everyone honors and respects a pure devotee of Krishna. That is the position of the pure devotee. So please try to understand what is being described here, that common men could see devatas in the sacrifice that was organized by Parikshit Maharaj. So Srila Prabhupada explains that demigods are not generally visible to common men even when they come to this earth. As Lord Krishna is not visible to common men, but as the Lord, Supreme Lord Krishna, by His causeless mercy, descends to be visible to the common man, Krishna comes down from His spiritual abode, personal abode, that's called avatara, to descend, to come down, and becomes visible. Similarly, the demigods also become visible to the common man by their own grace. If they decide to be visible, they can be visible. If they decide not to be visible, they'll not be visible.

**Key Quote:** "Because Krishna's form or body is completely spiritual. It's not material like our body."
**Summary:** The speaker reinforces the idea that Krishna and demigods have spiritual bodies and are visible only by their own will, highlighting Maharaj Parikshit's influence in making the demigods visible.

Just like Krishna. He sits in our heart. But unless He gives darshan, we cannot see Him. Or even when Krishna was present on the earth, 5000 years back, only if He decided to become visible for the common man, He would be visible. Otherwise they could not see Him, because Krishna's form or body is completely spiritual. It's not material like our body. And the devatas, they don't have a gross body. So therefore, neither the devatas nor Krishna are visible to ordinary people, to common people's sight on this earth. If they decide to become visible, they can be seen by common people. All those celestial beings, means those living in heavenly planets, are not visible to naked eyes of the inhabitants of this earth. It was due to the influence of Maharaj Pariksit

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the lavish spending by kings during sacrifices, emphasizing the importance of pleasing the devatas, sages, and brahmanas, and comparing the king's charity to a cloud distributing rain.

that the demigods also agreed to be visible. The kings used to spend lavishly during such sacrifices as a cloud distributes rains. So this is very significant. The kings used to organize such sacrifices for the welfare of the entire citizens. Now, in such sacrifices, it was an important aspect of pleasing the devatas, the sages, the brahmanas, learned brahmanas, who direct the king how to perform the sacrifice. Their satisfaction is very, very important to get the full benefit of the sacrifice, to derive the benefit. So one of the aspects of the king performing sacrifice successfully is that the king will spend very, very liberally and the description given here by Srila Prabhupada is just like a cloud distributes rains, similarly the kings would spend during such sacrifices to give in charity

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the king's charity during sacrifices is a redistribution of taxes for the citizens' benefit, leading to prosperity through the successful performance of the sacrifice.

to all the invitees. Srila Prabhupada explains about cloud distributing rain. A cloud is nothing but another form of water. Or in other words, the waters of the earth transform into clouds. What is a cloud? After all, water evaporated by the sun forms the cloud, which has got water in the form of water vapor. Similarly, and those water vapor when they condense, then the clouds pour down rain. That's the system, arrangement of the Supreme Lord in this material world. Similarly, the charity made by the kings in such sacrifices are but another form of the taxes collected from the citizens. Where will the king spend from? From the taxes he collects from the citizens. And what will he spend for? He will spend for giving back the benefit to the citizens. How will the citizens benefit if the king spends for a sacrifice? The result of the sacrifice is all prosperity for the citizens. All types of prosperity. So the citizens benefit by the king performing sacrifices properly.

**Key Quote:** "Satisfied citizens will never organize agitation against the king."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the liberal distribution of charity during sacrifices, leading to citizen satisfaction and stability in the monarchical state, emphasizing the king's responsibility for the citizens' welfare and spiritual guidance.

And the king gives sufficient charity to the deserving, qualified brahmanas, sages, like that. But, as the rains fall down very lavishly and appear to be more than necessary, the charity made by such kings also seems to be more than what the citizens need. So, they would distribute liberally to everyone present in the sacrifice. Not only to the brahmanas, not only to the sages, but to everyone. Now, this is done according to the direction of the shastra. This is not one's whimsical idea to distribute liberally to everyone. No. It is exactly according to shastra. Now, in the sacrifice, the citizens will be satisfied completely. So, Srila Prabhupada says, "Satisfied citizens will never organize agitation against the king." And thus, there was no need in changing the monarchical state. The kings would rule keeping all the citizens satisfied by providing all the necessities, by doing proper sacrifices, by guiding the citizens properly towards the ultimate goal of life. In so many ways,

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the necessity of a spiritual master for guidance, even for advanced devotees like Maharaj Parikshit, highlighting that spiritual progress requires guidance from the right authority.

the kings were very responsible. Srila Prabhupada says further, even for a king like Maharaj Pariksit, there was need of a spiritual master for guidance. Of course, Pariksit was trained and he was well-versed in the principles of bhakti. He himself was a first-class devotee. But that does not mean he does not require guidance. He still requires a spiritual master for guidance. Without such guidance, one cannot make progress in spiritual life. Spiritual life means to progress by getting guidance from the right person, from the right authority, from the right source. Whimsically, we cannot select somebody we like. Or as people say, "I believe or I think such and such a person is very good." No. It should not be based on what we like or what we whimsically choose or what we think is correct. No. It has to be guided by, again,

**Key Quote:** "to effect the perfection of human life there is cooperation between men and demigods sages, denizens of Pitraloka, devotees of the Lord"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Srila Prabhupada's purport on the verse, emphasizing the importance of cooperation between different personalities and the scientific system of Varna and Ashrama for achieving perfection in human life.

What about their condition, their position? So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says something like this. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says something about the cooperation that is required between different personalities forever, even our basic existence. Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "To effect the perfection of human life, there is cooperation between men and demigods, sages, denizens of Pitraloka, devotees of the Lord and sages, denizens of Pitraloka, devotees of the Lord and the sages and presentee are like a fire and a tool." So, when you are in magor and puja and you can become one with each other, muchísimas gracias, the scientific system of Varna and ashrama of life. What is Varna ashrama? Varna means the social divisions according to the occupation. So the brahmanas work in one way, they are intellectuals, then the sages, the denizens of Pitraloka, all of them, they have to cooperate for perfection of human life because they are all different controllers and have different types of control exercised over the human beings on the earth. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport further, "The distinction between human life and animal life therefore begins with the scientific system of Varna and Ashrama guided by the experience of the sages in relation with the demigods gradually rising to the summit of reestablishment our eternal relation with the supreme absolute truth, the personality of Godhead."

So the scriptures describe this that there are four activities which are common for human beings and animals: the demands of the body, ahara nidra bhaya maithunam, the demands of the body, the necessity of food, necessity of sleep or rest in the afternoon and at night also, and the necessity of the body in terms of defense, protecting oneself, and mating, the necessity of sex life for procreation. So these four are common activities between animals and human beings, but there is a fifth activity and that's called dharma, and without dharma a human being is on the level of animals, living a life on the level of animals: dharma viheen apadabha, dharma viheen apadabha, dharma viheen apadabha.

**Key Quote:** "God made Varna ashrama dharma which is strictly meant for developing animal consciousness into human consciousness and human consciousness into godly consciousness levels of advancement for human beings"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the purpose of Varna and Ashrama Dharma, explaining how it facilitates the transformation from animal consciousness to human consciousness and ultimately to godly consciousness.

This is the statement of the Shastra. So therefore, human life means there has to be the scientific system of Varna and ashrama guided by the experience of the sages in relation with the devatas gradually rising to the perfection of human life when one is able to re-establish one's Lord's lost connection with Krishna. So when God made Varna ashrama Dharma, Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, chaturvaranyam maya-srishtam guna-karma-vibhagasaham. So this God made Varna ashrama dharma which is strictly meant for developing animal consciousness into human consciousness. You can see that in the Bhagavad Gita there is a verse in the Bhagavad Gita that says, So this God made Varna ashrama Dharma which is strictly meant for developing animal consciousness into human consciousness and human consciousness into godly consciousness levels of advancement for human beings from animal consciousness to human consciousness by following the Varna ashrama Dharma and from human conscious to godly consciousness by following the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita by following the teachings of the bhagavatam like that and in this way when one makes actual factual spiritual advancement then one can very easily understand who am I who is God what is my relationship etc so this arrangement of the Bhagavad Gita which is strictly meant for developing animal consciousness into human consciousness by following the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita by following the teachings of the bhagavatam like that.

**Key Quote:** "in Kali Yuga the first attack of the venomous snake strikes against God made varnashrama this God made varnashrama is almost destroyed by the influence of the Kali Yuga"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the challenges posed by Kali Yuga to the proper understanding and implementation of Varna and Ashrama Dharma, highlighting the distortion of the system and the misinterpretation of scriptures.

The ultimate of the supreme Lord for a human society of Varna ashrama Dharma is broken by advancement of foolishness. That means people don't properly understand the purpose of this varnashrama, they criticize, they give trouble, they challenge the authority, etc. So such disturbance in the human society in the name of following some varnashrama but actually not in proper spirit, the system of progressive life becomes at once disturbed. So Prabhupada says in Kali Yuga the first attack of the venomous snake strikes against God made varnashrama. This God made varnashrama is almost destroyed by the influence of the Kali Yuga and a person properly qualified as a Brahmana is treated like a shudra in Kali Yuga and a shudra by qualification such a person is passing off as a Brahmana and what is the basis? Oh, I was born in a Brahmana family or somebody else is not born in a Brahmana family. So these are all not the proper understanding of the Shastra. So proper understanding of the Shastra means by birth there is no consideration of somebody being belonging to Brahmana Kshatriya Vaishal Shudra Varanasa.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the qualities of a true Brahmana and laments the corrupting influence of Kali Yuga, which leads to a decline in these qualities and a lack of interest in transcendence.

So this has to be understood carefully that birth is not the criterion, though Srila Prabhupada says that if somebody is born in a good Brahmana family they have very good opportunity to get trained up as a Brahmana right from the early stages of your life, but they are not the criteria for their birth. So this has to be understood carefully that birth is not the criterion, though Shri their life but even if we don't consider this consideration of birth or consideration of occupational duties, we don't consider that, but simply a person develops control of the mind, control of the senses, and cultivates tolerance, simplicity, cleanliness, knowledge, truthfulness, devotion, and faith in the Supreme, then one becomes a really qualified Brahmana. And in the present age, the influence of Kali is such that people neglect the knowledge of the Supreme to follow the proper culture and they become victim of the age of Kali, they become victim of the age of Kali. So due to this age of Kali, the influence of the age, everything is topsy-turvy, especially as regards varnashrama, it's topsy-turvy. We don't have qualified Brahmanas, we don't have qualified Kshatriyas, we don't have very much qualified Vaishyas, some Vaishyas are there but not very qualified, and the influence of the Kali also makes people corrupt, they are not straightforward, they are not

In this session, we will be discussing the 32nd and 33rd verses of the 16th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. These two verses are given together. I shall read them first, the two verses, and then we will hear the translation of the two verses given together. And then we will discuss from the purport. ब्रह्माद यो बहुतितं यद अपांग मोक्षा कामास्तपस समचरन भगवत प्रपन्ना साश्री स्ववासं अरविन्द वनं विहाया यद पाद सवभगं अलं भजतेनु रक्ता This was the 32nd verse. And the 33rd verse. तस्याहं अब्ज कुलिष अंकुष केतु केतै श्रीमत पदैर भगवत समलंक्रतां गी त्रीन अत्यरोच उपलभ्य ततो विभूतिम लोकान समाम व्यस्रजत उत्स्मयतीम तदन्ते These two verses, the meaning is given together by Srila Prabhupāda, the translation of these two verses. लक्ष्मीजी दे गौड़ेस अफ फोर्चून विभूतिम ततो विभूतिम लोकान समाम व्यस्रजत उत्स्मयतीम तदन्ते This glance of grace was sought by demigods like Brahma and for whom they surrendered many a day unto the personality of Godhead. That Lakshmiji gave up her own abode in the forest of lotus flowers and engaged herself in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord. And now Mother Earth is telling, I was endowed with specific... specific powers to supersede the fortune of all the three planetary systems by being decorated with the impressions of the flag, thunderbolt, elephant-driving rod, and lotus flower, which are the signs of the lotus feet of the Lord. But at the end, when I felt I was so fortunate, the Lord left me.

### grace of the Lord, material opulence, dependence on nature, sinful activities

**Key Quote:** "The beauty and opulence of the world can be enhanced by the grace of the Lord and not by any man-made planning."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing that the earth's opulence comes from the Lord's grace, not human endeavors, and that our dependence on nature is affected by our piety or sinfulness.

Now in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains something very valuable, very important for all of us to understand. He says, "The beauty and opulence of the world can be enhanced by the grace of the Lord and not by any man-made planning." We think that by our own efforts at utilizing the resources of nature and controlling material nature in such a way that... he is most favorable for our enjoyment here. We forget the actual control of the Supreme Lord over material nature and over us and over everything else that we forget. So when there is the mercy or grace of the Lord, there is no scarcity of anything for the whole... material existence and the beauty and opulence of the world can be enhanced significantly by getting the mercy of the Lord, his merciful glance. When the Lord Sri Krishna was present on this earth, the impressions of the special signs of his lotus feet were stamped on the dust. Whenever Krishna used to walk, so he would leave behind the impression of his feet. And especially in Vrindavan, the other inhabitants of Vrindavan were very conscious of Krishna's footprints, that when they are walking in Vrindavan, if there is a footprint of Krishna which is recognized by the symbols of a flag, thunderbolt, elephant-driving rod, or the lotus flower, then they will not disturb that impression. They will walk away from that. So the earth was beautified by these impressions. And as a result of this, what happened? The whole earth was made as perfect as possible. The earth became a wonderful place. The earth became a wonderful place for all its inhabitants. It is described here, in other words, the rivers, the seas, the forests, the hills, and the mines which are the supply agents for the necessities of men and animals, were fully discharging their respective duties. So this is very, very important. We depend on the supplies of nature for our success, for our subsistence, and for our civilization to flourish. But that supply is sometimes curtailed if we become sinful. And if we are pious, that supply is in abundance. So we need not have industrial enterprises to exploit this material nature and try to get more and more and more and more and more of those resources.

**Key Quote:** "One should ask that the grace of the Lord always be present on earth, so that we may be favored by His causeless mercy, and be happy, having all the necessities of life, for living comfortably and enjoying life without any scarcity."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how to maintain the Lord's presence on Earth through devotional service, particularly by chanting the Hare Krishna mantra, which is identical to the Lord.

Therefore, Prabhupada says, "One should ask that the grace of the Lord always be present on earth, so that we may be favored by His causeless mercy, and be happy, having all the necessities of life, for living comfortably and enjoying life without any scarcity." So, then one may ask, how can we detain the Supreme Lord on this earth after His mission is fulfilled and He has left this earth, for going to His own abode? When He was present, because of the footprints of the Lord, everything was in abundance, all supplies were in abundance. That's described already in a previous chapter. So, Srila Prabhupada says that there is no need to detain the Supreme Lord in this material world. Why? Because, the Lord is actually omnipresent. He is always present everywhere. But, if we want Him, He can be present in a way that we can perceive His presence. We can perceive His presence by the way He is approached by us. If we are attached to His devotional service by hearing, chanting, remembering, etc., then He can always be present with us in the form of transcendental sound. Transcendental sound. That transcendental sound is specifically taught by Caitanya Mahaprabhu as Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare, that is what is taught by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, so very easy way of having the presence of the Lord in this world by which we can get immense amount of benefits from the Lord and even without our asking the Lord will...

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the importance of chanting the Hare Krishna mantra offenselessly, emphasizing the need to avoid sinful activities to achieve purification and experience the Lord's presence.

Krishna Krishna mantra, we can always be connected with him, simply vibrate the tongue Hare Krishna. We are connected with him through his sound because the holy name of the Lord in the form of this Hare Krishna mantra and the Lord himself, the supreme personality, transcendental personality, they are identical. So, and this presence of the Lord in the form of the transcendental sound can be experienced by offenseless chanting. There are considerations of offenses in chanting Hare Krishna. Of course, in the beginning, we are just told to chant Hare Krishna. Simply vibrate your tongue and produce a sound and try to hear that sound. But as we advance in Krishna consciousness, we learn that chanting is fully effective if we are able to chant without any offenses. What does it mean? That means there are some activities we have to refrain from in order to please the Lord by our chanting. That means chanting Hare Krishna. Just like one of the offenses to be considered while chanting Hare Krishna in the form of japa is to commit sinful activities on the strength of chanting the holy name because by chanting we become purified. It doesn't mean we can go on committing sinful activities and go on chanting and purifying ourselves. It doesn't work like that. Similarly, all the other offenses are to be considered.

**Key Quote:** "So Krishna's appearance, one of the reasons for his appearance is to reduce the burden of the Earth which is overburdened by demoniac persons posing as Kshatriyas."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verses to be discussed (SB 1.16.34-36) and begins explaining verse 34, focusing on the Earth being burdened by atheistic kings and the Lord's incarnation to relieve this burden.

In this session we are discussing verses 3.34, 3.35, and 3.36. The last three verses are from verses 3.34, 3.35, and 3.36, the last three verses of this chapter, the 16th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavata. So these verses are all given separately, one verse at a time. The 34th verse: Yovai Mamatibharam Asura Vamsa Raghmyam Akshauhini Shatam Apanudad Atmatantraha Tvam Dustham Oonapadam Atmani Paurushena Sampadayan Yadushu Ramyam Abhibhrad Angam. The meaning of this 34th verse: Mother Earth is addressing the personality of religious principles, Dharma. Dharani is addressing Dharma. O Personality of Religion! I was greatly overburdened, burdened by the undue military phalanxes arranged by Atheistic Kings. And I was relieved by the grace of the Personality of Godhead. By the grace of the Supreme Lord, all those military phalanxes were destroyed of the Atheistic Kings. They were destroyed. Similarly, you are also in a distressed condition, weakened in your standing strength, and thus he also incarnated by his internal energy in the family of the Yadus to relieve you.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the qualities of these 'demoniac' leaders, their lack of Kshatriya qualities, and how they create suffering for ordinary people, necessitating the Lord's intervention.

So Krishna's appearance, one of the reasons for his appearance is to reduce the burden of the Earth which is overburdened by demoniac persons posing as Kshatriyas. They don't have Kshatriya qualities. To properly rule this Earth planet, or to rule some provinces or states, they don't have the Kshatriya qualities. So they simply pose as if they are independently able to do the administration without any consideration of any principles, whimsically. They take charge or control of the whole state or province or country or whatever, and they create havoc in the lives of ordinary people. So, to curtail these people's miscreant activities, the Lord incarnated as Krishna, and he incarnated by his internal energy.

**Key Quote:** "the Asuras want to enjoy life of sense gratification even at the cost of others happiness they don't care for others happiness and they also don't hesitate to give trouble to others who want to live a pious life"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the Lord's appearance through internal energy with ordinary births and quotes Srila Prabhupada on the nature of Asuras, their desire for sense gratification, and their tendency to create war.

That means his appearance is not like our appearance which is subject to so many material... Our own spiritual identity as spirit soul, we forget that, whereas internal energy means there is full enlightenment, full knowledge, full consciousness, so the two are totally different. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The Asuras want to enjoy life of sense gratification even at the cost of others' happiness." They don't care for others' happiness, and they also don't hesitate to give trouble to others who want to live a pious life. The Asuras give trouble to such people, and they want to enjoy independently. They don't care for others. And Prabhupada says further, "In order to fulfill this ambition, the Asuras, especially atheistic kings or state executive heads, try to equip themselves with all kinds of deadly weapons to bring about a war in a peaceful society unnecessarily." Some demoniac kings, they want to declare war and somehow capture power, defeat or kill some righteous kings and...

**Summary:** The speaker continues discussing the Asuras' tendency to create war and the suffering it causes, emphasizing Mother Earth's compassion and the Lord's duty to protect devotees and vanquish demons.

Capture power. So these atheistic kings, they equipped themselves with so many deadly weapons. So such people simply create a condition or situation where there will be war unnecessarily. In a peaceful society there is no need for war, but they will create a situation that there has to be war. And Mother Earth, because she considers all the living entities living in this earth planet as her own children, so she feels for their suffering when the Kings oppress the people or the unwanted asuras. They have to be vanquished by the Supreme Lord only. Nobody else can actually control them or curtail them or restrict their nefarious activities. Even the demigods, the rishis, all the different inhabitants of the upper planets, or even the powerful persons on this earth or in the lower planets, they cannot restrict these asuras. So they, and the asuras, unnecessarily give trouble to the devotees unless they give trouble. So therefore, there is an absolute necessity of the Supreme Lord's appearance, and he does his duty or his seva regardless of whether others are doing or not doing. So he appears also for delivering all...

**Summary:** The speaker transitions to verse 35, focusing on the pain of separation from the Lord and the joy Mother Earth felt from the touch of His lotus feet.

The others, and he simultaneously protects the devotees and kills the demons. In the 35th verse it is said, the meaning of this 35th verse is that, "Who therefore can tolerate the pangs of separation from that Supreme Personality of Godhead? He could conquer the gravity and passionate wrath of his sweethearts like Satyabhama by his sweet smile of love, pleasing glance, and hearty appeals." Krishna is very, very, very kind and benevolent towards his devotees. So for those who render loving service to him, Krishna is also reciprocating with such devotees, and his reciprocation is very, very, very, very attractive. Further it is said, "When he traversed my surface, that is the earth surface, I would be immersed in the dust of his lotus feet, and thus would be sumptuously covered with grass, which appeared like hair standing on me out of pleasure." Lord was constantly in touch with the surface of this earth planet. So Mother Earth felt the touch of the Lord's lotus feet on her body.

**Key Quote:** "So no chance of separation for Mother Earth from the contact with the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord Krishna when he was present on the earth."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the constant contact between the Lord's lotus feet and the Earth, contrasting it with the occasional separation felt by the Lord's queens.

And she was always very much happy and ecstatic with such contact. So it appeared like the grass that was growing whenever the Lord walked on the surface of the earth. Those grass appeared like hair standing on the body of the earth planet due to excessive joy, due to the contact of the Lord's lotus feet with the Mother, with the earth planet. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "There were chances of separation between the Lord and his thousands of queens because of the Lord's being absent from home." So in the daytime the Lord would go to the assembly house in Dwarka, and in the evening He would return and spend time with His family members in His palaces. So when he would go away, they would feel the Lord's absence from their home. Thousands of queens, sixteen thousand one hundred and eight queens. But as far as this connection with the earth was concerned, it is different. What is the difference? The Lord would traverse the earth with his lotus feet, and therefore there was no chance of separation. He would always travel on the earth surface. So no chance of separation for Mother Earth from the contact with the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord Krishna when he was present on the earth.

### separation, Pariksit, Kali, dharma

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "While the earth and the personality of religion were thus engaged in conversation, the saintly king Pariksit reached the shore of the Saraswati river which flowed towards the east."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the intense feeling of separation Mother Earth experienced when the Lord departed and introduces verse 36, describing King Pariksit's arrival at the scene where Kali was mistreating a cow and bull, setting the stage for the next chapter.

So therefore, when the Lord left this earth planet and went back to his personal abode in the spiritual world, Mother Earth's feelings of separation were therefore very, very, very acute, very intense. She felt the separation so much, because for 125 years the Lord was there constantly. His lotus feet was in touch with the surface of the earth. So she felt the most, the separation from the Lord after he left for his personal abode. The 36th verse, the last verse: tayor evam kathayato prithvi dharmayostada parikshin nama rajarshi praptaprachim sarasvatim. The meaning of this last verse: "While the earth and the personality of religion were thus engaged in conversation, the saintly king Pariksit reached the shore of the Saraswati river which flowed towards the east." So the description is continuing that Pariksit has reached that spot where the personality of Kali was trying to beat a cow and a bull. So Pariksit has reached there. And then now there will be, the personality of Dharma and the personality of Mother Earth were conversing with each other, and Pariksit reached there at that time. Now Pariksit is going to enquire and is going to take action, suitable action against the personality of Kali. We will hear that in the next chapter.

**Summary:** This segment introduces the context of the lecture, focusing on Pariksit Maharaj's encounter with Kali Yuga and its connection to the Srimad Bhagavatam.

In this session, we will be discussing from the fourth verse of the sixteenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This chapter relates how Pariksit received the age of Kali, the beginning of the age of Kali. The fourth verse is as follows, निजग्राह ओजसा वीरह कलिम् दिग्विजये क्वचित् नृपलिंगधरं शूद्रं नन्तं गोमिथुनं पदाः The meaning of this verse is, once when Maharaj Pariksit was on his way to conquer the world, he saw the master of Kali Yuga, who is lower than a Shudra, disguised as a king and hurting the legs of a cow and bull. The king at once caught hold of him to deal sufficient punishment. So, the description continues by Suta Goswami to the sage Naimisharanya. The topics leading to Pariksit Maharaj meeting Shukadeva Goswami and consequently Shukadeva Goswami spoke the Bhagavatam to Pariksit.

**Summary:** This segment describes Pariksit Maharaj's extraordinary qualities and his encounter with Kali Yuga, emphasizing the latter's low character and disguised appearance.

So, that is the reason why the descriptions are being given about Pariksit and earlier about Shukadeva Goswami also the description was given. So, Maharaj Pariksit is a Mahabhagavata, his birth is extraordinary, his activities are extraordinary and his passing away from this world is also extraordinary. Everything about him is very special. So, to hear about Pariksit's life is in itself auspicious and it leads to awakening our own devotional service within our own heart. Therefore, that is included in the Bhagavatam. So, the description here is, when Pariksit Maharaj was on his way to conquer the world, he saw the master of Kali Yuga, disguised as a king and hurting the legs of a cow and bull. The divine powers carried on his way to conquer the world. After he took charge, he has to establish himself as the worthy emperor descendant of the Pandavas, competent to rule the people. So, he was on a world tour as it is understood nowadays. He saw the master of Kaliyuga, kalipurusha, a killing through no ability to do anything. Yes, so we mean to say, a gunner of this world, who does not know DNS permission, can't climb to ensure that a slave with a pole and salute the boss can kill himself. So, he is a friend of 인들사 stressors. Pull out a book of callig между 라는華 Mits and garments him his place of worship.

And this Kalipurusha's characteristic is that he is very, very low in his character, lower than a Shudra. And he is disguising himself as a king, Nripalingadhara. He is dressed as a Kshatriya, externally, as a king. But his activities are low class. What was he doing? He was hurting the legs of a cow and bull. And Pariksit could not tolerate this. Immediately, Pariksit caught hold of this Kalipurusha and decided to give him sufficient punishment to stop him completely

**Summary:** This segment explains the true purpose of a king's tour, which is to ensure the kingdom is aligned with the godly state and Krishna's will, not for self-aggrandizement.

from hurting a cow and bull. So, Srila Prabhupada explains, in the purport, the purpose of a king's going out to conquer the world is not for self-aggrandizement. What is the meaning of self-aggrandizement? He doesn't want to accumulate power, wealth. And it is not for self-aggrandizement. He is not interested in people glorifying him. It is explained here. Maharaj Pariksit went out to conquer the world after his ascendance to the throne. But this was not for the purpose of aggression on other states. It was not for conquering some other places. Because it is said here, he was the emperor of the world and all small states were already under his regime. So what is the purpose for his going out on a world tour? His purpose in going out was to see how things were going on in terms of the godly state. This is the real purpose of the king touring his kingdom: to see how things are going on in terms of the godly state. Srila Prabhupada further says, The king being the representative of the Lord, Supreme Lord Krishna, has to execute the will of the Lord Krishna. This is the Lord's duty. Ultimately, who is the supreme controller of all controllers? It is Krishna. And Krishna has got a certain plan: how this world should be run. There is a purpose for this creation. So whether the purpose of the creation is being met, that is what should be the concern of the king

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes Krishna's supreme control and the king's duty to enforce dharma according to Krishna's codes, highlighting the characteristics of a God-conscious ruler.

as the representative of Krishna. There is no question of self-aggrandizement. Means, the king knows very well that this entire world belongs to Krishna. Isha vasya midam sarvam. Or as the Bhagavad Gita says, Karvaloka Maheshwaram. Krishna is the supreme controller, supreme lord of all planets, all universes. And in the Isha Upanishad, the supreme lord is the supreme proprietor of every place. So, Pariksit is not under illusion that, I am the enjoyer, I am the controller, I am the master, I am powerful. He is not under such an illusion. So he wanted to see that things are going on exactly according to the codes of dharma as given by Krishna, whether people are following the code of dharma. The king has to enforce that. That's the duty of the king. Thus, as soon as Maharaj Pariksit saw that a lower class man in the dress of a king was hurting the legs of a common bull, he at once arrested and punished him. So this is the duty of the king. This is the characteristic of a God conscious king who is ruling exactly according to the plan of the supreme lord.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the importance of cow protection and brahmanical culture for spiritual progress and the advancement of human civilization.

So Srila Prabhupada says, the king cannot tolerate insults to the most important animal, the cow. Nor can he tolerate disrespect for the most important man, the brahmana. So, Krishna as the supreme lord is offered prayer: Namo brahmanya devaya go brahmana hitaya jaya. Krishna wants to see that these two personalities or these two factors are always taken care of: Go brahmana. The cows are protected and the brahmanas are protected. This is brahmanical culture which is ultimately meant for the spiritual progress of everyone in the whole world so that they utilize the human form of life for preparing themselves to go back to Godhead. Human civilization means to advance the cause of brahmanical culture. And to maintain it, cow protection is essential. Brahmanical culture is centered around the understanding that every living being is the soul not the body and Krishna is the supreme soul and we are all part and parcel of Krishna. We belong to Krishna and we are meant to return to Krishna in his personal abode in the spiritual kingdom of God. So that is the brahmanical culture. And this brahmanical culture is maintained by cow protection. What is the connection between brahmanical culture

**Summary:** This segment explains the connection between cow protection and brahmanical culture, highlighting the benefits of cow's milk for developing sattva guna and advancing spiritual understanding.

and cow protection? Prabhupada says in the next sentence in this purport, there is a miracle in milk, cow's milk. Prabhupada is talking about cow's milk, for it contains all the necessary vitamins to sustain human physiological conditions for higher achievements. A human being, especially, who is meant for God realization, has to derive the necessary nutrition by taking cow's milk. Brahmanical culture can advance only when man is educated to develop the quality of goodness, sattva guna. Brahmana means sattva guna. Brahmanical culture means sattva guna. And for this, for developing sattva guna, there is a prime necessity of food prepared with milk, fruits and grains: sattvic ahara. Sattvic ahara. If people take sattvic ahara, then they develop sattvic qualities: milk, fruits and grains. Maharaj Pariksit was astonished to see that a black shudra dressed like a ruler was mistreating a cow, the most important animal in human society. So, cow should always be protected. Specially in the Bhagavad Gita, it is said, go raksha. No other animal is mentioned as deserving special protection. Only the cow deserves special protection. Of course, the scriptures say, don't harm any other creature: Ahimsa. But, the cow is to be given special protection in addition to the injunction, Vedic injunction, don't harm any other creature. Don't harm others. There is also the injunction that the cow has to be given extra care of special protection, because it is the most important animal

**Summary:** This segment describes the characteristics of Kali Yuga, including mismanagement and the lack of cow protection due to unqualified leaders, and Pariksit Maharaj's intention to stop this decline.

in human society. So, the characteristic of this age of Kali, the present age we are living in, is being described here by Srila Prabhupada. The age of Kali means mismanagement and quarrel. And the root cause of all mismanagement and quarrel is that worthless men with the lower modes, who are situated in lower modes, who have no higher ambition in life, come to the helm of this state management. And, such people, they don't know the importance of cow protection. Instead of taking the milk of the cow, they want to drink the blood of the cow. So, this is because they are situated in lower modes, and they are very sinful, and they are very, very unqualified. So, therefore, Pariksit Maharaj wanted to stop this. And, therefore, we will see what steps he took. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "So, therefore, it's so important to discuss these topics."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the fifth verse of the sixteenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining Shaunaka Rishi's inquiry about Pariksit Maharaja's actions and emphasizing the importance of discussing topics related to Krishna.

In this session we will be discussing from the 5th and 6th verses of the 16th chapter of the 1st canto of Shri Madbhagavata. The 5th verse is as follows: Shaunaka Vacha Kasyahetor Nijagraha Kalim Digvijayendrapaha Nrudeva Chinha Drakshudra Kosav Gamya Padahanat Tatkathyata Mahabhaga Yadi Krishna Kathashrayam? So the meaning of this 5th verse is as follows: Shaunaka Rishi inquired. Suta Goswami is describing to the sages of Naimisharan. He did by Shaunaka Rishi vary hundred Shana because she is inquiring after you heard that Parachit Maharaja came across a low class person meeting a cow and a bull. So he came after wrote on all of this. Savanaka Rishi's inquiry is very pertinent here. Savanaka Rishi inquired, why did Maharaj Pariksit simply punish him since he was the lowest of the Shudras, having dressed as a king and having struck a cow on the leg? Please describe all these incidents if they relate to the topics of Lord Krishna. So, the sages of Naimisharanya, they are very eager to hear topics connected with Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "This suggests that a pious king like Maharaj Pariksit should have at once killed an offender who wanted to cheat the public by dressing like a king and at the same time daring to insult the purest of animals, a cow."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Srila Prabhupada's perspective on Pariksit Maharaja's punishment of the Shudra, highlighting the importance of protecting cows and the expected severity of justice in a pious kingdom, contrasting it with the degraded state of Kali Yuga.

So, therefore, it's so important to discuss these topics. Now, in the Purport of the Lord Krishna, there is a very important topic. What Srila Prabhupada says, Savanaka and the rishis were astonished to hear that the pious Maharaj Pariksit simply punished the culprit and did not kill him. See, the sages of Naimisharanya, they were expecting Pariksit as the Mahabhagavata, as the ideal king, ideal emperor, ideal ruler, that he will never... that he will never tolerate even a little harm done to a cow. So, why did Pariksit not kill the fellow immediately? Instead, you are describing Pariksit Maharaj just punished him, spared his life. So, they were completely astonished to hear. Why did Pariksit not kill him? So, Srila Prabhupada further says, This suggests that a pious king like Maharaj Pariksit should have at once killed an offender who wanted to cheat the public by dressing like a king and at the same time daring to insult the purest of animals, a cow. In general, a conditioned soul is inclined to cheat, but this kind of cheating, dressing like a king while actually behaving as the lowest class person, is real, real big cheating. Big cheating. His actions suggest that he is a very low class fellow, but externally he appears to be dressed like a king. So, this cheating has to be at once stopped. And how can it be stopped? Simply kill the fellow on the spot. No mercy. No relief for him. No pardon. No excuse. Not at all. So, Srila Prabhupada says, The rishis in those days, headed by Saunaka, however, could not even imagine that in the advanced days of the age of Kali, the lowest of the shudras will be elected as administrators.

**Key Quote:** "So, this cow killing is the greatest sin. Greatest sin."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the degradation of Kali Yuga, focusing on the prevalence of unqualified leaders and the sin of cow killing, emphasizing the severe karmic consequences described in the scriptures.

Then there was one person, Parikshit's time. But now there are so many of, so many people like that Kali Purusha. And they are the lowest among men in the society, but they are elected as administrators, playing the role of the king. And such people will open organized slaughterhouses for killing cows. Mass killing. They could not even imagine that Kali Yuga, as time progresses, will become so degraded. Then one person was just beating a cow and a bull. Just beating, mind you. That itself, the rishi's reaction was, He should have immediately killed. Then what is the punishment for somebody opens a slaughterhouse and mass killing of cows? Helplessly, these innocent, pure animals are being killed by the thousands, tens of thousands, lakhs, millions, especially in America. So, because the scriptures say, a cow killer is punished by Yamaraj to be sent to hell for punishment for as many years as there are hair on the body of the cow. You can imagine how severe the punishment is if he escapes punishment before he dies. After death, punishment is abating those who escape punishment before they die. Suitable punishment. So, this cow killing is the greatest sin. Greatest sin.

**Key Quote:** "Everything in this material world in relationship with the three gunas is actually impure. But when dovetailed with Krishna everything becomes purified."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that even seemingly mundane topics become valuable when connected to Krishna, emphasizing Krishna as the purifying agent and the principle of dovetailing everything with devotional service.

There can't be any greater sin than cow killing. So, further Srila Prabhupada says, Anyway, although hearing about a Shudraka who was a cheat and an insulter of a cow was not very interesting to the great rishis, they nevertheless wanted to hear about it to see if the event had any connection with Lord Krishna. See, they are interested in hearing all topics connected with Krishna. It doesn't matter what the topic is. It should be in relationship with Krishna. That's all they want to hear. So, Prabhupada says the characteristic of Bhagavatam is there are so many topics about sociology, politics, economics, cultural affairs, but all of them are in relation with Krishna. Therefore, all of them are worth hearing, because Krishna is the purifying agent in all these matters. Everything in this material world in relationship with the three gunas is actually impure, but when dovetailed with Krishna everything becomes purified. That's the principle of the Bhagavatam.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The devotees of the Lord are accustomed to licking up the honey available from the lotus feet of the Lord. What is the use of topics which simply waste one's valuable life?"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the sixth verse, explaining that devotees are only interested in topics related to Krishna and that Lord Krishna and his devotees are both on the transcendental plane above the three gunas.

The sixth verse: athavasya padam bhoja makaranda liham satam kim manyair asad alaapair ayusho yad asad vyayaha. The meaning of the sixth verse is: The devotees of the Lord are accustomed to licking up the honey available from the lotus feet of the Lord. What is the use of topics which simply waste one's valuable life? Characteristic of a devotee of Krishna is the devotee only wants to hear topics connected with Krishna. All other topics are waste of time. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport: Lord Krishna and his devotees are both on the transcendental plane above the three gunas. Therefore the topics of Lord Krishna and of his pure devotees are equally good. Prabhupada gives an example: The battle of Kurukshetra is full of politics and diplomacy, but because the topics are related with Lord Krishna, the Bhagavad Gita is therefore adored all over the world. There is no need to eradicate politics, economics, sociology etc.

**Key Quote:** "But for a pure devotee he actually sees everything in relationship with Krishna. And therefore he is able to relate everything with Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the mundane perspective with the devotee's vision, who sees everything in relation to Krishna, emphasizing the importance of pure devotional service and the transcendental nature of topics related to Krishna's pure devotees.

which are mundane to the mundane-ers. Some class of philosophers, they consider topics like economics, politics, sociology connected with this world, the world we live in, as material subject matter and they don't want to hear at all. But for a pure devotee he actually sees everything in relationship with Krishna, and therefore he is able to relate everything with Krishna. So that relationship of everything with Krishna is possible when everything is dovetailed with the Lord's service, with pure devotional service. So Prabhupada is explaining: We have heard and talked about the activities of the Pandavas and we are now dealing with topics of Maharaj Paricharan. But because all these topics are related to the Supreme Lord Krishna they are all transcendental and pure devotees have great interest in hearing them. You see. How? Even the fighting on the battlefield of Kurukshetra or Paricharan Maharaj dealing with a low class person who was hurting a cow, these are important for us because they are in relationship with Krishna. Because the Pandavas are pure devotees of Krishna, Paricharan Maharaj is a pure devotee of Krishna, therefore those topics are of interest to us

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the limited duration of life and the importance of utilizing every moment for Krishna-related topics, urging listeners to avoid wasting time on matters disconnected from self-realization and going back to Godhead.

as devotees. We have already discussed this matter in connection with the prayers of Bhishma and Deva. In the ninth chapter of the first canto this is discussed in detail. Our duration of life is not very long and there is no certainty of when we shall be ordered to leave everything for the next stage. Of course we don't die a spirit soul, but we have to quit this body at a certain time when ordered to do so. There is a certain life span we can live in this body and we exactly do not know how many years we are going to live. It is our duty to see that not a moment of our life is wasted in topics which are not related with Krishna. Somebody who is serious about self-realization or going back to Godhead should not waste a valuable time in this human form of life in topics which are disconnected from Krishna.

### lotus feet of Krishna, devotional service, shelter

**Key Quote:** "devotees are accustomed to licking up the honey available from the lotus feet of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of taking shelter of Krishna's lotus feet, describing the spiritual planet Goloka Vrindavana and the honey available in the lotus flower, symbolizing the relishable nectar of devotional service and the constant desire of devotees to be sheltered by Krishna.

Now, Srila Prabhupada explains what is this licking up the honey available at the lotus feet of the Lord. Prabhupada says the spiritual planet Goloka Vrindavana, the eternal abode of Krishna, is shaped like the wall of a lotus flower. Even when the Lord descends to any of the mundane planets, any of the planets in this material world, He does so by manifesting His own abode as it is. Krishna's abode comes down with Him. When He comes His feet remain always on the same big wall of the lotus flower. And His feet are also as beautiful as the lotus flower. Therefore it is said Lord Krishna has lotus feet. You would have heard this many times. Krishna's feet are described as lotus feet because His feet are always resting on the lotus flower. So there is a certain honey available in the lotus flower, and that honey is what the devotees are accustomed to tasting when they take shelter of Krishna's lotus feet. That's why devotees are attached to Krishna's lotus feet, and that honey is as relishable as nectar. Therefore constantly the devotees want to be sheltered by Krishna's lotus feet. And that's why it is said devotees are accustomed to licking up the honey available from the lotus feet of the Lord. So to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord means to be engaged always in a relationship with topics of devotional service to Krishna. That is the meaning of taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "All of us desire freedom from death, especially those who are devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 7th verse of the 16th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining the desire for freedom from death and attaining eternal life through devotion.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session we will be discussing from the 7th and 8th verses of the 16th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. 7th verse: Shudra Ayusham Dranam Anga Martyanaam Rutaam Ichchatam Ihopahuto Bhagavan Mrutyu Shamitra Karmani. The meaning of this verse is, O Suta Goswami, there are those amongst men who desire freedom from death and get eternal life. They escape the slaughtering process by calling the controller of death, Yamaraja. A very important verse. All of us desire freedom from death, especially those who are devotees. And freedom from death means getting eternal life in Krishna's abode, eternal life full of bliss and knowledge. Now what is the way to get this freedom from death and get eternal life? It is to escape the slaughtering process by calling the controller of death, Yamaraja.

**Key Quote:** "Modern scientists, they do not know the real self, the spirit. They think only in terms of the body."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's purport, criticizing modern science's attempts to avoid death through physical means, emphasizing the importance of the spirit soul over the perishable body.

So what is the meaning of this? Shudra Prabhupada explains in the purport: The living entity as he develops from lower animal life to a higher human being and gradually to higher intelligence becomes anxious to get free from death. It is to get free from the clutches of death. We know nobody wants to die. We all know that. But then death is forced upon us. So in the human form of life, we have developed intelligence to understand how can we become deathless. That is the prerogative of the human being because of developed intelligence. Modern scientists try to avoid death by physiochemical advancement of knowledge. Modern scientists, they do not know the real self, the spirit. They think only in terms of the body. But this body is always a dead body. It appears living because of the presence of the spirit soul. Otherwise this body is always a dead body because it is made of matter. It doesn't have life by itself. It doesn't have life. So any attempt to avoid death by analyzing the chemicals, by manipulating the chemicals or the physical body, this is never going to work. So Srila Prabhupada says, even though they try to avoid death, the controller of death, Yamaraj, is so cruel that he does not spare even the very life of the scientist himself. The scientist who is trying to do research, how to avoid death by some chemical manipulation, even that scientist himself has to die. So nobody is spared by Yamaraj. The scientist who put forward the theory of stopping death by advancement of scientific knowledge becomes himself a victim of death when he is called by Yamaraj.

**Key Quote:** "The only hope of suspending the cruel slaughtering process of Yamaraj is to call him to hear and chant the holy name of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that chanting the holy name of the Lord and engaging in devotional service is the only way to avoid death and transcend material existence.

Yamaraj, exactly when the span of life is over, he sends the Yamadutas to take the soul out of the body, to drag the soul. Now we will be forced to leave the body. Not that we have a choice whether you want to leave the body or you want to continue to live in the body. No. What to speak of stopping death? No one can enhance the short period of life even by a fraction of a moment. So what is the way out then? The only hope of suspending the cruel slaughtering process of Yamaraj is to call him to hear and chant the holy name of the Lord. This is the process. Invite Yamaraj for Sankirtana involving the chanting and hearing of the Hare Krishna mantra, the holy name of the Supreme Lord. Yamaraj is a great devotee of the Lord and he likes to be invited to kirtanas and sacrifices by pure devotees who are constantly engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. Thus the great sages headed by Saunaka and others, invited Yamaraj to attend the sacrifice performed at Naimisharanya. This was good for those who did not want to die. It is described in the beginning of the Bhagavatam, the first canto beginning, that the sages of Naimisharanya undertook to perform a thousand year sacrifice. And what was this thousand year sacrifice? It was all about chanting and hearing the glory of the Lord, the stories of the Supreme Lord. So they began inquiry about Krishna and they wanted to hear the glorification of Krishna. So that is the way to stop death, to avoid death. Those who are engaged in devotional activities transcend the conditions of material life, birth, disease, old age, death, three-fold miseries,

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the 8th verse, explaining that hearing the transcendental pastimes of the Lord protects one from death and leads to eternal life in Krishna's abode.

everything they are able to transcend. The eighth verse, na kaścin mriyate tāvad yāvad āsta īhāntakaḥ etad arthaṁ hi bhagavān āhūtaḥ paramarṣivihi aho nṛloke pīyeta hari-līlāmṛtaṁ va caḥ. The meaning of this eighth verse is as follows: As long as Yamarāja, who causes everyone's death, is present here, no one shall meet with death. The great sages have invited the controller of death, Yamarāja, who is the representative of the Lord. Living beings who are under his grip should take advantage by hearing the deathless nectar in the form of this narration of the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. So the method is how to escape death? To be engaged in hearing the transcendental pastimes of the Lord as described in this Bhagavatam. Then Yamarāja will not touch us. Then what happens? Yamarāja will not touch us. Yamarāja will not drag us out of this body for another term of material existence in another body. No. Then what happens? Actually, when the time comes for quitting the body, Kṛṣṇa will take us to His personal abode for eternal life, full of bliss and knowledge. Not that we are going to continue in this body beyond the lifespan. No. That is not the program. That's not the spiritual program.

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "The surest remedy for avoiding death is to accustom oneself to hearing the nectarean pastimes of the Lord as they are systematically narrated in the text of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of hearing Srimad Bhagavatam daily to conquer death, highlighting the distinction between the perishable body and the eternal soul.

Don't mistake. Don't mistakenly think that I'm going to live in this body forever. This body is perishable. antavanta ime deha nityasyokta śarīrinaha. The soul inside the body is eternal. This body is perishable. So in the Purport Śrīla Prabhupāda says, Every human being dislikes meeting death, but he does not know how to get rid of death. The surest remedy for avoiding death is to accustom oneself to hearing the nectarean pastimes of the Lord as they are systematically narrated in the text of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. So we have begun everyday Bhāgavatam, little, little, little. You keep hearing. In this way you can conquer death. That's what is being said here. It is advised herein, therefore, that any human being who desires freedom from death should take to this course of life as recommended by the rishis headed by Saunaka. Every day hear Bhāgavatam. Therefore we have entitled this series as Daily Evening Bhāgavatam Discourse. Of course, in every ISKCON center, there is a program of daily morning Bhāgavatam class. That's also available. But those who cannot attend that daily morning Bhāgavatam class, either in the temple or online, we have this Daily Evening Bhāgavatam class. So at least evening you can attend. So this is the way to conquer death.

### hearing Bhagavatam, purification, Krishna's mercy, incarnations in Kali Yuga

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "When he sees that we are eager to hear Kṛṣṇa kathā in the Bhāgavatam, then he cleanses our desire for material enjoyment."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how hearing Bhagavatam purifies the heart and removes desires for material enjoyment through Krishna's mercy, mentioning the three important incarnations in Kali Yuga: Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Srimad Bhagavatam, and the Hare Krishna mantra.

Now how does it work? Simply if I hear Bhāgavatam, how do I become deathless? What does this hearing Bhāgavatam do? We have already discussed this in the first canto, second chapter. śṛṇvatāṁ śukathāḥ kṛṣṇahaḥ puṇyaḥ śravaṇaḥ kīrtanaḥ hṛdyantastohi abhadrāṇi vidhunoti surucatām. Krishna is seated in our heart. When he sees that we are eager to hear Kṛṣṇa kathā in the Bhāgavatam, then he cleanses our desire for material enjoyment. It is Kṛṣṇa's blessing, Kṛṣṇa's mercy for those who hear Bhāgavatam, because Bhāgavatam is another incarnation of Kṛṣṇa in this Kali Yuga. Kali Yuga three incarnations are very important. The first incarnation which is important in Kali Yuga is the incarnation of Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. He teaches us simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and hear Bhāgavatam and take prasādam and thereby prepare yourself to go back to Godhead. Then the second incarnation of the Supreme Lord in Kali Yuga is this Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. It contains narrations about Kṛṣṇa and His pure devotees. Simply hearing this every day will purify you and make you eligible to go back to Godhead at the end of this life. And the third incarnation is the incarnation of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, the holy name of the Supreme Lord in the form of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra. So these three incarnations are very, very important. So here, specific recommendation is hear the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam every day.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating the importance of hearing Bhagavatam, chanting Hare Krishna, and accepting Prasadam to purify oneself, realize one's spiritual identity, and ultimately return to Godhead.

At your convenience you can hear. If you can't hear live, then later on you can always hear. But hear every day little, little, little, little, little. This is important. And then you become purified. Your heart becomes cleansed of all misgivings. And then you understand that you are not the body. You realize that. And then when you realize you are not the body, you understand what is the purpose of this body. The purpose of this body is simply to engage in devotional service to Kṛṣṇa and thereby become free from all desires for extending our material existence into another material body after quitting this body. Don't extend. After life in this body is completed, straight go to Kṛṣṇa's abode in your spiritual body. So to uncover the spiritual body before death comes, it is possible by this practice of hearing Bhāgavatam every day. It is possible by daily chanting and hearing Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra. It is possible by daily accepting Prasādam. In this way you can prepare yourself. And you'll be guaranteed if you do this every day little, little, little, little, little, you're guaranteed to go back to Godhead at the end of this life. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and contrasts intelligent people who hear Bhagavatam with lazy, less intelligent people who waste the opportunity of human life.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 9th verse of the 16th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Mandasya Mandasya Prajnasya Vayo Mandayushas Chavai Nidrayahriyate Enaktam Divacha Vyartakarmabhihi. The meaning of this verse is: Lazy human beings with paltry intelligence and a short duration of life pass the night sleeping and the day performing activities that are for naught. So here, the description is being given by Shounaka Rishi. There are the intelligent people who engage in hearing Bhagavatam and escape the slaughtering process of Yamaraj, they escape death, they pass on from this body to Krishna's abode for eternal life, and then there are lazy, less intelligent, foolish human beings also who miss out the rare opportunity in the human form of life to put an end to this suffering of death and disease and

old age. They are described here. First of all, their characteristic is such unfortunate people are lazy. They are lazy, especially they are lazy when it comes to exerting oneself to hear Bhagavatam, lazy when it comes to chanting Hare Krishna, lazy when it comes to avoiding sinful activities, they're lazy. And another characteristic is paltry inclinations, paltry intelligence, very, very little brain substance, they're less intelligent. They're less intelligent. Now, less intelligent, does it mean that some people are born less intelligent, so what can they do? No, this is not what is meant by less intelligent. Less intelligent means they misuse their intelligence for material sense enjoyment. They don't utilize their intelligence for spiritual activities, for spiritual knowledge. They don't use their intelligence properly. That's the meaning here. Please don't misunderstand this. And the third characteristic is that life in Kali Yuga is characterized by short duration, and even that short duration of life they are wasting, completely losing out all the time available in this human body. In what way? At night they are simply engaged in sleeping, and in the daytime they are engaged in useless activities which are not at all helpful for their conquering death, that are not meant for conquering death, that are not meant for gaining eternal life. They are simply a waste of time. So Prabhupada describes about this

The human form is a special gift of material nature in the course of her enforcing stringent laws of miseries upon the living being.

repeated birth and death. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita also: jaatas yahi dhruva mrtyur dhruvam janmam ritasya cha. One has taken birth in this material world, in a material body, sure to die. That means has to quit the body. Now, after taking birth one has to live for certain number of years and quit the body, that's called death. Now, after quitting the body, if one is not prepared to go back to Godhead, one has to again take birth: dhruvam janmam ritasya cha. Birth is certain, another body, another term of suffering and misery. So this is called entanglement in the repetition of birth and death. So to get out of this is possible in the human form of life, and how do you take benefit of this human form of life to get out of the cycle of birth and death?

**Key Quote:** "simply they want to use these for enjoying enjoying enjoying enjoying material happiness material material"
**Summary:** The speaker criticizes the pursuit of economic development and sense enjoyment, highlighting the temporary nature of material happiness.

So such people, they become more interested in so-called economic development, work very hard throughout life simply for sense enjoyment of the temporary body. This body anyway is going to perish, it is simply meant for suffering, suffering something, but though they don't like suffering, they think I can overcome this suffering by replacing suffering with some material pleasure, and they have devised so many ways of trying to get some material pleasure by sense enjoyment. So we have senses, the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, and the skin, and we also have the genitals, we have the belly, we have the voice, we have hands, we have legs, all this, all these senses for the materialistic persons, for the less intelligent persons, for the foolish persons, for the lazy persons, for the unfortunate persons, simply they want to use these for enjoying, enjoying, enjoying, enjoying material happiness, material, material, and what they don't realize is by the laws of nature every creature including the lower animals, birds, worms, insects, the aquatics, the plants, every living being is allowed by nature to enjoy certain type of sense pleasure. Don't think human beings are the only one who are enjoying life and materially, even the hogs and dogs are enjoying this, this particularly pointed out by bhagavata,

**Key Quote:** "even the hogs and dogs are enjoying this particularly pointed out by bhagavata"
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of a hog enjoying stool to illustrate that sense pleasure is available in all forms of life, not just human life.

the stool eating hog, wit varaha, so stool eating hog, it eats rubbish, but it relishes that, it becomes fat, it takes lot pleasure in that, and we as human beings will look at the hog and say what a an abominable creature, dirty, filthy, how can it enjoy eating some filly stool, rubbish, rejected stuff, but the hog doesn't think like we think, so it is enjoying in its own way, every creature is enjoying it's own way, but that doesn't mean they're only enjoying all the time, know suffering by miseries inflicted upon them by material nature. So therefore, Prabhupada says, one should definitely try to understand that sense enjoyment is not the ultimate goal of human life.

**Key Quote:** "They work simply for sense enjoyment, that's all. But that sense enjoyment is not at all giving us happiness or real pleasure."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the momentary and unsatisfying nature of sense enjoyment with the eternal and natural pleasure of the soul.

It is available anyway in all forms of creature. Herein it is said that during the daytime one works for nothing. When it is said one works for nothing means there is only one goal ultimately of all materialistic persons. They work simply for sense enjoyment, that's all. But that sense enjoyment is not at all giving us happiness or real pleasure. That's all. It doesn't give us happiness or pleasure, because it is a sensation by sense contact which is momentary, which is just for the short moment that there is contact. Just like you place one piece of sweet on your tongue, that contact, supposing you like that sweet, that sweet taste. Moment the contact there is some sensation of sweet taste, ah, so nice. But can you keep on telling, oh very nice, sweet taste, very nice, sweet taste, very nice, sweet taste, very nice, sweet taste, very nice. Can you keep on telling like that? No. That sweet taste, the sensation will last only for a moment. And then after that you have to place one more piece of sweet for one more sensation by contact. samsparishvaja bhoga. This is described in Bhagavad Gita. This material pleasure is nothing but the sense contact producing a sensation for a moment which we think is oh so nice, so enjoyable, so pleasure. But this is waste of time. There is spiritual happiness which is not momentary, which is not by sense contact, which is the natural pleasure of the soul,

### cow protection, social order, Kali Yuga

**Key Quote:** "Maharaja Pariksit observes that a lower caste Shudra dressed like a king was beating a cow and a bull with a club as if they had no owner"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of the verse, highlighting the mistreatment of cows and bulls by an unqualified ruler.

The meaning of this verse is, Suta Goswami said, after reaching that place, Maharaja Pariksit observes that, Maharaj Pariksit observes that, that a lower caste Shudra dressed like a king was beating a cow and a bull with a club as if they had no owner. So the previous chapter ended with the description that while the, while Mother Earth and the personality of religious principles Dharma, Dharini and Dharma were engaged in conversation, the saintly king Pariksit reached that place and now the description continues. What did Pariksit observe when he reached that place? He saw that this Kali Purusha, that this Kali Purusha, he is dressed like a king, but actually he doesn't have the qualification of a king. He is not a qualified Kshatriya according to the Vedic understanding. He is actually unqualified person, but he is dressed like a king, means he is trying to occupy the post of the ruler or the, or the King without qualification. And it was also very clear that the Kshatriyas are meant for protecting the citizens and the domestic animals, but here we see this person, he is dressed like a king and then he is dressed like a king, dressed like a king, but he is beating a cow and a bull as if they had no owner.

### varanashrama, shudra, Kali Yuga

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The principal sign of the age of Kali is that lower caste's shudras, men without personal culture and men without spiritual initiation would be dressed like administrators or Kings"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the verse, defining 'shudra' not by birth but by lack of culture and spiritual initiation, and connecting it to unqualified leaders in Kali Yuga.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, what does this mean for us who are living in Kali Yuga? It has got a lot of significance this description here. The principal sign, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, the principal sign of the age of Kali is that lower caste's shudras, what does it mean lower caste shudras, men without aristocratical culture and men without spiritual initiation would be dressed like administrators or Kings and the principal business of such non-Ksatria rulers would be to kill the investors. Innocent animals, especially the cows and bulls, who shall be unprotected by their masters, the bona fide vices, the mercantile community. Sushila Prabhupada clearly explains a often misunderstood terminology. In the Vedic scriptures, in the description of the varana and ashrama system of dharma, it is described that the society should be divided according to occupational duties and according to spiritual development into four varanas and four ashramas, four social orders and four spiritual orders. Now, this varana classification has become completely topsy-turvy in this Kali Yuga because of the misunderstanding that one belongs to a varana according to birth in a certain family, which is not. What is explained in the scriptures, clearly in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says, the quality based on qualifications, based on the qualities possessed by a person, that person should be classified according to the qualities and according to the occupational duties. The one who performs the same occupation according to the work he performs, according to the natural inclination to work in a certain way, a person should actually be classified as a brahmana, kshatriya, vaishya or shudra. So very clearly who are to be classified as shudras, those who do not have brahmanical culture and they do not have spiritual initiation. Sushila Prabhupada explains. That means they are more or less godless people and they are bereft of the brahmanical culture. They are uncultured. According to Vedic description, they are uncultured. So, uncultured, godless people are to be classified as Shudras. Not according to birth. Regardless of which type of family they take birth in, it doesn't matter. If they are uncultured, if they are godless, then they are to be classified as Shudras. Such people will be considered as Shudras. They will be dressed like administrators or kings. This is the sign of Kalyuga.

### cow protection, vaishya, social order

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "These animals will be unprotected. So, therefore these administrators can freely kill without anybody questioning them."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the role of Vaishyas in protecting cows and bulls, and the consequences of their absence in Kali Yuga.

And these administrators who are unqualified, but somehow they have managed to occupy the post of the administrator. They will simply indulge in killing innocent animals, especially the cow and the bull. And these cows and bulls will be killed by such unqualified administrators because such cows and bulls which are meant to be protected by the Vaishya class, the mercantile community in the Vedic culture. These animals will be unprotected. They will be unprotected. So, therefore these administrators can freely kill without anybody questioning them. Without the animals, innocent animals who give lot of service to the human society, not getting any protection. They are helpless. They are innocent. They are helpless. So, this is the situation. Even in this age of Kali, that we are finding it right now in our present times. Exact description given in the Srimad Bhagavatam. So, Srila Prabhupada further says, In the Bhagavad Gita, in the 18th chapter, in the 44th verse, it is said, that the Vaishyas are meant to deal in agriculture, cow protection and trade. Krishi, Goraksha, Vaanijjam, Vaishya, Karma, Swabhavajam. By their acquired nature. There are certain class of people in the civilized human society who are meant to deal in three things. Krishi or agriculture. Goraksha, cow protection. Goraksha. And Vaanijja, trade, commerce.

### cow protection, degraded vaishyas, slaughterhouses

**Key Quote:** "And in this age of Kali, the degraded Vaishyas, the mercantile men, are engaged in supplying cows to slaughterhouses."
**Summary:** The speaker criticizes the modern Vaishyas who exploit cows for milk and then send them to slaughterhouses, neglecting their duty of protection.

So, the cow protection was specifically entrusted to the Vaishyas in the Vedic culture. Now, there are no qualified Vaishyas. So, therefore, the cows are not getting the protection that they deserve. And in this age of Kali, the degraded Vaishyas, the mercantile men, are engaged in supplying cows to slaughterhouses. As long as the cow gives milk, they keep the cow and take the milk and do business with milk and milk products. And when the cow stops giving milk, send it to the slaughterhouse. This is their business. Not that the cow has given so much service and it should be given protection. No such consideration at all. Merciless, heartless, cruel people. Very, very mean-minded. Right? Yes. And it is said in the scriptures that the Kshatriyas, the qualified Kshatriyas, are meant to protect the citizens of the state. Whereas the Vaishyas are meant to protect the cows and bulls and utilize them to produce grains and milk. So, both the humans and the cows and bulls require protection because human form of life is very, very important for it affords the opportunity for self-realization. And cows and bulls are especially meant for producing grains and milk. And the cow gives a lot of service.

**Key Quote:** "Even the cow, the urine and stool of the cow is very useful for human society."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the immense value of cows, highlighting the usefulness of their milk, urine, dung, and even their horns and skin after death, and condemns cow killing as a grave sin leading to suffering.

Every part of the cow is very, very useful. Even the cow, the urine and stool of the cow is very useful for human society. Goarka. Cow urine is called Goarka. It has got a lot of medicinal properties. It can be used in so many ways. So many useful ways for human beings. And the cow dung is first-class medicine. It is first-class manure. It is the best fuel for dried cow dung cakes. And it helps in so many ways. So many ways the cow dung can be used. It has got antiseptic properties. When cow dung cake, dried cake is burnt, it drives away mosquitoes. That smoke drives away mosquitoes. So like that, there are innumerable benefits of cow dung and cow urine. Such an animal is very, very, very useful. After the cow dies a natural death, the horn of the cow, the horns of the cow are very useful. The skin of the cow is very useful, very useful also. So cow is so valuable. The cow tail, the tail of the cow is also very useful. So like this, the cow is such a useful animal. And most importantly, the cow gives us milk, which is the most precious food substance for human beings, especially for human beings. So such animals should never be killed. Should never be killed. So that is the Vedic injunction. And it is the greatest sin to kill the cow. Gohatya is the greatest sin. And people have to suffer in very horrible ways by the laws of nature imposed on such foolish people, ignorant people, merciless people, cruel people. By nature, by God, through the material nature, this punishment will be enforced. People have to suffer. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.
