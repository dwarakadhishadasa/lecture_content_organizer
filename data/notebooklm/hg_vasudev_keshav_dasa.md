In our fearful condition, let us take shelter of him, for we are sure that the Supreme Lord, the Supreme Soul, will give us his protection.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, the Supreme Lord is the cause of Prakriti and Purusha. He is the original cause, Sarvakarana Karanam."
**Summary:** The speaker reads and explains the purport, emphasizing Vishnu as the original cause of creation, Prakriti, and Purusha, referencing Sridhar Swami's commentary and various scriptures.

Purport. In this verse, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vishnu, is ascertained to be the original cause of creation. Sridhar Swami, in his commentary, Bhavarth Deepika, replies to the idea that Prakriti and Purusha are the causes of the cosmic manifestation. As stated here in Param Pradhanam Purusham Vishvamanyam, he is the Supreme. He is the supreme cause, represented as the male and female creative energies. All the different from this universe, he exists in his universal form, Virata Rupa. The word Prakriti, which is used to indicate the source of generation, refers to the material energy of the Supreme Lord, and the word Purusha refers to the living entities, who are the superior energy of the Lord. Both the Prakriti and Purusha ultimately enter the Supreme Lord, as stated in the Bhagavad Gita, Prakritim Yanti Maam Ikam. Although Prakriti and Purusha superficially appear to be the causes of the material creation, both are emanations of different energies of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, the Supreme Lord is the cause of Prakriti and Purusha. He is the original cause, Sarvakarana Karanam. The Naradya Purana, Avikaropi Paramah Prakritistu Vikarini Anupravisya Govindah Prakritishchabhidhiyate Both the Prakriti and Purusha, which are inferior and superior energies, are emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As explained in the Bhagavad Gita, Gama Vishya The Lord enters the Prakriti and then the Prakriti, and creates different manifestations. The Prakriti is not independent or beyond his energies. Vasudeva, Lord Shri Krishna, is the original cause of everything. Therefore, the Lord says in the Bhagavad Gita, Aham Sarvasya Prabhavo Matta Sarvam Pravartate Iti Matva Bhajante Maam Buddha Bhava Saman Vitaha I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from me. The wise, who perfectly know this, engage in my devotional service and worship me with all their hearts. In Srimad Bhagavatam, the Lord also says, Aham Evasam Evagre Only I existed before the creation. This is confirmed in the Brahmanda Purana as follows: Smritir Avya Vadhanena Prakrititvam Iti Sthithi Ubhayatmaka Suthitvadha Vasudeva Parah Puman Prakriti Purushad Cheti Shabder Ekobhidhiyate To generate the universe, the Lord acts indirectly as the Purusha and directly as the Prakriti. The energies emanate from Lord Vasudeva, the all-pervasive, supreme personality of Godhead. He is known as both Prakriti and Purusha. Therefore, Vasudeva is the cause of everything. Sarvakarana Karanam

### Vritrasura, Indra, yagna, mantra, fear, shelter

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "So now Indra and all the devatas are seeing this personality and they have no clue from where he has appeared and how he has appeared and they all become very very afraid and now they have taken shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead for protection"
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Vritrasura's appearance and Indra's fear, explaining how a mistake in chanting a mantra led to an unintended outcome, and how the demigods sought protection from the Supreme Lord.

So in this chapter, chapter 9 of 6th canto, the appearance of demon Vritrasura. So we know the story how the demon appeared. Indra, he killed his priest because he was chanting the mantras favoring the demons. So Indra becomes very afraid and kills him. And then his father becomes upset because his son is killed. So his father, Tvashta, is performing a sacrifice by which a personality will be born who will kill Indra, because Indra killed his son, that is Visvarupa. So Visvarupa was the priest that Indra had engaged and he killed his own priest because he was favoring the demons. So Tvashta, his father, performs a yagna. And as we read that in the yagna, this is the importance of chanting the Vedic mantras accurately. He chanted the mantra Indra Shatro Vibhar Dasva. And he was supposed to chant it short, but he chanted it long. And because of this small difference of chanting it short to long, the mantra became opposite. Tvashta, when he chanted the mantra Indra Shatro Vibhar Dasva, Indra Shatro means the Shatru of Indra Vibhar Dasva may increase. So from the yagna a personality would be born who would be a Shatru of Indra, who would be the enemy of Indra. But because he chanted it long instead of chanting it short, the meaning became opposite. The meaning became Indra will become the Shatru of that personality. So now somebody asked me what's the difference whether he becomes the Shatru of him or Indra becomes the Shatru of him, what is the difference? They did not understand this. Quite a reasonable question. So it is like this: Personality and Indra. If this personality Tvashta wanted to be the enemy of Indra, then he will kill him because he is the enemy. So the personality was supposed to be born as enemy of Indra means he would kill Indra because he is the enemy. But now what happened? Indra became his enemy. So now because Indra has become his enemy, Indra will kill him. So you see how the meaning has changed. Instead of he killing Indra, he becoming so powerful that he would kill Indra, Indra got all the power by that Yagna and Indra finally killed him, Vritrasura. That's why Vritrasura was such a powerful demon. It is said that when Vritrasura appeared he was so fearful and so huge and gigantic that the demigods felt that the entire creation would be destroyed. Not just the universe, the entire creation. But Indra managed to kill him because the Yagna was performed like that. So Vritrasura has appeared. So now Indra and all the devatas are seeing this personality and they have no clue from where he has appeared and how he has appeared and they all become very very afraid and now they have taken shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead for protection. So this is the Mantra. So in this shloka this is the prayer of Indra to the Supreme Personality of Godhead Narayana. They are offering prayers seeking protection, seeking shelter from Lord Narayana. So here in this prayer we read this prayer how Krishna is the cause of all causes. He is the cause of Purusha. He is the cause of Prakriti. Purusha is the superior living entity, the spirit soul and the ultimate paramam Purusha is Krishna and Prakriti is this material manifestation. So all that we see in this material world is a combination of Purusha and Prakriti because we are also small Purushas. So the origin of Purusha and Prakriti is the Supreme Lord. Like that the prayer starts off and then Indra is praying to the Lord. So how do you begin a prayer? You start glorifying the Supreme Lord. So Indra is glorifying the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Narayana.

### prayer, inconceivable, incarnations, cause of all causes
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/pd1f-WBVQec?t=697
**Verse References:** BG 10.8
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "My dear Lord, O Lord Narayana, You are inconceivable"
**Summary:** The speaker explains Indra's prayer to Lord Narayana, highlighting the Lord's inconceivable nature, His expansions into various incarnations, and His position as the cause of all causes.

Indra says that My dear Lord, O Lord Narayana, You are inconceivable. So we try to understand God, but actually God can be understood only by Bhakti. God cannot be understood by our material logic, by our material intelligence. That's why Indra is saying You are inconceivable. And so Krishna's name is Achintya. He cannot be understood. That's why he is inconceivable. Krishna's another name to explain how he is inconceivable is Adhokshaja. Akshaja means these senses. Akshaja means the eyes. It also refers to all the senses, the five senses that we have to acquire knowledge. But Krishna's Adhokshaja means he is beyond these five senses. So he is inconceivable. Because we can only conceive something which is within our intellect, which we can understand through our senses, eyes, ears, nose and all those five senses. But Krishna is beyond them. That's why he is inconceivable. And that's why Krishna is called Adhokshaja. So Indra is praying You are inconceivable. All the pastimes of Krishna are also inconceivable. So many wonderful pastimes Krishna performed. These are the inconceivable pastimes of Lord. And then he also says that Indra is praying that you expand yourself into different transcendental bodies. All the list of incarnations are mentioned here. Krishna expands himself into all these bodies. And then he also says You are the cause of all causes. And Krishna himself declares in the Bhagavad Gita I am the source of all material and spiritual world. And from me everything emanates.

### intelligence, ultimate cause, research

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Real intelligence means trying to find the ultimate cause"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts material research with spiritual understanding, arguing that true intelligence lies in seeking the ultimate cause of everything, rather than just immediate causes.

So as we know that understanding Krishna who is the cause of all causes is the most important thing a human being should be engaged in. You are all so busy trying to understand different things happening in the material world. Why this happened, why that happened? Why this is like that, why that is like that? We are doing PhDs, research. They are considered to be the best of the scholars. And in the PhD what are we doing? We are trying to find the causes for different things. Why it is like this? Trying to explain something. But actually real intelligence means trying to find the ultimate cause. Because if that ultimate cause does not exist, then none of these things would exist. So we are finding this material creation so wonderful, so unique, so inconceivable. Even this tiny planet earth has got so many inconceivable wonderful things. And we are so marveled and bewildered by these wonderful things. Imagine the person who created it. How powerful and how intelligent he will be. So actually just trying to understand the immediate cause is not very intelligent. Trying to understand the ultimate cause is real intelligence.

### analogy, train, engine, Krishna, fearlessness, surrender

**Verse References:** BG 10.8
**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Krishna is the cause of Aham sarvasya prabhavo Matta sarvam pravartate Everything emanates from me"
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a train and its engine to illustrate that Krishna is the ultimate cause, and emphasizes that surrendering to Krishna is the path to fearlessness.

Just like a simple example. In a train which is moving, it has got 10 bogies. If a person sitting in bogie number 9 is trying to understand why bogie number 10, if he is trying to understand why my bogie is moving so wonderfully and I am proceeding towards my destination, and if he tries to find the immediate cause, he will know it is because bogie 9 is pulling me. And like that if someone is sitting in bogie 9 and he is trying to find out why am I moving so fast and how wonderfully I am moving, it is because bogie 8 is pulling him. But actually these are all immediate causes. The ultimate cause for the existence of the train and for the very purpose of the train's existence is the engine. And beyond the engine there is nothing else. The engine is the cause of all causes. So a train becomes meaningless without an engine. And all the meaning that is there in all the 10 bogies and people inside the train and all the things that is happening in the train is because of the engine. Engine is the main invention, is the main find, is the main thing to understand. So in the same way Krishna is the cause of Aham sarvasya prabhavo Matta sarvam pravartate. Everything emanates from me. Whatever we see is emanating from Krishna. Brahma is also saying Sarvakarana karanam. He is the karana Sarvakarana karanam of cause of all causes. So we must all try to understand God and his wonderful creations, keeping God as the reference. So like this he is offering prayer. Now why is he offering this prayer? He is saying we are offering prayer. We are seeking shelter and protection. It ends like this, the prayer: In our fearful condition, let us take shelter of him, for we are sure that the supreme lord, the supreme soul will give us his protection. So in our fearful condition, let us take shelter of him, for we are sure that the supreme lord, the supreme soul will give us his protection. Krishna also says Just take shelter of me, surrender to me, for I am the supreme lord. So if you want to be fearless, we just have to surrender to Krishna. So here the devatas are surrendering to the supreme lord Narayana and they are offering their prayers. So now

### fear, material world, nature, foreign place

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "So this is the nature of the material world...The king of heavens is afraid...The reason because everyone is afraid in this material world...Is because the place that we are living in is not natural to us. It's a foreign place."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the pervasive nature of fear in the material world, even for those in positions of power like Indra, explaining that it stems from being in an unnatural, foreign place.

Devatas, Indra is no ordinary devata. He is in the heavenly planet. He is the king of the entire Demigods. Even he is afraid. He is not an ordinary person. So this is the nature of the material world. Whether you are the king, not only a king of this planet earth, the king of heavens is afraid. And why the king of heaven is also afraid? King of heaven must be a very wonderful comfortable life, isn't it? King has a very wonderful life. And Indra the king, not an ordinary, even he is afraid. The reason because everyone is afraid in this material world. Even an animal is afraid. A small insect is afraid. A small ant is afraid. We see many times a bird is pecking at some grains. It pecks one grain and it looks left and right. Again pecks at one more grain. Again it is looking left and right, afraid that somebody will come, kill him, afraid. Once Prabhupada was giving a talk in Vrindavan. In Vrindavan there are a lot of monkeys. So while he was talking, one monkey entered his room. Actually not a monkey, it was a baby monkey. The mother monkey and the baby monkey were there. And the windows bars are some size and the baby is very small. So through those two bars. And the moment the baby entered, baby hasn't got so much of intelligence, the mother becomes very afraid. And the mother is shouting, screaming, making sound, trying to shake the bars. And all the devotees are watching. And then they somehow try to push that baby monkey outside the window. And then the mother took it and went away. See a small insignificant being to Indra. Everyone is afraid in this material world. And the reason as Bhagavatam gives us, tells us, is because the place that we are living in is not natural to us. It's a foreign place. So in a foreign place, in a place which is not natural to our existence, fear is certain.

### analogy, ocean, ship, spiritual world, shelter

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "We are spirit souls. A spirit soul is supposed to stay in the spiritual world serving Krishna. And if we are not there...We will be afraid."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of a ship on the ocean, the speaker explains that the material world is not our natural home, and true fearlessness comes from taking shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the spiritual world.

Just like Prabhupada gives an example. In the sea, on the ship. Ship is a very safe place, right? In an ocean you are comfortably seated. But many times there are storms, there are fogs. When there is storm, the ocean becomes very turbulent. And then everyone becomes afraid. And when there is fog, again the ship stops and the ship is sounding because it's afraid that another ship will come and they will collide. In an ocean, although you are in a ship, you will always be afraid because the ocean is not your natural position. When you are on land, you will not be so afraid because land in your house is your natural position. So in the same way, we are not in our natural position, whether on this planet earth or in Indraloka or even in the highest material planet Brahmaloka. We are spirit souls. A spirit soul is supposed to stay in the spiritual world serving Krishna. And if we are not there, no matter how rich we are, how intelligent we are, how capable we are, how good a job we have, the very fact that we are in this material world, we will be afraid. So we must always be making a plan that how can I, if I want to be really fearless, I have to be in the spiritual world. I have to take shelter of the supreme personality of God. Then no matter what we are, in whatever position we are, automatically fearlessness.

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Because the Supreme Lord, so we can do that by taking strong shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Prahlad Maharaj to illustrate how devotion to the Lord leads to fearlessness, even in the face of extreme adversity, contrasting it with his powerful but fearful father.

The best example is Prahlad Maharaj. Just a small boy, 5 years old, but is completely fearless. He hasn't got some big education or anything like that, but he is fearless because he was engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. So many things he went through. He is completely fearless. It is so difficult. Imagine a small boy of 5 years. He is put into a pit of poisonous snakes, fearless. He is being pierced, he is being stamped by an elephant, fearless. He is being pierced by trident, fearless. He has even drunk poison, imagine. So only by being a devout. And on the other hand, if you see his father, he conquered Indra. He has all the wealth, all the power, but full of fear. So in the material world, fearful situations are common. It is a very. But all that we need to know, a soul, that's why the spiritual world is Vaikuntha. Vaikuntha means a place where there is no fear, there is no anxiety. Material world is full of fear and anxiety for everyone. So how do we create a fearless situation in the material world? This is our unnatural position, right? Material world is unnatural, like ocean is unnatural. But now I want to be fearless in this unnatural position, in this unnatural situation. How can I do that? Because the Supreme Lord, so we can do that by taking strong shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. God is, even though we are in an unnatural position, if we take strong shelter of His lotus feet,

**Key Quote:** "Very simple, to take shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna, the practical method to take shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna is by chanting the Hare Krishna mantra."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Bhaktivinoda Thakur on the qualities of Krishna's lotus feet and explains that the practical way to take shelter of them is by chanting the Hare Krishna mantra, as there is no difference between the lotus feet of Krishna and chanting Hare Krishna.

we can become fearless even in this material existence which is full of fear. Bhaktivinoda Thakur has written in one song, very nicely, he says, he is describing Supreme Lord's two lotus feet, very nicely. And he says, if you take shelter of this lotus feet of Krishna, then you will become fearless. So he says, Your two lotus feet is what? It is the source of Ashoka. Ashoka, Abhaya, Amrita, Ashoka. Ashoka means, there is no Shoka, there is no lamentation. There is no sorrow, Ashoka. And Abhaya, it is fearless, it is a place where there is no fear. And Amrita, Adhaar, and they are the basis for Amrita. Or like, not only it is fearless, you will get nectar at His lotus feet. And so what have I, what will I do? Taha te ekho no vishrama labhiya, labhiya. Now I will take shelter, I will take rest at your lotus feet. Chhaadi nu bhavera bhaiya. And in this way, this bhava bhaiya, the fear of this material existence, bhava, I will be able to give up. So Ashoka Abhaya, Amrita Adhaar, tomara charana dhvaya. Taha te ekho no vishrama labhiya, chhaadi nu bhavera bhaiya. Taha te ekho no vishrama labhiya, chhaadi nu bhavera bhaiya. So how do we take shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna? Very simple, to take shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna, the practical method to take shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna is by chanting the Hare Krishna mantra. Prabhupada says in one letter he is writing, you must strongly take shelter of the, he is writing to a devotee, that you must strongly take shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna. You must strongly take shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna and that you can do by chanting the Hare Krishna mantra. Because there is no difference between the lotus feet of Krishna and chanting Hare Krishna. It is one and the same.

### holy name, fearlessness, chanting, hearing

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Yet, all fear is vanquished as soon as there is the sound of the Lord, represented by his holy name"
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada on the power of the holy name to vanquish all fear, emphasizing that fear vanishes as soon as the sound of the Lord is heard.

Krishna is present in this world in the form of his holy name. So I will read a few quotes of Prabhupada. The sound of the Lord is identical with the Lord, as we have tried to explain. The material existence of our present status is full of fear. Out of the four problems of material existence, namely the food problem, the shelter problem, the fear problem and the mating problem, the fear problem gives us more trouble than the others. Eating, sleeping, mating, defending, the four miseries of the material world. Defending or fearing is giving us more problem, gives us more trouble than others. We are always fearful due to our ignorance of the next problem. Another reason of fear, I don't know what is going to happen tomorrow. The whole material existence is full of problems and thus the fear problem is always prominent. This is due to our association with the illusory energy of the Lord, known as Maya or external energy. Yet, all fear is vanquished as soon as there is the sound of the Lord, represented by his holy name, as it was sounded by Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in the following 16 words: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. We can take advantage of these sounds and be free from the threatening problems of material existence. So just by chanting this mantra, Prabhupada is writing, fear is vanished as soon as there is sound. So actually if you become afraid, just chant and hear. Immediately you will feel a sense of fearlessness, if you are hearing. It doesn't take long. It's not that you have to do a long practice to become fearless. Many, many, lot of chanting you have to do. Prabhupada is writing, all fear, not one or two fear, all fear is vanished. How long it takes to vanish? As soon as there is sound of the Lord. As soon as there is sound, all fear vanished. Just look at the meanings of these words. How significant it is. All fear vanished immediately as soon as there is sound. So that's why if devotees focus on hearing the sound, vibrating it very clearly, distinctly and hearing, instantly you will become fearless.

**Key Quote:** "As soon as we chant Hare Krishna, we are Vasudev Parayana, there is no more fear."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada again, emphasizing that as soon as one chants Hare Krishna, there is no more fear, and stressing the importance of sticking to this principle and not deviating from it.

It doesn't take long. Another word, another quote. Chant Shri Krishna Chaitanya Prabhu Nithyananda Shri Advaita Gadadhar, Shri Vasadi Gaurabhakta Vrinda. By their favour, by the favour of Pancha Tathwa, by their mercy we can chant Hare Krishna. And as soon as we chant Hare Krishna, we are Vasudev Parayana, there is no more fear. Again here Prabhupada is saying, as soon as you chant Hare Krishna, there is no more fear. So how as soon as you chant no more fear, fear vanishes? The whole world is full of fear. Everybody today, you can see what is the situation of the world. Everybody is so afraid. So many wars, so much unrest, so much of terrorism, so much this, natural calamity. In Kerala something happened, rain. Everybody is full of fear. As soon as you chant, fearlessness, immediately. So and then Prabhupada is saying, as soon as you chant no more fear, so you stick to this principle, do not forget. Don't deviate from it. Then everything is perfect and your life is successful. So it's like Prabhupada is stressing. Just like you have a stress. Hare Nama Hare Nama Hare Nama Iva Kevalam. Kalo Naasteva Na. There is a stress. Now here see Prabhupada's stress. He says, as soon as you chant, no more fear. Now how is Prabhupada stressing? You stick to this principle. First stress. Second, do not forget. And third, don't deviate from it. And then what is the result? The result is, everything is perfect and your life is successful.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "That we can become fearless as soon as we take shelter of the Holy Name."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that Kali Yuga is an age full of fear, but the solution is simple: taking shelter of the Holy Name, which is always present and available, will immediately bring fearlessness.

Everything becomes perfect. Last one. So this is confirmed in the Bhagavatam. Sankhya Deva Krishnasya Mukta Sangha Param Vrachet. Simply by chanting, you can keep. If you follow the rules and regulations and chanting, you will not be victimized. You will not be victimized. You will make your progress without any fear. So Kali Yuga is an age full of fear and anxiety. It is the dark age. But as we know, we have heard it in Bhagavatam, this age is worshipped. It is glorified. It is better than Satya Yuga. Because the problem of fear which gives us the maximum trouble, as Prabhupada is writing, out of the eating, sleeping, fearing and defending, has a very simple and easy solution. That we can become fearless as soon as we take shelter of the Holy Name. So here we see the Devatas, they become very afraid, full of fear, because the huge demon Vritrasura has appeared. And so they are taking shelter of Narayana. And Narayana is present in this age 24 bar 7. Every moment Narayana is present in this Holy Name, we just have to hear the sound attentively. And as soon as we hear the sound, immediately we will become fearless. So we will end here. Vrindra Ashi Mad Bhagavatam Ki. Shila Prabhupada Ki.

Shri Shukadev Goswami said, My dear King, when all the demigods offered Him their prayers, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Hari, carrying His weapons, the conch shell, desk and club, appeared first within their hearts and then before them. This is no purport, so I'll read the next verse by myself. Atma Tulyai Shodasha Bhir Vina Sri Vatsa Kaustubha Pariyo Paasitam Unniya Nidra Shadadamburu Hekshanam Drishtvatam Avanosarva Ekshanah Lada Viklavaha Dandavat Patita Rajan Chaner Uthaya Tushtuvahu. Translation: Surrounding and serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana, were sixteen personal attendants, decorated with ornaments and appearing exactly like Him, but without the mark of Sri Vatsa and the Kaustubha jewel. O King, when all the demigods saw the Supreme Lord in that posture, smiling with eyes like the petals of the lotus, they were overwhelmed with happiness and immediately fell down like rods offering dandavats. Then they slowly rose and pleased the Lord by offering Him prayers.

**Summary:** The speaker provides context to the verses by summarizing the events leading to the Lord's appearance, including the appearance of Vritrasura and the demigods' prayers.

So in this chapter, Appearance of Demon Vritrasura, in just a few verses before, we saw how the demon Vritrasura appeared and under what conditions he appeared. Indra and all the devatas have lost their kingdom. So they are praying. They first, we know the whole story, that how they got Vishwarupa as their priest to help them and win back their kingdom. And then Vishwarupa was sikandhu. He was secretly offering the ahutis in the sacrificial fire. He was offering oblations to please the devatas, to please the Supreme Lord on behalf of the devatas and also on behalf of the demons. So Indra becomes angry and in a fit of anger, he beheads Vishwarupa, kills him. And then Vishwarupa's father, Tvashta, becomes very angry. And then Tvashta starts a sacrifice where he intended to produce, to generate a personality who will be the demon of Indra and will kill Indra. But the reverse effect happens because he chanted the mantra long instead of chanting the mantra short. So instead of, because of that mistake, the personality arose, a fearful demon who was supposed to be the enemy of Indra, but because the mantra was chanted wrong, Indra becomes his enemy. And so Indra, we will see later in the next chapter how Indra will kill him. So when this demon Vritrasura appeared, he was very, very powerful, very fearful, very vast, very ghastly. It was like appearing as if the whole universe, the whole creation will come to an end. And so all the devatas, they have no other option now but to seek shelter at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of God. They are offering prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So they have just finished offering their prayers and at this point of time, a wonderful thing has happened. The Supreme Personality of God personally appears. It's no ordinary thing. The Lord has appeared in His full form. Actually this chapter is called Appearance of Demon Vritrasura and there is also the Appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari and Narayan.

### Appearance in the heart, Manifestation, Devotion

**Key Quote:** "He appeared first within their hearts and then He appeared before them. This was the process of appearance."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the process of the Lord's appearance, first in the heart and then externally, drawing parallels with Krishna's appearance to Devaki and Dhruva Maharaja's experience.

So these two verses are describing how the Lord has appeared. It says here, Abhud Aavihi. Abhud means He became manifested. He became visible. Aavihi means He appeared. And how did He appear? He appeared first within their hearts and then He appeared before them. This was the process of appearance. We have a very similar thing we see in Lord Krishna's appearance at the prison house of Kamsa in Mathura to Mother Devaki. Krishna also appeared in the same way. First He appeared in the heart of Vasudev. Then from the heart of Vasudev He gets transferred to the heart of Devaki and then He appears. So something very similar we are seeing here also. The Lord first appeared in the heart and then the Lord manifested Himself outside. And something similar we saw in Dhruva's also, when Dhruva was chanting the mantra Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya. Actually the Lord appears first in His heart as a Paramatma. Dhruva could clearly see. And then suddenly His meditation on the Vishnu Murthi broke. He was seeing the Lord in His heart and then it broke and He was wondering where did the Lord disappear? And then He opened His eyes and He saw the Lord was right in front of Him standing in His beautiful form of Vishnu. So this Lord first appearing in the heart and then appearing, manifesting in front of the devotees is a very wonderful Leela of the Lord.

### Lord's Entourage, Vaikuntha Features, Demigods' Reaction

**Key Quote:** "Here also the Lord has appeared with 16 more personal attendants. And there is only one difference between the Lord's appearance and the appearance of these 16 attendants."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the Lord's appearance with attendants, highlighting the distinguishing features of the Lord (Srivatsa and Kaustubha gem) and the demigods' overwhelming happiness and subsequent prayers.

And the Lord appears like this to satisfy His devotees when His devotees are rendering pure devotional service. It's not an ordinary thing for the Lord to appear. It's an extraordinary thing. And here, how the Lord has appeared. He has not just appeared alone like Prabhupada says, when the King goes, the King doesn't go alone. The King goes with His whole entourage. And so, here also the Lord has appeared with 16 more personal attendants. And there is only one difference between the Lord's appearance and the appearance of these 16 attendants. That is, because in the Vaikuntha planet everybody has features of Lord Vishnu, the four-handed form. But to distinguish between the Lord's associates, the Lord's devotees in the Vaikuntha and the Lord Himself, there has to be some demarcation that He is the Supreme Lord. Because everybody there appears with four hands, with a helmet and with everything. The only differentiating factor is that the Lord has two features which none of His associates have in Vaikuntha. And what are those two features? He has the Srivatsa mark on His chest. Srivatsa is a tuft of, a curl of white hair on His chest. And He has the beautiful, valuable, magnificent Kaustubha gem, the jewel, which is suspended on His neck and which is hanging on His chest. So, when He appeared, surrounding and serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana, were 16 personal attendants decorated with ornaments and appearing exactly like Him, but without the mark of Srivatsa and Kaustubha jewel. And all the devatas were so overwhelmed with happiness. Ekshana, by seeing the Lord Sarve Ahalada. They were all filled with happiness. Ahalada means they were so happy. Imagine the Lord has appeared in front of them. And what happened? They were overwhelmed. Viklavaha, overwhelmed. And so in that state of happiness and overwhelming happiness, what did they do? Dandavat Patithaha. Patithaha means they fell down and they offered dandavats to the Lord. And then they shanahi, they slowly utthaya, they slowly got up after offering dandavats and once again they started tushtuvuhu, they started offering prayers. So they offered prayers, the Lord was pleased and satisfied, Lord appeared and soon after that they offered the dandavats and again they start offering, glorifying the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana with wonderful prayers.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the Lord becomes visible through sincere chanting and extraordinary bhakti, highlighting that the entire Bhagavatam is a scripture of pure bhakti.

So here as we see this is a very momentous occasion that the Lord has appeared. It's no ordinary thing. The word used here is avihi. Avihi means he became visible. He appeared in front of them. So this morning when we were, we have those quotes of Srila Prabhupada going on in the main temple hall and there Prabhupada is also writing that if one is chanting the Hare Krishna mantra very sincerely, very attentively then the Lord will appear in front of the devotee. There are many places where Prabhupada says but that chanting has to be like the Lord appearance is no extraordinary, it's an extraordinary event. So similarly and the Lord here appeared just by offering prayers. So actually if we engage in bhakti, if we engage in our devotional service very sincerely, very seriously, it should be extraordinary bhakti. That is when the Lord will make his appearance. Prabhupada writes in this human form of life, our goal should be to see the supreme personality of Godhead face to face. So for that ordinary bhakti it's an extraordinary bhakti that and if you see the

**Summary:** The speaker uses the examples of Dhruva and Prahlad Maharaj to illustrate the power of serious devotional service, emphasizing that the Lord appears to those engaged in pure bhakti.

entire bhagavatam is actually a scripture which is talking of pure bhakti. The beginning of bhagavatam is dharma projjhita kaitavotra paramo nirmatsaraanam satam. The entire bhagavatam is a scripture dealing with pure devotional service. Dhruva, although he had a heart with, you know, he had some material desires but he took to the practice of devotional service that his spiritual master gave him very, very seriously. And just by chanting the mantra the Lord appeared in front of him. Prahlad Maharaj also was seeing when he was actually when he was asked by his father Hiranyakashipu, is the Lord there in the pillar? He said yes he is there because Prahlad was seeing. Prahlad was also doing pure devotional service. So if we are engaged in this process of bhakti very seriously then Aavihi Krishna will appear. So Prabhupada writes and in the bhagavatam also many places it is said that we should be engaged in intense devotional service. Not just devotional service. Yesterday also we were discussing about this. Ti Vrena Bhakti Yogena. It is not just Bhakti Yogena but Ti Vrena Bhakti Yogena. So here this is Ti Vrena Bhakti Yogena. This is Lord Kapila, this is the prayer of Lord Kapila, these are the teachings of Lord Kapila to his mother

Devahuthi and then here Prabhupada is translating Ti Vrena Bhakti Yogena like this Ti Vrena Bhakti Yogena Manomai Arpitam Sthiram. Therefore persons whose minds are fixed on the Lord engage in intensive practice of devotional service, that is the only means for attainment of the final perfection of life. So Kapila is talking about the final perfection in life and there is only one means to attain the final perfection so we should be actually hankering for this, I want the highest perfection and there is only one means that is Ti Vrena Bhakti Yogena, intensive practice of devotional service.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the examples of Bali Maharaj and Sudama to further illustrate intense devotional service, highlighting their selfless surrender and devotion to the Lord.

Now and if you see all the chapters, all the stories in Srimad Bhagavatam are rotating and revolving around this. Bali Maharaj also, he practiced intense devotional service because when the Lord, what was his intense devotional service that Bali Maharaj practiced when the Lord came and he knew that everything is going away from his hand and asked him now you have to give me, you have given me everything, now nothing is remaining, what will you give me? He offered himself also and very happily he offered himself. You see the intense devotional service that Bali Maharaj did and then the Lord blessed him. Bali Maharaj was not thinking okay if I give away everything the Lord will bless me so let me give away, no he did not have any of those calculations, he just gave everything to the Lord because he knows finally everything belongs to the Lord and for complete surrender to the Lord. So as I was mentioning that this is what the entire Bhagavatam is talking about. So there are some words let us go through them, few of them which explains, which defines what is intense devotional service. Intense, we have heard the story of Sudama, even Sudama's service was intense devotional service, he had so much of requirement, his wife had sent him to Lord Krishna, they had no food to eat, his children was starving, he was starving, the entire family was starving but Sudama did not ask anything to the Lord, he just went to the Lord with a very simple humble offering and we know the whole story how the Lord blessed him, he just wanted bhakti to the Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "He said I want your achala bhakti achala bhakti so this is what his ask was achala bhakti means achala means which moves which shakes achala bhakti means which is unshakable devotion"
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of the florist Sudama, who asked for achala bhakti (unshakable devotion) from Lord Krishna, emphasizing the importance of unwavering faith.

Now there is one more Sudama, he is the florist Sudama and he meets the Supreme Lord when Krishna and Balaram go to Mathura to fight Kamsa when Akrura invites him, they go to Mathura and there they meet many, many different people. So there at one point of time this florist Sudama meets Krishna and the florist welcomes him very nicely and then he asks, the florist asks, my dear Lord please tell me how will I please you, what can I do for you? And because he was a florist he offered two very beautifully woven, exquisite and very fragrant flower garlands to Lord Krishna and Krishna and Balaram. So they were very pleased, Lord Krishna was very pleased with this florist's offering, pure offering and at that time Krishna asks him ok what do you want? Actually he was a florist, you can imagine florist means a very humble person, you know he was just hardly having any possessions and what did he ask? So here it is mentioned now you have to choose what you want to ask. So what did he choose to ask? He asked achalam bhaktim tasmin. He said I want your achala bhakti. So this is what his ask was, achala bhakti means achala means which moves, which shakes, achala bhakti means which is unshakable devotion. So this should be our prayer to the Lord just like the simple ordinary man is able to make this prayer, he chose this kind of a prayer, Lord please bless me with achala bhakti, my faith, my devotion to you should never shake, I should eternally remain your servant.

### Atmarama Verse, Ahaituki Bhakti, Causeless Devotion

**Key Quote:** "What is this intense practice of devotional service it's called ahaitukim bhakti achala bhakti ahaitukim bhakti ahaitukim bhakti means causeless devotional service or unalloyed devotional service means our bhakti to the Lord should not be mixed with anything"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the concept of ahaituki bhakti (causeless or unalloyed devotion) from the Atmarama verse, emphasizing that devotion should be free from material desires or motivations.

Then so in so many places this is achala bhakti, then that famous Atmarama verse that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu also elaborated upon, Atmarama shchumunayo nirgantha apyurukrame kurvanti ahaitukim bhaktim itthambhuta gunoharihi. So here we see what kind of a bhakti we must be offering, what is this intense practice of devotional service? It's called ahaitukim bhakti, achala bhakti, ahaitukim bhakti. Ahaitukim bhakti means causeless devotional service or unalloyed devotional service means our bhakti to the Lord should not be mixed with anything, with any ask, with any demand or I should not be doing bhakti for some cause, for some material gain, my bhakti is the supreme lord, he is my supreme father, he is my supreme well wisher, whatever I possess is all coming from him just like a mother is not serving the children, mother is not serving the family with the hope of getting something, she only wants one thing, what is that? Pure love. Similarly here it says that Atmarama means even those exalted souls, pure devotees, they are not ordinary souls, ahaitukim bhakti, unalloyed devotion like Prabhupada writes alloy means it's a mixture of two metals so unalloyed devotion means devotion without the mixture of any frutive desire without asking anything from the Lord our bhakti should be towards the Lord like that.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Prahlad Maharaj's teachings on amalaya bhakti (spotless devotional service) to his demoniac friends, emphasizing that the Lord is pleased only by unflinching, unalloyed devotion.

Then Prahlad is teaching to his friends, you may think that Atmaramas are doing ahaitukim bhakti, they are all very exalted souls and at that level this ahaitukim bhakti is possible but here we see a small boy Prahlad, he is teaching to his friends who are also small children of his age 5 years and they are not even devotees, they are just, they are children belonging to demon families so they are nowhere in devotional service and small children to them Prahlad is teaching what kind of bhakti you should perform, he is saying you all should perform amalaya bhaktia, amalaya bhakti. See the teachings of the Bhagavatam even a small child teaching to small children pure devotional service, he is not just teaching bhakti he is teaching amalaya bhakti and Prabhupada translates this amalaya bhakti as spotless devotional service. So he is telling my dear friends oh son of the demons you cannot please the supreme personality of godhead by becoming perfect brahmanas, demigods or great saints or by becoming perfectly good in etiquette or vast learning you cannot please the lord by all these things none of these qualifications can awaken the pleasure of the lord nor by charity, austerity, sacrifice, cleanliness or vows can one satisfy the lord, the lord is pleased only by amalaya bhakti by unflinching unalloyed devotion to him this is what he is teaching.

**Summary:** The speaker returns to Lord Kapila's teachings, introducing ananya bhakti (unflinching devotional service) and explaining that those who worship the Lord without material aspirations are taken beyond birth and death.

amalaya bhakti and then so achalam bhaktim these are what the bhagavatam is all talking about achalam bhaktim ahetukim bhaktim amalaya bhakti and then yet in another place this is teachings of lord kapila so you see at all levels the same teaching is being given so in the teachings of lord kapila to his mother devahuti he is also saying something similar to mother devahuti and to everyone bhajanti ananyaya bhaktia ananyaya bhaktia means ananya means no with something else ananya means unflinching without the mixture of anything else ananyaya bhaktia so here thus the devotees who worship me the all pervading lord of the universe in unflinching devotional service gives up all aspirations to be promoted to the heavenly planets or to become happy in this world with wealth children cattle home or anything in relationship with the body i take him to the other side of birth and death so actually we all know goal of life is to get go back to the spiritual world go back to the vaikuntha loka where there is no birth no death so this is the qualification needed it is not just bhakti that will take us there yes bhakti will eventually take us but eventually we have to get into this ananya bhakti he says devotees who worship in unflinching devotional service giving up all aspirations to be promoted to heavenly planet or to become happy in this world with wealth with children with cattle with home i then i take them to the other side of birth and death.

In the first song that Prabhupada writes, Krishnatava Punya Habebhai, that song if you remember, in that it's a prayer to the lotus feet of Krishna. In that the first verse, Prabhupada is first starting the prayer with an offering to Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur and there he writes in that verse, So now basically the question is that if you want Achala Bhakti, you know, Ahaituki Bhakti and Ananya Bhakti and all these different unshakable, immovable, unalloyed, unflinching devotional service, from where are we going to get it? It is your spiritual master who possesses it and it's your spiritual master who will give it to you. And Prabhupada is writing this in this prayer.

Look at the confidence, the conviction that Prabhupada carried with him. Prabhupada says, I have only, people call me that I have become very successful, there is no credit to myself. Yes there is only one thing that if there is any credit to me. And that? That if there is any credit for myself, that is I followed the instructions of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur as it is and I believed in his words. I simply believed in the words of my spiritual master. So just like Prabhupada simply believed in the words of the spiritual master, we must also actually believe in the words of Srila Prabhupada. So Prabhupada writes, now we are talking of seeing the Lord, like the demigods are seeing Aavihi, the Supreme Lord has appeared. So how do we see the Lord? One should not artificially try to see the form of the Lord while chanting Hare Krishna. But when the chanting is performed offenselessly, the Lord will automatically reveal himself to the view of the chanter. The chanter therefore has to concentrate on hearing the vibration. And without extra endeavour on his part, the Lord will automatically appear. You see, the Lord will appear automatically without any extra endeavour, if we simply concentrate on hearing. And he says automatically appear and the Lord will automatically reveal. This is what we are talking about.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The duration of life is immaterial, but the duty of a dying man is very important."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces Maharaj Pariksit's two questions about duty in life and at the time of death, explaining their significance and how the Srimad Bhagavatam addresses them, emphasizing devotional service as the ultimate duty.

Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, first canto, 19th chapter, 24th verse, appearance of Shukadev Goswami. Translation, O trustworthy brahmanas, I now ask you about my immediate duty. Please, after proper deliberation, tell me of the unalloyed duty of everyone in all circumstances and specifically of those who are just about to die. Purport, in this verse, the king has placed two questions before the learned sages. The first question is, what is the duty of everyone in all circumstances? And the second question is, what is the specific duty of one who is to die very shortly? Out of the two, the question relating to the dying man is most important, because everyone is a dying man, either very shortly or after 100 years. The duration of life is immaterial, but the duty of a dying man is very important. Maharaj Pariksit placed these two questions before Shukadev Goswami also on his arrival. And practically the whole of Srimad Bhagavatam, beginning from the second canto up to the last 12th canto, deals with these two questions. The conclusion arrived at thereof is that, devotional service of Lord Srikrishna, as it is confirmed by Lord himself in the last phases of the Bhagavad Gita, is the last word in relation to everyone's permanent duty in life. Maharaj Pariksit was already aware of this fact, but he wanted the great sages assembled there to unanimously give their verdict on his conviction, so that he might be able to go on with his confirmed duty without controversy.

**Key Quote:** "The first class method demands that one give up all other methods and surrender unto the lotus feet of Lord and thus be saved from all sins and their reactions."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the importance of asking the right questions and highlights the significance of surrendering to the Lord as the ultimate path to self-realization, emphasizing that the entire Srimad Bhagavatam is based on these two questions.

He has specifically mentioned the word Shuddha or perfectly correct. For transcendental realization or self-realization, many processes are recommended by various classes of philosophers. Some of them are first class methods and some of them are second or third class methods. The first class method demands that one give up all other methods and surrender unto the lotus feet of Lord and thus be saved from all sins and their reactions. So in this verse, Parikshit Maharaj is asking something very important to all the sages who have assembled there in the forest of Naimisharanya. He has just been cursed by the son of the Rishi, Sringi, that boy. And the curse is that he is supposed to die in seven days. He receives a death notice, something very unique, Prabhupada writes. And he is asking two very, very important questions. Prabhupada writes that the quality of question itself is so wonderful. Just the question itself is so wonderful. What are the two questions he is asking? Number one, what is the ultimate duty, the unalloyed duty of everyone in all circumstances? Not just what is my duty, his duty. Everyone's duty, unalloyed duty, the highest duty in all circumstances. It's like everything is covered in this. And then the second question that he is asking is, and the duty of someone who is about to die immediately. These are the two questions and Prabhupada writes in the purport, the entire Srimad Bhagavatam is based out of these two questions. Right from the second canto, this is the 19th chapter of the first canto. The first canto is ending now. And now the second canto to 12th canto is all based on these two questions.

**Key Quote:** "Everyone is a dying man."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the unpredictable nature of death through the story of his neighbor who died unexpectedly, highlighting the urgency of fulfilling one's duty in life.

So Prabhupada writes, Who is not a dying man? Everyone is a dying man. We cannot say, generally people think dying means old age. But no, we cannot be so sure when death will come. Death may come any moment. There is no guarantee. And in that way, Prabhupada says, everyone is a dying man. There was one of my neighbors, we stayed in Calcutta for about 20 years. And one Mr. Mittal Ji, we shared the same floor. We were next door neighbors. We used to spend time there. They used to spend time there. I knew them very well. So just not long time ago, but very recently I got a news about him that he passed away. It was very shocking how he passed away. He was a very hale and healthy man, very nice person, very gentle. And he had built a new house and he was supposed to be doing Griha Pravesha. There was so much of excitement and happiness in the entire family. He has three children and the pujas were supposed to begin. And he was supposed to go, the Pandit Ji told him that can you please go and bring some puja items for the puja. Something was missing or something like that. So he went to bring some puja items from the market and then family members are waiting for him to come back. And he is not returning. And then after a while it was a matter of concern what happened. And then somehow they got a call after some time that he is, who is this and he is your father and he is on the road and please come. He looks like something has happened. Please come and they were all shocked and they rushed to the place from where the call came. And what had happened actually, he was carrying the puja items or something like that. He was walking and he was going and one vehicle came and hit him. It was not a very big hit, it was a small hit. And he fell down, the way he fell down something on his brain got hurt. And he was rushed to the hospital. And the doctor says 24 hours is very critical. We cannot say anything like that. But as Krishna had desired after 24 hours he passed away. This news came as a big shock. Imagine the excitement, griha pravesha, new house, new apartment. And this is what happened and nobody had any idea about it.

**Key Quote:** "Every moment we must remind ourselves that we have a very important duty. And I must complete that duty before I die."
**Summary:** The speaker shares a near-death experience and emphasizes the importance of taking devotional service seriously and becoming Krishna conscious quickly, as it is the ultimate duty.

So every moment we must remind ourselves that we have a very important duty. And I must complete that duty before I die. Just yesterday it happened. We were all travelling to Haridas Thakur's birthplace and we were in the first vehicle. Ten of us were there. And just we were driving, the driver was driving, it was at a medium speed. And just about 15-20 meters ahead of us one big tree branch just fell on the road. It was like first time live we saw it. It got captured on the video. And it was a fraction of 3-4 seconds. If we were 3-4 seconds ahead. It was a huge one. It occupied the entire expanse of the road. It just fell. It was some old tree or something like that. And see how Krishna saved us. So this verse is actually talking about how seriously we must take to devotional service. What is the unalloyed duty of everyone in all circumstances. The question itself is so serious. I must become Krishna conscious very soon, very quickly. Because unless and until you become perfectly Krishna conscious, we have not actually done our duty.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "But one must be very serious and sincere."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of humility and sincerity in prayer and devotional service, emphasizing that Krishna will purify and deliver those who are serious and sincere.

We chant that verse, Shri Krishna Chaitanya Prabhu doya koro more. Toma bina ke dayalu jagata samsare. And what is the second verse? Shri Krishna Chaitanya Prabhu doya koro more. And what is the second line? Patita pavan hetu tavey avataar. Mosama patita Prabhu na paiy beyaar. So we sing this every day. And then we say, we offer a prayer to Krishna, that Krishna, I am the most fallen. And since I am the most fallen, my claim is first on being delivered. Please claim me. I am the most fitting candidate for being delivered. And then your name as Patita, your name as Patita Pavana will be truly glorified. We pray like that. Prabhupada in one place writes something more than this. Yes, we can pray. Definitely we should pray that I am the most fallen so my claim is first. But then in what should be a mood and what should be a consciousness of praying and a practice of devotional service. So Prabhupada quotes these two lines and then soon after that he writes, But one must be very serious and sincere. It is not that yes, it is good to pray that I am the most fallen and so please deliver me first. But we should be very sincere, very serious and then Krishna will deliver us from, He will purify us from all contamination surely and certainly. So actually if we read Srila Prabhupada's books, we will get this sense. This sense should be absorbed from Srila Prabhupada. Prabhupada's life itself, he is a living example of how serious and sincere he was. Writing books, midnight, 12 o'clock, getting up at 4 o'clock. You see the seriousness and how serious Prabhupada was in spreading Krishna consciousness. With just 40 rupees, he is trying, he is struggling, he is endeavouring. And all over his lectures, all over his books, He gives this impression to us that we must be very serious and sincere.

**Summary:** The speaker stresses the importance of intensive devotional service as the only means to achieve final perfection in Krishna consciousness, emphasizing the need to be 100% Krishna conscious to return to Godhead.

There is one, recently I read one line. So just to give you a sense of how Prabhupada through his teachings is talking, stressing about seriousness and sincerity. So this is one line which talks and like this you can find innumerable lines. We practice devotional service as practice of devotional service is the means to attain perfection. So there are three words here. Practice of devotional service is the means to attain perfection. Now for each of these three words, one more word has been added. We must practice intensive devotional service, not just devotional service. And intensive devotional service is the only means to attain final perfection in Krishna consciousness. So look at the word. Intensive devotional service is the only means for final perfection of Krishna consciousness. So we all have to go for the final perfection. Even if we are 99.9% Krishna conscious, there is no going back to Godhead. We have to be 100% Krishna conscious.

And that is why, the reply to these two questions. What is the answer that Shukadev Goswami is giving? Tasmad ekina manasa. Tasmad. Okay, there are many verses. But yeah, this is exactly. There are.

And one more place. So this is one verse where he is talking about. Tasmad Bharata Sarvatma. Bhagwan Ishwaro Harihi. Sarvatma. Everyone. Bhagwan Ishwaro Harihi. And what they should do? Hear, chant, remember, worship. And in another place Shukadev Goswami is saying. Tasmad ekina manasa. Bhagwan Satvatam Patihi. Shotavya. Kirti Tavyasya. Gheya. Pujas. Cha. Nityadhar. Ekina manasa. Ekina manasa means with one pointed attention. Another way. A perfect reply for a perfect question. One should, Shotavya, Kirti Tavyasya, hear, chant, Gheya, remember, Pujas, worship, Cha, Nityadhar, Nityadhar means constantly. So devotees should actually reflect on all these things, that am I doing my devotional service with this intensity, with this force. In another place Prabhupada is right. We should not be doing devotional service casually, but we should be doing devotional service seriously, constantly. So this Govarmandal Parikshan, Parikrama that we are all out, it's an opportunity for us during these 20 days to actually engage in this intensive practice of devotional service, because Ekina manasa. It is very, it is sometimes, because we are not, we are still conditioned. We are not on that stage where we can practice this 24 hours. But at least these 20 days that we have, we should take this opportunity, remember these instructions and make the best use of this opportunity that is there. I must at least for these days, Shotavya, Kirti Tavya, Shadheyya, Poojas, Cha Nityada, Ekina Manasa. All these things can be practiced.

We need to keep, we must keep reminding ourselves of these instructions and pray to Srila Prabhupada, that Srila Prabhupada please help me. I wish to do. So before we get into this mood, first a desire should be there and a prayer, a heartfelt prayer should be there, that yes Prabhupada I want to do like this. I am unable to do like this and please help me. And so when Prabhupada sees that a devotee is very sincere and very eager in becoming like that, we will be blessed with this opportunity. So like yesterday we were there in such a wonderful place, Haridas Thakur Samadhi and sorry, Bhajan Kotir and the appearance place. And we saw that tree also. It was so much different. So it all, all these, this is a very one, I am realizing now after coming here. You know that what a wonderful, we have read. So all these pastimes in CC and different places of Prabhupada. But when you come here and you be in that place, I am sure all of you have this experience. Some of you shared also. It is so much different from just reading. It is giving us, this intensive practice of devotional service actually comes so easily. So we should be grateful to Prabhupada, be grateful to all the devotees who have you know organized this, because so nicely it is coming, so easily it is coming.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "You should be possessing one lakh holy names every day."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates a pastime of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, explaining how He defined 'Lakshishwar' not as a millionaire, but as one who chants one lakh holy names every day, emphasizing the importance of chanting.

And it's a, so yesterday we read that story of Hira Devi, right? Hira Devi, Lakshah, Lakshah, Lakshah, Lakshah. No, she was Hira Devi, Hira Bai. Hira Bai. Hira Bai she was. Later she became Lakshahira. A small pastime which I heard something about Lakshahira. So Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, he would, devotees would invite Chaitanya Mahaprabhu for the, for lunch. That was a, that was a system, that 12 o'clock, the noon time lunch, Mahaprabhu would take in the house of devotees. And all the devotees, he was very eager to host Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to, because that was a devotional service and they wanted to do that. And Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, he realized that he is receiving too many invitations. So every day you can accept only one invitation. But there were so many devotees of Lord Chaitanya that every day he was receiving 3 to 4 invitations. So Mahaprabhu had to devise a method by which, you know, it is reduced to just one invitation. So he says from today I am going to accept invitations from only those devotees who are Lakshishwar. Lakshishwar. Lakshishwar means, it is something synonymous to, in Calcutta, Lakpati. Lakpati. It was a very well known term. This is about 30 years back. Lakpati means, now a days it is all crorepati. Lakpati is gone. Millionaire. So, Lakpati means, you possess a lakh of rupees. You can imagine what a Laksh, Lakpati would be during Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's time. But there were, Hiranya and Gordhan Majundar were there like that. So, so, Mahaprabhu says, from today I am going to accept invitations only from these people. So everybody thought, oh my god, Lakpati. None of them were Lakpati. They were all very simple devotees. Kola, Vicha, Shridhara, you know what he was. So they thought that, okay, from today then we can't host Mahaprabhu because that is the condition that he has placed. And then Mahaprabhu said something. He was actually basically trying to impress upon, stress upon, intensive devotional service. He said, no, Lakshishwar means, Ishwar means a lord of one lakh, not one lakh rupees. You should be possessing, not one lakh rupees, you should be possessing one lakh holy names every day.

### chanting, devotional service, duty

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Except chanting, a person has no other duty."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of chanting, highlighting that it is the only duty in this human form of life, and mentions Srila Prabhupada's instruction to chant 16 rounds minimum.

So, and this is what Gaudiya Math was actually. They were chanting one lakh holy names every day, 64 rounds. And actually if you see, Srila Prabhupada also in the initial days, he told, you chant 64 rounds. And that is why our rule is, 16 rounds minimum. That word minimum is there. So all these things, when you read and hear, it is actually stressing on this word, intensive practice of devotional service. And this is our duty, only duty, for everyone, in all circumstances. In one place Srila Prabhupada is saying, directly is pointing out, except chanting, a person has no other duty. Except chanting, there is no other duty in this holy, in this human form of life. So basically all these things, you know, it is stressing. So at least 16 rounds, yes finally we have 16 rounds with us and we should stick to 16 rounds and engage ourselves in devotional service, because that is what finally Prabhupada gave us. But these 16 rounds must be of good quality. And if you, in 1976, there are many letters that Srila Prabhupada, Prabhupada keeps writing so many letters to different devotees. If you search the Veda base, in 1976, it is 76 or 75, one of these years, Prabhupada is writing to disciples, that please chant 16 good rounds. And if you search on this, 16 good, he is not saying please chant 16 rounds. He is stressing something, chant 16 good rounds.

### chanting, good rounds, devotional service
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/3CpLo1CgMbM?t=1231

**Content Type:** practical
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Please chant 16 good rounds."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of chanting 16 good rounds, citing Srila Prabhupada's letters and a devotee's explanation that chanting all rounds in one go constitutes good rounds.

So we should ask ourselves, am I chanting good rounds? And he doesn't write this to one disciple. In one year, he writes about 16 letters. In all the 16 letters, this line is repeating, please chant 16 good rounds. So our prayers to Srila Prabhupada and this should be a prayer to all the Leelas Thalis that we visit today, that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, today we are going to Roop Sanatan, place where they did their bhajana. Let us offer this prayer. I am sure all of you are offering, that please help me in doing, you know, chanting good rounds and doing intensive practice of devotion service, so that we become more serious and become perfect before we meet our last days. Thank you. Anybody wishes to say something on the 16 rounds, good rounds. Srila Prabhupada said that 16 rounds good rounds means you chant them all in one go. Ok very good. You chant them all in one go, because that is good rounds. Ok. If you chant, if you chant the rounds, here one here two there three there, by the time it is evening, you just want to chew them up. If we can chant all rounds, all together 16 rounds, the whole day will be a complete different day. I have also realized this and I am sure many devotees would have also realized this. All in one go and that is really, that is a good definition of 16 good rounds. . . . .

## True Meaning of Tapasya | Sri Vasudev Keshav Dasa | ISKCON Bangalore Sanga
**Speaker:** HG Vasudev Keshav Dasa

### austerity, devotional service, Krishna consciousness
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/LRvhg77DyQ4?t=0

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "All our austerities are actually centered around devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that true austerity (Tapasya) is centered around devotional service to Krishna, not material gains, and that even traditional Vratas are only beneficial on a material plane unless connected to Krishna consciousness.

Vrishabhadeva said to his sons that, "Tapo Divyam Putraka Yena Satvam Shuddhe." Heart will become cleansed by practicing austerities. And we have some very simple austerities to practice: rising early in the morning, chanting 16 rounds, taking morning bath. All our austerities are actually centered around devotional service. The goal of austerity is service to Krishna, not to attain some power or some material opulence. Tapasa, you are doing Tapasya. If you are doing worship of Krishna, that is the highest Tapasya. There is no need of any other higher Tapasya. And if you are not engaged in devotional service, then all of you will be in trouble. Any other so-called Tapasya we may be doing, like sometimes some people say, "I am doing this Vrata, I am doing that Vrata, I am doing Somvar Vrata," or I am... All that is good, but it is only at a material plane. We follow Ekadashi to please Krishna. That's why if you see, all the Tapasyas and Krishna consciousness in our life...
