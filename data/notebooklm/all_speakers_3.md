**Key Quote:** "Vidura has come to instruct Dhritharashtra, to save him from missing the opportunity for self-realization in his human form of life."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the purpose of Vidura's visit to Dhritharashtra, which is to instruct him on self-realization and prevent him from wasting his life.

So, meaning of this verse is: Having won his kingdom and observed the birth of one grandson competent to continue the noble tradition of his family, Maharaj Yudhishthira reigned peacefully and enjoyed uncommon opulence in cooperation with his younger brothers who were all expert administrators to the common people. So this verse is describing what is Yudhishthira's position when Vidura is visiting Yudhishthira. Vidura's purpose is not to enjoy any nice hospitality. Rather, he has come to instruct Dhritharashtra, to rescue Dhritharashtra from his so-called comfortable living towards the end of his life. Instead of preparing for putting the body through self-realization, Dhritharashtra is completely neglectful of his spiritual responsibility. So Vidura has come to instruct Dhritharashtra.

**Key Quote:** "Yudhishthira was very peacefully ruling, waiting for his grandson to grow up and take charge."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Yudhishthira's peaceful reign and his anticipation for his grandson Parikshit to become a competent successor.

So what about Yudhishthira? So that is being explained by Prabhupada in this purport. Yudhishthira was, the verse says, ruling very nicely, assisted by his younger brothers who were all expert administrators. And he had a competent grandson because as soon as Parikeet was born, the learned astrologist told he is a competent successor for Yudhishthira. When he grows up, he will have excellent qualities. So Yudhishthira was very peacefully ruling, waiting for his grandson to grow up and take charge. Till then Yudhishthira was accepting to rule the whole world.

**Key Quote:** "Even though they were unwilling to kill their own men in the fight, it had to be done as a matter of duty."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Yudhishthira and Arjuna were unhappy about the Kurukshetra war but fought due to duty and Krishna's will, as Krishna wanted a devotee to rule the kingdom.

Now Srila Prabhupada says something important about Yudhishthira, that both Maharaj Yudhishthira and Arjuna were unhappy from the beginning of the battle of Kurukshetra. Why were they unhappy? They were not very comfortable fighting against their own kinsmen, simply for the sake of getting their share of the kingdom to rule. Duryodhana cleverly cheated the Pandavas and sent them away for exile, 13 years. So even after the term of exile is over, Duryodhana refused to give back the share of the kingdom. So then Kshatriya code of conduct is, if a Kshatriya challenges, then another Kshatriya cannot refuse the challenge. So Yudhishthira could not refuse the challenge offered by Duryodhana. So Yudhishthira had to engage in fighting the battle of Kurukshetra because Duryodhana challenged. So even Arjuna, even though he was very very powerful, even Yudhishthira was very powerful and strong and not afraid of fighting, but he did not like to fight for the sake of gaining some kingdom, because by and heart he is a pure devotee. Both Yudhishthira and Arjuna are pure devotees. Therefore it is described by Prabhupada here that they were unhappy from the beginning. Even though they were unwilling to kill their own men in the fight, it had to be done as a matter of duty. Why? Because it was planned by the supreme will of Lord Krishna that somebody like Yudhishthira should rule the kingdom and not be corrupt, non-devotional Duryodhana.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna wants the world to be ruled by his representative who is a devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of a ruler being spiritually competent to guide citizens in Krishna consciousness and prepare them to return to Godhead.

Krishna wants the world to be ruled by his representative who is a devotee. Such a devotee is the perfect person to rule because people have to not only be taken care of in terms of their material necessities, but they should also be directed and protected for practicing spiritual life to make their human form of life successful by preparing themselves to go back to Godhead. So that's why it is so important that the ruler not only be competent in terms of material qualifications to rule the kingdom, but also be spiritually competent to guide the citizens how they can side by side, apart from doing their material duties, also practice Krishna consciousness

**Key Quote:** "The only remaining hope was a child in the womb... and that child in the womb was attacked by Ashwatthama."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna wanted Yudhishthira to rule, and describes the aftermath of the war, the lack of descendants, and the attack on Parikshit in the womb, who was saved by Krishna.

to actually prepare themselves for going back to Godhead. So, because Krishna wanted Yudhishthira to go home and Duryodhana was not a devotee, so he was not giving any spiritual guidance to the people. He himself was not a devotee. So where would he give guidance to others to become devotees? So that is the reason Krishna wanted it, therefore as a duty they had to fight in the battle. After the battle, Maharaj Yudhishthira was unhappy over such mass killings. Huge massacre happened. It was a world war. So in that world war so many people died. Practically there was none to continue the Kuru dynasty after them, the Pandavas. Pandavas took charge of ruling. But there were no descendants in the Kuru dynasty. The only remaining hope was a child in the womb of Yudhishthira's daughter, Lavuktha Rao. And that child in the womb was attacked by Ashwatthama. Even the child in the womb was attacked by Ashwatthama. The last surviving descendant of the entire Kuru dynasty was attacked by Ashwatthama. But by the grace of the Supreme Lord Krishna the child was saved in the womb of the mother. The child was saved by Krishna. This has already been explained in an earlier chapter.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Yudhishthira felt some relief as a human being."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Yudhishthira's relief after the establishment of peace and the survival of Parikshit, despite his lack of attraction to material happiness.

So after the settlement of all disturbing conditions and re-establishment of the peaceful order of the state and after seeing the surviving child Pariksha well satisfied Maharaj Yudhishthira felt some relief as a human being. After the massacre Yudhishthira was very disturbed. But he was instructed by Bhishma that he has to do his duty and not become afflicted by his sorrow over the big killing that has happened in the battle. So he was pacified by Bhishma. Yudhishthira was pacified by Bhishma. And he was even more happy rather even more peaceful when this Pariksha was saved and Pariksha took birth as a competent descendant to ascend the throne after Yudhishthira Maharaj. So things were settled and he felt some relief as a human being, although he had very little attraction for material happiness

which is always illusory and temporary. See Prabhupada is mentioning a very important point that material happiness which can be had by having a nice kingdom growing peacefully, having a competent successor, and having very able administrators as younger brothers, younger brothers as administrators. In spite of all this Yudhishthira as a pure devotee had no attraction for material happiness. Why? Because as Prabhupada says here, material happiness is always illusory and temporary.

**Key Quote:** "What we think as a source of happiness is actually a disguised source of misery in the future."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that material happiness is based on sense contact and is ultimately a source of misery, quoting the Bhagavad Gita.

Two characters only. Illusory because material happiness is the happiness due to sense contact. And what is the description of material happiness due to sense contact? In the Bhagavad Gita Krishna says in the fifth chapter: yehi samsparsha ja bhoga dukha yonaya evade aadyantamant kaunteya na teshu ramate buddhah. Intelligent people who are totally enlightened do not take pleasure in happiness arising from sense contact because they know all such happiness is simply a temporary sensation due to the sense contact and it is always a source of misery in the material world. So what we think as a source of happiness is actually a disguised source of misery

**Key Quote:** "It is promising to give us great amount of happiness but that is just a false promise."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of cold water in winter and summer to illustrate how our perception of happiness and distress is based on favorable or unfavorable sense contact.

in the future. All material happiness is like this. It is promising to give us great amount of happiness but that is just a false promise. It is due to illusion. Due to illusion we consider some type of sense contact as favourable and another type of sense contact as unfavourable. So when the sense contact is favourable we think it is happiness. And when the same sense contact is unfavourable we think it is distress. Prabhupada gives a simple example to help us understand. It is like cold water. In winter in the severe cold cold water is very unpleasant very harsh for the sense of touch. The same cold water at the same temperature in summer it is very very pleasing for the sense of touch. In fact we like to take a cold water bath in summer and it is very hot outside. So it is just the contact which is due to some particular situation or condition it is either interpreted as happiness or distress based on whether it is favourable contact or unfavourable contact. This is the nature of

**Key Quote:** "Reality is it is illusion."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that material happiness is a concoction of the mind based on likes and dislikes, and that both happiness and distress are ultimately illusions.

all kinds of sense contact. We have five primary senses, external senses: the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, sense of touch, skin, and we have one sense within the mind. Now including the mind with these six senses we are trying to enjoy happiness, material happiness of this world. But our only avenue for material happiness through these senses is sense contact. And that sense contact simply is a concoction in our mind and we are trying to enjoy something that is not so nice or something that is painful or something that is pleasurable. Just like another example, if you are given some edible which you like to eat you will think oh it is so nice I am having this for eating because you like the taste, the contact of that edible with your sense of taste, oh so nice. The same thing for somebody else who does not like it. They when they look at it oh I don't like it I don't want it. So even if it is edible even if it is to the liking of somebody some other person for me it is not likeable so I don't consider it as a pleasurable experience to eat such an edible. So the same thing according to our concoction of likes and dislikes we are born into this material world with certain set of likes and dislikes, material likes and material dislikes and exactly according to these likes and dislikes we consider something as pleasurable and something as not pleasurable. So this is the basis of all material happiness and distress. So neither happiness nor distress is actually the reality. Reality is it is illusion. It is illusion. But we in ignorance we seek after material happiness and try to avoid material distress. And we are always in this way under illusion.

**Key Quote:** "These are some of the thoughts which engross the insanely attached householder who is blind to the passing of eternal time."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains the meaning of Srimad Bhagavatam 1.13.17, focusing on how attachment to family and material pursuits leads to wasting valuable time and spiritual ignorance, contrasting this with the perspective of spiritually advanced individuals.

In this session we will be discussing from the 17th verse of 13th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. अनेशु सक्तानाम् प्रमत्तानाम् तदीहया अत्यक्रावण अविध्यातः कालपरमदुस्तरहाँ. The meaning of this verse is, insurmountable eternal time imperceptibly overcomes those who are too much attached to family affairs and are always engrossed in their thought. So this is Sotu Goswami narrating to the sages of Maimishananya. The reality about the time being wasted by Dhritarashtra, even though he is very nicely taken care of by Yudhishthira, he is spending his last few days without utilising it properly for eternal benefit. So that is going to be explained on top of that. And that is the statement made by Sotu Goswami. What is that? Insurmountable eternal time. Time is eternal. But it is continuously passing, passing, passing, passing, passing. And nobody can overcome it. The effect of time, the influence of time, nobody can overcome it. No materialist can overcome it. So imperceptibly this time overtakes us. And particularly those who are too much attached to family affairs and engrossed in thought of the family, its well-being, and children and the bonding of affection between the different family members, like that time just passes away. And human form of life is wasted without any eternal benefit. So that is going to be explained on top of that. So Srila Prabhupada says, "I am now happy. I have everything in order. My bank balance is quiet enough. I can now give my children their first aid. I am now successful. The poor beggar sannyasis depend on God. But they come to me for begging from me. Therefore I am more than the Supreme Father." The Prabhupada says, "These are some of the thoughts which engross the insanely attached householder who is blind to the passing of eternal time." What Suta Goswami stated, Srila Prabhupada explaining, by going into a little more detail, what is the kind of thinking of people who are spiritually ignorant, having got the evil form of life. They are always after material achievements, material happiness, material relationships, material prosperity. Almost to the extent that they completely neglect spiritual life. So what is their thinking? They are thinking that actually they are happy. Because presently their health is good. Presently everything is going on okay. Materially everything is going on okay. They have enough money. They have nice children. Or they have enough to give their children their children inheritance. They have saved enough. And they consider themselves successful because they successfully managed to get a good job or a business. And they have earned enough money. So they also consider the spiritual, especially the sannyasis more renounced. And therefore they don't, they don't have money with them. So they are renounced. And they depend upon Krishna. And in all humility they go and beg from householders to get some bhiksha, some little food for their basic needs and sustenance. So these householders who are foolish, medievalists and a very attached to family, they think these sannyasis, they are just beggars. And they say they depend on God but actually they are depending on a person like me. And if I give some, some small donation then they can, they can maintain themselves. Otherwise not even that. So this is the total misunderstanding of these so called successful people, materialistic people.

**Key Quote:** "Every second of human life is meant for making an ultimate solution to the problems of life."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of utilizing every moment of human life for spiritual advancement, highlighting the problems of birth, death, disease, and old age inherent in the material body and the opportunity to transcend them through spiritual practice.

So Prabhupada explains, our duration of life is measured and no one is able to enhance it even by one second against the scheduled time ordained by the supreme will. So we got a fixed duration of time in this body. Such valuable time especially for the human being should be spent very carefully, cautiously. Because even a second passed imperceptibly cannot be replaced in exchange for thousands and millions of gold coins amassed by hard labour. Supposing I lose time, I cannot regain that lost time by any means. It is lost forever. So, why is Prabhupada telling this? Every second of human life is meant for making an ultimate solution to the problems of life. The fundamental problems of life, which we cannot solve except by spiritual method. If we don't make a solution then we have the opportunity for spiritual practice in the human form of life. Then we simply are going to repeat the cycle of birth and death. And when repeating the cycle of birth and death, we may take birth in lower species. And in the lower species if we take birth, there is no opportunity for somebody in the lower species, a soul in the lower species, to inquire about spiritual life, to take up the practice of spiritual life in lower life forms. It is not possible, generally. So, they are losing the birth and death opportunity for eternal life full of bliss and knowledge by not practicing spiritual life. They spend away all their time in material pursuits. And time lost is lost forever. So, the ignorant people, spiritually ignorant people, they don't understand a fundamental fact about this material body. What is that? This material body subject to birth, death, disease, old age. And these four fundamental problems in the material body are the cause of all sufferings of the living being. Otherwise, the living being himself is eternal and never born, never dies, never has to face old age or disease in this spiritual body, in this spiritual form. Never has to face. So, foolish people forget this that I have got a material body. It is simply the source of all miseries. But I am not meant for this material body. In my original position as a transcendentalist, I am entitled to eternal life full of bliss and knowledge, without any of the miseries, without birth or death or disease or old age or any of the miseries.

**Key Quote:** "Such illusion cannot affect a person who is engaged in pure devotional service."
**Summary:** The lecture explains how illusion affects those engrossed in temporary family affairs, contrasting this with the detachment of devotees like Yudhishthira Maharaj, who are focused on eternal spiritual happiness through devotional service, and applying this to the example of Dhritarashtra.

And even if some people take note of these problems, miseries which crop up from time to time, they do not know how to solve these miseries in such a way that we come out of the miseries entirely, that they do not know. They become engrossed in the temporary family affairs not knowing that they are losing valuable time in human form of life. So, this is called illusion. This is called illusion. More. Such illusion cannot affect a person who is engaged in pure devotional service. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj and the Pandavas they were all engaged in service of Lord Krishna. So, they had very little attraction for illusory happiness because they know what is the value of this illusory happiness. You know, it is worthless. And they also know they have to prepare for eternal life by practicing devotional service. So, they were engaged in Krishna consciousness. And therefore, they were always attracted to spiritual perfection, achieving spiritual perfection at the end of life by practicing spirituality now in the human form when we got an opportunity. So, Maharaj Yudhishthira was always fixed in the service of Lord Mukunda or Krishna. And therefore, there was no point in seeking the happiness of life as it was in the kingdom of heaven and what to speak of the happiness available on the earth because he knows all these are illusory, all these are temporal. So, therefore, happiness, being attached to family life, they do not realize that insurmountable eternal time is overtaking them and they are losing valuable time, wasting it in some material pursuits. So they don't realize this doesn't apply to Yudhishthira Maharaj, it doesn't apply to Pandavas, it doesn't apply to devotees, it applies to Dhritarashtra who was actually out of attachment for his body, for his wife, for the comforts, material comforts that

**Key Quote:** "One who is factually learned, he knows that material happiness is not important, it's not worthwhile."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating the importance of spiritual enlightenment and detachment from material happiness, emphasizing that true happiness lies in devotional service and that Vidura's instructions were aimed at helping Dhritarashtra overcome his illusion and attachment.

Yudhishthira was offering as a courtesy. He was lost in that and he was completely lost in neglecting spiritual life. So this verse is applicable to Dhritarashtra and Vidura had come exactly to shake up Dhritarashtra out of the ignorance and to instruct him how he can save himself before that comes. So Srila Prabhupada says that one who is factually learned, he knows that material happiness is not important, it's not worthwhile. There is something called Brahma Sukha or absolute happiness, spiritual happiness. That Brahma Sukha or spiritual happiness is eternal and it is always unconditionally experienced by those engaged in devotional service. So such devotees, they have no attraction for any material, including material happiness or material comforts. So Maharaj Yudhishthira actually was a true devotee of Yudhishthira. He was a true devotee of Yudhishthira. He was spiritual, enlightened, was spiritually alert. But Dhritarashtra was not. So it was actually for the sake of Dhritarashtra that Vidura had come to enlightened Dhritarashtra and that is why we will hear how Dhritarashtra strongly instructs Dhritarashtra to come out

**Summary:** Vidura visits Dhritarashtra to instruct him on his neglected spiritual duty, as Dhritarashtra is engrossed in material concerns.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 18th verse of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The meaning of this verse is, Mahatma Vidura knew all this, and therefore he addressed Dhritarashtra saying, 'My dear king, please get out of here immediately, do not delay, just see how fear has overtaken you.' So the purpose for Mahatma Vidura to visit the palace of Hastinapura was to actually instruct Dhritarashtra about his prime duty, spiritual duty, which he had completely neglected. He was engrossed in securing his bodily comforts, ensuring that his sons will inherit the kingdom against their rightful claim, etc. So now Vidura has come specifically to instruct Dhritarashtra, and now he is addressing Dhritarashtra.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "In a sense, those who are spiritually inclined and are spiritually engaged in spiritual activities, they don't require the kind of alertness that Vidura is trying to bring in by his strong words."
**Summary:** Prabhupada's purport explains the urgency of Vidura's instruction, applicable to both Dhritarashtra and Yudhishthira, but especially needed for the materialistic Dhritarashtra.

In the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains the reason why Vidura is telling Dhritarashtra, 'Get out of here immediately, do not delay.' It's urgent that he has to leave the palace, and one of the reasons he gives is because fear has overtaken you now. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport, 'Cruel death cares for no one, be he Dhritarashtra or even Maharaj Yudhishthira, therefore spiritual instruction as was given to old Dhritarashtra was equally applicable to younger Maharaj Yudhishthira.' Dhritarashtra is the uncle of Maharaj Yudhishthira, his father's brother. So Dhritarashtra is old and Yudhishthira is younger than Dhritarashtra, but this instruction which Vidura is giving is equally applicable to both Dhritarashtra and Yudhishthira. जातस्यही द्रुवाव मृत्यु द्रुवाम जन्म मृतस्यचा फर्मेकृतत्वःत देखऌ अवधिधर्यक्ति भृत देखा दिया तो धफ्त प्रतित्रणित देखा । प्रतित्र्यी केस्ट materially दोष्षल न एउदर्धर्यक्ति से अतित्राधूक्या टत्रेक्रि तौर फिर धैम न परिणा हो जातू ऋह । So, Srila Prabhupāda says, further, as a matter of fact, everyone in the royal palace, including the king and his brothers and mother, was rapidly attending the lectures that were being given by Vidura. But it was known to Vidura that his instructions were especially meant for Dhritarashtra, who was too materialistic.

**Key Quote:** "Dhritarashtra had become too materialistic, and therefore he required such a dose of, as they say, bitter medicine. He required that."
**Summary:** Dhritarashtra's materialism and disqualification from the throne due to blindness are discussed, along with his ambition to become king and hand the kingdom to his sons.

In a sense, those who are spiritually inclined and are spiritually engaged in spiritual activities, they don't require the kind of alertness that Vidura is trying to bring in by his strong words. And we shall hear how Vidura is going to speak. Dhritarashtra spoke very, very harshly, just to shake him up out of the slumber. Now, the important point here is Dhritarashtra had become too materialistic, and therefore he required such a dose of, as they say, bitter medicine. He required that. The word Rājan is especially addressed to Dhritarashtra. Why is the word Rājan applicable to Dhritarashtra, particularly? It's because Dhritarashtra was the eldest son of his father, and therefore, according to law, he was to be installed on the throne of Hastinapura. But because he was blind from birth, he was disqualified from his rightful claim. See how, in the ancient times, they were so conscious of... exercising their claim based on their qualification. Not just because, 'I am the eldest son, so I should ascend the throne, regardless of whether I am blind, I am unqualified.' No, it's never like that. So, he was disqualified because he was blind by birth. But he could not forget. Dhritarashtra could not forget the bereavement. And his disappointment was somewhat compensated after the death of his younger brother, Pandu. Pandu died untimely, when he was very young. So, Dhritarashtra was made the caretaker king, because there was no one to ascend the throne after Pandu's death, because the children were all... His younger brother left behind him some minor children, and Dhritarashtra became the natural guardian of them. But at heart, he wanted to become the factual king and hand the kingdom over to his own sons headed by Duryodhana. With all these imperial ambitions, Dhritarashtra wanted to become a king, and he contrived all sorts of intrigues in consultation with his brother-in-law. And he contrived all sorts of intrigues in consultation with his brother-in-law, Shakuni.

**Summary:** Shakuni's anger at his sister's marriage to a blind king and his plan to destroy the Kuru dynasty are explained, highlighting his role in Dhritarashtra's intrigues against the Pandavas, which ultimately failed due to the Lord's will.

Now, Shakuni, the brother-in-law of Dhritarashtra, that is Gandhari's brother, Dhritarashtra's wife's brother, he was very angry that his sister Gandhari, the most beautiful princess of her time, she was married to a blind king. She was married to a blind king. So, Shakuni was very angry. 'Why my sister, who is so qualified, so beautiful, so chaste, so very good in all qualities, why is she being married to a blind person?' So, he decided to destroy the Kuru dynasty. To destroy the Kuru dynasty. So, this was Shakuni's agenda. And when Dhritarashtra, he contrived all sorts of intrigues, Shakuni actually became very much instrumental in trying to, in Dhritarashtra's attempt at somehow trying to destroy the Pandavas, because Shakuni's agenda was somehow the Kuru dynasty should be destroyed. But everything failed by the will of the Lord. Dhritarashtra was not successful. Shakuni was not successful.

**Key Quote:** "When the Lord protects somebody, Nobody can destroy such a devotee protected by the Lord."
**Summary:** Even after losing everything, Dhritarashtra wanted to remain king and shamelessly accepted Yudhishthira's hospitality, while Vidura aimed to awaken him from his slumber of disease and old age, detailing the physical decline associated with aging.

Everything failed by the will of the Lord. When the Lord protects somebody, nobody can destroy such a devotee protected by the Lord. And at the last stage, even after losing everything, men and men, Dhritarashtra wanted to remain as king, being the eldest uncle of Maharaja Yudhishthira. Maharaja Yudhishthira, as a matter of duty, maintained Dhritarashtra in royal honor. Dhritarashtra was not entitled to the royal honor, because Yudhishthira Maharaj had ascended the throne. And before Yudhishthira Maharaj ascended the throne, Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana had given so much trouble to Yudhishthira. So Dhritarashtra was shamelessly accepting all the hospitality Yudhishthira was offering, shamelessly. So this will be pointed out later on by Vidura. Hmm. Dhritarashtra was happily passing away his numbered days in the illusion of being a king or the royal uncle of King Yudhishthira. See, just because Yudhishthira was very, very courteous, and he was upright in his dealings, he was straightforward in his dealings, he was ideal in his behavior and character, Dhritarashtra was misusing this kind of treatment of Yudhishthira. Now Vidura as a saint and as the duty-bound affectionate youngest brother of Dhritarashtra wanted to awaken Dhritarashtra from his slumber of disease and old age. Now what is Dhritarashtra's condition? He had become old. So invalidity due to old age has set him. That will be described by Vidura later on. That means as the body ages, generally the senses become weaker and weaker and weaker, and internally the organs start failing. The digestion becomes poor. The liver doesn't function properly. The heart becomes weak. So many changes in the body, and that will be described later on. These are all changes which are natural, consequence of the aging of the body, and nobody can prevent it. It's natural for everyone to experience this.

**Key Quote:** "Everyone is the servant of eternal time."
**Summary:** The inevitability of old age and its effects are discussed, leading to Vidura's sarcastic address to Dhritarashtra as king, emphasizing that everyone is controlled by time (Kala) except pure devotees, and Vidura's mission is to help Dhritarashtra save himself.

If they live beyond a certain stage of this body. When old age sets in, if somebody is still living, then in the old age, even though they may be happy that 'I am still living,' but their body may not be in the best of conditions. So Dhritarashtra was facing the invalidity due to old age, and also the disease that accompanies sometimes the aging of the body. Vidura therefore sarcastically addressed Dhritarashtra as the king, which he actually was not. Dhritarashtra was not the king. Then why is Vidura addressing him as the king? Rajan. The word says, 'Rajan nirgam yatham shigram.' 'My dear king, please leave this place immediately.' So it was a sarcastic address. Everyone is the servant of eternal time. You see, Kala reigns supreme in this material world, because it is a representation of the Supreme Lord Paramatma. Nobody can overcome Kala except a pure devotee who transcends the material conditions, the material modes, and even Kala. Only a pure devotee can transcend Kala. But those who are not taken to devotional service, they cannot transcend Kala. So therefore, no one can be king in this material world, in the real sense of the term. Nobody is like the controller. Everyone is controlled. So therefore, this situation which Dhritarashtra was in, Vidura had come to get him out of this situation, to help him save himself. That was Vidura's mission. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "My Lord, it is the Supreme Personality of Godhead as eternal time or Kala that has approached us all."
**Summary:** The lecture begins with invocations and then introduces the verse SB 1.13.19, explaining that the frightful situation Dhritarashtra faces is due to the approach of Kala, or eternal time, representing death.

Om Ajnana Timira Andhasya Jnananjani Shalakaya Chakshur Unmilitam Jena Tasmai Shri Gurave Namaha Namah Om Vishnupadaya Krishna Preshtaya Bhutale Shri Mate Bhaktivedanta Swamin Nithinamine Namaste Saraswate Deve Gauravani Pracharine Nirvishesha Shunyavadi Pashchatya Deshatarine Jaya Shri Krishna Chaitanya Prabhu Nithyananda Shri Advaita Gadhadhara Shri Vasadi Gauravakta Vrinda Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudhirayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 19th verse of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Pratikriyana yasyeha kutashchit karhichit prabho saesha bhagavan kalaha sarveshamna samagatah. The meaning of this verse is, this frightful situation cannot be remedied by any person in this material world. My Lord, it is the Supreme Personality of Godhead as eternal time or Kala that has approached us all.

**Key Quote:** "So, death cannot be remedied by any material solution."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the verse, explaining Dhritarashtra's fear as being related to the fast-approaching death and emphasizing that there is no material solution or escape from death.

So this can be understood in connection with the previous verse in which Vidura is addressing Dhritarashtra and telling, "My dear king, immediately get out of this place, do not delay." Why? Because Dhritarashtra is overtaken by fear. Why is he afraid? What is he afraid of? So that frightful situation is due to Kala approaching Dhritarashtra to remind him of the fast approaching death, fast approaching death. So, death cannot be remedied by any material solution. There is no remedy for death in terms of working out a material escape path or a route, no. So, it is the Supreme Personality of Godhead as eternal time that has approached Dhritarashtra.

**Key Quote:** "In this material world, there is no superior power which can check the cruel hands of death."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Prabhupada, stating that no superior power can stop death, and explains that old age is a notice of death's arrival, and that death is present from birth, with life constantly reducing, and that material enjoyment is illusory.

In the purport, Prabhupada explains, there is no superior power which can check the cruel hands of death. In this material world, there is no superior power. No one wants to die however acute the source of bodily sufferings may be. Even in the days of so-called scientific advancement of knowledge, there is no remedial measure either for old age or for death. Old age is the notice of the arrival of death served by cruel time. Why old age? Because it is a notice of fast approaching death. Srila Prabhupada explains elsewhere that actually death is present along with birth. Why? Because this body, as soon as we enter into this body, the limited duration of time we inhabit to some degree, the checkout time for nailed up children will be ensuring that the life cycle is in Ruha-Rasankara. Therefore, as soon as we inhabit this body that counter starts ticking, so the countdown has begun. The day we are born our lifespan keeps on reducing, reducing, reducing, reducing, reducing, reducing, and specially in younger age we are completely forgetful of these reducing effect of kala on our lifespan. We may think that, oh maybe there is death but it is long, long time to go before I die, let me enjoy while I'm young, and that enjoyment also, as we heard yesterday in the previous session, it is illusory.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Only intelligent spiritualists don't have attraction for this illusory and temporary material happiness."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts illusory material happiness with spiritual happiness, stating that materialists are always defeated by nature's laws, and that death is the supreme judgement of eternal time, and that the spirit soul is eternal, and that ignorance of this leads to fear of death.

And terrible, and it is not good. Temporary, illusory, and temporary. Only intelligent spiritualists don't have attraction for this illusory and temporary material happiness. The foolish materialists, they do not know of spiritual happiness, so they think the only happiness that we can really have in this world is material happiness. So they chase material happiness which is temporary, illusory, and they are always defeated in their attempt to enjoy material happiness, always defeated by the laws of material nature. So there is no remedy for old age or death, and old age means it is the notice of the arrival of death. No one can refuse to accept either someone calls a supreme judgment of eternal time when we are supposed to quit this body, that is called death. We leave this body, spirit soul which is eternal. I or you are any real person, we are eternal, but we have to leave the body, and in ignorance we think this bodily existence is all in all and we are not prepared for leaving this body. Then we suddenly shocked, why am I asked to leave this body? Where will I go? What will happen to me? How will I exist? This is the fear of death. Why people forgot as to cheated or cheated who cheated or anything in all the wrongs in this matter, watch.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Everything is not finished it's only this body which is actually deteriorating and that is going to be finished but you are going to continue to exist after death."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that death is not the end, only the body perishes, and the soul continues to exist, and that this knowledge is not available in material books, and that Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita that death is merely a change of body.

Of course, before death comes some foolish materialist may think everything is finished at death, but everything is not finished. It's only this body which is actually deteriorating and that is going to be finished, but you are going to continue to exist after death. This is a very, very, very important lesson given in our scriptures, in spiritual literature. It's not available in any material book. They do not know what is what life really is. They have no idea. So those who are writing all this material literature, they do not know spiritual creature is home, the foundational truth, understanding of the foundational truth that I am NOT this body. This body's just temporary body, it is going to deteriorate and perish, and I should prepare before death comes to quit this body and transfer myself to my eternal home, Krishna's about. So such lessons are not available in our material books. No, no material education can give you this understanding. Only in the Bhagavad Gita directly Krishna says you are not the body, your spirit soul, you as spirit soul have no death. Then what is called is death is change of body.

**Key Quote:** "There is no remedial measure available by staying in the palace while staying in the palace now there's no remedial measure like that before ordering however Vidura informed Dhritarashtra that there is no remedial measure by anyone or from any source in this material world there is no material solution for this problem of death."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Vidura is telling Dhritarashtra that there is no material solution to the problem of death, and that staying in the palace will not protect him.

This is explained before Dhritarashtra because he might ask Vidura to find out some remedial measure for the imminent fearful situation as he had ordered many times before. Whenever there was danger, Dhritarashtra was having his brother Vidura, younger brother Vidura, as his advisor, and whenever there was some difficulty or danger in a political situation, Vidura was giving very good advice to Dhritarashtra. So now again Vidura has come to the palace, and when Vidura is warning Dhritarashtra there is danger, beware, then Dhritarashtra might ask Vidura, okay you are warning me of the danger but you find a solution so that I am protected remaining here, I am protected against the danger. So Vidura is telling there is no remedial measure available by staying in the palace. While staying in the palace now there's no remedial measure like that. Before ordering however, Vidura informed Dhritarashtra that there is no remedial measure by anyone or from any source in this material world. There is no material solution for this problem of death.

**Key Quote:** "Death is identical with the Supreme Personality of Godhead as it is said by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad Gita."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that death is identical to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, quoting Krishna from the Bhagavad Gita as saying, 'I am death, and I take away all your material possessions.'

This we have to get convinced because we are always hoping somehow I will overcome some bodily problem and we've been doing it as long as there is life in this body is always some remedial measure we figure out are we somehow managed to survive but that will not work at that time due to a certain difficulty so said Dhritarashtra resented Viya thinking that something is wrong with him never dare to go to HIM at the time of death this is the important point here because there is no such thing in the material world death is identical with the Supreme Personality of Godhead as it is said by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad Gita what is Krishna saying the Bhagavad Gita? Mruthu sarva haras chaahum Mruthu I am death and as death sarva hara I take away all your material possessions I terminate your material existence in the body material existence means this body bodily existence and you are left with nothing none of your material possessions none of your material relationships none of your material assets assets, none of your material knowledge, nothing you are left with. Sarvaharascha. That's why.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Death cannot be checked by anyone or from any source within the material world."
**Summary:** The speaker gives the example of Hiranyakashipu, who wanted to become immortal through severe penance, but Brahma could not grant him immortality because Brahma himself is subject to death.

Sometimes death is called all devouring death. All devouring death. So Srila Prabhupada gives an example here. Death cannot be checked by anyone or from any source within the material world. And Prabhupada gives the example here. Hiranyakashipu wanted to be immortal and underwent a severe type of penance by which the whole universe trembled. Hiranyakashipu amassed a lot of power by performing severe austerities and asking for boons from Brahma. And Brahma himself approached Hiranyakashipu to dissuade Hiranyakashipu from such a severe type of penance. So Hiranyakashipu's plan was to become immortal. But Brahma wanted to dissuade him from this penance because it is futile to think that I will do tapasya so that I will become immortal. Material type of tapasya. Hiranyakashipu asked Brahma to award him the blessings of immortality. But Brahma said that he himself was subject to death, even in the top. So how could Brahma award Hiranyakashipu the benediction of immortality? Brahma himself is going to die. Then how can Brahma give anybody else immortality when he himself is subject to death? So the lesson to be learnt is everyone beginning from Brahma down to the most insignificant creature in this material world who has taken birth is subject to death.

**Key Quote:** "Nobody can escape death. There is no question of immortality in this body or in any body, any material body. There is no immortality."
**Summary:** The speaker states that death exists even in Brahma Loka, and that the only way to overcome birth, disease, old age, and death is through spiritual realization, which is what Vidura will advise Dhritarashtra.

Subtitles by the Amara.org community. Nobody can escape death. There is no question of immortality in this body or in any body, any material body. There is no immortality. So there is death even in the topmost planet of this universe and what to speak of other planets which are far, far inferior in quality to Brahma Loka. So Brahma Loka is the place where Brahma resides. The topmost planet in this material universe. And even in Brahma Loka there is death even though they have fantastic long life span as compared to the life span of the human beings on the earth. But still Brahma lives for some 311 trillion years measured in our time scale. But even Brahma has to die. Brahma has to die. When that 311 trillion years is measured in our time scale. When that 311 trillion years is measured in our time scale. So 311 trillion years are over. So Srila Prabhupada concludes by telling wherever there is influence of eternal time there is this set of tribulations namely birth, disease, old age and death. And all of them are invincible. You cannot conquer any of these. Birth, birth means rebirth after death, rebirth. Then followed by further rebirth by a disease old age and death so this cannot be overcome by any material means any material methods so the only way is to work for spiritual realization of our spiritual nature eternal spiritual nature so that is what the scriptures advice and that's what exactly Vidura is going.

**Key Quote:** "whoever is under the influence of supreme Kala or eternal time must surrender his most dear life and what to speak of other things such as wealth, honour, children, land and home"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces verse 20 of the 13th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining that everyone is subject to the influence of time and must surrender everything at death.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we are discussing from two verses, the 20th and the 21st verses of the 13th chapter of the 1st canto of Shri Madbhagavata, one verse at a time, first the 20th verse: Yena Chaivabhipannoyam Pranai Priyatamair Api Janasadyo Viyujeta Kimutanyair Dhanadibhi. Now Vidura is explaining to Dhritarashtra, whoever is under the influence of supreme Kala or eternal time must surrender his most dear life, and what to speak of other things such as wealth, honour, children, land and home Dhanadibhi. Dhana is wealth and all the things that we think wealth can buy for us, some land, some home, some material possessions, assets, some status, material status in society, all these things, when none of these things can be protected or saved when death comes, supreme Kala. Kala means synonymous with death, that time we surrender most dear life and what to speak of other things.

**Key Quote:** "actually being ignorant of the fact that death always comes suddenly"
**Summary:** The speaker provides examples from Srila Prabhupada's teachings and historical events to illustrate the inevitability of death and the surrender of material possessions.

So Srila Prabhupada explains, a great Indian scientist busy in the plan making business was suddenly called by invincible eternal time while going to attend a very important meeting of the planning commission, and he had to surrender his life, wife, children, house, land, wealth, etc. One of the examples Srila Prabhupada is giving, we always actually witness around us that somebody, they say, suddenly died. They say suddenly died, actually being ignorant of the fact that death always comes suddenly, always comes suddenly. So somebody is very, the example being given by Srila Prabhupada, a great Indian scientist busy in plan making business, he was in the planning commission and very important meeting he was going to attend, suddenly death came and he collapsed while going for the meeting, and death means surrender his life, and along with his life he has to surrender everything connected with that body in which there was life till he was having his life span, everything he has to surrender. Another example Srila Prabhupada gives, during the political upsurge in India and his division into Pakistan and Hindustan at the time of independence, political independence India got, so many rich and influential Indians had to surrender life, property and honour due to the influence of time. When they had to die, they had to give up everything that they had accumulated, they had amassed by being so called successful in business or in becoming rich, everything they had to surrender. And there are hundreds and thousands of examples like that all over the world, all over the universe which are all effects of the influence of time.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "there is no powerful living being within the universe who can overcome the influence of time"
**Summary:** The speaker expands on the influence of time, explaining that even demigods (devatas) are subject to its power and must relinquish their positions during the partial dissolution of the universe.

It's not just the earth people, it's not just the earth planet, it's not just the human beings, there are even devatas. When the partial dissolution of the universe happens, all the devatas they have to give up their positions, they have to give up their life, they have to give up their wealth, they have to give up their power, everything they have to give up the influence of time. Therefore, the conclusion is that there is no powerful living being within the universe who can overcome the influence of time, Kala. If we are conscious of Kala, we realize that the influence of time is insurmountable, we cannot overcome the influence of time, whatever position one might be in, even in the upper planets including Brahma's position in the topmost planet. Many poets have written verses lamenting the influence of time, many devastations have taken place over the universes due to the influence of time.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "even in our daily life so many things come and go in which we have no hand but we have to suffer or tolerate them without remedial measure"
**Summary:** The speaker describes the devastation caused by the partial dissolution of the universe, where planets are submerged in water, and connects this to the influence of time (kala) in daily life.

See, when devastation takes place, everything is destroyed. Of course, when there is partial dissolution of the universe, the planets are not exactly destroyed, but there is a flood and water covers every planet in the middle and lower planetary systems. Everyone in the middle and lower planetary systems has to quit his body and the planet itself is covered by water, the water of devastation, pralaya payodhi jale. Pralaya means the dissolution or the devastation, destruction, payodhi jale, the water of the ocean. Just like we have experienced now that the oceans are contained within a certain limit, they never come beyond the high tide line on the shore, any ocean or sea, but that is only as long as this universe is maintained by the supreme lord. But when dissolution comes, the universe, of course the final dissolution, the whole universe is destroyed, but even the partial dissolution at the end of Brahma's day, there is submerging of the planets in the middle and lower planetary systems. The earth planet will be completely submerged by water and there is no one who can check this devastation when Kala brings about the devastation. Even in our daily life, so many things come and go in which we have no hand, but we have to suffer or tolerate them without remedial measure, that is the result of time, Kala, that Kala is being described by Vidura as insurmountable.

**Key Quote:** "the king is reminded of his precarious condition influenced by cruel time"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces verse 21, focusing on Vidura's message to Dhritarashtra about his precarious situation due to old age, loss of family, and dependence on others.

21st verse: pitra bhratra suhratputra hataste vigatam vayam aatmacha jarayagrastaha paragyeham upasase. What is Dhritarashtra's actual situation now that Vidura is telling him, get out of the place, why so? Some of the reasons are stated in this verse. Vidura is telling, your father, brother, well wishers and sons are all dead and passed away, you yourself have expended the major portion of your life, your body is now overtaken by invalidity and you are living in the home of another. So these are all the facts which Vidura is bringing to the notice of Dhritarashtra. So in the purport Srila Prabhupada says, the king is reminded of his precarious condition influenced by cruel time, what does Kala do?

**Key Quote:** "it unfolds our karma"
**Summary:** The speaker explains how time unfolds our karma, bringing both enjoyment and suffering, and highlights the illusory nature of material happiness.

It unfolds our karma. We are carrying a load of karma with us when we take birth and Kala will decide in this particular body during our life span which of those reactions which are not yet fructified in our heart, in our subtle body, which of those will actually give us the result. It could be either enjoyment or suffering. Of course, enjoyment, there is no real enjoyment, there is no real enjoyment, real happiness, it is illusory happiness, but even if somebody settles for illusory happiness, there is also the suffering due to the bad reactions, the sinful reactions. So all this will unfold, that is what is called as the influence of cruel time. And Dhritarashtra by his past experience, he should have been more influenced and intelligent to see what was going to happen to his own life. We think that I am not going to die, though I see everyone else around me either as already dead, either as already dead or they are going to die, but I think I am not going to die, each person thinks like that. So the warning given by Vidura is explained by Prabhupada.

**Key Quote:** "Dhritarashtra lost all his sons"
**Summary:** The speaker recounts the tragedies in Dhritarashtra's life, including the deaths of his father, brother, sons, and other relatives, emphasizing his immense loss.

That Dhritarashtra's father Vichitravirya died long ago when he and his younger brothers were all little children and it was due to the care and kindness of Bhishma Deva that they were properly brought up. Bhishma Deva was the elder brother of Vichitravirya, so Bhishma Deva took responsibility for raising these small children when their father died untimely. Then again his brother, Dhritarashtra's brother, Pandu died also, Pandu died untimely. Then in the battlefield of Kurukshetra his 100 sons and all his grandsons died. So Dhritarashtra lost all his sons, he had 100 sons, see his ill-fated destiny that not even one son survived that battle of Kurukshetra, all of them died and his grandsons also, they also died and even his other well-wishers like Bhishma Deva, Dronacharya, Karna, many other kings and friends, all of them died in the battle of Kurukshetra. It is told elsewhere that only the Pandavas were specially protected by Krishna, they survived that ghastly war, the battle of Kurukshetra, everybody else died. So Dhritarashtra lost all men and money and now he was living at the mercy of his nephew whom he had put into troubles of various types.

**Key Quote:** "the only protector is the Supreme Lord and nobody else"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Dhritarashtra's dependence on Yudhishthira, whom he and Duryodhana considered an enemy, and emphasizes that only the Supreme Lord can provide true protection.

With whom is Dhritarashtra living, with his enemy now. Yudhishthira did not consider Dhritarashtra or Duryodhana as his enemy, but Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana were always eyeing the Pandavas as their enemy, why? Because Pandavas were eligible and it was their rightful claim to the kingdom of Hastinapur and Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana had to give that kingdom to Yudhishthira when Yudhishthira grew up, became a major adult, but Dhritarashtra did not do that and Duryodhana was always plotting and planning to kill Yudhishthira and that way Duryodhana developed enmity, Dhritarashtra developed enmity towards Yudhishthira. So now where is Dhritarashtra living, in the house of his enemy. Is it a very honorable life, living in the house of the enemy is not at all honorable. Despite all these reverses, he thought that you prolong his life more and more, as long as I live let me live comfortably, that was Dhritarashtra's plan. Vidura wanted to point out to Dhritarashtra that everyone has to protect himself by his action and the grace of the Lord. There is a suitable way of protecting oneself by Krishna's mercy and your spiritual activities, only that can protect you. One has to execute his duty faithfully depending on the result, depending on the Supreme Lord for the result, result is in the hands of the Lord. No friend, no children, no father, no brother, no state and no one else can protect a person who is not protected by the Supreme Lord, so the only protector is the Supreme Lord and nobody else.

In the next few verses we will hear more about Dhritarashtra's precarious condition being warned by Vidura. I will stop here and thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Which means that it is notice of death which is fast approaching."
**Summary:** The speaker explains verse 22, where Vidura points out Dhritarashtra's old age and failing health as a warning of approaching death, urging him to consider his future.

This chapter is entitled Dhritarashtra Quits Home. The verse number 22 Andhapuraiva Vadhiro Mandaprajnyascha Sampratam Vishirna Danto Mandagni Saraga Kapham Udbhahan The meaning of this verse is: You have been blind from your very birth, and recently you have become hard of hearing. Your memory is shortened, and your intelligence is disturbed. Your teeth are loose, your liver is defective, and you are coughing up mucus. These are words spoken by Vidura to Dhritarashtra, and Vidura is pointing out that the symptoms of invalidity due to old age are very much prominent in the person of Dhritarashtra, which means that it is notice of death which is fast approaching. So what are you doing about Dhritarashtra facing death? So Vidura is actually alerting Dhritarashtra.

#### material attachment, illusion, impermanence, shadvikara

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "This is the power of illusion in this material world."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the purport, explaining the symptoms of old age, the concept of 'Shadvikara' (six changes in the body), and how people foolishly seek permanent settlement in the material world, forgetting the impermanence of the body and material possessions.

So in the Purport, Shila Prabhupada explains the symptoms of old age which had already developed in Dhritarashtra were all, one after another, pointed out to him as warning that death was nearing very quickly, and still he was foolishly carefree about his future. The signs pointed out by Vidura in the body of Dhritarashtra were signs of Apakshaya, or dwindling of the material body before the last stroke of death. The body is born, it develops, stays, creates other organs, other bodies, dwindles, and then vanishes. This is called Shadvikara, six different changes that take place in the body from birth to death. So body is born, body is going to die, but in between four stages: body develops, then it stays for some time, produces by-products, and dwindles. So these are described in the Shadvikara. So these are described in the scriptures as Shadvikara, six changes that happen in the body, irrespective of whether it is the body of a small insignificant creature, or the body of a human being, or the body of an animal or a bird, or a demigod, these six changes take place. But foolish men want to make a permanent settlement of the perishable body and think that their estate, their children, their society, country, etc., will give them protection. With such foolish ideas, they become overtaken by such temporary engagements and forget altogether that they must give up this temporary body and take a new one, again to arrange for another term of society, friendship, and love, again to perish ultimately.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "We are spirit soul, we belong to Krishna, we have eternal life."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the deep-rooted desire for material enjoyment, the illusion of finding lasting happiness in the material world, and the tendency to forget our true, eternal identity as spirit souls belonging to Krishna, contrasting genuine sadhus with those who offer sense gratification.

This is the power of illusion in this material world, because we have got a deep-rooted desire for material enjoyment. We have hope that we can make it in this material world by some adjustment, some arrangement, some wealth, some friendship, some so-called love of near and dear ones, but actually none of these can really save us ultimately from death. Everything is taken away, everything material is taken away from us at the time of death. They forget their permanent identity. What is our permanent identity? We are spirit soul. We belong to Krishna. We have eternal life. We belong to Krishna. We have eternal relationship of love with Krishna. That we forget and become foolishly active for impermanent occupations, forgetting altogether their prime duty. Therefore, saints and sages like Vidura approach such foolish men to awaken them to their real situation, but they take such sadhus and saints as parasites of society, and almost all of them refuse to hear the words of such sadhus and saints, although they welcome show bottle sadhus and so-called saints who can satisfy their senses.

**Key Quote:** "A genuine sadhu will never promise any sense gratification in exchange for some spiritual life."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why people are cheated by bogus sadhus who offer sense gratification, emphasizing that a genuine sadhu will never promise material benefits for spiritual advancement, and that Vidura is correctly pointing out the real situation of life.

Sometimes we ask, why do people get cheated by bogus sadhus? Because these bogus sadhus know how to cheat people by satisfying their senses. The same business is going on even otherwise without any saintly person, so-called saintly person, trying to satisfy their senses. People are simply busy with material enjoyment, and for the sake of material enjoyment, they are seeking satisfaction of their senses. So these show bottle sadhus who somehow give some license for sense gratification in the name of so-called religious practices, a genuine sadhu will never promise any sense gratification in exchange for some spiritual life, never. Vidura was not a sadhu to satisfy the ill-gotten sentiment of Dhritarashtra. He is correctly pointing out the real situation of life and how one can save oneself from such catastrophes.

**Key Quote:** "A sadhu is to speak to the householders about the naked truth of life so that they may come to their senses about the precarious life in material existence."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces verse 23, where Vidura uses strong words to shake Dhritarashtra out of his illusion, comparing him to a household dog dependent on Bhima, and explains that a sadhu should speak the truth about the precariousness of material life.

The 23rd verse: Aho mahiyasi jantor Jivitasha Yatha bhavan Bhima pavarjitam Pindam adatte Grihapalavat. These are very strong words spoken by Vidura to shake up Dhritarashtra out of his illusory situation. The meaning of this 23rd verse is: Alas, how powerful are the hopes of a living being to continue his life. Verily, you are living just like a household dog and are eating remnants of food given by Bhima. These are very strong words spoken by Vidura. So the purport, Shila Prabhupada explains, why is Vidura speaking so harshly? Prabhupada says, a sadhu should never flatter kings or rich men to live comfortably at their cost. A sadhu is to speak to the householders about the naked truth of life so that they may come to their senses about the precarious life in material existence.

**Key Quote:** "Yudhishthira is actually a pure devotee, so such pure devotees, they depend on Krishna under all circumstances."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Dhritarashtra as an attached old man, explains why Bhima is specifically mentioned, recounting Bhima's anger at the Kauravas' cheating and mistreatment of Draupadi and the Pandavas, and highlighting Yudhishthira's righteous conduct and dependence on Krishna.

This is a genuine sadhu. Dhritarashtra is a typical example of an attached old man in household life. He had become a pauper in the true sense, yet he wanted to live comfortably in the house of the Pandavas, of whom Bhima especially is mentioned here. Why is Bhima mentioned especially among the five Pandavas? Because personally it was Bhima who killed two prominent sons of Dhritarashtra, namely Duryodhana and Dushyasana. These two sons were very much dear to Dhritarashtra for their notorious and nefarious activities. Bhima is particularly pointed out because he killed these two pet sons. Actually, Bhima killed not only these two pet sons, Bhima killed each of the 100 sons of Dhritarashtra. Bhima was angry because Ghervravas took undue advantage of Yudhishthira's righteous, upright behavior even in trying circumstances in gambling match which was rigged, and the Pandavas were cheated. Just because Yudhishthira agreed to follow the rules of the game, even though he was cheated, Duryodhana and Dushasana took undue advantage of Yudhishthira's good conduct, righteous conduct, and simply insulted Draupadi, made Pandavas slaves, and practically insulted all of them, so Bhima was very angry at this particular time, but he restrained himself because Yudhishthira did not want any of the Pandavas to protest.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This sense of continuing one's life indicates that a living being is eternally a living entity and does not want to change his bodily habitation."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotees accept suffering as Krishna's will, maintaining their righteousness, and recounts how Krishna protected the Pandavas and ensured their victory, emphasizing Dhritarashtra's desire to live comfortably despite humiliation and the eternal nature of the living being.

Now Yudhishthira is actually a pure devotee, so such pure devotees, they depend on Krishna under all circumstances. If it is the Lord's will that we have to undergo suffering, we will suffer, but we will never give up our righteous conduct in order to avoid some suffering, no. The Lord has got his own higher reason why he wants devotees to suffer in certain circumstances. There is a higher plan, and devotees have this full faith in the Supreme Lord, and as it turns out, that in the battle of Kurukshetra, against all odds the Pandavas were protected by Krishna and the Kauravas were completely destroyed in that battle because it is Krishna's will that the Pandavas must win this battle and Yudhishthira must be enthroned as the emperor of the world against all odds. So therefore it is specifically mentioned here that Bhima who was angry at the Kauravas, he got an opportunity to properly fight in this battle and personally kill each of the 100 sons of Dhritarashtra. Why was Dhritarashtra living there at the house of the Pandavas? Because he wanted to continue his life comfortably even at the risk of all humiliation. Vidura therefore was astonished how powerful is the urge to continue life. This sense of continuing one's life indicates that a living being is eternally a living entity and does not want to change his bodily habitation. The foolish man does not know that a particular term of imprisonment, a particular term of bodily existence is awarded to him to undergo a total term of imprisonment, and the human body is awarded after many many births and deaths as a chance for self-realization to go back home, back to Godhead, but persons like Dhritarashtra try to make plans to live here in this material world comfortably. They do not see things as they are. Dhritarashtra is blind and continues to hope to live comfortably in the midst of all kinds of reverses of life, but as

**Key Quote:** "Vidura is pointing out to Dhritarashtra how Dhritarashtra had done so much of atrocities, committed so many atrocities against the Pandavas and now living in their house is a degraded life."
**Summary:** Vidura criticizes Dhritarashtra for his past actions against the Pandavas and his current degraded state of living off their charity.

In this session, we will be discussing two verses, the 24th and the 25th verse of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 24th verse: Agnir Nisrishto Dattascha Garodarascha Dushitaha Hritham Kshetram Dhanam Yesham Tad Dattair Asubhi Kiyat. The meaning of this verse is, "There is no need to live a degraded life and subsist on the charity of the Lord. There is no need to live a degraded life and subsist on the charity of those whom you tried to kill by arson and poisoning. You also insulted one of their wives and usurped their kingdom and wealth." Vidura is pointing out to Dhritarashtra how Dhritarashtra had done so much of atrocities, committed so many atrocities against the Pandavas, and is now living in their house, a degraded life.

**Key Quote:** "To stick to family life to the end of one's human life is the grossest type of degradation and there is an absolute need for the Viduras to educate such Dhritarashtras even at the present moment."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's purport emphasizes the importance of self-realization in human life and criticizes those who remain attached to material life until death, drawing a parallel to Dhritarashtra's situation.

This is a degraded life for Dhritarashtra. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains some very important points. The system of Varnashrama religion sets aside a part of one's life completely for the purpose of self-realization and attainment of salvation in the human form of life. This is how human life is. Human life is distinguished from animal life in that there is a special provision that you can set aside a part of your life exclusively for self-realization, which is the main goal of the human form of life and which is only possible in the human form of life. That is a routine division of life. But persons like Dhritarashtra, even at their very ripened age, want to stay home, even in a degraded condition of accepting charity from enemies. Vidura wanted to point this out and impressed upon him that it was better to die like his sons than accept such humiliating charity. It was not a dignified way that Dhritarashtra was living in the house of the Pandavas. So Vidura is pointing out, "If you have any consideration for living a dignified way, you should immediately leave this place. This is not a suitable place for you." Five thousand years ago there was one Dhritarashtra, but at the present moment there are Dhritarashtras in every home. People's life has become very degraded in this present time because they live in spite of all kinds of difficulties and dangers. They don't

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the relevance of the Dhritarashtra episode in modern times, highlighting the need for saintly persons to awaken materialistic individuals to the value of human life.

make any preparation for facing death like a proper human being. So that's why Prabhupada says now it's not just one rare Dhritarashtra who is living a degraded condition of life. There are many, many, many such people living a very degraded condition of life, and Prabhupada specially mentions here politicians especially do not retire from political activities unless they're dragged by the cruel hand of death or killed by some opposing element. We see this all around us. This is the reality. To stick to family life to the end of one's human life is the grossest type of degradation, and there is an absolute need for the Viduras to educate such Dhritarashtras even at the present moment. So don't take this episode as some historical incident which is not relevant now. It is very much relevant now, especially in modern times, it's necessary for saintly persons to wake up the materialistic persons who are lost, engrossed in sense gratification, and missing the opportunity of the valuable

Somebody may think that I will make some adjustment and somehow live, but nature does not allow you to live in the same way you have been living. Your body deteriorates and it will give you more and more trouble as the body ages. It will only deteriorate further.

**Key Quote:** "Human life is meant for finishing all kinds of miseries of material existence."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concepts of Kripana (miserly man) and Brahmana, contrasting their understanding of the material body and the purpose of human life, emphasizing the importance of preparing for death and ending material suffering.

That's the law of nature. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says the words Kripanasya Jiji Vishoho are significant, two words, Kripana and Jiji Vishoho. So Prabhupada explains there are two classes of men, this is described in the scriptures, in the Upanishads. This is described. That are the... One is called Kripana and the other is called Brahmana. The Kripana, or miserly man, has no estimation of his material body, but the Brahmana has a true estimation of himself and material body. So Kripana and Brahmana. Kripana does not know the value of this human form of body. The Brahmana knows the value. The Kripana, having a wrong estimation of his material body, wants to enjoy sense gratification with his utmost strength. And even in old age, he wants to become a young man by medical treatment or otherwise. We see this all around us, that old people somehow want to maintain themselves for sense gratification, living a life of sense gratification. But that's not possible. That's really not possible. Dhritarashtra is addressed herein as a Kripana because without any estimation of his material body, he wants to live at any cost, somehow live a life of sense gratification. Vidura is trying to open his eyes to see that he cannot live more than his term and that he must prepare for death. The symptoms are indicative of fast approaching death and Dhritarashtra must prepare to face death like a human being and not miss the opportunity like an animal. Since death is inevitable,

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts spiritual and material assets, highlighting the eternal nature of spiritual assets and the futility of wasting human energy on sense gratification.

why should he accept such a humiliating position for living? It is better to take the right path even at the risk of death. Human life is meant for finishing all kinds of miseries of material existence. It's only in the human form of life that this is possible. It's not possible in animal form of life, bird form of life, reptile form of life. The form of life is not possible. The form of life of lower creatures, this elevated consciousness does not exist. There is consciousness in every form of life, but that consciousness is mainly simply used for eating, sleeping, mating, defending, just maintaining the body as far as possible, subsisting in this material existence. But human life, we have got developed consciousness. For what? To realize that I can prepare for death to put an end to all kinds of miseries of material existence. Life should be so regulated that one can achieve the desired goal of going back home, back to Godhead. Dhritarashtra, due to his wrong conception of life, had already spoiled 80% of his achieved energy. So it behooved him to utilize the remaining days of his miserly life for the ultimate good. Such a life is called miserly because one cannot properly utilize the assets of the human form of life. One who does not know the value of this body will waste this human energy simply for sense gratification. And at the end, left with nothing, which is like an asset which one can utilize in the future, can carry forward to the next life. So only spiritual assets are eternally with us. We can carry forward and utilize it always. Material assets are not going to remain with us. They will be completely lost at the time of death.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that meeting a self-realized soul like Vidura can help one overcome nescience (ignorance) and prepare for death through spiritual culture.

Only by good luck does such a miserly life, miserly man, meet a self-realized soul like Vidura. And by his instruction, by Vidura's instruction, Dhritarashtra can get rid of the nescience of material existence. What is nescience? Nescience means the ignorance, the darkness in which one is living. Material existence means there is this ignorance about who am I? What is my actual goal of life? How to solve all the problems of material existence once and for all? Make a permanent solution for these problems, not some temporary patchwork solutions. No. So that is possible by meeting a self-realized soul like Vidura and taking instructions from him how to actually prepare oneself, especially towards the end of one's life, how to prepare for facing death by spiritual culture, by spiritual practice, by spiritual enlightenment.

Simply by doing this and nothing more. That is Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's mercy. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 26th verse of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining its meaning about leaving the body in a remote place when it becomes useless, and Vidura's advice to Dhritarashtra.

In this session we will be discussing from two verses, the 26th and the 27th verses of the Shri Advaitha Gadadhara Shri Vasadi Gauravakta Vrinda of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. The 26th verse: Gata Swartham Imam Deham Virakto Mukta Bandhanaha Avignyata Gatir Jahyat Savay Dheera Udah Hruthaha. So far Vidura has been describing the condition of the Trashtra, which is a miserable condition, a degraded life he is leading, not preparing himself for death. Now he is giving a practical solution: what should the Trashtra do? He has already told him, quit home, leave home immediately and do what? That is going to come in the next few verses. So this 26th verse, the meaning is, he is called undisturbed, undisturbed means Dheera, who goes to an unknown remote place and freed from all obligations quits his material body when it has become useless. So what is the meaning of this, going to a remote unknown place and quitting the material body when one has, when the body has become useless?

**Key Quote:** "One who has spoiled his life without such cultural activities is advised to leave home without knowledge of friends and relatives, and being thus freed from all obligations of family, society, country, etc., give up the body at some unknown destination."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport on the verse, emphasizing the importance of devotional service in human life and the recommendation for those who haven't engaged in it to leave home and give up the body in an unknown place.

That is explained by Srila Prabhupada in the purport. Narottam Das Thakur, a great devotee and acharya of the Gaudiya Vaishnava sect, has sung, Narottam Das Thakur, my lord, I have simply wasted my life, having obtained the human body I have neglected to worship your lordship and therefore I have willingly drunk poison. This is a part of a song written by Srila Narottam Das Thakur, one of the previous acharyas. So Srila Prabhupada explains, in other words, the human body is especially meant for cultivating knowledge of devotion and service to the Lord, without which life becomes full of anxieties and miserable conditions. Therefore, one who has spoiled his life without such cultural activities is advised to leave home without knowledge of friends and relatives and being thus freed from all obligations of family, society, country, etc., give up the body at some unknown destination so that others may not know where and how he has met his destiny, where and how he has met his death. This is the recommendation for somebody who has not taken up devotional service to fully engage in devotional service at the time of old age. Before death comes is the best remedy for facing death and achieving perfection of the human form of life. But if somebody, let us say, is in the middle of death, has not practiced, not prepared that way then better to quit home without knowledge of friends and relatives in such a way that one may give up the body in some unknown place.

**Key Quote:** "Quit home is possible only for a dhira. Dhira means undisturbed. This is however the path of renunciation based on a frustrated life is for those who are unable to take to devotional service and are experiencing the miserable conditions especially in old age."
**Summary:** The speaker continues explaining Prabhupada's purport, defining 'dhira' as one who is undisturbed and can give up family life, and clarifying that this path of renunciation is for those frustrated with material life and unable to take up devotional service.

And without the knowledge of anyone else. So Srila Prabhupada further explains, dhira means one who is not disturbed even when there is sufficient provocation. One cannot give up a comfortable family life due to his affectionate relationship with wife and children. Self-realization is obstructed by such undue affection for family and if anyone is at all able to forget such a relation he is called undisturbed or dhira. To be able to forget that bond of affection for family members and thereby quit home is possible only for a dhira. Dhira means undisturbed. This is however the path of renunciation based on a frustrated life is for those who are unable to take to devotional service and are experiencing the miserable conditions especially in old age.

**Key Quote:** "But stabilization of such renunciation is possible only by association with bona fide saints and self-realized souls by which one can be engaged in the loving devotional service of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that renunciation alone is not enough; association with devotees and engaging in devotional service under proper guidance are crucial for stabilization and liberation, highlighting Dhritarashtra's fortune in having Vidura's association.

But Srila Prabhupada says this is a recommendation of accepting the path of renunciation based on frustrated life. But stabilization of such renunciation is possible only by association with bona fide saints and self-realized souls by which one can be engaged in the loving devotional service of the Lord. So what is Prabhupada saying here? That you may accept the path of renunciation giving up the miserable condition of material existence based on experiencing frustration living such a miserable life. But you cannot become stable and fixed up in that renounced life. Simply by going away from home and remaining undisturbed. No. You have to positively engage in pure devotional service under the guidance of pure devotees like Vidura. Sincere surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is possible by awakening the transcendental sense of service. This is called awakening of the divine sense of service. This is made possible by association with pure devotees of the Lord. Sadhu Sangha. Dhritarashtra was lucky enough to have a brother whose very association was a source of liberation for his frustrated life. So Dhritarashtra was very very fortunate because Vidura specially came to the palace of Hastinapura to deliver Dhritarashtra.

So he is our top most well wisher. He is our best guide. He is most dependable. He is always ready to enlighten us, to guide us, to protect us, to give us strength. So leave home depending. So, Srila Pravapada says the idea is that the renounced order of life after a frustrated life of sentiment in the material world may be the stepping stone on the path of self-realization. But real perfection of the path of liberation is attained when one is practiced to depend fully on the personality of Godhead who lives in everyone's heart, as Paramatma so it is necessary for everyone regardless of how they plan to quit household life and enter spiritual life regardless of that everyone should prepare themselves to depend fully on Krishna within the heart by learning this from an expert devotee learning this from an expert devotee so Srila Prabhupada says one may live in the darkest jungle alone out of home but a steadfast devotee knows very well that he is never alone how can one understand I'm never alone because the Supreme Personality of God it is with him and he can protect his sincere devotee in any awkward circumstance this who's living in your heart the Paramatma the Supreme Lord Krishna he is supremely powerful he is a supreme controller so he can arrange for you a devotee he can arrange for his devotee anything the devotee wants especially even the devotee's craving for self-realization Krishna can make all

One should therefore practice devotions service at home hearing and chanting the holy name quality form pass times entourage etc in association with pure devotees and this practice will help anyone fromude to purification of feelings or emotions of pureness and the same with one's Emergencies but also with with several other qualities He also stands there for this conversation but everything in all ournsinnas have different Representatives and so these can be a work of meditation everything as well only for those people who are conscious one awaken God consciousness in proportion to one's sensitive purpose. So Prabhupada is giving us directions. If at all you want to be able to fully depend on Krishna towards the end of your life, then prepare, begin preparation for it now by associating with devotees and practicing chanting, hearing about Krishna's holy name, Krishna's qualities, Krishna's pastimes described in the Bhagavatam, etc. Prepare yourself by this practice and then Krishna will actually guide you, help you, Krishna will purify you and you can actually seriously take up Krishna consciousness in this way. One who desires material benefit by such devotional activities can never depend on God consciousness. one who desires material benefits by electing Kristina's material benefits will depend on the Supreme Personality of Godhead although the Supreme Lord is seated in everyone's heart as Paramarckim. So to actually depend on Krishna means never to accept any material benefits from devotional service. The materialistic devotees, who are materialistic devotees, they want the material benefit by doing a devotional service.

We are discussing Dhritarashtra quitting home on the instruction of Vidura. Vidura has come to the palace of Yudhishthira in order to instruct Dhritarashtra. So Vidura is speaking to Dhritarashtra. This 28th verse also is spoken by Vidura to Dhritarashtra, continuing his instructions: Atho Deechim Disham Yathu Svair Adnyata Gathir Bhavan Itorvak Prayashak Kalah Pumsam Gunavikar Shanah.

So Srila Prabhupada explains all these terms. What is the meaning of 'leave for the north,' and what is the time being referred to here? So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "One can compensate for a life of frustration by becoming a Dheera, or leaving home for good without communicating with relatives." And Vidura advised his eldest brother to adopt this way without delay because very quickly the age of Kali was approaching. The age referred to here is the age of Kali, which is fast approaching. Dwapar Yuga is going to come to an end, and Kali Yuga is going to begin. And what is the characteristic of the age of Kali? And that is told in the verse. The verse, it said, Pumsam Gunavikar Shanah, that which will diminish the good qualities of men, that which will deteriorate the good qualities of people in general.

**Summary:** The speaker continues to discuss the degradation caused by material association in all Yugas, with Kali Yuga representing the lowest point, and Dhritarashtra's need to leave home before its full influence sets in.

So Srila Prabhupada says regarding this age of Kali fast approaching, Srila Prabhupada says, "A conditioned soul is already degraded by the material association, whether Satya Yuga or Dwapar Yuga, or Treta Yuga or Kali Yuga, all Yugas. This material association is already degrading our consciousness by the power of illusion, the power of the three Gunas. And still in the Kali Yuga, the good qualities of a man will deteriorate to the lowest standard. Satya Yuga was the best age, and then little degradation when Treta Yuga set in, and even more little degradation when Dwapar Yuga set in, but Kali Yuga is the lowest. The maximum deterioration happens in Kali Yuga." Dhritarashtra was advised to leave home before Kali Yuga approached because the atmosphere which is created by Vidura, his valuable instructions on the facts of life, would fade away due to the influence of the age which was fast approaching.

**Key Quote:** "Human life is simply meant for self realization, but due to this dangerous age, men have completely forgotten the aim of life."
**Summary:** The speaker describes symptoms of Kali Yuga, including the forgetting of self-realization as the aim of life and the prevalence of unrestricted sense gratification.

Some symptoms of Kali Yuga are mentioned by Srila Prabhupada in another purport, in the beginning of the Bhagavatam, first canto, first chapter. Srila Prabhupada says about the age of Kali, "The age of Kali is very dangerous for the human being. Human life is simply meant for self realization, but due to this dangerous age, men have completely forgotten the aim of life." It's characteristic of Kali Yuga. We see everywhere around us, people do not know what is the aim of life. Most people lead a life without any particular aim. Of course, there is always a default aim, that is sense enjoyment, sense gratification. That's common for all living beings throughout the creation, at all times, in all places, in all circumstances. That's common, sense enjoyment. But in Kali Yuga, even this sense enjoyment, they are not cautious to exercise certain restrained. Unrestricted sense gratification is the norm in Kali Yuga.

**Key Quote:** "In this age of Kali, the life span will gradually decrease, people will gradually lose their memory, they will lose their finer sentiments, they will lose their strength, and they will lose their better qualities."
**Summary:** The speaker details the negative consequences of Kali Yuga, such as decreased lifespan, loss of memory and finer sentiments, and the complete absorption in sense gratification, leading to the neglect of self-realization.

So it is been explained in the scriptures, in this age of Kali, the life span will gradually decrease, people will gradually lose their memory, they will lose their finer sentiments, they will lose their strength, and they will lose their better qualities. A list of the anomalies of this age is given in the 12th canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam. And so this age is very difficult for those who want to utilize this life for self-realization. The scriptures say there is only one aim of the human form of life, that is self-realization. But in general, people in the material world are inclined to sense gratification, and they don't take the aim of life as self-realization very seriously, especially in the age of Kali. They almost completely forget that the aim of life is self-realization. So people are so busy with sense gratification that they completely forget about self-realization. Out of madness, they frankly say there is no need for self-realization because they do not realize that this brief life is but a moment on our great journey towards self-realization.

**Key Quote:** "The whole system of education in Kali Yuga is geared to sense gratification."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the current education system, focused on sense gratification, with the traditional gurukula system, which emphasized self-realization and livelihood training.

Generally self-realization takes many lifetimes. So as we progress in self-realization life after life, life after life, life after life, then each duration of life, life in a particular body, is a brief moment, that's all. Made little progress, some more progress, some more progress, like that. The whole system of education in Kali Yuga is geared to sense gratification. And if a learned man thinks it over, he sees that the children of this age are being intentionally sent to the slaughterhouses of so-called education. This is not the case in the former ages. Children were educated in a gurukula, and in the gurukula, the primary education that was given was that this human form of life is very precious. It should be utilized only for self-realization. And of course there was also the teaching of how to earn one's livelihood by different prescribed methods. The brahmanas, the kshatriyas, the vaishyas, they used to undergo training in the gurukula. So they were trained in the prime necessity of human life, that is self-realization, and they were also trained in how to earn their livelihood. Both training was given. But in this age of Kali, there is no training about self-realization at all. Even in the so-called schools and educational institutions, it's almost completely forgotten.

**Summary:** The speaker advises caution in Kali Yuga and suggests following the guidance of saintly persons and scriptures like Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam to cross the ocean of material existence.

Learned men therefore must be cautious of this age, and if they at all want to cross over the dangerous ocean of Kali, they must follow the footsteps of great saintly persons like the sages Naimisharanya. And they should accept, like the sages Naimisharanya accepted Suta Goswami, they should accept Suta Goswami or his bona fide representative as the captain of the ship. What is a ship? Like in an ocean, to cross an ocean you take help of a ship. Similarly, the ship for crossing the ocean of Kali is described here as the message of Lord Sri Krishna in the shape of Bhagavad Gita, Shreemad Bhagavatam. So the Bhagavatam suggests that hear the message of Krishna in the Shreemad Bhagavatam or the Bhagavad Gita, and thereby prepare oneself to cross this ocean of material existence or the ocean of the age of Kali.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Vidura's instruction to Dhritarashtra is tailored to his situation, highlighting the difficulty of becoming a Narottama (first-class devotee) for ordinary people due to sinful acts, referencing Bhagavad Gita 7.28.

Now Srila Prabhupada explains that Vidura is giving specific instruction to Dhritarashtra considering Dhritarashtra's current position. What is his situation? So Srila Prabhupada explains, "The best is to become a Narottama, or a first class human being, depending completely on the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna." Now this is not possible for any ordinary man to become a Narottama, or a first class human being. A first class personality is not possible for a human being in which one completely depends on the Supreme Lord. Such a situation is not possible for an ordinary human being. Why is it not possible for an ordinary human being? It is stated in the Bhagavad Gita in the 7th chapter and 28th verse that a person who is completely relieved of all taints of sinful acts can alone depend on the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna, the personality of Godhead: Ye shantu antagatam papam Jananam punyakarmanam Tedvam dhamoha nirmukta Bhajan temam dhridam vrataham.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Dhritarashtra is advised by Vibhira to at least become a Dheera."
**Summary:** The speaker outlines three stages of spiritual advancement - Dheera, Sanyasi, and Narottama - and emphasizes that becoming a Dheera (one who is detached) is the minimum requirement for preparing for death and self-realization, concluding with a summary of Vidura's advice to Dhritarashtra.

This is not possible for ordinary people. Dhritarashtra is advised by Vibhira to at least become a Dheera. Three stages: Dheera, a Sanyasi, and Narottama. So Dheera is the lowest, the least one can do to prepare oneself for death, for Self Realization. So Dhritarashtra advised Vibhira at least to become a Dheera in the beginning, if it were impossible for him to become a Sanyasi or a Narottama. Lowest is Dheera, better than that is Sanyasi, better than that, best is Narottama. Persistently endeavoring on the line of Self Realization helps a person to rise to the conditions of a Narottama from the stage of a Dheera. Gradually rise to the top most platform. The Dheera stage is attained after prolonged practice of the Yoga system, but by the grace of Vidura, one can attain this stage immediately simply by willing to adopt the means of the Dheera stage, which is the preparatory stage for Sanyas. The Sanyas stage is the preparatory stage of Paramahamsa, or the first great devotee of the Lord, also called Narottama. So this is the advice of Vidura for Dhritarashtra. Consider Dhritarashtra's situation. He was completely entangled. So to pull him out, extricate him from the entanglement, at least leave home and go to a secluded place and prepare yourself by being undisturbed. So that is the advice Vidura is giving to Dhritarashtra. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the importance of associating with pure devotees (sadhus), quoting Chaitanya Mahaprabhu on how even a moment's association can lead to perfection.

In these words, Anuja means the younger brother. So the strong words of Vidura had a very nice impact on the heart of Dhritarashtra. He was able to cut off all the strong familial ties and he became determined. He immediately left home. Vidura was not delivered. collect вжеi ki Bopamanna Varasi Tal. Immediately left home. And that is the wonderful effect of the association of a pure devotee Vidura. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the great preacher of the principles of Srimad Bhagavatam, has stressed the importance of association with sadhus or pure devotees of the Lord. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita. Sadhu means a pure devotee, not one with a long beard or one with a particular type of tilak or talak, or one with a particular type of robes. No, this is not sadhu. Sadhu means a pure devotee. So, sadhu is bhajate mam ananyabhak, one who is engaged in pure devotional service without even a little deviation. So, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has said that even a moment's association with a pure devotee can help one achieve all perfection. What is the verse Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says? Sadhu Sangha Sadhu Sangha Sarva Shastra Koi. Lava Matra Sadhu Sanghe Sarva Siddhi Hoi. The meaning of this verse in the Chaitanya Charitamrita, this is said by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu: The verdict of all revealed scriptures is that, by even a moment's association with a pure devotee, one can achieve all perfection. The verdict of all revealed scriptures is that, by even a moment's association with a pure devotee, one can achieve all perfection. Lava Matra. Lava is just one moment. Actually, Shri Lapa Prabhupada says, this Lava Matra Sadhu Sangha, a brief moment. What is the duration of that brief moment? According to astronomical calculation, Lava means one eleventh of a second. Lava means one eleventh of a second. It is less than one second. It is one eleventh of a second. So, so little association is very, very valuable. So, so little association is very, very valuable.

**Key Quote:** "Without seeing him at that opportune moment, he said, we could have become a very great business magnate, but never would we have been able to walk the path of liberation and be engaged in the factual service of the Lord"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the value of association with devotees, referencing another verse from Bhagavatam and Srila Prabhupada's experience with his spiritual master, highlighting the transformative power of such association.

There is one more verse in the Bhagavatam. It is said... tulayama lave naapi na svaryam na punar bhavam... tulayama lave naapi na svaryam na punar bhavam... Bhagavat Sanghi Sanghasya... Bhagavat Sanghi Sanghasya... martyanaam kim utashishah... lava also the same duration of time is being used. The meaning of this Bhagavatam verse is: the value of a moment's association with a devotee of the Lord cannot be compared even to the attainment of heavenly planets or liberation from matter, and what to speak of worldly benedictions in the form of material prosperity which is for those who are meant for death. So it's very, very, very, very valuable to have even a brief association with a pure devotee of the supreme law, that is the teaching of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. So Srila Prabhupada says about his own life in this purport, he says, we are not ashamed to admit this fact, that we experienced this particular teaching of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in our practical life. Srila Prabhupada experienced this. Were we not favoured by His Divine Grace, Sri Madbhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaj, by our first meeting for a few minutes only, it would not have been possible for us to accept this mighty task of describing Sri Madbhagavatam in English. Srila Prabhupada, while writing this purport, in the first canto, he is recollecting his first meeting with his spiritual master, Sri Srimadbhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaj. Without seeing him at that opportune moment, he said, we could have become a very great business magnate, but never would we have been able to walk the path of liberation and be engaged in the factual service of the Lord under the instructions of His Divine Grace, Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur. So that meeting was a turning point in the life of Srila Prabhupada. Completely everything changed.

#### Vidura, Dhritarashtra, detachment, sadhu, motivation

**Key Quote:** "He just spoke some words, but those words pierced the heart of Dhritarashtra and made such an impact that Dhritarashtra was able to cut off all material attachments and immediately leave home and proceed towards the north for self-realization."
**Summary:** The speaker returns to the example of Vidura and Dhritarashtra, emphasizing how a sadhu's words can sever material attachments and lead to self-realization, and that a sadhu's motivation is to enlighten others.

Though, we should not disregard the fact that Srila Prabhupada was born to a pure devotee. His father was a pure devotee, Gaur Mohan Dey. He was a pure devotee. And Prabhupada was trained in devotional service right from his infancy by his father. That is explained in Prabhupada's biography. But nevertheless, what is the example? Here is another practical example by the action of Vidura's association with Dhritarashtra. What is the effect of Vidura coming to the palace and instructing Dhritarashtra? He just spoke some words, but those words pierced the heart of Dhritarashtra and made such an impact that Dhritarashtra was able to cut off all material attachments and immediately leave home and proceed towards the north for self-realization. So, it is also told that a sadhu's words are meant for cutting off the material bonds of attachment. And it is also told in the Shastra that a sadhu should not flatter. How sadhu? A sadhu should not flatter householders or people who are attached simply for the sake of getting some dakshina or some viksha. No. For maintaining himself, a sadhu is fully dependent on Krishna and he is confident that Krishna will protect him under all circumstances and provide him with the basic needs. So, why does a sadhu go begging? It is an excuse to enter a householder's garden in order to enlighten the householder, like Vidura is doing.

**Key Quote:** "And yet, despite his life of failure, materially speaking, it was a life of failure, he achieved the greatest of all success in self-realization by the forceful instructions of a pure devotee of the Lord, who is the typical emblem of a sadhu."
**Summary:** The speaker details Dhritarashtra's life of material ambition and ultimate failure, contrasting it with his success in self-realization through Vidura's guidance.

So, Dhritarashtra was tightly bound in a network of material affinities related to politics, economy and family attachment. And Dhritarashtra, he did everything in his power to achieve so-called success in his planned projects, because he could not lay a claim for ascending the throne, even though he was the eldest son of his father. He could not ascend the throne because he was blind by birth. But, he had the desire and when his younger brother Pandu, after ascending the throne, died untimely, immediately Dhritarashtra got the opportunity to sit on the throne, at least as a caretaker king. Nobody else was there. So, he was the caretaker king. Then, he started planning how I can retain this throne for myself and my eldest son, Duryodhana. So, he made so many plans. But, he was frustrated from the beginning to the end, so far as his material activities were concerned. He could not continue. But, when he was still on the throne, he lost the post of the emperor when, in the battle of Kurukshetra, all his sons were defeated and killed in the battle. And he himself completely lost everything. All his well-wishers and his position and his sons and his wealth, everything he lost. And yet, despite his life of failure, materially speaking, it was a life of failure, he achieved the greatest of all success in self-realization by the forceful instructions of a pure devotee of the Lord, who is the typical emblem of a sadhu. A pure devotee of the Lord. A pure devotee of the Lord. A pure devotee is a true sadhu. He is a true saintly person. His words can penetrate the heart through the layers of ignorance and instantly cleanse the heart.

#### compassion, Shukadeva Goswami, association with devotees, detachment, self-realization

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "This material world is a world of great illusion. And only by such association of pure devotees or genuine saints can we actually cut off our attachments."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating the importance of associating with sadhus, drawing parallels with Shukadeva Goswami's compassion and emphasizing the power of such association to break material bonds and guide one towards self-realization.

That's why as a sadhu, he goes door to door and speaks. In the Bhagavatam also, it is said, Shukadeva Goswami, Suta Goswami, glorified Shukadeva Goswami, that Shukadeva Goswami, out of compassion for the suffering humanity, spoke the Bhagavatam. Karunaya aha purana guhyam. Samsarinam karunaya aha purana guhyam. Out of compassion for the suffering souls of this world, Shukadeva Goswami spoke the Bhagavatam. So, same thing. Vidura spoke the words of enlightenment and Dhritarashtra became completely detached and left home and middle. The scriptures enjoin, therefore, that one should associate with sadhus only, rejecting all other kinds of association. Asasangatyagye Vaishnavachar. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, reject association of materialistic persons, even though in their association, somebody may enjoy some material, sense gratification. But that's not important. That's available in all species of life. Even to those in hell, sense gratification is available. What to speak of others? So, that's not important. What is important is the association of sadhus or pure devotees, who can cut the bonds of material affection and free us from this material bondage and direct us from this bondage, and direct us for self-realization. This material world is a world of great illusion, and only by such association of pure devotees or genuine saints can we actually cut off our attachments, by hearing them attentively and by taking their words very seriously, understanding them to be the best well-wishers and taking their words seriously and cutting off this bondage and following their instructions how to proceed on the path of self-realization. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

#### Vidura, Hastinapura, Duryodhana's Insult, Vidura's Pilgrimage
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/58fbM0TAqxU?t=49
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Vidura left the palace and went away not because exactly that he was insulted by Duryodhana, but because he was not interested in any material comforts or materialistic way of life."
**Summary:** The lecture begins with an introduction to verses 3 and 4 of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on Vidura's return to Hastinapura, the joy of the inhabitants, and the circumstances of Vidura's departure due to Duryodhana's insult and his own desire for spiritual advancement.

In this session, we will be discussing the third and fourth verses of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Since there is a long purport for these two verses given by Srila Prabhupada, we will discuss this in two parts. So this session will be discussing part one of the purport. The third and fourth verses are given together. I shall read them together. So the third and fourth verses are given together, their translation: "When they saw Vidura return to the palace, all the inhabitants—Maharaj Yudhishthira, his younger brothers, Dhritarashtra, Satyaki, Sanjaya, Kripacharya, Kunti, Gandhari, Draupadi, Subhadra, Uttara, Kripi, many other wives of the Kauravas, and other ladies with children—all hurried to him in great delight. It so appeared that they had regained their consciousness after a long period." This indicates how dear Vidura was to all the inhabitants of the palace of Hastinapura. Foolishly, Duryodhana insulted Vidura, though Vidura was a well-wisher of Dhritarashtra and all the Kauravas. But Duryodhana, he very foolishly, in a narrow-minded way, he thought somehow that Vidura was against his real welfare, while the opposite was true. Vidura was actually advising Dhritarashtra for the well-being of Dhritarashtra and their entire family members, but Duryodhana thought otherwise. And when Duryodhana, out of foolishness, he insulted Vidura, Vidura left the palace and went away, not because exactly that he was insulted by Duryodhana, but because he was not interested in any material comforts or materialistic way of life. His interest was in Krishna consciousness, and he thought it wise to go on a pilgrimage and travel to holy places, searching for a suitable pure devotee of the Lord to hear Krishna katha and inquire about spirituality from such a bonafide, proper devotee. So it was described in the previous words that Vidura was on pilgrimage. He actually went searching for a pure devotee. He came in contact with Maitreya Muni. He inquired from Maitreya Muni, and after he got conviction that the ultimate goal is to be established in transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord Krishna, after that, he stopped putting questions to Maitreya and returned to Hastinapura.

**Key Quote:** "All of them they were very very joyful to receive him back after he had left and gone means they were not happy that he left."
**Summary:** The segment describes the joyful reception of Vidura upon his return and introduces the upcoming discussion of the histories of Gandhari, Kunti, Draupadi, and Subhadra as described in the purport.

Now, what are the purpose of return to Hastinapura? That will be made clear in the next few verses. But here, when he returned, all the inhabitants of Hastinapura were not the same as he had been in the past. Also, that palace, Maharaj Yudhishthira, the brothers of Yudhishthira, Kunti, Gandhari, Draupadi, and so many other ladies with children, all of them, they were very, very joyful to receive him back after he had left and gone, means they were not happy that he left. Duryodhana foolishly insulted Vidura, but Vidura was actually a real well-wisher, and he was very dear to all the other members of the family. So they all felt great delight when Vidura returned, and they went to receive him, and they were appearing to have regained their consciousness after a long time. It appeared like that they were so happy, so joyful. So Srila Prabhupada in the Purport describes the four different personalities mentioned in this verse: the brief history of Gandhari, Kunti, Draupadi, and Subhadra. These four personalities' history, brief history, is given by Srila Prabhupada in the Purport.

#### Gandhari's History, Chastity, Worship of Lord Shiva, Marriage to Dhritarashtra, Blindness

**Key Quote:** "She wrapped up her eyes with many silk linens and she was married to Tirtharashtra under the guidance of her elder brother Shakuni."
**Summary:** The lecture details Gandhari's history, emphasizing her chastity, her worship of Lord Shiva, her marriage to the blind Dhritarashtra, and her decision to voluntarily blind herself.

So first of all, Prabhupada describes the history of Gandhari. Gandhari is the mother of the Kauravas. She is the wife of Dhritarashtra, and she is being described here by Srila Prabhupada, "the ideal chaste lady in the history of the world." Such a glorious description of Gandhari, "ideal chaste lady." Now, why she is described in this way will be very clear in the later parts of this description. She was the daughter of Maharaj Subala, the king of Gandhara. Now, this Gandhara is known as Kandahar in Kabul, Afghanistan. And in her maiden state, Gandhari worshipped Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva is generally worshipped by Hindu maidens to get a good husband. Gandhari satisfied Lord Shiva, and by his benediction, to obtain 100 sons, she was betrothed to Dhritarashtra despite his being blind forever. Dhritarashtra was very powerful Kshatriya, but he had that blindness from birth. He was born blind. When Gandhari came to know that her would-be husband was a blind man, to follow her life companion, she decided to become voluntarily blind. These are the characteristics of a chaste lady, a chaste wife. She voluntarily decided to become blind. So what did she do? She wrapped up her eyes with many silk linens, and she was married to Dhritarashtra under the guidance of her elder brother Shakuni. She was the most beautiful girl of her time, and she was equally qualified by her womanly qualities, which endeared every member of the Kaurava court. Despite all her good qualities, she had the natural frailties of a woman.

#### Envy of Kunti, Birth of 100 Sons, Kurukshetra War, Advice to Dhritarashtra

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "When the intrigue of the battle of Kurukshetra was going on, she was not in favour of fighting with the Pandavas, rather she blamed Dhritarashtra her husband for such a fratricidal war."
**Summary:** The segment continues Gandhari's story, describing her envy of Kunti, the miraculous birth of her 100 sons, her disapproval of the Kurukshetra War, and her attempts to advise Dhritarashtra.

And she was envious of Kunti when the latter gave birth to a male child. Both the queens were pregnant, but Kunti first gave birth to a male child. Thus, Gandhari became angry and gave a blow to her own abdomen. As a result, she gave birth to a lump of flesh only. But since she was a devotee of Vyasadeva, by the instruction of Vyasadeva, the lump was divided into 100 parts, and each part gradually developed to become a male child. Thus, her ambition to become the mother of 100 sons was fulfilled, and she began to nourish all the children according to her exalted position. When the intrigue of the battle of Kurukshetra was going on, she was not in favor of fighting with the Pandavas. Rather, she blamed Dhritarashtra, her husband, for such a fratricidal war. She desired that the state be divided into two parts from the sons of Pandu and her own sons. She was very affected by this when all her sons died in the battle of Kurukshetra, and she wanted to curse Bhishmadeva and Yudhishthira, but she was checked by Vyasadeva. So you can understand, she is a very chaste lady. She is very faithful to her husband, but still she advised based on proper religious principles, and she actually felt grief when she lost all her 100 sons in the battle of Kurukshetra. Her mourning over the death of Duryodhana and Dushasana before Lord Krishna was very pitiful, and Lord Krishna pacified her by transcendental messages.

**Summary:** The lecture concludes Gandhari's history with her mourning over the death of her sons, her pacification by Lord Krishna and Vyasadeva, and her eventual death in a forest fire along with Dhritarashtra.

Always in the Vedic culture, when somebody is grieved due to the death of a near and dear one, they are pacified by transcendental messages from the Vedic literature. That is the only way one can become pacified. Further, it is described by Srila Prabhupada, she was equally grieved on the death of Karna, and she described to Lord Krishna the lamentation of Karna's wife. She was pacified by Shri Vyasadeva when he showed her dead sons, then promoted to the heavenly kingdom. She died along with her husband in the jungles of the Himalayas near the mouth of the Ganges. She burned in a forest fire. Maharaj Yudhishthira performed the death ceremony of his uncle and aunt. Then Srila Prabhupada describes Kunti Devi's brief history.

**Key Quote:** "Durvasa Muni gave her a mantra by which it was possible for her to call any devata she pleased."
**Summary:** The lecture transitions to Kunti's history, detailing her birth, adoption, service to Durvasa Muni, the mantra she received, and her invocation of Suryadeva, leading to the birth of Karna before her marriage.

Kunti Devi was born as the daughter of Maharaj Shurasena, and she was a sister of Vasudeva. Vasudeva was Lord Krishna's father. Later, Kunti was adopted by Maharaj Kunti Bhoja, and hence she is known as Kunti. She was born as the daughter of Maharaj Shurasena, but she was adopted by Kunti Bhoja, and therefore she is called Kunti. She is the incarnation of the success potency of the personality. You got it. The heavenly denizens used from the upper planets used to visit the palace of King Kunti Bhoja, and Kunti was engaged for their reception. In former times, people were very pious, that the pious people of the earth were very strict in following all the rules and regulations, so they were visited by the devatas, and devatas were visible on this earth planet whenever they used to visit here because people were pious. In Kali Yuga, because of the sinful activities having increased too much, we cannot see the devatas even when they come to this material world. Now, whenever these heavenly denizens used to visit King Kunti Bhoja's palace, Kunti was engaged for their reception. She also happened to serve the great mystic sage Durvasa Muni, and being satisfied by her faithful service, Durvasa Muni gave her a mantra by which it was possible for her to call any devata she pleased. As a matter of inquisitiveness, she at once called for the sun god Suryadeva. Now, this Suryadeva, when he was called, he immediately desired couplement with her, but she declined. But the sun god assured her that she would be not adulterated, her virginity would not be adulterated, that she would be given immunity from the adulteration of her virginity. So she agreed to that proposal. As a result of this couplement, she became pregnant, and Karna was born by her. This is before her marriage to Pandu. So by the grace of the sun, she again turned into a virgin girl, but being afraid of her parents, she quitted the newly born child Karna. After that, when she actually selected her own husband, she preferred Pandu to be her husband.

**Summary:** The lecture concludes with the explanation of how Kunti used her mantra to invoke devatas and bear children for Pandu due to his curse, leading to the birth of the Pandavas, and announces the continuation of the discussion in the next session.

Now, Pandu was under a curse that he could not conceive children from his wife Kunti. So therefore, Kunti had to use that mantra to call upon devatas to bear children for Pandu, and that's how the five Pandavas, sorry, the first three Pandavas were born from Kunti, and two other Pandavas were born from Madri. So there is more description which we will continue to discuss in the next session. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "The two co-wives namely Kunti and Madri decided that Kunti should live for the maintenance of the five minor children, the Pandavas and Madri should accept the Sati rituals"
**Summary:** The speaker continues the history of Kunti Devi, describing Pandu's death, Madri's decision to perform Sati, and Kunti's responsibility to raise the Pandavas, highlighting the Vedic culture and the role of sages in endorsing these decisions.

So, we continue to discuss the purport from the previous session. We were discussing the history given by Srila Prabhupada about Kunti Devi. So, continuing to describe the history of Kunti Devi from where it was stopped in the previous session. It was described that Kunti Devi, after marrying Pandu because Pandu could not beget any children in his wives, so Kunti Devi was requested to call upon the Devatas by using the mantra given to her by Durvasamuni, and she called upon three different personalities: Yamaraj, Vayudeva, and Indrava, and begot Yudhishthira, Bhima, and Arjuna. Then, Madri also wanted to begot children. So, Kunti Devi taught her the mantra, and she begot twins, Nakula and Sahadeva, by calling upon the Ashwini Kumaras. And in this way, Kunti Devi was called upon by Durvasamuni and Indra. This way, Pandu had five sons through his two wives. Then, it is described that Maharaj Pandu died at an early age, for which Kunti was so aggrieved that she fainted. The two co-wives, namely Kunti and Madri, decided that Kunti should live for the maintenance of the five minor children, the Pandavas, and Madri should accept the Sati rituals by meeting voluntary death along with her husband Pandu. This agreement was endorsed by great sages like Shatashringa and others present on the occasion. This is the meaning of chaste wife or chaste wives. One of them decided to undergo Sati rituals, and the other one decided to stay back as a widow for taking care of the five minor children, and this was approved by great sages like Shatashringa.

#### Vedic Scriptures, Self-Realization, Human Life, Sense Gratification

**Key Quote:** "This human life is not simply meant for enjoying some sense gratification while life is there in the body. But the Vedas give us the higher purpose of life that we can become self-realized and attain eternal life"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of following Vedic scriptures for self-realization and attaining eternal life, contrasting it with the modern focus on sense gratification and warning against wasting the human form of life.

So, the Vedic culture, everybody follows the Vedic scriptures as explained and endorsed by the great sages who are well versed in this Vedic literature. So, it is a perfect society that is based on the principles given in the Vedas: How civilized human beings must live in this world with the ultimate aim of self-realization. This human life is not simply meant for enjoying some sense gratification while life is there in the body. No. That is the modern understanding. But the Vedas give us the higher purpose of life, that we can become self-realized and attain eternal life in the spiritual abode of the Supreme Lord. Go back to Him to associate with Him and live with Him eternally, full of bliss and knowledge. That is the special purpose, the special prerogative of the human form of life. People do not know this in the modern age, and in ignorance, they are simply living like animals. So, therefore, Srila Prabhupada and all the Acharyas and the scriptures and the great Rishis, they are warning us: Don't waste the human form of life simply in sense gratification. You may not get this opportunity again, though you will take birth again in this world. You may take birth in a lower species, and again to evolve the consciousness from the lower species to human form takes millions of years. So don't miss this chance; otherwise, you have to wait millions of years to again get this chance for eternal life free from all miseries, all kinds of ignorance and suffering.

**Key Quote:** "Later on when the Pandavas were banished from the kingdom by the intrigues of Duryodhana, Kunti followed her sons and she equally faced all sorts of difficulties during those days in exile"
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of Kunti, describing her trials during the Pandavas' exile, including the encounters with Hidimba and Bakasura, and the circumstances surrounding Draupadi's marriage to the five Pandavas.

This is the opportunity. So, all these great personalities that are described in the Bhagavatam, in the Puranas, the great devotees, the great saintly persons, they lived a life based on the scriptural directions, and they attained perfection. So, the description continues. Later on, when the Pandavas were banished from the kingdom by the intrigues of Duryodhana, Kunti followed her sons, and she equally faced all sorts of difficulties during those days in exile. During the forest life, one demon girl, Hidimba, wanted Bhima as her husband. Now, this is Kshatriya Dharma: If some woman or girl approaches a Kshatriya and begs for shelter, protection, because women have to be protected, and if they don't have protection, they can approach a Kshatriya and beg for protection. Bhima refused this girl. But when the girl approached Kunti and Yudhishthira, they ordered Bhima to accept her proposal and give her a son. As a result of this combination between Bhima and this Hidimba, Ghatotkaja was born, and he fought very valiantly with his father against the Kauravas in the battle of Kurukshetra. In their forest life, the Pandavas along with Kunti Devi, they lived with a Brahmana family that was in trouble because of one Bakasura demon, and Kunti ordered Bhima to kill the Bakasura demon to protect the Brahmana family against troubles created by the demon. She advised Yudhishthira to start for Panchala Desha. Draupadi was gained in this Panchala Desha by Arjuna, but by order of Kunti, all the five Pandava brothers became equally the husbands of Panchali or Draupadi. She was married with the five Pandavas.

**Key Quote:** "So people sometimes wonder how can Draupadi be considered as a chaste lady when she had five husbands. So it is explained that on the order of Kunti though Draupadi actually was gained in this Swayamvara of Draupadi only by Arjuna"
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the question of Draupadi's chastity despite having five husbands, explaining that it was due to Kunti's order and approved by Vyasadeva, emphasizing Draupadi's extraordinary nature.

In the presence of Vyasadeva. Again, Draupadi accepted five husbands is not the norm. A chaste woman accepts only one husband. So people sometimes wonder how can Draupadi be considered as a chaste lady when she had five husbands. So it is explained that on the order of Kunti, though Draupadi actually was gained in this Swayamvara of Draupadi only by Arjuna, so she should have married Arjuna alone. But Kunti Devi ordered Draupadi to accept all the five brothers as her husband. And this was approved by Vyasadeva, the great sage, based on the scriptures. So she is an extraordinary personality. Draupadi is described elsewhere by Srila Prabhupada as a partial incarnation of Lakshmi. So Draupadi is a transcendental personality. She is not an ordinary woman. So therefore, we can't view this Draupadi having five husbands as unchaste on her part to have more than one husband.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Kunti's devotion, including her lament for Karna, her prayers to Lord Krishna, and her severe penance in the forest, highlighting her dedication to self-realization.

Kunti Devi never forgot her first child, Karna, who was born before Kunti's marriage. And after Karna's death in the battle of Kurukshetra, she lamented and admitted before her other sons that Karna was her eldest son prior to her marriage with Maharaja Pandu. She admitted. Her prayers for the Lord after the battle of Kurukshetra, when Lord Krishna was going back home, she excellently explained. She is a pure devotee of Krishna. So she offered wonderful prayers, and it has become immortalized in the Bhagavatam. So in those prayers, we come to know what is the transcendental position of Lord Krishna, very nicely explained by Kunti Devi. Later, she went to the forest with Gandhari for severe penance. She used to take meals after 30 days. See, this is proof that Kunti Devi is actually a great devotee. Because for the sake of self-realization, she underwent fasting, taking meals only once in 30 days. Who can do this? Not possible for some ordinary people. She finally sat down in profound meditation and later burned to ashes in a forest fire.

**Key Quote:** "Subhadra was very dear sister to both Krishna and Balarama the two brothers and sisters are represented in the famous Jagannath temple at Puri"
**Summary:** The speaker shifts to describing Subhadra, Krishna's sister, mentioning her birth, her relationship with Krishna and Balarama, and her representation in the Jagannath temple, linking it to the meeting of Radha and Krishna.

Then there is a description of Subhadra. Subhadra was the daughter of Vasudeva and sister of Lord Sri Krishna. In the 10th canto of the Bhagavatam, it is described that Vasudeva and Devaki gave birth to 8 sons and 1 daughter, Subhadra, and the 8th son is Krishna, and 6 of her children were killed by Kamsa, Shadgarbha it is called, and the 7th son was actually Balarama, but he was transferred from Devaki's womb to Rohini's womb, so when he was actually born, he appeared as the son of Rohini, but initially for 7 months he was in the womb of Devaki, so therefore it is described here. Subhadra was very dear sister to both Krishna and Balarama. The two brothers and sisters are represented in the famous Jagannath temple at Puri, and the temple is still visited by thousands of pilgrims daily. Jagannath Baldev Subhadra Maharani Ki Jai! The three are present in the deity form in this particular temple as the two brothers and sister. This temple is in remembrance of the Lord's visit at Kurukshetra during an occasion of solar eclipse and his subsequent meeting with the residents of Vrindavan. The meeting of Radha and Krishna during this occasion is a very pathetic story, and Lord Sri Chaitanya in the ecstasy of Srimati Radharani always pined for Lord Sri Krishna Jagannath Puri.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Arjuna kidnapping Subhadra with Krishna's advice, their subsequent marriage, the birth of Abhimanyu, and Subhadra's solace upon the birth of Pariksit, concluding the lecture.

While Arjuna was at Dwaraka, he wanted to have Subhadra as his queen, and he expressed his desire to Lord Krishna. Sri Krishna knew that his elder brother, Lord Baladeva, was arranging Subhadra's marriage elsewhere, and since he did not dare to go against the arrangement of Baladeva, Krishna advised Arjuna to kidnap Subhadra. Krishna himself kidnapped Rukmini. Similarly, Krishna advised Arjuna to kidnap Subhadra. So when all of them were on a pleasure trip on the Raivata hill, Arjuna managed to kidnap Subhadra. Krishna Baladeva was very angry at Arjuna, and he wanted to kill Arjuna, but Lord Krishna implored his brother to excuse Arjuna. Then Subhadra was duly married to Arjuna, and Abhimanyu was born of Subhadra and Arjuna. At the premature death of Abhimanyu in the battle of Kurukshetra, Subhadra was very mortified, but on the birth of Pariksit, she was happy and solaced. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "The gentle and chaste Gandhari, who was the daughter of King Subala of Kandahar or Gandhara, followed her husband, seeing that he was going to the Himalaya mountains, which are the delightful mountains, which are the delight of those who have accepted the staff of the renounced order, like fighters who have accepted a good lashing from the enemy."
**Summary:** Suta Goswami describes Gandhari's decision to follow her husband Dhritarashtra to the Himalayas, highlighting her chastity and devotion.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 30th verse of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. We have already heard how Dhritarashtra cut off his attachment after hearing the strong words spoken by Vidura and left home and went towards north. Now, the further description is being given here. It is Suta Goswami who is describing this to the sages of Naimisharanya. Patim Prayantam Subalasya Putri Pativratacha Anujagama Sadhvi Himalayam Nyasta Dhanda Praharsham Manasvinam Ivasat Samprahara. The meaning of this verse is, the gentle and chaste Gandhari, who was the daughter of King Subala of Kandahar or Gandhara, followed her husband, seeing that he was going to the Himalaya mountains, which are the delightful mountains, which are the delight of those who have accepted the staff of the renounced order, like fighters who have accepted a good lashing from the enemy.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Gandhari's qualities as a Sadhvi and Pativrata, emphasizing the importance of chaste and devoted wives in Vedic culture.

It is a very poetic, beautiful language used by Suta Goswami to describe. Along with Dhritarashtra, Gandhari also followed her husband, seeing that he was going to the Himalayas. So, he proceeded north, means he went in at least the Indian subcontinent. When somebody proceeds north for a spiritual purpose, they are going to the Himalayas. And that's the ideal place for those who want to go to a secluded place and live in seclusion, exclusively for the purpose of self-realization. So, you see Gandhari is described very beautifully here as Sadhvi, Pativrata. And Sadhvi means she is the most chaste lady. And Pativrata means she is devoted to her husband. So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, Sovalini or Gandhari, daughter of King Subala and wife of King Dhritarashtra, was ideal as a wife devoted to her husband. Pativrata, Sadhvi. The Vedic civilization especially prepares chaste and devoted wives, of whom Gandhari is one amongst many mentioned in history. Whenever there is an example given in the scriptures about historical personalities who were ideal, chaste and devoted wives,

**Key Quote:** "Just like Sita voluntarily chose to follow her husband and go to the forest with him, similarly Gandhari, she voluntarily accepted to follow her husband and go with him to the Himalayas."
**Summary:** The speaker draws a parallel between Gandhari and Sita, highlighting their voluntary sacrifices and devotion to their husbands, despite the hardships involved.

Gandhari's name is one of the foremost. Similarly, Srila Prabhupada says, Lakshmiji, Sita Devi, was also a daughter of a great king. She followed her husband Lord Ramachandra into the forest. Sita, she was a daughter of King Janaka. She was a princess. She was married to the Prince Rama. But, when Rama was ordered by his father to go to the forest, Sita need not have gone. So, it is said here, just like Sita voluntarily chose to follow her husband and go to the forest with him, similarly Gandhari, she voluntarily accepted to follow her husband and go with him to the Himalayas. So, Srila Prabhupada says, similarly as a woman, Gandhari could have remained at home or at her father's house. But as a chaste and gentle lady, she followed her husband without consideration. Life in Himalayas, that too for practicing Self Realization, is a very difficult life, especially for a woman. So, in spite of knowing the difficulties, Gandhari did not hesitate even a little bit. She simply followed her husband.

**Key Quote:** "As a chaste lady, Gandhari decided to follow her husband till the last moment."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Gandhari's decision to follow Dhritarashtra was voluntary and emphasizes Dhritarashtra's detachment and Gandhari's unwavering devotion.

Instructions for the renounced order of life were imparted to Dhritarashtra by Vidura. And Gandhari was by the side of her husband, hearing Vidura, while Vidura was instructing Dhritarashtra. So, Vidura did not ask Gandhari to follow her husband. Or, Dhritarashtra did not ask Gandhari that you follow me. No. Because, Dhritarashtra was at that time fully determined, like a great warrior who faces all kinds of dangers in the battlefield. The example is given, Manasvinam Ivasat Samprahara. Manasvinam. Those who are great warriors, they are ready to face any danger in the battlefield, but they will not give up fighting for the just cause, or for fighting in a Dharma Yudha. They are never afraid of facing any situation. So, even if they are injured or even if they are killed, they don't mind. But they will fight for justice. Similarly, Dhritarashtra was determined to renounce and leave the palace and go away to the Himalayas. So, he did not ask her, are you going to come with me? What are you going to do? He did not ask her. So, Srila Prabhupada says, Dhritarashtra was no longer attracted to so-called wife or relatives, and he decided to start all alone. But, as a chaste lady, Gandhari decided to follow her husband till the last moment. It will be explained in the later verses. And Srila Prabhupada is writing in the purport, Gandhari decided, I am going to be with my husband till the last moment of his life. I am not going to bother about my comforts, especially in old age. This is real chastity. This is a sign of chastity. As a chaste lady,

#### Vanaprastha, Sanyas, Varna Ashrama, renunciation

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "These are all based on a very advanced culture and civilization in the Vedic culture."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the stages of Varna Ashrama, focusing on Vanaprastha and Sanyas, and the rules regarding a wife's association with her husband in each stage, highlighting the advanced nature of Vedic culture.

Gandhari decided to follow her husband till the last moment. Maharaj Dhritarashtra accepted the order of Vanaprastha. It is not that after Grahastha, one directly accepts Sanyas. No. Directly accepting Sanyas is possible only for a Brahmachari who decides not to enter the Grahastha Ashrama. Such a Brahmachari can directly accept Sanyas. But a Grahastha, one who has been trained as a Brahmachari and enters Grahastha Ashrama, should next accept Vanaprastha and then accept Sanyas. So, Brahmacharya, Grahastha, Vanaprastha, Sanyas. These are the progressive stages of spiritual development in the life of a civilized, cultured human being following the Varna Ashrama system. But, Dhritarashtra, because he had accepted the Grahastha Ashrama, he next accepted the Vanaprastha order. Now, Srila Prabhupada says, because Dhritarashtra accepted the order of Vanaprastha, at this stage, the wife is allowed to remain as a voluntary servitor of the husband. It is allowed for the wife to remain with the husband as a servitor of the husband. But in the Sanyas stage, no wife can stay with her former husband. So, Sanyas is that particular stage of renunciation or the spiritual order where a Grahastha who renounces home, goes away to the forest or a holy place or to the Himalayas, can take his wife only as long as he is in Vanaprastha order. But Sanyas order, he cannot be with his wife. He has to be away from his wife. Completely away from his wife. Why? Srila Prabhupada explains, according to the scriptures, a Sanyasi is considered to be a dead man civilly. It is declared like he is no longer present for the wife. Therefore, the wife becomes a civil widow without connection with her former husband. These are all based on a very advanced culture and civilization in the Vedic culture. Of course, nowadays it is not practical. Neither it is recommended.

**Key Quote:** "Sanyas is only for those who want to dedicate themselves for traveling and preaching without any other responsibility. Otherwise, Sanyas in Kali Yuga is forbidden."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the prohibition of Sanyas in Kali Yuga, except for those who dedicate themselves to traveling and preaching, and reiterates Dhritarashtra's detachment and Gandhari's voluntary following.

Sanyas itself is not recommended in Kali Yuga. Somebody may ask, why did I accept Sanyas? Now, Sanyas in Kali Yuga in general is not recommended for everyone. But some people who want to preach in this society very vigorously, travel and preach, for them, Sanyas may be accepted. May be accepted simply for the sake of dedicating oneself for traveling and preaching without any encumbrances of other responsibilities and duties in the society. So, Sanyas is only for those who want to dedicate themselves for traveling and preaching without any other responsibility. Otherwise, Sanyas in Kali Yuga is forbidden. Five things are forbidden in Kali Yuga: Ashwamedham, Gavalambham, Sanyasam, Palapaitrikam, Devarayana, Suthopati, Kalopancha, Vibharjayet. So, Sanyas is forbidden in Kali Yuga. Maharaj Dhritarashtra did not deny his faithful wife and she followed her husband at her own risk. It doesn't mean that husband because the wife is following him, he takes some responsibility for protecting her, maintaining her. No. She is following her husband at her own risk. And the husband is still completely detached from the wife and he is determined to practice. He is determined to practice self realization without any other incomprehenses.

#### Sanyas, Danda, Mayavadi, Vaishnava, renunciation

**Key Quote:** "The Vaishnava Sanyasis from the beginning they learn to depend on Krishna. The Supreme Personality of God."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the significance of the Sanyas Danda, differentiating between Ekadanda (Mayavadi) and Tridanda (Vaishnava) Sanyasis, and their respective approaches to renunciation and dependence on Krishna, concluding with advice for Dhritarashtra.

Now, regarding Sanyas, Srila Prabhupada says, briefly, the Sanyasis accept a rod as the sign of the renounced rod of the Danda. Sanyas Danda. Like, I am having this Danda here. So, Sanyasis accept this Danda. What is the significance of this Danda? This Danda is accepted by Sanyasis to signify that they have accepted the renounced daughter of the fly, Sanyas. There are two types of Sanyasis. Those who follow the Mayavadi philosophy headed by Sri Pachankaracharya accept only one rod or Ekadanda, Sanyas. But those who follow the Vaishnava philosophy accept three combined rods called Tridanda. Inside this, three Dandas. There are three rods. The Mayavadi Sanyasis are Ekadandi Swamis, whereas the Vaishnava Sanyasis are Tridandi Swamis. More distinctly, they are called Tridandi Goswamis, in order to be distinguished from the Mayavadi philosophers. The Ekadandi Swamis are mostly fond of the Himalayas. But the Vaishnava Sanyasis are fond of Vrindavan and Puri. Vaishnava Sanyasis generally go to a holy place connected with the pastimes of the Supreme Lord, whereas the Mayavadi Sanyasis they generally go to the Himalayas. The Vaishnava Sanyasis are Narottamas, whereas the Mayavadi Sanyasis are Dheeras. The Vaishnava Sanyasis they from the beginning they learn to depend on Krishna, the Supreme Personality of God. So therefore, specially in Sanyas, they are completely dependent on Krishna only. Where therefore, they are eligible for this Narottama stage of renunciation, the highest stage. Whereas the Mayavadi Sanyasis because they don't have any conception or understanding of the personality of Godhead, so they are mostly Dheeras, undisturbed by material circumstances and detached from all material comforts. So they are mostly Dheeras. Dhritarashtra was advised to follow the Dheeras because at that stage it was difficult for him to become a Narottama, given the circumstances in which it was he was situated. He was advised to become a Dheera. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "This is the Vedic culture."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of verse 31, highlighting the daily duties of a householder in Vedic culture, as exemplified by Maharaj Yudhishthira, and contrasting it with modern practices.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devim Saraswatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing three verses, 31, 32, and 33 of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This chapter is dealing with the topic of Dhritarashtra quits home. So we have already discussed how Vidura instructed Dhritarashtra with very, very strong words, and Dhritarashtra was able to cut off his attachments and leave the palace and immediately go to the Himalayas. And after that, what happened? So that is being now described by Suta Goswami to the sages of Naimishaharanya. So the 31st verse, Ajatashatru krutamaitro hutagnir Viprannatva tilago bhumi rukmaihi Graham pravishto guru vandanaya Naca apasyat pitarau saubhalimcha. The meaning of this verse is, Maharaj Yudhishthira, whose enemy was never born, performed his daily morning duties by praying, offering fire sacrifice to the sun god, and offering obeisances, grains, cows, land, and gold, to the brahmanas. He then entered the palace to pay respects to the elderly. However, he could not find his uncles or aunt, the daughter of King Subala. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, Maharaj Yudhishthira was the most pious king because he personally practiced daily the pious duties for the householders. The householders are required to rise early in the morning, and after bathing, they should offer respects to the deities at home by prayers, by offering fuel in the sacred fire, by giving the brahmanas in charity land, cows, grains, gold, etc., and at last offering to the elderly members due respects and obeisances. This is the Vedic culture, duties of a householder.

#### importance of sadhu sanga, spiritual guidance, modern life vs. Vedic principles

**Key Quote:** "Nothing good can be expected from them unless they associate with sadhus."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of associating with pure devotees (sadhus) like Vidura to learn and adopt Vedic principles, contrasting this with the detrimental effects of modern lifestyles.

If you study the 10th canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam, you will find a chapter describing Lord Krishna's daily activities as a grahastha in Dwaraka. So Krishna is to do all this. Yudhishthira Maharaj was doing all his duties very nicely. So Srila Prabhupada comments, One who is not prepared to practice any duties, and is not prepared to practice injunctions prescribed in the shastras, cannot be a good man simply by book knowledge. Modern householders are practiced to different modes of life, namely to rise late, they don't rise early, and then take bed tea without any sort of cleanliness, and without any purificatory practices as mentioned above. A cultured householder should rise early in the morning, and the first business after rising early in the morning is to cleanse oneself completely. That is a very, very, very first thing one should do. But modern day householders do not do so. The household children are taken to practice what the parents practice, and therefore the whole generation glides towards hell. Nothing good can be expected from them unless they associate with sadhus. Sadhus means pure devotees. Like Dhritarashtra, the materialistic person may take lessons from a sadhu like Vidura, just like Vidura instructed Dhritarashtra. Similarly, modern day householders should take lessons from devotees of the Lord who are following all these practices very nicely. So if the materialistic persons take proper lessons from sadhu like Vidura, then they can be cleansed of the effects of modern life.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the events following Dhritarashtra's departure, focusing on Yudhishthira's anxiety and concern for his uncles and aunt, and his reaction upon discovering their absence.

Now Maharaj Yudhishthira, Srila Prabhupada says, however, could not find in the palace his two uncles, namely Dhritarashtra and Vidura, along with Gandhari, the daughter of King Subala. Saubalini means the daughter of King Subala. So all the three of them had left the palace very silently, quietly, without informing anybody. So therefore the next morning when Yudhishthira came to offer respects to his uncles and his aunt, the elderly, he could find them. He was anxious to see them and therefore asked Sanjaya, the private secretary of Dhritarashtra. So the 32nd verse, The meaning of this 32nd verse, Maharaj Yudhishthira, full of anxiety, turned to Sanjaya who was sitting there and said, O Sanjaya, where is our uncle who is old and blind? The 33rd verse, Ambacha hata-putrarta pitruvyakva-gata-surat apimaiyakrita-prajne hata-bandhusya-bharyaya Asham samana shamalam Ganga aayam dukhito apatat. The meaning of this 33rd verse is, Where is my well-wisher, uncle Vidura and mother Gandhari, who is very afflicted due to her son's demise? My uncle Dhritarashtra was also very mortified due to the death of all his sons and grandsons. Undoubtedly, I am very ungrateful. Did he therefore take my offenses very seriously and along with his wife drown himself in the Ganges?

**Key Quote:** "So this is the soft-hearted nature of pure devotees."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Yudhishthira and Arjuna's reluctance to engage in the Kurukshetra war, highlighting their compassionate nature and the understanding that the battle was ultimately executed by the will of the Lord.

See the reaction of Yudhishthira when he did not find his uncles and aunt. It is just befitting with Yudhishthira's good-natured behavior. So Srila Prabhupada explains, The Pandavas, especially Maharaj, Yudhishthira and Arjuna anticipated the after-effects of the battle of Kurukshetra. Both Yudhishthira and Arjuna did not actually want to fight the battle. They were just carrying out their duties according to what was prescribed for them as kshatriyas. Kshatriyas are duty-bound to fight for justice. So Yudhishthira and Arjuna were unwillingly engaged in the battle. So Srila Prabhupada points out, Because both of them did not really like the fighting, therefore Arjuna declined to execute the fighting. You can read in the Bhagavad Gita, in the first chapter, how Arjuna tells Krishna, I won't fight. How can I kill my kinsmen just for the sake of me to enjoy a flourishing royal kingdom? I don't want to fight. So this is the soft-hearted nature of pure devotees. All the Pandavas are pure devotees. The fight was executed, however, by the will of the Lord. So even though the Pandavas did not want to fight, especially Yudhishthira and Arjuna did not want to fight against the Kauravas, but it was executed, the fighting was executed by the will of the Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "Care for the elderly. That is the culture, the Vedic culture."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the aftermath of the war and Yudhishthira's deep concern for Dhritarashtra and Gandhari, emphasizing the Vedic cultural value of caring for the elderly and contrasting it with modern trends.

Everyone is bound by the will of the Lord. Now after the battle, the effects of family agreement, as they had thought of it before, had come true. Whatever they had feared would be the aftermath of the massacre. Millions of Kshatriyas who were participating in the battle all died. Maharaj Yudhishthira was always conscious of the great plight of his uncle Dhritarashtra and aunt Gandhari, because they lost all their sons and grandsons, and they are old, and now they are bereft of their kingdom. Their sons and grandsons have died. Their well-wishers have passed away. So what do they do? But Yudhishthira Maharaj, being the most saintly, compassionate, kind, considerate, good-natured, well-behaved, saintly king, he was always conscious of the miserable condition of his aunt and uncle. Therefore, he took all possible care of them in their old age and aggrieved conditions. Care for the elderly, that is the culture, the Vedic culture. Nowadays, many, many children, when they are grown up, they go away from home, leaving their parents alone. They go for some career, some business, some opportunities for making a lot of money. In the western countries, especially from India, so many youngsters go away and leave their parents alone. Yudhishthira Maharaj is not like that. He was taking all possible care of Dhritarashtra and Gandhari in their old age.

**Key Quote:** "A devotee never finds faults with others, but tries to find his own fault and rectify them as far as possible."
**Summary:** This segment focuses on Yudhishthira's humility and self-reflection, highlighting the qualities of a devotee who focuses on their own faults rather than those of others, and acknowledging Dhritarashtra's past kindness.

When, therefore, he could not find his uncle and aunt in the palace, naturally, his doubts arose. He was worried, what happened to them? Where have they gone? Why are they missing from their place of residence? He conjectured that they had gone down to the water of the Ganges. Had they drowned themselves in the Ganga river because they thought their life is not worth living? He thought himself ungrateful because when the Pandavas were fatherless, Maharaj Dhritarashtra had given them all royal facilities to live. And in return, Yudhishthira had killed all Dhritarashtra's sons in the battle of Kurukshetra. See how Yudhishthira is thinking. Dhritarashtra gave me shelter when I was fatherless, and what did I do? I killed all his sons and grandsons in the battle of Kurukshetra. So, as a pious man, Maharaj Yudhishthira took into account all his unavoidable misdeeds. He never thought of the misdeeds of his uncle and company. Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana were always plotting to kill the Pandavas. So, the fact is, Dhritarashtra suffered the effects of his own misdeeds by the will of the Lord. But Maharaj Yudhishthira was thinking only of his own unavoidable misdeeds. This is the nature of a devotee of the Lord. A devotee never finds faults with others, but tries to find his own fault and rectify them as far as possible. This is a wonderful quality of a devotee of the Lord. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verses to be discussed and explains the context of Yudhishthira's inquiry about his missing uncles and aunt, and Sanjaya's initial inability to respond due to grief.

In this session, we will be discussing from four verses, the 34th, the 35th, the 36th and the 37th verses of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The description is continuing about Yudhishthira searching for his missing uncles and aunt. The 34th verse: Pithari Uparate Pandav Sarvanas Surudas Shishun Arakshatam Vyasanataha Pitruvyav Kva Gatav Itaha. The meaning of this verse is: When my father Pandu fell down and we were all small children, these two uncles came to me and said, 'They gave us protection from all kinds of calamities. They were always our good well-wishers. Alas, where have they gone from here?' This is spoken by Yudhishthira to Sanjaya while inquiring from Sanjaya about the uncles and aunt who are missing from the palace. The 35th verse: Suta Vacha. We should remember that Suta Gosvami is speaking, narrating this, describing this in silence to the sage of Sunayamishadanya. Suta Vacha Kripa Yaas Neha Vaikla Vyat Suto Viraha Karshitaha Atmeshwaram Achakshano Napratya Napratyaha Atipiditaha.

#### Dhritarashtra's departure, Sanjaya's perspective, Renunciation, Better life

**Key Quote:** "Unless one is convinced of a better life after renunciation of present life, one cannot stick to the renounced order of life simply by artificial dress or staying out of the home."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Sanjaya's sorrow at Dhritarashtra's departure and connects it to the importance of genuine conviction in a better life for successful renunciation, as explained by Srila Prabhupada.

The meaning of this verse is, Suta Goswami said, because of compassion and mental agitation, Sanjaya, not having seen his own master Dhritarashtra, was aggrieved and could not properly reply to Maharaj Yudhishthira. Immediately Sanjaya could not respond to Yudhishthira's inquiry. So in the Purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, Sanjaya was the personal assistant of Maharaj Dhritarashtra for a very long time and thus he had the opportunity to study the life of Dhritarashtra. And when he saw at last that Dhritarashtra had left home without his knowledge, his sorrows had no bound. He was extremely sorry that somebody whom he had served for a very long time had left home without informing Sanjaya. So Sanjaya was fully compassionate toward Dhritarashtra because in the game of the battle of Kurukshetra, King Dhritarashtra had lost everything, men and money. And at last the king and the queen had to leave home in utter fright. Dhritarashtra was so frustrated that he felt very sorry for the people who had left home without informing Sanjaya. He studied the situation in his own way because he did not know that the inner vision of Dhritarashtra has been awakened by Vidura. So Sanjaya left home in enthusiastic cheerfulness for a better life after departure from the dark well of home. So Srila Prabhupada says, Sanjaya doesn't know that Dhritarashtra's inner vision has been awakened by Vidura and he has cheerfully left the palace, not in frustration. So Srila Prabhupada says, unless one is convinced of a better life after renunciation of present life, one cannot stick to the renounced order of life simply by artificial dress or staying out of the home. Sometimes not. Nowadays people leave home and go away to some ashram. But such renunciation will not last unless they are properly fixed up in that renunciation by being convinced of a better life after quitting home.

**Key Quote:** "First he slowly pacified his mind by intelligence. And wiping away his tears. And thinking of the feet of his master, Dhritarashtra. He began to reply to Maharaj Yudhishtira."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how Sanjaya regains his composure by pacifying his mind with intelligence, wiping away tears, and remembering his master, Dhritarashtra, before replying to Yudhishthira.

Being convinced of a better life. The 36th verse: Vimrgya ashroni paanibhyam vishtabhyatmanam atmana ajatashatrumpratyuche prabhopadavanusmaran. The meaning of this 36th verse: First he slowly pacified his mind by intelligence, and wiping away his tears, and thinking of the feet of his master, Dhritarashtra, he began to reply to Maharaj Yudhishtira. Sanjaya. He pacified his mind because he was disturbed on not finding Dhritarashtra in the palace. So he pacified his mind by his intelligence. In the Bhagavad Gita it is explained that the mind is superior to the senses. The intelligence is superior to the mind. The soul is even superior to the intelligence. So one can pacify the mind by intelligence because intelligence is higher. If one's intelligence is not working then one can get the mind pacified by taking instructions from somebody else who is more intelligent, who is spiritually awakened. So Sanjaya pacified his mind by his intelligence and wiping away his tears, thinking of the feet of his master Dhritarashtra, he began to reply to Maharaj Yudhishtira.

#### Sanjaya's reply, Deception by great souls, Respect for elders
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/TgJFmDw9S5k?t=479
**Verse References:** SB 1.13.37
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "I have been cheated by those great souls."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Sanjaya's reply to Yudhishthira, focusing on his feeling of being 'cheated' by Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, and Vidura, and emphasizes the importance of respecting elders regardless of their actions.

What was his reply? That's the next verse, 37th verse: Sanjaya Vacha. Sanjaya is replying to Maharaj Yudhishtira. Naham Veda Vyavasitam. Pitrorva Kulanandana. Gandharya Vamahabaho. Mushitosmi Mahatmabhi. This is the most important point here in this verse: Mushitosmi Mahatmabhi. What's the meaning of this? The meaning of this verse, the 37th verse: Sanjaya said, he is speaking to Yudhishtira, replying to Yudhishtira's enquiry, 'My dear descendant of the Kuru dynasty, Nandana.' He is addressing Yudhishtira in that way. 'I have no information of the determination of your two uncles and Gandhari. I have no information. I do not know where they have gone, O King. I have been cheated by those great souls.' Mushitosmi means 'I have been cheated.' By whom? By those great souls, Mahatmabhi. This is Sanjaya's attitude towards Dhritarashtra, Vidura, and Gandhari, elders. This is our culture. Regardless of what they may do or not do, the elders are to be offered proper respect by the younger ones. This is the culture. So Sanjaya is addressing to Yudhishtira that 'I have been cheated by them because they never informed me where they are going. I was taking care of them, especially Dhritarashtra and Gandhari.' So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport that great souls cheat others may be astonishing to know. If they are great souls, why should they cheat? So Srila Prabhupada explains clearly in this purport, kindly hear attentively, that great souls cheat others may be astonishing to know, but it is a fact that great souls cheat others for a great cause. They have a solid reason to cheat others under very, very, very, very special circumstances, rarest of rare cases. Such great souls, Mahatma, who are basically devotees, they sometimes, for a greater cause, they do cheat others.

#### Great souls cheat for a cause, Satisfying the Lord, Occupational duty, Perfection
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/TgJFmDw9S5k?t=659
**Verse References:** BG 18.46
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The highest perfection of life is to satisfy the Lord by one's occupational duty."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of great souls 'cheating' for a greater cause, citing examples and emphasizing that the ultimate goal is to satisfy the Lord through one's prescribed duties, referencing the Bhagavad Gita.

So it is explained here by Srila Prabhupada, it is said that Lord Krishna also advised Yudhishtira, only for Dronacharya. Yudhishtira is the greatest moralist of his time, but he was told by Krishna, 'Tell a lie to Dronacharya, his own teacher. Tell a lie.' And it was also for a great cause. The Lord wanted it, therefore it was a great cause. Whatever the Lord wants, that is the greatest thing one can do. Satisfaction of the Lord is a criterion of one who is bona fide. And the highest perfection of life is to satisfy the Lord by one's occupational duty. That is the verdict of Gita and Bhagavad, both the Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam describe this. Where is it said in the Gita that the highest perfection of life is to satisfy the Supreme Lord by one's occupational duty? In the 18th chapter, the 46th verse says: Yataha Pravritti Bhutanam Yena Sarvam Idam Tatam Svakarmana Tam Abhyarchya Siddhim Vindati Manavaha. Is the meaning of this verse: By worship of the Lord, who is the source of all beings and who is all pervading, man can in the performance of his own duty attain perfection. So one attains perfection by worship of the Lord, who is the source of all beings and who is all pervading, while a person performs his own duties as prescribed in the Shastra. One can please the Lord in this way. In the Bhagavatam it is said, it is therefore concluded that the highest perfection one can achieve by discharging the duties prescribed for one's own occupation according to caste divisions and orders of life is to please the personality of Godhead. Highest perfection, Sam Siddhi, is Haritoshanam, satisfy or please Lord Hari.

#### Confidentiality, Examples of cheating, Absolute Truth, Conclusion

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "To satisfy the Lord, anything is good, for it is in relation with the absolute truth."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by providing further examples of devotees 'cheating' for a higher purpose, emphasizing that actions done to satisfy the Lord are aligned with the absolute truth, and ends the lecture.

So therefore Prabhupada says, Dhritarashtra and Vidura, followed by Gandhari, did not disclose their determination to Sanjaya, although he was constantly with Dhritarashtra as his personal assistant. Sanjaya never thought that Dhritarashtra could perform any act without consulting him. But Dhritarashtra's going away from home was so confidential that it could not be disclosed even to Sanjaya. And Srila Prabhupada gives more examples. Sanatana Goswami also cheated the keeper of the prison house than Mahaprabhu. Sanatana was trying to get relief from the duties in the royal palace of the King, Nawab Hussain Shah of Bengal. He was the minister. So he cheated the prison keeper and went away to join Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Raghunath Das Goswami also cheated his priest and left home to join Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. So to satisfy the Lord, anything is good, for it is in relation with the absolute truth. That's the conclusion. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "So, the Lord, unknowingly, arranged that Narada inform Yudhishthira about the whereabouts of Dhritarashtra and Gandhari and Vidura."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of the verses, explaining Narada's appearance as a divine arrangement to inform Yudhishthira about his relatives.

In this session, we will be discussing from two verses, the 38th and the 39th verses of the 13th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 38th verse is as follows: Athar Jagama Bhagavan Narada Sahatumburuho Pratyutthaya Abhivadhyaha Sanujo Abhyarchayan Munim. The meaning of this verse is, "While Sanjaya was thus speaking, Shri Narada, the powerful devotee of the Lord, appeared on the scene carrying his tumburu. Maharaj Yudhishthira and his brothers received him properly by getting up from their seats and offering obeisances." So, this is the Lord's arrangement. When Yudhishthira is puzzled as to where his uncles and aunt have gone, Sanjaya is also unaware. So, the Lord, unknowingly, arranged that Narada inform Yudhishthira about the whereabouts of Dhritarashtra and Gandhari and Vidura.

**Key Quote:** "The way of devotional service is not only to worship the Supreme Lord with all devotion, but also to worship the pure devotee spiritual master, the Acharya, on the same level as the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why Narada is referred to as Bhagavan, emphasizing the importance of honoring pure devotees and their role in preaching.

So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, Devarishi Narada is described herein as Bhagavan. Why? Why is he called Bhagavan? Is he Bhagavan? He is not Bhagavan. Krishna is Bhagavan. The Supreme Personality of God is Krishna. Krishna is Bhagavan. So, why is Devarishi Narada described as Bhagavan? Prabhupada explains it is because he is the most confidential devotee of the Lord. In rare cases, very exalted devotees who are most confidential devotees of the Lord are described, addressed as Bhagavan. So, Srila Prabhupada further says, "The Lord and his very confidential devotees are treated on the same level by those who are actually engaged in the loving service of the Lord. The way of devotional service is not only to worship the Supreme Lord with all devotion, but also to worship the pure devotee spiritual master, the Acharya, on the same level as the Lord. Because, such Acharyas and pure devotees are very, very dear to the Lord. Such confidential devotees of the Lord are very much dear to the Lord because they travel everywhere to preach the glories of the Lord in different capacities and try their utmost to convert the non-devotees of the Lord into devotees in order to bring them to the platform of sanity. This material world is filled with non-devotees. And to convert these non-devotees into devotees, pure devotees like Narada travel and preach and try to convert non-devotees into devotees."

**Key Quote:** "Actually a living being cannot be a non-devotee of the Lord because of his constitutional position."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the inherent devotional nature of all beings and highlights preaching to non-devotees as the highest form of service.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains, it's very interesting to note that actually a living being cannot be a non-devotee of the Lord because of his constitutional position. What is our constitutional position? We are part and parcel of the Lord. We belong to the Lord. We are all devotees of the Lord. But, when one becomes a non-devotee, a non-believer, it is to be understood that the person concerned is not in a sound condition of life. So, if somebody is a non-devotee, that is not the perfect condition or sound condition of the life of such a non-devotee. The confidential devotees of the Lord treat such illusioned living beings and therefore they are most pleasing in the eyes of the Lord. There are so many devotees rendering different kinds of service to the Lord. Among all of them, who is rendering the best service or the topmost service? It is those who are engaged in preaching to the non-devotees and delivering such non-devotees to the spiritual world.

**Key Quote:** "Such people who, devotees, pure devotees, who preach the glories of the Lord among the non-devotees, they are actually the most munificent."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the generosity of those who preach and the importance of offering respect to pure devotees like Narada.

They are the best devotees. They are described in the Bhagavatam 10th canto in the prayers offered by the gopis to Krishna that bhuvigranantiye bhuridājana. Such people who, devotees, pure devotees, who preach the glories of the Lord among the non-devotees, they are actually the most munificent. Bhuridājana. They are very, very, very generous. The Lord says in the Bhagavad Gita that no one is dearer to Him than one who actually preaches the glories of the Lord to convert the non-believers and non-devotees. So the preaching is very, very much necessary and it is powerful and effective when it is done by pure devotees. Such personalities as Narada must be offered all due respects like those offered to the personality of Godhead Himself. sākṣād haritvena samasta-śāstrair uktas tathā bhāvyata eva sattvihī. The pure devotees are to be treated on the same level as the Lord. That is the verdict of the śāstras. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira along with his noble brothers were examples for others in receiving a pure devotee of the Lord like Narada who had no other business save and except singing the glories of the Lord along with his veena,

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Gandhari's exceptional character as an ascetic, highlighting her tolerance and devotion.

from Narada. So, in the purport Śrīla Prabhupāda explains Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira as a good soul and devotee of the lord was always conscious of the great loss of his aunt and her sufferings as an ascetic. So, Gandhari is an exceptional personality described in the history called Mahabharata. Gandhari's personality is very much glorified in the Mahabharata because she was living the life of an ascetic even though she was living in a palace. Because her husband was blind, Gandhari blindfolded herself voluntarily. This is called a chaste wife, an obedient wife, a devoted wife. And after the great loss of her sons, in the battle of Kurukshetra, Gandhari was living like an ascetic, tapasvini. Particularly, Yudhiṣṭhira is referring to Gandhari as tapasvini. And what is the characteristic of a tapasvini or ascetic? An ascetic is never disturbed by all kinds of sufferings. So, suffering is a part of material existence which is unavoidable even for great devotees, even for pious people, even for anybody who is willing to undergo the austerities to detach themselves from their body. For such people, any difficulty is tolerable. They tolerate. Queen Gandhari is a typical example of an ascetic because of her marvelous character

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Gandhari's wise counsel and the importance of tolerance in the face of difficulties encountered on the path of devotional service.

in many trying situations. Gandhari has always displayed this tolerance because she was kind to Dhritarashtra who was plotting and planning to kill the Pandavas. Gandhari was not supporting her husband. She was giving him good counsel. But, the Kauravas would not listen to Gandhari nor would they listen to other great personalities. So, this is a demoniac nature. They will not listen to others if they think that is not so favorable. So, Queen Gandhari is a typical example of an ascetic because of her marvelous character in many trying situations. So, they teach us by their example these great personalities, great devotees, very, very tolerant. Srila Prabhupada says in the material world, while we have taken up the path of devotional service, we have declared a war against Maya. So, in a battle between Maya and people, there will be difficulties, there will be dangers, there will be some inconveniences, but one has to tolerate all of them in order to actually practice spiritual life and make progress to go back home,

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing Gandhari's exemplary qualities as an ideal woman and her unwavering fairness, even in difficult circumstances.

back to Godhead. It is not some voluntary torture of the body or voluntarily denying something which is nicely enjoyable. No, that is not this proper understanding. So, Gandhari is described as she was an ideal woman as mother, wife, and ascetic and in the history of the world such character in a woman is rarely found. Gandhari has been glorified a lot in the Mahabharata and even in the Bhagavata as a great personality. So, she is setting a very good example for tapas we need. Even though her husband was not fair to the Pandavas, but she was always fair herself and she was requesting her husband to be fair to the Pandavas. She never approved the different nefarious activities of Duryodhana, of Dushasana, of Dhritarashtra, she never approved. And she was always advising them to refrain from giving trouble to the Pandavas. So, she is a marvelous personality and such character in a woman is rarely found in the world. She is a very rare ideal woman to be found very rarely. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the story of Dhritarashtra leaving the palace, Yudhishthira's worry and his respect for his elders, and the subsequent arrival of Narada Muni.

So the background for this 40th verse is that Dhritarashtra has left the palace after hearing the strong instructions of Vidura. Vidura, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari all have left the palace. And Yudhishthira the next day morning is doing his daily morning duties as a pious householder. So he went to pay respects to Dhritarashtra and he didn't find Dhritarashtra in his usual place. Then immediately he inquired from Sanjaya, Dhritarashtra's secretary, Where is Dhritarashtra, my uncle? So Sanjaya said, I don't know. I don't know where he's gone, I have no idea. Then Yudhishthira began to worry whether because Dhritarashtra and Gandhari had lost all their sons and they were very much aggrieved because we were all here, aggrieved because of the great loss in the battle of Kurukshetra, all their 100 sons were killed and their grandsons, sons and grandsons, everyone was killed in the battle of Kurukshetra, so because he was so very much aggrieved, did he leave the palace to go and drown himself in the river Ganga? That was what Yudhishthira was so much concerned, worried. In fact, Yudhishthira wanted to take care of his uncle and aunt, that they should be comforted when they have undergone such a huge loss in the last days, so he was taking good care actually, but suddenly when they disappeared he began to worry what happened, why did they, where did they go and where have they gone? So as he was worrying suddenly Narada appeared in the

**Summary:** The speaker explains the analogy of Narada Muni as a captain of a ship, guiding Yudhishthira who is lost and seeking direction, emphasizing Narada's role as a guide.

palace of Yudhishthira and as soon as Narada came Yudhishthira began to inquire from Narada and he explained that my uncles and aunt have gone, I do not know where they have gone, kindly tell me what should I do now. So Yudhishthira is describing Narada as a captain of a ship in a great ocean. In this analogy is very important for us to understand that if somebody is, I'm going in a ship and is in the middle of the coast, the ocean, if every side they look they'll only see water, they'll see only water, there'll be no sight of any land in the middle of the great ocean, big ocean, there will be no sight of any land. Then only the captain who knows how to navigate the ship based on, of course nowadays they have modern equipment, but formerly they used to have maps and using the maps and the compass, the direction which they should go, they would actually steer the ship in the ocean and take it from one place where they start, shore of the ocean, one particular landmark to another particular landmark to another country or another place in the other side of the ocean. So only a captain who's experienced, who has got these maps, who knows how to use the maps to steer the ship, only such a person can help the to reach the destination, the designated place they are supposed to go, they wish to go, they desire to go.

Similarly, Yudhishthira is now lost. He doesn't know where his uncle and aunt are. But Narada Muni is actually a great philosopher devotee as it will be explained in the, as it is mentioned here. Narada Munisattamaha, he is the greatest among the philosopher devotees. So he is like a captain of a ship in the great ocean.

And he is also a philosopher, he is also a great personality, the greatest of the personalities, such personalities. And when Narada is addressed by Yudhishthira, he began to speak.

**Key Quote:** "There are different types of philosophers and the greatest of all of them are those who have seen the personality of Godhead and have surrendered themselves in the transcendental loving service of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Srila Prabhupada's explanation of Narada Muni, emphasizing the importance of seeing the Supreme Lord, becoming spiritually situated, and surrendering in loving service.

And that will come in the next few verses. So in the purport Srila Prabhupada says something about Narada. There are different types of philosophers and the greatest of all of them are those who have seen the personality of Godhead and have surrendered themselves in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. And to see the Supreme Lord is not an ordinary thing. The Lord is completely spiritual. And not only is he a spiritual personality, but he is also the unlimited Supreme personality. So one has to first of all become spiritually situated to be able to see or perceive or realize what is spirit. And then go beyond this, beyond perceiving spirit, to be able to perceive or see the Supreme Spirit, the unlimited Supreme Lord. Both of these are distinct qualifications. It's not that anybody and everybody can just either see spirit or ultimately be able to see even the Supreme Spirit. That is the personality of Godhead. And after seeing the Supreme Lord, one has to surrender in transcendental loving service. This is what Krishna explains in the Bhagavad Gita.

**Key Quote:** "This surrender is not for any material purpose. It is not for any other purpose other than to render loving devotional service to the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes the Bhagavad Gita and explains the process of surrendering to the Supreme Lord in transcendental loving service, highlighting Narada Muni as an example.

This is what Krishna explains in the Bhagavad Gita. He says, tad viddhi pranipatena pariprasnena sevaya upadekshanti te jnanam jnaninah tatva-darshinah. Tatva-darshinah means one who has seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And jnaninah, one is full of knowledge about who is the Supreme Lord and what is the relationship, what is the relationship of everyone with the Supreme Lord, and how one can situate himself or herself in the proper position of one's relationship by surrendering to the Supreme Lord in transcendental loving service. This surrender is not for any material purpose. It is not for any other purpose other than to render loving devotional service to the Lord. That is our actual constitutional position. So Narada Muni is one such personality who has seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is described in the earlier chapter how Narada had darshan of the Lord. Then he realized the Lord. Then he became situated as a totally surrendered devotee of the Lord. And after situating himself in that way, he is simply traveling and preaching to everyone to help them to get out of this material existence and reinstate themselves in their original position as pure devotee of the Supreme Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Narada Muni has come to help Yudhishthira and that Narada is the chief among devotees and a learned philosopher of Vedanta.

So Narada Muni has now come to actually help Yudhishthira understand the destination or the future of his uncles and aunt. So among all such pure devotees of the Lord, because Lord has many pure devotees like Narada, Devarishi Narada is the chief. Narada Munisattamaha. And therefore he has been described herein as the greatest of all philosopher devotees. Now even among devotees there are different kinds of devotees. So who is a philosopher devotee? That Prabhupada explains, unless one has become a sufficiently learned philosopher by hearing the Vedanta philosophy from a bona fide spiritual master, one cannot be a learned philosopher devotee. So to know the philosophy of Vedanta. Vedanta means the conclusion of the Vedas. And what is the conclusion of the Vedas? Vedaischa sarvair ahameva vedyam. Krishna is the goal of all Vedas, Vedic knowledge.

**Summary:** The speaker continues to describe Narada Muni's qualifications as a guide, emphasizing his realization of Vedanta and his engagement in transcendental loving service, and the need for faith, learning, and renunciation to be a pure devotee.

So Narada is such a devotee who has become sufficiently learned philosopher by hearing the Vedanta philosophy from the Bhaktivedantas in his previous life. And he has become realized. He followed the instructions to realize that subject matter after hearing. And he had darshan of the Lord. And he became situated in his transcendental relationship as the pure devotee engaged in transcendental loving service of the Lord. So therefore Narada Muni is actually the proper qualified person to guide somebody like Yudhishtira. So Prabhupada says one must be very faithful, learned and renounced. Otherwise one cannot be a pure devotee. It's not possible to be a pure devotee unless one is very faithful. Bhakti begins with faith. And that faith has to be developed. And then one has to become learned in the science of Krishna consciousness, science of Bhakti. And one has to become renounced. Completely free from all material attachments. 100% pure. That's called 100% pure. Without these qualifications one cannot be a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord. And such a pure devotee is qualified to help anybody cross this ocean of ignorance and reach the destination of the shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna.

And it is also explained here by Prabhupada Devarshi Narada used to visit the palace of the Pandavas because the Pandavas are pure devotees themselves. And Devarshi Narada used to visit them and was always ready to give them good counsel whenever needed. Of course, Yudhishthira as a pure devotee himself, he is capable of knowing from directly the Supreme Lord because he is always engaged in the service of the Lord. But he is playing the part of a Kshatriya who always seeks the direction of a Brahmana or a pure devotee saint, saintly person. So therefore he is enquiring from Narada. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of Krishna's supreme control, explaining that all beings, from Brahma to the smallest creature, are subject to His order.

So, Shri La Pravapada explains this very important point in the purport elaborately, what Narada Muni is telling as a reply to Yudhishthira. Yudhishthira is concerned, where are my uncles and aunt gone? So, Narada before directly telling where have they gone, he is first explaining the general principle, which all of us have to understand. Every living being either in this material world or in the spiritual world is under the control of the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead. Now, why is Krishna called the Supreme Lord? Because Lord means controller, and Supreme means he is the ultimate controller of everyone. So, he is completely controlling everyone in the material world and in the spiritual world. Universally, everywhere he is controlled. And Pravapada further clarifies this. Beginning from Brahmaji, the leader of this universe, down to the insignificant, all are abiding by the order of the Supreme Lord. Brahma is the first created being in this universe.

**Key Quote:** "It is only the devotees and the pious people, the followers of the Vedic injunctions or the scriptural directions given by God, only they are actually voluntarily following the order of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker distinguishes between voluntary obedience by devotees and forced obedience by others, emphasizing the subordinate position of all beings to the Supreme Lord.

There are millions of planets in each universe, and in each planet there are millions of living entities, all of them beginning from Brahma, the topmost living being in this universe, and down to the most insignificant creature, everyone is abiding by the order of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord's control is everywhere. And when it is said everyone is abiding by the order, not everyone is abiding by the order of the Lord voluntarily. It is only the devotees and the pious people, the followers of the Vedic injunctions or the scriptural directions given by God, only they are actually voluntarily following the order of the Supreme Lord. The others, demons, atheists, and agnostics, materialists, rebellious souls, all of them are forced to obey the order of the Supreme Lord. Thus, the constitutional position of the living being is subordination under the control of the Lord. Everyone is subordinate to the Lord. The Lord is the only supreme personality. He is the supreme master.

**Key Quote:** "The foolish living being, especially man artificially rebels against the law of the supreme God...and thus becomes chastised as an asura or law breaker"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that rebelling against God's law leads to suffering and punishment, comparing it to breaking earthly laws and facing consequences.

Everyone is under his control. Ekala, Ishvara, Krishna are Sababhrithya. This is explained in the Chaitanya Charitamatha. Krishna is the only Ishvara, only control, ultimately. And everyone else is under his control. Constitutional position means the way we are made, the way we are constituted, the way we are eternally, is that we're subordinate. And the way Krishna is ... what is Krishna's constitutional position? It is to always control, always be the master, the Lord, the supreme. And we are always subordinate, eternally we are subordinate to the supreme Lord Krishna. The foolish living being, especially man, artificially rebels against the law of the supreme God, the law of the supreme, and thus becomes chastised as an asura or law breaker. When laws are operating and there's an enforcing authority, anybody who breaks the law is immediately punished by the law enforcing authority, just like there is traffic police patrolling and anybody violates the traffic laws, immediately the traffic police will chastise, will actually stop the lawbreaker and correct the lawbreaker. So similarly, even in the whole creation there is the law of the supreme that is operating and anybody who rebels against the law is chastised, is punished by the supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "A living being is placed in a particular position by the order of the supreme lord and is again shifted from that place by the order of the supreme lord or his authorized agents"
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the question of how divine control manifests in practical experience, explaining that beings are placed in and removed from positions by the Lord or His agents, and provides examples of powerful figures throughout history who were ultimately under divine control.

Now, Sri La Prabhupada explains how does it work actually. In our practical experience, we don't see any God coming and chastising us. If at all we are chastised, it's by the lawmakers in our country or in our institutions. We don't see any God. Where is God? That's what an atheist or a law breaker may question in this way. So, Prabhupada says, a living being is placed in a particular position by the order of the Supreme Lord and is again shifted from that place by the order of the Supreme Lord or his authorized agents. We are all placed in some particular position and removed from that position by whom? By the order of Krishna or his authorized agents. So, Prabhupada lists some names by which you can get an idea what is the extent of the control of the Supreme Lord: Brahma, Shiva, Brahma and Shiva, the greatest of demigods in the entire creation, Indra, Chandra, they are also very powerful demigods but subordinate to Brahma and Shiva. Even they, Maharaj Yudhishthira, even Maharaj Yudhishthira, he is under the control of the Lord. Or in modern history, Napoleon, Akbar, Alexander, Gandhi, Subhash, and Nehru, all are servants of the Lord. All these names mentioned are powerful persons of the Lord.

Swarat means Krishna is supremely completely independent. Even though such men or leaders rebel so as not to recognize the supremacy of the Lord, they are put under still more rigorous laws of the material world by different miseries. Why do miseries come? They are enforcement of the authority of the Supreme Lord on lawbreakers, on rebellious souls. It is only the rebellious souls who suffer.

**Key Quote:** "Whenever he suffers right from the time he is placed in the womb of a particular mother inside the womb he has suffered so much and he forgets that"
**Summary:** The speaker illustrates the pervasive nature of suffering, even from infancy, using the analogy of a baby suffering from an ant bite to show how past karma manifests.

It is only the rebellious souls who suffer. Nobody else who is fully obedient will have to suffer in this material world. Only the foolish man therefore says that there is no God. Foolish people, they say where is God? Who is God? There's no God. But the foolish man doesn't realize that who is imposing miseries upon him whenever he suffers, right from the time he is placed in the womb of a particular mother. Inside the womb he has suffered so much and he forgets that. Everyone who enters the womb of a particular mother, what suffering they undergo, they forget after they come out of the womb because they get some relief and they say better don't remember that traumatic experience, better forget it. And then through their growing up, childhood, as a child, so many different types of sufferings. Even the rich man's child, the most cared for child also has to suffer. Supposing there an ant biting a child in the diaper, then how does the child express itself to its mother or nurse or caretaker? We had the best of people taking care, but how does the child express? The child simply is helpless in expressing. It can only cry. Now when the child cries, the mother or the caretaker or the nurse cannot understand why the child is crying. Of course, the mother or child caretaker can make out the child is having some discomfort. Okay, they'll try to comfort the child. Maybe they'll think it's hungry so they'll try to feed it. So, feeding that will not stop the crying because the ant is biting in the diaper. And then they will try to make out the child is crying and then they will try to play with the child, try to give the child some air, maybe it's feeling suffocation or maybe it is feeling too cold, whatever different ways they speculate and try to comfort the child. But how will they understand the child is crying specifically because an ant is biting in the diaper? How will they figure that? They cannot. So this is a misery that

**Key Quote:** "Intelligent people simply understand that we have to surrender to Krishna the supreme lord and we have to abide by his laws orders and pray to him to get out of this entanglement of material existence"
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of surrendering to Krishna as the only way to overcome the laws of material nature and escape suffering, referencing a verse from the Bhagavad-gita about the difficulty of transcending Maya without surrender.

the child has to suffer because of its own past misdeeds, own past misdeeds and it's not very easy for the child to get relief from that. So only till that quota of suffering is given to that living entity in that situation, in that circumstance, till then it has to suffer. It has to cry and cry and cry and cry and then by the will of the Lord somehow they will figure out. Let's say it passes urine then to change the diaper. When they remove the diaper, oh they'll see, oh there was a, they may or may not notice anyway with the diaper being removed and disposed the ant is also gone, the child gets relief or they notice the ant and then they understand the cause and then they remove that ant. So like that it is, even those who are cared for by different material methods, there is no guarantee of freedom from miseries, even those who are cared for. So therefore this world, everybody is by the Lord, everybody is placed in a particular position and removed from that position by the will of the Lord, by his superior arrangement and those are called the laws of God and everybody is forced to abide by the laws. So intelligent people simply understand that we have to surrender to Krishna, the Supreme Lord and we have to abide by his laws, orders and pray to him to get out of this entanglement of material existence. Only he can help us cross over this ocean of material existence. Daivihesha gunamayi mamma maya duratyaya ma mevaye prapadyante maya metham tarantite. In simple one verse, in a simple way Krishna says in the Bhagavad-gita, you cannot overcome the stringent laws this material nature which are the laws of Krishna only simply by your own methods and arrangements and intelligence and and and and all kinds of remedies, you cannot. But if you surrender to Krishna, Krishna will easily help you to cross over and that is what will be explained by Narada.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Prabhupada's explanation, contrasting the severity and inescapability of God's laws with the fallibility of man-made laws.

through the Vedic injunctions. Now how does it work? Prabhupada explains this in the purport. Every living being, whether a man or an animal or a bird, thinks that he is free by himself, but actually no one is free from the severe laws of the Lord. This is the reality. This is the truth. Nobody is free. Nobody is independent. The laws of the Lord are said to be severe because they cannot be disobeyed in any circumstance. The man-made laws may be evaded by cunning outlaws, but in the codes of the Supreme Lawmaker, there is not the slightest possibility of neglecting the laws. So, Prabhupada is helping us distinguish between man-made laws, however stringently enforced or however powerful the garment may be, or the law enforcing mechanism. There is a difference. Man-made laws are possible to be evaded by somebody who is cunning or more intelligent or is more powerful than the enforcing authority itself. That is possible. But in the codes of the Supreme, the Supreme Lawmaker, there is not the slightest possibility of neglecting the laws.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of a tsunami to illustrate the consequences of violating God's laws and connects these laws to the codes of religion.

Krishna's laws nobody can neglect or evade or avoid. That is not possible. A slight change in the course of God-made law can bring about a massive danger to be faced by the law-breaker. We have experienced one, tsunami, and even the most powerful persons in this earth planet we are living in. When they have to face such calamities, natural calamities, then there is no question of anybody being powerful, or wealthy, or influential, or well-protected by some material arrangement. All that doesn't work. None of those things work. Such laws of the Supreme are generally known as the codes of religion

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the core principle of all authentic religions is obedience to the Supreme God, leading to protection.

under different conditions. Codes of religion. God and God's laws as codes of religion, religious principles. But one should not think, oh, there are so many different religions, and so many different scriptures. So, is there any commonality? Prabhupada says, but the principle of religion everywhere is one and the same. What is that one and the same principle of religion? Namely, obey the orders of the Supreme God, that is the codes of religion. Every scripture describes this. Authentic, bona fide scriptures we are talking about. We are not talking about some concocted religious systems. No. The authorized religious systems, they are given for the human beings to obey the laws of God, and thereby be under the proper protection, and safe protection of the Supreme Lord only. That is the condition of material existence. Material existence means, we have to obey the codes of religion, which is the orders of the Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "All living beings in the material world have taken up the risk of conditioned life by their own selection."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that living beings in the material world have chosen a conditioned life and are not in complete control of their bodies, which are governed by material nature.

All living beings in the material world have taken up the risk of conditioned life by their own selection. Now, how is it that somebody comes under a particular set of laws? In this material world, the creation itself is made like that. For example, this body that I have got, I think that I am the controller of my body. But actually the reality is, I am not the real ultimate controller of the body. Though I have some degree of control, like I can lift my hand, okay, that is given to you, that control is given to you, limited control is given to you. I can digest the food I eat normally. But if I eat something which cannot be digested, or if I overeat, then I have to suffer indigestion, the consequences of indigestion. So, where is my control? Can I digest anything and everything, and whatever quantity I eat? No. So, can I keep on working without taking rest when the body becomes fatigued? No. When there is an infection that attacks me, then some germs invade my body, then I have to suffer the consequences of that infection unless it is treated. I cannot be living a normal, healthy life. I have to suffer the symptoms of that infection. So, like that, we are not ultimately under complete control of our body. Our body actually is controlled. It is controlled by material nature who is the agency of God's control in this material world, through this material body.

**Key Quote:** "We are taking up the risk of conditioned life by our own selection, because we want to enjoy."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how the material body is a vehicle for punishment due to the desire for concocted enjoyment and violation of God's laws, leading to entrapment in material nature.

Now, who doesn't have a material body? Every created being has a material body. Every created being. Brahma, beginning from Brahma, the first created being, the topmost devata, up to the insignificant creatures, everyone has a material body. We don't have any suffering. There is no connection between the material body and the soul except that this body is given to us simply because we desire some concocted enjoyment. And we violate the laws and we are also given the punishment through this body only, by the agency of God, called material nature, Durga Devi. So, we are taking up the risk of conditioned life by our own selection, because we want to enjoy. We violate the laws and we come under the enforcement, law enforcement authority, forcing us to accept this body, so that we will be given suitable punishment through this body. We thus become entrapped by the laws of material nature. We are trapped, because even a slight violation, we have to suffer the consequences of that violation.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the concept of spiritual intelligence as the key to understanding and escaping material entanglement through obedience to the Supreme Lord and spiritual practices.

The only way to get out of the entanglement is to agree to obey the Supreme. Actually, it is very simple. How do I get out of this entanglement? First of all, to understand that I am entangled itself requires some a particular type of intelligence. It is called spiritual intelligence. It is different from material intelligence. Please try to understand this point. Material intelligence is for ordinary material subject matters. But spiritual intelligence is something else. It is only possible to exercise our spirit. Everybody has got spiritual intelligence because it is spirit soul. Everyone, every living being is spirit soul. But that spiritual intelligence is awakened and it is trained up to be utilized by spiritual instruction, by spiritual practice, by spiritual master, by spiritual direction given in the scriptures. So only that can awaken our spiritual intelligence.

**Key Quote:** "As long as one is spiritually ignorant, it doesn't matter what is their material situation or material position."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts spiritually ignorant people, who deny God and suffer, with devotees who have awakened their spiritual intelligence and understand God's hand in everything.

Spiritual intelligence is different. Like foolish people. Foolish people means they say there is no God. I don't believe in religion. Such foolish people, they don't, they are unable to awaken their spiritual intelligence because they don't follow the scriptural directions. They don't have any spiritual practices. They don't obey the order of the Supreme Lord. And so therefore they have to suffer. They suffer in ignorance, spiritual ignorance. They might be materially very qualified or unqualified. It doesn't matter. As long as one is spiritually ignorant, it doesn't matter what is their material situation or material position. Whether they are wealthy or they are poor. Whether they are old or young. Whether they are powerful or not so powerful. Materially, whatever their situation, if they are spiritually ignorant, they have to suffer. Suffer in ignorance. Because they violate and they don't awaken their spiritual intelligence. Those who have awakened their spiritual intelligence by properly following the laws of God. They are the wisest people in the whole creation. They are called devotees of the Supreme Lord. And very easily they understand how the laws are working. They are able to see the hand of God in every action they do. Everywhere. Everyone is under the control of God. So this requires spiritual intelligence to be able to understand, to be able to perceive, to be able to actually make a make a very intelligent decision. How to get out of this forced suffering. So, it is to agree to obey the Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "Surrender to the Supreme Lord and agree to abide by His orders is the way to get out."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by discussing how material designations bind us and reiterates that surrender and obedience to the Supreme Lord are the path to liberation, ending with Hare Krishna.

But instead of becoming free from the clutches of Maya or illusion, foolish human beings become bound up by different nomenclatures being designated as Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra, Hindus, Mohammedans, Indians, Europeans, and many other designations like this. And thus they carry out the orders of the Supreme Lord under the influence with respect to scriptural or legislative injunctions. See these material designations. Upadhi. Everybody has got Upadhi. I am this, I am that. Beginning with I am the body. And later on the body becomes decorated with different titles. Somebody studies in a university and acquires degrees like Ph.D. or M.A. or whatever the university titles are. Or somebody becomes qualified as a doctor or a lawyer or a prime minister is elected or has won the popular vote and is in a very powerful position as the leader of a big nation. So, the leader of a big nation, great nation or even the post of a devata much higher. Indra, Chandra, Varuna, Vayu, all powerful controllers. You can imagine the control of the wind which is blowing all over the universe. Very powerful position. But even He is subject to the laws of God in this material world. So, surrender to the Supreme Lord and agree to abide by His orders is the way to get out. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

You are like the captain of the ship. So you please guide us to our destination. So then Narada is, first of all, explaining the important principles by which this world is working, and then he will come to the actual facts about the uncles of Yudhishthira, both Vidura and Dhritarashtra, as well as Gandhari, where have they gone. That he will tell later, but first of all, he explains the general principles which is very much helpful for all of us to understand the facts about our existence in this material world.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding that our current situation is a result of our past actions and that we are responsible for our actions under the laws of karma, which apply to all living beings, especially humans.

them; both are due to the supreme will of the Lord. But how does it actually work? Some details are given by Srila Prabhupada in the purport. We must know for certain. We need to know that the particular position in which we are now set up is an arrangement of the supreme will in terms of our own acts in the past. So we have to consider the supreme will of the supreme Lord and also our own actions in the past. So it is not just the Lord alone who decides everything independently, there is also the consideration of our own actions in the past. What kind of actions? Our material activities in the past. We are held responsible for every action of ours, especially as human beings. So this we should not forget. If we don't act responsibly, we'll have to pay the price for irresponsibly acting because we are under the laws of the Supreme Lord God. These are called the laws of karma. So every action we are accountable, whether the state laws may or may not consider the consequence of every action of ours. The state laws work within the framework of some constitutional laws for people who are called citizens of this country. But the laws of karma are not responsible for our actions. The laws of God are working for every living being.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Supreme Lord is present as the localized Paramatma in the heart of every living being"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the role of the Paramatma (Super Soul) as the witness and sanctioner of our actions, citing Bhagavad Gita (13.23), and how this relates to the reactions we receive for our past deeds.

And especially the human being is held responsible for every action of his. Srila Prabhupada further explains, the Supreme Lord is present as the localized Paramatma in the heart of every living being, as it is said in the Bhagavad Gita in the 13th chapter in the 23rd verse: Upadrishta anumanam. Svaramanta bharata bhoktamaheswaraha. Paramatmeti capyukto dehesmin purushapparaah. Krishna is explaining, there is another transcendental enjoyer in this body apart from the living being who is a subordinate enjoyer, there is a transcendental enjoyer, he is called Paramatma, the Super Soul. Srila Prabhupada further explains, and he is the witnesser of every action of ours and he is the sanctioner of every action, both the witnesser and sanctioner. He is a supreme lord, he is a supreme controller, he is a supreme proprietor, Maheshwara Bharta, he is a supreme enjoyer, he is a supreme maintainer, supreme provider. Therefore, Srila Prabhupada says he knows everything of our activities in every stage of our lives. He knows the past, present and future. Vedaham Samatitani Vartamanani Charjuna Bhavishyani Chabhutani Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, I know the past, present and future of every living being, and this is a fact. So because he knows, he rewards the reactions of our actions by placing us in some particular place. So if I am in my whatever position, born in a particular family with certain circumstances, with certain facilities, with certain amount of life, with certain knowledge or intelligence or wealth, material knowledge I am talking about, material wealth, material intelligence, that is the reward of the Paramatma

**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of a rich man's son born with a silver spoon to illustrate how the Paramatma guides living beings according to their karma and desires, and how both coming together and separation are governed by the Lord's will.

for my past actions. So Srila Prabhupada gives an example, a rich man gets his son born with a silver spoon in his mouth, but the child who came as the rich man's son deserved such a place and therefore he is placed there by the will of the Lord. Every one of us is spirit soul and we have got our reactions from the past. So the Lord places, as Paramatma, he guides every living being, every living being and particularly the human being is guided every moment for every action according to the will of the Lord, to what he deserves and what he desires, both are taken into account, and at a particular moment when the child has to be removed from that place, he is also carried by the will of the Supreme, even the child or the father does not wish to be separated from the happy relation. So we come together in a family or in a society, in a community, in a workplace, in a family, in a country, in a foreign place even, or even in heavenly planets, we come together by the will of the Lord according to our karma and we are separated also by the will of the Lord again according to our karma.

The same thing happens in the case of a poor man also. It is not just a rich man alone. It's working in everybody's case. Neither rich man nor poor man has any control over such meetings or separations of living beings. The example of a player and his playthings should not be misunderstood. Narad Muni is giving the example just like a player. He sets up different things, and according to his sweet will, he sets it up and he dismantles it whenever he likes, the way he likes.

**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that while the Lord generally awards reactions according to karma, He is not bound by it and can change the reactions at His will, contrasting this with the Karma Mimamsa philosophy.

So, this should not be misunderstood. How to understand this example properly? Srila Prabhupada says here, one may argue that since the Lord is bound to avoid the reactionary results of our own actions, the example of a player, player cannot be applied because earlier Prabhupada is mentioned according to our reactions the Lord is giving us a certain placing us in a certain position, but we should not think that the Lord is completely bound up to reward each of our reactions, that is not true. Generally the Lord will give us our reactions which is due to us, but he may at his own will, he may change that also. The karma mimamsa philosophy says that even if there is God, everyone will have to get their own reactions of their past actions, so the karma mimamsa philosophers say we don't have to bother about God, which is a wrong

philosophy. While it is true that people in general get the reactions of their own past actions according to the body they have got, but still the Supreme Lord always reserves the ultimate sanction of such reactions moment to moment, and in specific cases the Supreme Lord can change the reactions which are due, especially Prabhupada explains that in the case of a devotee who has surrendered to Krishna. So Shri la Prabhupada explains how does it work in the case of a devotee. We must always remember that the Lord is a supreme will and he is not bound by any law. He is not bound by law, we are bound up, he is not bound by any law. Generally the law of karma is that one is awarded to the Lord itself when we are specific about the duty of God who has made us that way, we are bound up and we should not get bound by any law. Generally the law of karma is that one is awarded to the Supreme Lord and the Lord is not bound by any law, we are bound up the result of one's own actions, but in special cases by the will of the Lord such resultant actions are chained also. So when is it changed? This change can be affected by the will of the Lord only and no other. Only the Lord can change if he wants to, not otherwise. Therefore, the example of the player cited in this verse is quite appropriate for the supreme will. He is absolutely free to do

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the Lord's special concern for protecting pure devotees who have surrendered to Him, and that the Lord is transcendent to all laws.

whatever he likes, and because he is all perfect, there is no mistake in any of his actions or reactions, the supreme law to the supreme perfect being. Therefore, there is no question of any mistake in any of his actions, absolutely no mistakes. These changes of resultant actions are especially rendered by the Lord when a pure devotee is involved. See, when a pure devotee is involved, the Lord is particularly concerned about protecting the pure devotee in all circumstances, in all conditions, even in this material world. So the Lord is neutral as far as non-devotees are concerned according to the divine law because the reactions are actually given to each living being who is an art devotee, but for a pure devotee the Lord intervenes according to his own sweet will. It is assured in the Bhagavad-Gita that the Lord saves a pure devotee who surrendered unto him without reservation from all sorts of reactions of sins and there is no doubt about this. So the Lord is able to change the reactions of one's past deeds if the person in question happens to be a pure devotee. So if he can change for a pure devotee, then he himself is not bound by any laws, himself is not bound, he is perfect and transcendent to all laws.

**Key Quote:** "Bhagavatam, and the followers of the Bhagavata philosophy, the pure devotees, they give the perfect understanding based on the complete knowledge about the reality."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains that the Bhagavatam and its followers offer a perfect understanding of reality based on complete knowledge, unlike other philosophers.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 44th verse of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. यन मन्यसे ध्रुवं लोकं अध्रुवं वा नचो भयं सर्वथा नही शोच्चास्ते स्नेहाद अन्यत्र मोहजात The meaning of this verse is, O King, in all circumstances, whether you consider the soul to be an eternal principle, or the material body to be perishable, or everything to exist in the impersonal absolute truth, or everything to be an inexplicable combination of matter and spirit, feelings of separation are due only to illusory affection and nothing more. A technical verse, and it explains perfectly the philosophy of Krishna Kaalabhata, as the perfect explanation of the reality of the truth in this world. About what is this world, or who we are, or what is actually going on, the basis for things to take place in this world. Different philosophers have different theories. Now, the Bhagavatam, and the followers of the Bhagavata philosophy, the pure devotees, they give the perfect understanding based on the complete knowledge about the reality.

**Key Quote:** "Just like the materialists do not know anything about the soul. If they don't know anything about the soul, then they do not know anything about the supreme soul either."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the Bhagavata understanding with that of materialists, who are ignorant of the soul and the Supreme Soul, and discusses the understanding of matter and its elements.

Because the other philosophers are not able to see the complete reality. They are ignorant about certain facts, or certain facets of reality. Just like the materialists do not know anything about the soul. If they don't know anything about the soul, then they do not know anything about the supreme soul either. So, they don't take spiritual reality into consideration, which is always in the background of the material reality. Even the material reality, different philosophers have different degrees of understanding. Different philosophies have different degrees of understanding. Different philosophies are different. Different religions have different degrees of understanding. Different religions have different degrees of understanding of what is matter. Some people do not even know that matter means the five elements, gross matter, consists of five elements combined in different proportions. It consists of five elements combined in different proportions, and it comes into existence by the combination of the five elements in different proportions when it is created. It remains for some time, and then it is separated again back to the five elements. This is what is going on as far as all the material objects are concerned. And this is happening not by any person's endeavor, but by the actions and reactions of the material modes of nature.

**Key Quote:** "Feelings of separation, which any two people experience who are separated, are only due to illusory affection."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the main point of the verse, stating that feelings of separation are due to illusory affection.

This reality is not known to the modern day scientists. They don't even know what are these five elements. So, here, Naramuni is presenting the fact that whatever be one's understanding of the present reality, feelings of separation, which any two people experience who are separated, are only due to illusory affection. So, here, Naramuni is presenting the fact that whatever be one's understanding of the present reality, feelings of separation, which any two people experience who are separated, are only due to illusory affection. So, here, Naramuni is presenting the fact that whatever be one's understanding of the present reality, feelings of separation, are only due to illusory affection. We have an affection for some of our near and dear ones, and when we are separated from somebody whom we have got an affectionate relationship, we feel the pangs of separation, and we desire that we again are able to come together and stay as well-wishers of each other.

**Key Quote:** "The soul to be an eternal principle is a fact but that is not the only eternal principle that is there in this world there is a higher eternal principle of the absolute eternal principle that is the Supreme Lord Krishna above both this tiny spirits souls and matter itself for the material creation itself beyond both."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the first philosophical viewpoint: the soul as an eternal principle, contrasting it with the Supreme Lord Krishna, who is above both the soul and matter.

The Maya that is working in this world, so what are the different philosophies? Just to cite the different philosophers mentioned here by Naramuni, four kinds of philosophies are mentioned in our verse. So, the first philosophy he mentions is those who say the soul to be an eternal principle. I am spirit soul, you are spirit soul, every living being is spirit soul, and as spirit soul, we are all eternal beings. We don't die, we don't take birth, we don't deteriorate as soul. Soul has no deterioration. The wonderful qualities and properties of the soul are described in the second chapter of the Bhagavad Gita by Lord Krishna. So there it is clearly said, cannot be burned by fire, cannot be withered by the wind, cannot be destroyed by any of the different kinds of weapons, is not subject to birth and death. It is only the body which is born, which undergoes changes, six kinds of changes, shad vikara: birth, growth, sustenance, producing by-products, dwindling, and finally vanishing. These six changes apply to the body or any material object, but it doesn't apply to the spirit soul. So, the soul to be an eternal principle is a fact, but that is not the only eternal principle that is there in this world. There is a higher eternal principle of the absolute eternal principle, that is the Supreme Lord Krishna, above both these tiny spirit souls and matter itself. For the material creation itself, a material world itself, beyond both. The controller of both, the absolute controller, the ultimate controller is Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "It is a fact that this body is perishable. But the body we are going to get next, after we quit this body, when it becomes no longer habitable, then we have to actually enter another body, forced to enter, and suffer in that body, undergo experiences in that body, whether we like it or not."
**Summary:** The speaker presents the second philosophical viewpoint: the material body as perishable, referencing the atheist Charvak Muni, and refutes it by emphasizing the soul's transmigration and rebirth.

So this is just one aspect of the truth or the reality, the soul to be an eternal principle. Another theory says, a philosopher says, the material body is perishable. Many times even materialists say that, after all this body we are not going to have forever. So, why should we be so much worried about next life? One atheist by name Charvak Muni, he has said in the past, millions of years ago he has said, that this body is going to turn into ashes because ultimately according to our tradition, we either burn the body or bury the body or leave it for vultures to eat. It is going to be ultimately perish. So when the body is going to perish, where is the question of taking birth again? Now this is a philosophy which does not take into consideration within the body there is a spirit soul which is eternal. That Charvak Muni is not able to figure out. He is like the modern day materialist, materialistic scientist that, after all, who are we? This body. So this body is, as long as it is there, enjoy life. Don't bother about God and life after death and all that. Don't bother about all that. So this is the hedonistic philosophy, atheistic philosophy, Charvak philosophy. So body is perishable. It is a fact that this body is perishable, but the body we are going to get next, after we quit this body, when it becomes no longer habitable, then we have to actually enter another body, forced to enter, and suffer in that body, undergo experiences in that body, whether we like it or not. So that Charvak Muni has no understanding. Neither the materialistic persons understand that. Change of body at death. By whom? By the person inside this body. The body is coming into existence and it's going to remain for some time, undergo some changes, and it's going to perish. Yes. But what about the person inside the body? The experiencer. The resident of the body. Dehi and Deha. This fundamental differentiation is made in the Bhagavad Gita in the beginning.

**Key Quote:** "Everything is existing in the impersonal absolute truth... Try to understand matter is illusory. And, you are that impersonal absolute truth. And, you have to aim for liberation from this material bondage by developing detachment and becoming one with the supreme impersonal absolute."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the third philosophical viewpoint: everything existing in the impersonal absolute truth (Mayavada philosophy), where matter is considered illusory and liberation is achieved through detachment.

Then, another philosophy says, everything is existing in the impersonal absolute truth. The Mayavadis. They say, there is only one impersonal Brahman, and we are all that impersonal Brahman. This matter is simply some illusory thing. That's all. It is there today. It is not there tomorrow. At the most, it will last till Pralaya. So, don't bother about this body. Don't take into consideration anything about matter. Try to understand matter is illusory, and you are that impersonal absolute truth, and you have to aim for liberation from this material bondage by developing detachment and becoming one with the supreme impersonal absolute. So, this is the Mayavada philosophy that Narad Muni is mentioning here. And, yet another philosophy is, everything to be an inexplicable combination of matter and spirit.

**Key Quote:** "Whatever be your philosophical understanding, Narab Muni says the truth you have to remember is that feelings of separation is only due to illusory affection. That's all."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the fourth philosophical viewpoint: everything as an inexplicable combination of matter and spirit, acknowledging the distinct difference between living beings and dead matter, and concludes by reiterating that feelings of separation are due to illusory affection.

There are some philosophers who say there is something called spirit and something called matter. Two things are there, because they understand there is a distinct difference between a living person and dead matter, whether it is a dead body or dead object like a table. There is a distinct difference, and this difference always exists. Always exists. Living body is never the same as a dead matter, and dead matter can never be showing any living symptoms. Though sometimes people claim that even in dead matter we can see some life symptoms, actually, it never is possible. There is a distinct difference between living person in this world I am talking and dead matter. There is always difference. So, they say ultimately there is some kind of combination of matter and spirit, because matter they recognize as completely different from the living person, and living person, they kind of say is something spirit, which is not matter, which is not just dead matter. So, somehow they think there is some combination of the two, because we have got in this body hair and nails which is like dead matter. So, how is hair which is when you cut the hair you don't feel any pain, and that hair is it is just like matter. So, but, the hairs as long as it is attached to this body it keeps growing. So, what about that? Under certain conditions. So, some combination of matter and spirit. That's all. Don't break your head about it. That's all it is. We cannot understand beyond that. Some philosophers say like that. So, whatever be your philosophical understanding, Narab Muni says the truth you have to remember is that feelings of separation is only due to illusory affection. That's all.

**Verse References:** SB 1.13.45
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "All feelings of separation are due to illusory affection."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains the meaning of Srimad Bhagavatam 1.13.45, emphasizing detachment from illusory affection and understanding the supreme control of the Lord.

In this session we will be discussing from the 45th verse of the 13th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. तस्माद् जह्यंग वैक्लव्यं अज्ञानक् कृतमात्मनः कथम् तू अनाथा कृपणा वर्तेरं स्तेच माम् विना The meaning of this 45th verse is, "Therefore give up your anxiety due to ignorance of the self. You are now thinking of how they who are helpless poor creatures will exist without you." So now Narada Muni is coming to the point that he explained in the previous verse. All feelings of separation are due to illusory affection. Then the conclusion now is being drawn after explaining the philosophy, the truth, the reality, that give up your anxiety which is due to ignorance of the self. So you are not considering the fact that you, your uncles, your aunt and everybody for that matter is spirit soul and are controlled by, their movements are controlled by the supreme will according to their own past actions. And now you are thinking, even though you know that, you might be aware that supreme lord ultimate is a controller, but you're thinking, "How will they exist without your help? Because they have become old, they are helpless." That's your anxiety now. But give up your anxiety to the self. Give up that anxiety. And why he has to give up that anxiety, that he'll explain the next verse.

**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing that while we should perform our duties, ultimate protection comes from the Supreme Lord.

But Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, a brief purport, "When we think of our kit and kin as being helpless and dependent on us, it is all due to ignorance." Why is Prabhupada saying this? Because every living creature is allowed all protection by the order of the supreme lord in terms of each one's action. A quiet position in the world, how much protection each person can have at any given time is dependent on the position in which one is placed by the Lord, and the important point is to remember always the Lord is known as Buddha breath, means he is the one who gives protection to all living beings, he is not partial, he is impartial and is the only one who protects each and every living being. So therefore understanding that there is the supreme control of the Supreme Lord and everybody is protected by the Lord, one should discharge his duties only. Does it mean the Supreme Lord is everybody's controller so why should I bother to protect my children or why should I bother to give any protection to the people who are dependent on the Lord? No, that is not correct. We have to do our duty in the position in which we are placed presently. If I am in the position of a father I have to do father's duties towards the children, if I am in the position of a husband I have to do husband's duty, if somebody else is in the position of a mother such a mother has to do her duty towards her children. So everybody has to do their duties and always remember no one but the Supreme Lord can give protection to anyone else. You do your duties and depend on the Supreme Lord for protect your protection, for the protection of your children, the protection of your beloved loved ones, everybody you depend on the Lord for protection, this is the perfect understanding as regards to the...

**Key Quote:** "This gross material body made up of these five elements is already under the control of three different things: eternal time, action, and the three moments."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami introduces the next verse (SB 1.13.46) and explains how the material body is controlled by eternal time (kala), karma, and the three modes of material nature (guna).

Now how the Lord gives protection and how we have to simply discharge our duties is explained very nicely in the next verse. The next verse, forty-sixth verse is, काल कर्म गुणाधीनो देहोयं पांच भवतिकह कथम अञ्याम्स्तु गोपायेत सर्पग्रस्तो यथापरम। This is a very important verse. The meaning of this verse, "This gross material body made up of these five elements is already under the control of three different things." What is that? It is already under control of eternal time, that is काला, under the control of कर्म or action, and under the control of गुणा or the three moments. The three moments of material nature, काला, कर्म, गुणा, eternal time, action, and the material moments. How then can it being already in the jaws of the serpent protect others? काला is also called काल सर्पा because time brings about death. As we all know, it is just a question of time. Somebody may die now, somebody may die some few hours later, somebody may die a few years later, somebody may die at the end of the duration of this universe, but काला is going to ensure death for everybody. So, everybody is under the clutches of काला. So, how can you... how can you avoid that particular death which is going to come? You cannot protect. Everybody is under काला.

#### freedom, control of material nature, modes of nature

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The world's movements for freedom through political, economic, social, and cultural propaganda can do no benefit to anyone because everyone is controlled by the superior power."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, stating that true freedom is not possible through material means because everyone is controlled by material nature and the modes of nature.

So, Srila Prabhupāda explains in the purport, "The world's movements for freedom through political, economic, social, and cultural propaganda can do no benefit to anyone." This so-called freedom is actually really not beneficial. Why? Because everyone is controlled by the superior power. So, who can go against the supreme will of the Supreme Lord that is operating in this material world? No one can do it. A conditioned living being is under the full control of material nature. Conditioned means those who are under the laws of karma. So, everyone is under the laws of karma, except pure devotees, who are transcendental to the laws of karma, because of being directly under the Supreme Lord's internal potency, the spiritual potency, Yoga, Maya. So, except for them, everyone else is under the full control of material nature. Everyone else is a conditioned living being, full control of material nature. Control of material nature means it is represented by three things. Control of material nature means it is represented by eternal time. It is represented by activities under the direction of the material modes of nature, which are always working in this world. So, there are three material modes of nature, namely, goodness, passion, ignorance. Goodness means the sattva guna. Passion means rajo guna. Ignorance means tamo guna. Unless one is situated in the mode of goodness, or sattva guna, one cannot see things as they are. So, Prabhupada says, "The passionate and the ignorant," that means the rajasic and tamasic people, "they cannot even see things as they are. They are unable to see this control of kala, karma, guna. They cannot see. They cannot perceive."

#### modes of nature, guidance, bhakti yoga, kala

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Only the man in the quality of goodness can help to a certain extent... Only that is the only alternative for protection."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains that only those in the mode of goodness can guide others towards taking shelter of the Supreme Lord, and that bhakti yoga is the only way to escape the clutches of kala.

They cannot understand. Therefore, a person who is passionate and ignorant cannot direct his activities on the right path. So, rajasic and tamasic people, they can never be doing things right. They will always make mistakes and they will suffer. Only the man in the quality of goodness can help to a certain extent. So, a man in the quality of goodness can see things properly and can guide how one can actually take shelter of the supreme lord. Only. That is the only alternative for protection. There is no other alternative. Most persons are passionate and ignorant and therefore their plans and projects can hardly do any good to others. So many plans are there for protection, but they don't work the way somebody desires, because the supreme lord, the supreme will, is ultimately going to override all our plans. Above the modes of nature is eternal time, which is called kala, which is called kala because it changes the shape of everything in the material world. Kala is changing everything and that is forced change. It is not something which we can reverse or we can avoid, the influence of kala. Even if we are able to do something temporarily beneficial, time will see that the good project is frustrated in the course of time. Kala will ensure that. The destruction will come at the right time. For the time being we may say maintenance, or we may say protection, or we may say some safety, but ultimately there is no eternal safe position in this material world. No. So Srila Prabhupada says, "The only thing possible to be done is to get rid of eternal time kala, which is compared to kala sarpa or the cobra snake, whose bite is always lethal." Lethal means its constant. Lethal means its going to end our life in this body. So when death comes there is no remedy for avoiding death except bhakti yoga. That Prabhupada will explain. No one can be saved from the bite of a cobra. The best remedy for getting out of the clutches of cobra, like kala, or its integrity, the modes of nature.

#### bhakti yoga, transcendence, spiritual platform

**Key Quote:** "One who renders pure devotional service to Krishna, unfailing in all circumstances, transcends the modes of material nature, comes to the spiritual platform."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami quotes Bhagavad Gita 14.26, explaining that bhakti yoga is the only way to transcend the modes of material nature and become free from the effects of kala, karma, and guna.

Is bhakti yoga. And this is recommended in the Bhagavad Gita, in the 14th chapter, 26th verse. Maam chayo avyabhicharena, Bhakti yogena sevate, Sagunan samatityaitaan, Brahma bhuvaya ayakalpate. One who renders pure devotional service to Krishna, unfailing in all circumstances, transcends the modes of material nature, comes to the spiritual platform. On the spiritual platform one is immune to death and immune to the influence of kala, karma, guna, everything. One's actions become completely spiritual on the spiritual platform for those who are engaged in pure devotional service. So the highest perfectional project of philanthropic activities is to engage everyone in the act of preaching bhakti yoga all over the world. So you should practice bhakti yoga, pure devotional service, and you should preach this bhakti yoga to people who are not aware of bhakti yoga, and this alone can save the people from the control of maya or material nature, represented by kala, karma, and guna. So this is very, very clear. So we should practice bhakti while doing our duties. We should practice bhakti yoga and in that way become free from the effect of kala, karma, guna. I'll stop.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Very important law of material nature that's working universally is explained by Sri Narada Muni to Yudhishthira and to all of us."
**Summary:** This segment introduces the verse about one living being being food for another and addresses the common argument used to justify eating animals.

In this session, we will be discussing from the forty-seventh verse of the thirteenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Ahastāni sahastānām apadāni chatuṣpadām falgūṇī tatra mahatām jīvo jīvasya jīvanam. Very important verse. The meaning of this verse is: those who are devoid of hands are prey for those who have hands. Those devoid of legs are prey for the four-legged. The weak are the subsistence of the strong, and the general rule holds that one living being is food for another living being. So, a very important law of material nature that's working universally is explained by Sri Narada Muni to Yudhishthira and to all of us. Jīva jīvasya jīvanam. The food for our subsistence, according to the law of material nature, is that one living being is food for another. So, there are so many misunderstandings that are possible by simply considering, anyway, one living being is food for another. So what is wrong in killing animals for food? This is the argument many people will give. Those who are meat eaters, they give this argument. But that argument is wrong, as will be pointed out by Prabhupāda in the purport.

**Key Quote:** "The living beings who have come to this material world against the will of the supreme being are under the control of a supreme power called maya shakti, the deputed agent of the lord"
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of purports for understanding scripture, introduces the concept of Maya Shakti, and explains how the law of 'the weak are the subsistence of the strong' is one of the threefold miseries.

Purports are important because they help us understand in the proper way the particular statement of the scripture. What Narada Muni is telling is definitely true. For our subsistence, we cannot eat dead objects. But we still have to use our good sense what kind of food we should, we are permitted to take in terms of jīva jīvasya jīvanam. So, Srila Prabhupāda says in the purport, "A systematic law of subsistence in the struggle for existence is there by the supreme will, and there is no escape for anyone by any amount of planning." So, you try to protect any poor helpless creature. Ultimately, when death comes, you cannot save the body. This is the law. The living beings who have come to this material world against the will of the supreme being are under the control of a supreme power called maya shakti, the deputed agent of the lord. The deputed agent of the lord is maya shakti. And this daivimaya, divine power, is meant to pinch the conditioned souls by threefold miseries, one of which is explained here in this verse. We are always under the threefold miseries, tapatraya, which is the one that is mentioned here, the weak are the subsistence of the strong.

**Key Quote:** "Although the law states that a human being must subsist on another living being, there is also the law of good sense. For the human being is meant to obey the laws of the scriptures."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the categories of strength, the importance of following scriptural laws, and the sinful reactions that arise from violating them.

No one is strong enough to protect himself from the power of the supreme being. And by the will of the lord, there are systematic categories of the weak, the stronger, and the strongest. All around you, you can see this. There is nothing to be lamented if a tiger eats a weaker animal. For its food, a tiger will kill another weaker animal and eat its flesh. Although the law states that a human being must subsist on another living being, there is also the law of good sense. For the human being is meant to obey the laws of the scriptures. For the human beings, there is something extra above the fundamental laws of jivo, jivasya, jivanam. We have to subsist on other living beings, but that doesn't mean that we violate the laws of the scriptures. So we have to live by eating some other living thing, but we also have to follow the laws of scriptures. That is the law of good sense for the human being. The human being is meant for self-realization. And for that purpose, he is not to eat anything which is not first offered to the lord. This is the law of scripture. It is explained in the Bhagavad Gita. Whatever you eat, you have to first offer to Krishna. And only then you are free from reactions. Otherwise, you are going to suffer severe reactions. And what are those reactions? That reaction is called papa.

#### Offering Food to Krishna, Prasada, Vegetarianism

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Whatever you eat, you have to first offer to Krishna. And only then you are free from reactions. Otherwise, you are going to suffer severe reactions."
**Summary:** This segment explains the process of offering vegetarian food to Krishna, partaking of prasada, and how this mitigates suffering and frees one from reactions.

Sinful reaction. Sinful reaction is severe suffering, which is enforced by material nature. Nobody can go against it. So, Srila Prabhupada explains, the lord accepts from his devotee all kinds of food, preparations made of vegetables, fruits, leaves, and grains. Fruits, leaves, and milk in different varieties can be offered to the lord. And after the lord accepts, the food is offered to him. The devotee can partake of the prasada, by which all suffering in the struggle for existence will be gradually mitigated. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad Gita, 9.26: Patram pushpam phalam toyam yome bhaktya prayarchati. What Krishna accepts has been told in the Gita. This is the law of scripture. You should eat only what is offered to Krishna. Only then you can be free from reactions. And you can progress in bhakti, to get out of the clutches of maya. No more to suffer any material existence. But, you have to only offer Krishna varieties of foodstuff, which is prepared from patram pushpam phalam toyam. In this category, vegetarian, not non-vegetarian.

**Key Quote:** "For them, the injunctions are not meant to encourage the eating of animal flesh. No. But to restrict them by regulated principles."
**Summary:** This segment discusses scriptural injunctions for meat-eaters, emphasizing that they are meant to restrict and minimize harm to animals, not to encourage meat-eating.

Even those who are accustomed to eat animals can offer foodstuff. Now, this is something that is explained in the scriptures, people do not know. They can eat animal flesh, not by offering to the lord directly, not by offering to Krishna. No, Krishna does not accept flesh. But, they can offer to an agent of the lord according to the scriptures, according to the scriptural direction, under certain conditions of religious rights. So, there are specific rules: what they can offer, to whom they can offer, when they can offer, how they have to offer. All this is given in the shastra. So, injunctions of the scriptures, especially for these meat eaters, who want to eat animal flesh. For them, the injunctions are not meant to encourage the eating of animal flesh. No, but to restrict them by regulated principles, to minimize the harm done to animals. The killing of animals is to be restricted. That's the ultimate aim.

**Key Quote:** "You can relish. And lead a healthy life simply by eating vegetarian foods of offer to the lord."
**Summary:** This segment promotes a vegetarian diet offered to the Lord, emphasizing that the Lord provides for all living beings and one need not be anxious about subsistence.

And put some sense into these people's head, that you should completely avoid animal killing because you can subsist, and not only subsist, you can relish and lead a healthy life simply by eating vegetarian foods offered to the lord and partaking prasad. So, to put this sense into the head of the foolish people who simply, to satisfy their tongue, they indiscriminately kill animals and eat animal flesh. For them to be saved from severe reactions, very, very sinful, severe reactions, the scriptures are guiding and regulating such animal killing. So, further Srila Prabhupada says, "The living being is a source of subsistence for other stronger living beings. No one should be very anxious for a subsistence in any circumstances, because there are living beings everywhere, and no living being starves for want of food at any place." See, if I am placed in a particular situation by the higher arrangement of the supreme lord, then I will be provided by the lord whatever I require for my subsistence. Now, how that is going to happen is mystical.

**Key Quote:** "The lord provides ant its small grain. And the lord provides the elephant its 500 kg of food."
**Summary:** This segment uses the analogy of the African jungle to illustrate how the Lord provides for all living beings, regardless of their size or needs, and assures that even in the forest, prasada is available.

Like how do, Prabhupada explains this very nicely in another place, how do so many millions of living entities subsist in the African jungle? Or any jungle? How do they subsist? The lord arranges for the elephant. It requires 500 kg of food at a time in one day. And the ant requires a small grain of sugar, or some small grain of stuff, particular foodstuff. So, the lord provides the ant its small grain, and the lord provides the elephant its 500 kg of food. So, the lord is arranged. So, you don't have to be anxious how elephants will survive, how will they get their food, or how an ant will survive. No. Just like in the African jungle, there is no scarcity of food. So, therefore, the conclusion is Maharaj Yudhishtira has advised by Narada not to worry about his uncle's suffering for want of food, for they could live on vegetables available in the jungles as prasada of the supreme lord, and thus realize the path of salvation.

**Summary:** This segment discusses how those seeking self-realization can subsist in places like the Himalayan region on available fruits and vegetables, emphasizing the Lord's protection for spiritualists.

So, Narada is going to tell, your uncles have gone to the forest for the sake of self-realization. And how will they subsist without your providing them their food? The lord will provide prasada in the form of vegetables or fruits in the forest. Srila Prabhupada says about the Himalayan region, the forest in the Himalayan region, there is plenty of fruits for spiritualists particularly. Plenty of fruits available, and roots are there, berries are there, and vegetation is there, which different seasons, different things are available for subsistence of the devotees, the yogis, the transcendentalists. They don't have to kill any animal, nothing. And the lord's protection is also there for a spiritualist, for a transcendentalist, who is engaged in meditation or spiritual practice in the jungle. Prabhupada explains that also. So, that is the higher arrangement.

**Key Quote:** "It can be checked only by awakening the spiritual sense of the human being. By practice of spiritual regulation."
**Summary:** This segment explains that while the exploitation of the weak by the strong is a natural law, it can only be checked in humans by awakening their spiritual sense through spiritual practice.

Now, the exploitation of the weaker living being by the stronger is a natural law of existence. That is natural law. A tiger will kill another living being, but only when the tiger is hungry, and only as much as it requires. The tiger lives in the jungle, not that it is always killing some other weaker animal. No. Only when it is hungry, and that also only one animal, and that also that flesh will last for it for several days or weeks. I don't know how much time. But till that flesh is there, the tiger will not kill another animal. So, this is the law of existence. There is no possibility of checking this tendency of a stronger living being devouring a weaker living being for its food by any artificial means under material conditions. It can be checked only by awakening the spiritual sense of the human being by practice of spiritual regulation.

Only a human being should not kill another animal or another creature, whether insect or bird or anything. Human being should subsist on food grains, and vegetables and fruits, and milk. But this sense is possible to be awakened by spiritual practice. So, if a man kills another animal, then how can he expect peace in the society? He will also be killed by the laws of nature. And there are many instances of this explained, which I don't have time to go into. Some other time I will explain. So, human being should not kill another animal. They should only subsist on food grains, vegetables, fruits, and milk, by offering that to Krishna and partaking prasad. So, this is the conclusion. I will stop here.

#### supremacy of the Lord, oneness of God, challenges to God

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Supreme Lord Personality of God, it is one without a second."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami introduces verse SB 1.13.48, explaining that Narada Muni is addressing Yudhishthira Maharaj and emphasizing the Supreme Lord is one without a second, illustrating this point with the story of Paundraka who falsely claimed to be God.

In this session we will be discussing from the 48th verse of the 13th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: रदिदं भगवान राजन एक आत्मात्मानं स्वद्रिक अन्तरो अनन्तरो भाती पश्यतं माययो रुधा. The meaning of this verse is: Therefore, O King, you should look to the Supreme Lord only, who is one without a second, and who manifests himself by different energies, and is both within and without. This verse is spoken by Narada Muni, he is addressing Yudhishthira Maharaj. He is explaining the philosophy first and then he is going to give the details about where the two uncles of Yudhishthira, Tritarashtra and Vidura, where have they gone. That is basically Yudhishthira's question to Narada Muni. So Narada Muni is going to answer that, before that he explains the philosophical basis for the solution to Yudhishthira's problem. And already Narada Muni has explained that when our own body is under the clutches of material nature, how can we help somebody else who may be suffering or undergoing difficulty because of their bodies being under the clutches of material nature. So it is ultimately the Supreme Lord, who is the Supreme Controller, who actually is the ultimate cause of all causes. We have to look towards him only after we do our duties. It is not that we neglect our duties because Supreme Lord is in control. No, we have to do our duties, but beyond that we only look towards the Lord. And Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport very elaborately. Srila Prabhupada says, "The Supreme Lord, Personality of Godhead, is one without a second." That means he is the only one who is the Supreme Lord. There are no two Supreme Lords, only one. Supreme means one, and there is nobody else who is a competitor to God. Sometimes we hear that somebody else is challenging God. That is never possible. It never has happened, never will happen. Even when Krishna was present on this earth, he had incarnated 5000 years ago, he was in Dwaraka. One Asura by name Paundraka, he declared himself as the real God, and he told Krishna, he challenged Krishna that you give up your symbols because I am the real Vasudeva. And Krishna actually when he received that note from the messenger of this Paundraka, Paundraka was a king ruling a particular province, and this Paundraka declared himself to be God. And this happens even now, that somebody declares I am God. So these sort of claims have no real foundation, they have no real basis. So Krishna just sent his Sudarshan Chakra. The Sudarshan Chakra cut off this Paundraka's head, and that was the end of Paundraka. So these sort of claims have no real basis. Therefore it is very clearly said by Narada, authoritative statement, the Supreme Lord, Personality of God, it is one without a second.

#### energies of the Lord, marginal energy, spiritual nature of living beings, contamination of material world

**Key Quote:** "The living beings are also manifestations of his marginal energy."
**Summary:** The lecture explains how the Lord manifests through different energies, including the marginal energy (living beings), highlighting the spiritual nature of living beings and how it is qualitatively one with the Lord, but pervertedly manifested in the material world due to contamination.

But he manifests himself by different energies because he is by nature blissful. Even though he is one only, he is not a limited person like us. So he has many forms, and all of them are identical to him. They are all only one person: Rama, Narasimha, Vamana, Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Narayana, all, Balarama, Krishna, all are Krishna only, one person. So he manifests himself by different energies. The living beings are also manifestations of his marginal energy. We are also energy of the Supreme Lord, but what kind of energy? Called marginal energy. And this marginal energy characteristic is qualitatively one with the Lord. That means our quality, which is spiritual, is same as the Lord's quality, which is completely spiritual. So we are not material beings, we are spiritual beings. And there are innumerable living beings both within and without the external internal energies of the Lord. So apart from this marginal energy, the Supreme Lord has got the external energy, the material energy, and the internal energy, which is the spiritual energy. So within the material with spiritual energy, and within the material energy, there are innumerable living beings. Since the spiritual world is a manifestation of the Lord's internal energy, the living beings within that internal potency are qualitatively one with the Lord without contamination from external potency. They are pure. In the spiritual world, there are many many living beings, but all of them are pure, means there is no contamination of the external potency. Although qualitatively one with the Lord, the living being in this material world, due to contamination of the material world, is pervertedly manifested.

#### material contamination, false identity, illusory happiness and distress, forgetfulness of spiritual qualities

**Key Quote:** "The perception of such ephemeral happiness and distress is due only to the forgetfulness of its qualities."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how material contamination leads to a false sense of identity and the experience of illusory happiness and distress, emphasizing that this is due to forgetfulness of our true spiritual qualities.

So this manifestation here means everyone here has got a material body, and that material body is not only externally covering the soul, but the consciousness also has become polluted by the material atmosphere with a false sense of identity, as I am independent, I am the Lord, I am the master, I am the enjoyer, I am the proprietor. All these contaminations are even there in the consciousness. So that's why Srila Prabhupada says here, "The living being is pervertedly manifested in this material world, and therefore he experiences so called happiness and distress in the material world." What is our original position? Completely blissful, eternally in the association of Krishna in the spiritual world. That is our original position, that's our pure state of existence. But this contaminated state in the material world is such that there is illusory happiness and there is illusory distress. Such experiences are all ephemeral. Ephemeral means they are all temporally manifested and do not affect the spirit soul. The spirit soul is completely aloof from all the material coverings or the material influence. The perception of such ephemeral happiness and distress is due only to the forgetfulness of its qualities. We forget our own spiritual quality. In contact with this material nature, we forget our self, we forget our spiritual nature.

#### Lord's arrangement for rectification, Paramatma, spiritual master, scriptures, cooperation with the Lord

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "By his order only, one should become a spiritual master."
**Summary:** The lecture explains how the Lord makes arrangements to rectify the fallen condition of living beings, both internally as Paramatma and externally through the spiritual master and scriptures, emphasizing the importance of cooperating with the Lord's outward activities.

Now our qualities are completely spiritual, like the Lord's quality, which is completely spiritual. There is however a regular current from the Lord himself, from within and without, by which to rectify the fallen condition of the living being. The Lord wants to correct our mistaken identity, so he makes arrangement, he makes elaborate arrangements in this material world. So within, from within us, he corrects the desiring living beings as localized Paramatma. That means Krishna has entered every living being's heart in this material world as Paramatma, Supersoul, and he corrects the desiring living being. He guides, provided we take his guidance. We can be corrected, we can be saved, we can be delivered from this material existence, we can get out of this entanglement. It's possible. And from without, that means externally, he corrects by his manifestations, the spiritual master and the revealed scriptures, Guru and Shastra. One should look unto the Lord, one should not be disturbed by so called manifestations of happiness and distress. Look towards the Lord, internally look towards the Paramatma, and externally look towards the spiritual master and the scriptures, and don't be disturbed by so called happiness and distress. If there is happiness also, there is no cause for jubilation, and if there is distress, there is no cause for lamentation. In either case, we have to go on with our spiritual life. So therefore Srila Prabhupada says, "Instead of being disturbed, one should try to co-operate with the Lord in his outward activities for correcting the fallen souls." Outward activities, the Lord is making arrangement for correcting the fallen souls. By his order only, one should become a spiritual master.

**Key Quote:** "Nobody can be a spiritual master without the order from the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that a spiritual master must be authorized by the Lord and should not seek personal gain, highlighting the qualities of a bonafide spiritual master who is qualitatively one with the Lord, contrasting this with those who are forgetful of the Lord and perverted reflections.

Very clear, the Lord's order has to be there to become a spiritual master. Nobody can be a spiritual master without the order from the Supreme Lord, explicit order from the Supreme Lord. And one should in this way co-operate with the Lord. Nobody can have an independent program of spiritual life. It has to be something which is given by the Lord, which is authorized by the Lord, which is ordered by the Lord. One should not become a spiritual master for one's personal benefit, for some material gain, or as an avenue of business or occupation for earning livelihood. This is very very bad. Somebody becomes a guru so that they can live off the disciples. That is very wrong, that should never be done. Neither should spiritual master look for some material benefit from the disciples. No. The spiritual master who looks at the Supreme Lord to co-operate with him is actually qualitatively one with the Lord. See, the bonafide spiritual master are completely spiritual personalities. They have no tinge of any material contamination. Therefore they are described as qualitatively one with the Lord. And the forgetful ones are perverted reflections only. The living beings who are forgetful of the Supreme Lord, they are not in their original state of existence, they are perverted reflections. Yudhishthira Maharaj is advised by Narada therefore not to be disturbed by the affairs of so called happiness and distress, but to look only unto the Lord.

To execute the mission for which the Lord has descended. That was his prime duty. So this is Narada's instruction to Yudhishthira. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

#### Krishna's descent as time, Asuras vs. Devatas, Devotee protection
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/suRASGsPB1s?t=51
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "For the devotees, his factual form is disclosed, and for non-devotees, he appears like Kalarupa, which is causal form."
**Summary:** This segment explains the meaning of the verse, describing Krishna's descent as all-devouring time to eliminate the envious, contrasting the fates of devotees and asuras, and highlighting the protection afforded to devotees.

In this session we will be discussing from the 49th verse of the 13th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, सोयम अध्यमहाराज भगवान भूतभावनह कालरूपो अवतीरणो स्याम अभावाय सुरत्विशाम। The meaning of this verse is, that supreme personality of Godhead, Lord Sri Krishna, in the guise of all devouring time, कालरूपा, has now descended on earth, to eliminate the envious from the world. So, this verse describes Krishna's descent, also as the all devouring time, कालरूपो. So, Prabhupada explains this in the purport. There are two classes of human beings, namely the envious and the obedient, who are called the envious. Since the supreme lord is one and the father of all living beings, the envious living beings are also his sons, but they are known as the asuras. But the living beings who are obedient to the supreme father are called devatas or demigods, because they are not contaminated by the material conception of life. Demigod means almost like God, or godly. Demigods also can be called godly persons or godly beings. Not only are the asuras envious of the lord, in even denying the existence of the lord, but they are also envious of all other living beings. See, this is the nature of the asuras. It's called demoniac nature. This is described in the Bhagavad Gita also, 16th chapter. The demoniac nature and the divine nature. The predominance of asuras in the world is occasionally rectified by the lord when he eliminates them from the world and establishes a rule of devatas like the Pandavas. The lord sometimes personally comes and sometimes he deputes his devotee. To kill these asuras and establish the proper rule of the devatas, like the Pandavas, godly beings. So his designation, that means the lord's designation as Kala in disguise, is significant. Kalaropoyam. He is not at all dangerous, but he is the transcendental form of eternity, knowledge and bliss. Kalaropoyam. That's the real form of the Supreme Lord. Full of bliss, full of knowledge. Very, very beautiful form, most attractive and very pleasing to the eyes. So that is the real form, original form of the lord. But, Prabhupada says, for the devotees, his factual form is disclosed, and for non-devotees, he appears like Kalarupa, which is causal form. So what is the causal form? This causal form of the Lord is not at all pleasing to the asuras. When he appears as death, that is not at all pleasing to anybody.

#### Devotee's perspective on death, Asura's fear of death, Form of God

**Key Quote:** "So for devotees, there is no death. That's why devotional service is the only way to conquer death."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how devotees are protected from death and how asuras fear death and deny the form of God to feel secure.

Specially for the asuras. Now, devotees don't have to face death, even devotees who take birth in this material world, because they are personally protected by the Lord. So for devotees, even though once having taken birth, it appears like even devotees die, but they are not dying like the asuras. Asuras are completely finished when they die, because all their power, their wealth, their possessions, their influence, everything is finished. But devotees, because they are on the spiritual platform, their devotional service, their devotional relationship, their devotional assets, everything is perfectly intact. And at the time of so-called death, a devotee changes the body from this body to another spiritual body. So for devotees, there is no death. That's why devotional service is the only way to conquer death. So these asuras, they are always afraid of death. They are always afraid of death and therefore they think of the Lord as formless. Asuras always describe if at all there is some god, he is formless. Why? Because in that way they feel secure that they will not be vanquished by the Lord. They think they can escape death or they can escape the destruction by the Supreme Lord if they declare that God is there but he is formless. This is not the truth. This is not the reality. God is there. He has got his transcendental form. But for the non-devotees he is always present as death.

#### Pandavas' role, Lord's mission, Asuras' envy, Desire for control

**Key Quote:** "We have come out of our own choice, dictated by a strong desire to lord it over the resource of material world."
**Summary:** This segment explains the Pandavas' role in Krishna's mission to cleanse the earth of asuras, highlighting the asuras' envy of the Lord and devotees, and their desire to control the material world.

The 50th verse. The meaning is the Lord has already performed his duties to help the demigods and he is awaiting the rest. You Pandavas may wait as long as the Lord is here on earth. So Narada Muni is indicating to the Pandavas that they are to cooperate with Krishna. Krishna is the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord has descended with a mission to clean up the earth which was overburdened by Asuras. So now the Pandavas are part of the mission of the Lord in this material world. So it is Krishna's desire that the Pandavas rule the world, the devotees, the divine personalities, not the demoniac natured Duryodhana and company. No. So in the Purport Srila Prabhupada says, "The Lord descends from his abode, Krishnaloka, the topmost planet in the spiritual sky, in order to help the demigod administrators of this material world when they are greatly vexed by the Asuras." The Asuras give too much trouble to the demigods or devatas or the divine beings in this material world. Then the Supreme Lord comes here. Now these Asuras are described as, "Not only are they envious of the Supreme Lord, they are also envious of the Lord's devotees." This is the nature of this Asuras, demoniac nature, as referred to above. They are conditioned living beings, contact material association by their own choice. So we are not put here accidentally. We have not come here by somebody else's dictation. We have come out of our own choice. And what is that choice we have made? Dictated by a strong desire to lord it over the resource of material world.

#### Material disease, Imitation gods, Disturbance by Asuras, Prayers for relief

**Key Quote:** "Everyone is trying to become an imitation god."
**Summary:** This segment describes the 'material disease' of wanting to be the lord, the competition among imitation gods (asuras), and how their disturbances lead devotees and demigods to pray for the Lord's intervention.

And become imitation lords of all they survey. This is the whole disease. It is called Bhavaroga, material disease. I want to be the lord of everything I survey and I want to lord over resources of this material world. So this is the desire which dictates us, contact with material association. And this is only possible with material association. It is not possible in the spiritual existence. Everyone is trying to become an imitation god. We cannot be. We cannot become god. We can try to imitate god. That's what all these Asuras do. They declare there is no god, or I am god, or everyone is god. All these kind of foolish things are done by Asuras only, not by the demigods. There is a keen competition among such imitation gods and such competitors are generally known as Asuras. Even the Asuras sometimes they fight among themselves. One tries to kill the other or one tries to overpower the other. When there are too many Asuras in the world, then it becomes a hell for those who are devotees of the lord. Devotees want to live peacefully doing their own devotional service. They have no desires like the Asuras. But these Asuras become too many in number. The Asuras disturb the devotees also. Due to the growth of the Asuras, both of the Asuras, the mass of people who are generally devoted to the lord by nature, and the pure devotees of the lord, including the demigods in higher planets, pray to the lord for relief. And when the devatas, devotees pray to the lord, then what happens? The lord either descends personally from his abode or deputes some of his devotees to remodel the fallen conditions of human society, or even animal society. The lord can appear in any form, but he remains the transcendental lord and his form is always spiritual, though it appears like a material form. It is not a material form. Such disruptions take place not only in human society, but also among animals, birds or other living beings, including the demigods in the higher planets.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the periodic disturbances in the material world, the Lord's intervention to vanquish asuras, the annihilation of the Yadu dynasty, and Narada Muni's hint to the Pandavas about future events.

So in this material world, periodically these disturbances are there, time to time. yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata. Whenever and wherever there is this dharmasya glani, neglect of religious principles, these Asuras, they come in the way of following religious principles. Then the lord personally comes. Lord Shri Krishna descended personally to vanquish Asuras like Kamsa, Jarasandha, Chishupala. And during the reign of Maharaj Yudhishthira, almost all these Asuras were killed by the lord. Now, it is told in the verse, "Await the rest." What is that? Now he was awaiting the annihilation of his own dynasty, called the Yadu Vamsha, who appeared by his will in this world. Krishna appeared along with the Yadus and they were very very powerful. Now, this annihilation of this Yadu Vamsha also, it is not required except when the Asuras had to be annihilated. After annihilation of the Asuras, the Yadu Vamsha is not required on this earth. So, the lord wanted to take them away, the Yadu Vamsha, before his own departure to his eternal abode. So, Narada like Vidura did not disclose the imminent annihilation of the Yadu dynasty, but he directly gave a hint to King Yudhishthira and his brothers to wait till the incident happened and the lord departed. So, Narada is indicating what is going to happen in the future, immediate future now, that the Yadu Vamsha will be annihilated and the lord will go to his own abode and then the Pandavas can go back to the spiritual world. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Vidura left the palace not because of Duryodhana's insult, but to seek spiritual knowledge and inquire about Atma Vidya.

the limbs and senses become active and existence itself becomes delightful. Vidura was so dear to the members of the Kaurava family that his long absence from the palace was comparable to inactivity. Why was Vidura absent for a long time from the palace? If you remember, it was described previously that Vidura was insulted by Duryodhana when Vidura was trying to advise Dhritarashtra, his elder brother, in some particular issue, particularly Dhritarashtra not treating the Pandavas properly, while the Pandavas were actually not treating the Pandavas properly, without their father, fatherless children. And Dhritarashtra was a caretaker, but he was not properly treating the Pandavas. He was partial to his own sons, and he did so much injustice to the Pandavas. Therefore, when Vidura pointed that out to Dhritarashtra, Duryodhana became very angry, and he insulted Vidura. Of course, Vidura apparently left the palace being insulted by Duryodhana, but in reality, Vidura left the palace because he wanted to inquire about the spiritual subject matter from saintly persons in the places of pilgrimage. Therefore, Vidura left the palace in order to visit holy places of pilgrimage to search out for a saintly person who could explain to him the truth about this self, Atma Vidya or Brahma Vidya. This is actually the real business of human form of life, to make this inquiry. In the Vedanta Sutra it is said, Athato Brahma Jignasa. So Vidura actually left the palace not because he was insulted by Duryodhana, but really because he wanted to inquire and acquire the knowledge about this self, Atma Vidya.

So Vidura left and went on a pilgrimage, and he kept travelling till he met Uddhava in one of the holy places of pilgrimage, and he began to inquire from Uddhava about this self. While Uddhava began to speak, then Uddhava realized that Vidura's questions can best be answered by Maitreya Rishi, because even though both Uddhava and Maitreya Rishi were instructed by Krishna before Krishna's departure from this world at the end of his manifest pastimes, even though both were instructed and both were self realized, both were competent, but Maitreya Rishi was elder in age to Uddhava. Therefore, Uddhava did not want to actually do Maryada Vetikrama, he didn't want to break the Vaishnava etiquette that when there is a senior devotee or senior personality present, then the younger one should not instruct the seekers of knowledge, spiritual knowledge. So Uddhava directed Vidura to go to Maitreya Rishi who was nearby and inquire from Maitreya Rishi about this knowledge of the self, Atma Vidya.

**Summary:** Vidura returns to Hastinapura after receiving instruction, intending to deliver Dhritarashtra, who is living comfortably under Yudhishthira's care, and his return is met with joy.

Accordingly, Vidura went to Maitreya Rishi, and Maitreya Rishi received Vidura very nicely and instructed him. So after Vidura was instructed by Maitreya Rishi, then he came back to Hastinapura. Why did he come back? To actually deliver his brother Dhritarashtra. By this time, already the battle of Kurukshetra was over, and all the Kauravas were killed in that battle. Dhritarashtra and Gandharva were staying under the care of Yudhishthira when Yudhishthira was enthroned as the emperor of the world after the battle of Kurukshetra by Lord Krishna, and Yudhishthira was ruling. Yudhishthira was very, very kind and respectful and compassionate, and very nicely he is taking care of Dhritarashtra and Gandharva, his uncle and aunt. He was taking care of them in the palace. They were living under the care of Yudhishthira very nicely, but Vidura actually thought that Dhritarashtra is actually not pursuing self realization. He is just living comfortably in the palace under the care of Yudhishthira and wasting his time in simply maintaining the body, simply for the sake of living a comfortable life, while time is running out, death is nearing. He had become an old man. Dhritarashtra had become an old man. So Vidura came back to the palace simply to deliver Dhritarashtra because he himself, Vidura himself, was self realized. So Vidura came back, and how the members of the royal palace received Vidura is being described here. Vidura was so dear to the members of the Kaurava family that his long absence from the palace is comparable to inactivity.

**Key Quote:** "Even an enemy received at home should be so well received that he will not feel any fearful situation."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the Vedic culture of hospitality, emphasizing that even enemies should be treated with respect and kindness when they are guests.

All of them were feeling acute separation from Vidura, and therefore his return to the palace was joyful for all. The sixth verse, mumucho prema baashpa, mumucho prema baashpaugham viraha autkantya kataraha rajatam arhayam chakre kratasana parigraham. The meaning of this verse is, due to anxieties and long separation, they all cried out of affection. King Yudhishthira then arranged to offer sitting accommodations and a reception for Vidura. The seventh verse, tam bhukta vantam vishrantam asinam sukham asane prashrayavanato raja prahatesham cha shunvatam. The meaning of this seventh verse is, after Vidura ate sumptuously and took sufficient rest, he was comfortably seated, then King Yudhishthira began to speak to him, and all who were present there listened since he has come back. They are very eager to hear from him about his travel. Now in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains something very important about the Vedic culture. Srila Prabhupada says, King Yudhishthira was expert in reception also even in the case of his family members. Vidura was well received by all the family members by exchange of embraces and obeisances. The younger ones to Vidura, they paid obeisances to Vidura, and the equals, they embraced, and out of affection for all those family members, Vidura himself, he embraced the affectionate family members. After that, bathing and arrangements for a sumptuous dinner were made by Yudhishthira, and then Vidura was given sufficient rest. After finishing his rest, Vidura was offered a comfortable place to sit, and then the king, Yudhishthira, began to talk about all happenings, both family and otherwise. That is the proper way to receive a beloved friend or even an enemy. This is the important point you should note. Srila Prabhupada says, not only receiving a friend properly so nicely or some dear relative, but even an enemy comes home, he should be received the same way like an affectionate relative or a dear friend. So Srila Prabhupada says, according to Indian moral codes that is based on the Vedic culture, Vedic tradition, even an enemy received at home should be so well received that he will not feel any fearful situation. An enemy is always afraid of his enemy, but this should not be so when he is received at home by his enemy. This means that a person when received at home should be treated as a relative.

**Key Quote:** "Even if a stranger enters your house, you will receive him in such a friendly way that he will forget that you are his enemy and he will have no fear."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the Vedic principle of treating uninvited guests (Atithi) with utmost respect and friendliness, ensuring they feel safe and welcome.

So what to speak of a family member like Vidura was a well wisher for all the members of the family. Thus Yudhishthira Maharaj began to speak in the presence of all the other members very lovingly. Yudhishthira began to speak to Vidura. Now Srila Prabhupada explains elsewhere what is this Vedic culture of receiving a guest, even if the guest, guest means somebody who comes without being invited, not having an invitation. Obviously, an enemy will not have an invitation. So even if an enemy comes or anybody comes without invitation, they are received very nicely by being offered a reception that is supposed to be offered to atithi, a guest who is uninvited, who comes home. How should a householder receive such a guest? So the injunction in the Vedas is that a householder should not be a stranger, not a stranger. So whatever a person is, even if a stranger enters your house, you will receive him in such a friendly way that he will forget that you are his enemy, and he will have no fear, no fear.

**Key Quote:** "The Vedic culture is to receive any uninvited guest properly even if the guest happens to be an enemy."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Parikshit Maharaj and Shamika Rishi to illustrate the importance of properly receiving guests, even if they are superiors or enemies, according to scriptural injunctions.

of facing the enemy. That is the way to receive. So Shrila Prabhupada explains elsewhere that when Parikshit Maharaj went hunting on some occasion and he became very thirsty and he started looking for water, he could not find any body of water nearby in the forest, and he happened to come across the ashram of one Shamika Rishi. So he entered that ashram of Shamika Rishi, and the Rishi was sitting there, and Yudhishthira Maharaj was not properly welcomed and received by this Rishi, so I'm sorry, Parikshit Maharaj was not received properly by Rishis Shamika. So Parikshit Maharaj became very angry, but not being received properly. So Shrila Prabhupada explains why did Parikshit Maharaj become angry at this Shamika Rishi. Actually, Parikshit Maharaj's Kshatriya is in a subordinate position to Shamika Rishi because Shamika Rishi is a Brahmana. So it is not expected that a Brahmana should actually respect a Kshatriya in the normal circumstances, but in this particular case when Parikshit Maharaj has come to the ashram as a guest, atithi, then even if that atithi happens to be an enemy, what to speak of a good Kshatriya king, the host, the resident of that ashram should receive the guest respectfully, very nicely, very properly. So only because of this particular injection in the scriptures, it was justified that Parikshit Maharaj became upset with Shamika Rishi, but then again Shamika Rishi did not, was not receiving परिक्षेत महाराज विकास शमिकर रिशी वास इन एंड मेडिटेशन सो इस एक्स्टाउर्नरी सरकुमस्टेंस अरेंड वाड़ सुप्रीन वॉल्ड सुगर परिक्षेत वुद्धि कर्स वाई द कि संख आफ शमिकर रिशी एंड परिक्षेत शुद्धी टाइप his kingdom and later on bhagat would be spoken by shukadeva swan pariksit maharaj and will reveal to the whole world through the medium of shukadeva and pariksit that was krishna's arrangement in any case this is what prabhupada says the very culture is to receive any uninvited guest properly even if

**Key Quote:** "Narada can see the past, present and future"
**Summary:** Narada Muni discloses Dhritarashtra's location and movements to Yudhishthira, highlighting Narada's ability to see past, present, and future events.

In this session, we will be discussing three verses: 51, 52, and 53 of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 51st verse: Dhritarashtraha Saha Bhratra Gandharaya Cha Swabharyaya Dakshinena Himavata Rishinam Ashramam Gatha. So Narada is now disclosing where Dhritarashtra has gone. He is telling the translation of the 51st verse: O King, your uncle Dhritarashtra, his brother Vidura, and his wife Gandhari have gone to the southern side of the Himalayan mountains, where there are shelters of the great sages. So Prabhupada briefly mentions in the purport: To pacify the mourning Maharaja Yudhishthira, Narada first of all spoke from the philosophical point of view, and then he began to describe the future movements of his uncle, which he had done in the past. He could see by his foreseeing powers and thus began to describe as follows. Narada can see the past, present, and future. Such saintly persons are called Trikalagya. By the mercy of the Lord, they are able to see specific events, either of the past or of the future, apart from seeing the present events, being aware of the present events.

**Key Quote:** "Dhritarashtra is now engaged in beginning Ashtanga Yoga"
**Summary:** Narada describes Dhritarashtra's activities at Saptasrota, including bathing, performing sacrifices, and practicing Ashtanga Yoga to control his mind and senses and detach from familial affection.

So the 52nd verse. Narada Muni is describing to Yudhishthira where they have gone. The translation of the 52nd verse: The place is called Saptasrota, divided by 7, because there the waters of the sacred Ganges were divided into 7 branches. This was done for the satisfaction of the 7 great Rishis, Saptarishi. 53rd verse: Snatva Anusavanam Tasmin Hutva Chagnin Yatha Vidhi Abhaksha Upashantatma Saaste Vigatai Shanah. The meaning of this 53rd verse is: On the banks at Saptasrota, Dhritarashtra is now engaged in beginning Ashtanga Yoga by bathing three times daily in the morning, noon, and evening, by performing the Agnihotra sacrifice with fire, and by drinking only water. This helps one control the mind and the senses and frees one completely from thoughts of familial affection.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the true purpose of Ashtanga Yoga, emphasizing that it's not merely for physical health but for controlling the mind and senses and diverting them from material to spiritual consciousness.

So specifically, Dhritarashtra is engaged in Ashtanga Yoga practice, and that is basically, any Yoga practice is to control the mind and senses, Yoga Indriya Samyama, and also become free from all thoughts of family affection. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport: The Yoga system is a mechanical way to control the senses and the mind and divert them from matter to spirit. This Yoga system, Ashtanga Yoga system, is a mechanical method, and the purpose is very clearly described by Prabhupada, which is missed out by many people who may be following some practice of Ashtanga Yoga, especially nowadays. They think Ashtanga Yoga is meant for maintaining good health or for increasing some mental power, like that. So many other purposes they use this practice of Ashtanga Yoga, but the real purpose of Ashtanga Yoga is to control the senses and mind and divert them from matter to spirit. We are completely spiritual beings, but due to our desire for lording over material nature, we have been given this material body, and we have a materialistic conception of life itself. So to correct that is to divert the mind and senses from matter to spirit.

**Key Quote:** "Facing the absolute person Paramatma"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the eight steps of Ashtanga Yoga, including posture, meditation, spiritual thoughts, manipulation of air (Pranayama), and achieving trance (Samadhi) focused on Paramatma.

In Ashtanga Yoga, there are different steps, Anga, Ashta Anga, eight steps actually. So Srila Prabhupada says: The preliminary processes are the sitting posture, meditation, spiritual thoughts, manipulation of air passing within the body, and gradual situation in trance, facing the absolute person, Paramatma. Very nicely Prabhupada is summarizing the eight steps: sitting posture, Asana; then meditation, fixing the mind, fixing the mind on the form of the Lord in the heart; spiritual thoughts, completely spiritualizing the thinking, because the Lord is completely spiritual. We are spiritual beings. There is no possibility of getting out of this material existence as long as we have got material thoughts, material conceptions, material ideas, material identification. We cannot get out. So these spiritual thoughts are very, very important. Manipulation of air passing within the body. Inside this body, there is something called Prana Vayu, and that Prana Vayu circulation or flow has to be manipulated. It is called Pranayama. Pranayama, Pranayama exercises which will help manipulate the flow in such a way that we will gradually become detached from all material sense objects, material pleasures, material thoughts. That is also called Vairagya, but it is a mechanical process. Therefore, they work with the Prana Vayu circulation, manipulating that by exercises, just like this inhalation and exhalation. That itself actually can regulate the flow of this Prana Vayu. So specifically exercising that inhalation and exhalation, breathing exercises, so that is called manipulation of air passing within the body and gradual situation in trance. Trance is the final stage actually, Samadhi, where one is completely, mind is in equilibrium, not disturbed by any external distractions, nor the mind is absorbed in some internal thinking process or feeling or willing, no internal activity either, but is absorbed in facing the absolute person, Paramatma, fixed completely on the form of Paramatma within the heart. Such mechanical ways of rising to the spiritual platform prescribe some regulative principles. Some strict rules have to be followed if at all one wants success in this Ashtanga Yoga.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "This material objective trying to enjoy materially is an illusory objective"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the strict rules of Ashtanga Yoga, such as bathing three times daily and fasting, emphasizing the need to detach from material objects and recognize the illusory nature of material enjoyment.

So what are the rules? Taking bath daily three times. That's why in the Bhagavad Gita also it is said, and in all the Yoga literature, Ashtanga Yoga literature, it is said, go to a secluded place which is suitable for practicing Ashtanga Yoga without any distraction and where there is facility for taking bath three times. So the Himalayan region is ideal because many, many rivers are flowing there. Most all of them are actually branches of the Ganga only, but that river flows in so many places. Anybody can actually take bath very easily three times. Fasting as far as possible. So gradually it is described in the episode on Dhruva Maharaj performing meditation on the Supreme Lord, how he progressively gave up solid food, then liquid, and even he gave up breathing. So this is the strict rules that are prescribed in the Ashtanga Yoga system, fasting as far as possible and sitting and concentrating the mind on spiritual matters. The mind is always absorbed in material things. That's our present condition. So if you want to change this subject matter of thinking for the mind, then one has to fix the mind on spiritual matters and freed from material thoughts and thus gradually becoming free from Vishaya, or material objectives. This material world is Vishaya Sagara. It's an ocean of material objects. Every material object has got some form, some taste, some smell, some sense of touch, some sound. So these material sense objects, we have to become free from them because we have nothing to do with matter or material objects or material things. We have no connection with them. We are spiritual beings, and trying to squeeze out some happiness out of matter is frustrating, will never give us the desired happiness or the desired satisfaction because we are spiritual beings. Material existence means to be absorbed in the material objective, which is simply illusory. This material objective, trying to enjoy materially, is an illusory objective.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating the importance of detaching from material thoughts and concentrating on Paramatma, using Dhritarashtra as an example of someone who had to abandon family affairs to turn towards spiritual realization.

Which body with some concocted idea of material enjoyment. So all these are coverings, material coverings of the spirit, and a yoga system helps one to become free from all these illusory thoughts and gradually turn towards the absolute person, Paramatma. This is the whole yoga practice or yoga system. By material associated education, we learn simply to concentrate on flimsy things, but yoga is the process of forgetting them all together. So real yoga practice means to forget all these material things and to concentrate on Paramatma, the supreme Lord within the heart, the spiritual, you all-spiritual being, supreme person. Dhritarashtra, you see the status condition, he was all along trying to improve his family affairs, but now for the sake of turning towards Paramatma, he has to forget all that. Therefore, it is necessary for him to become free from all these illusory thoughts and to concentrate on flimsy things, but now for the sake of turning towards Paramatma, he has to forget all that. Therefore, it is necessary for him to take bath three times, to fast, to concentrate his mind in spiritual thoughts like that. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

#### Ashtanga Yoga, Modes of Material Nature, Paramatma, Individual Soul

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Real yoga practice means, to focus or concentrate one's attention on the supreme Lord who is seated in everyone's heart."
**Summary:** This segment explains the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam about controlling senses through Ashtanga Yoga to become immune to material contaminations, emphasizing the importance of focusing on the Supreme Lord within the heart and distinguishing between the individual soul and the Paramatma.

In this session we will be discussing from the 54th verse of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. जितासनो जितश्वासह प्रत्याहृतशड़िन्द्रियह हरिभावनया ध्वस्त रजसत्वतमो मलहा The meaning of this verse is, one who has controlled the sitting postures, the yogic asanas, and the breathing process, can turn the senses toward the absolute personality of Godhead, and thus become immune to the contaminations of the modes of material nature, namely mundane goodness, passion, and ignorance. So, Narada Muni is describing. How does that work? In the Ashtanga Yoga system, which is practiced by those who follow this Ashtanga Yoga process, how does it work? So, here, जितश्वासह, जितासनो जितश्वासह, जितासनो is controlled sitting postures. Because, unless a yogi is able to sit properly, he cannot become completely absorbed in meditation. He'll be disturbed by the body. So, this practice of yogasana, different sitting postures, or different bodily exercises, for controlling the sitting posture, the ability to sit, for a very, very long time, without any distraction, without any disturbance. Then, जितास्वासह, the breathing process, also has to be controlled. Why the breathing process has to be controlled? To turn the senses toward the absolute personality of Godhead, and thus become immune to the contaminations of the modes of material nature. We are influenced by the three gunas. So, that influence is felt through the senses, through the mind, through our material activities. We feel the influence, we experience the influence. Sometimes, we are influenced by goodness, sometimes by passion, sometimes by ignorance. So, a combination of these modes always acts, in most cases. In any case, these influences, are material influence. They are all the influence of the material energy. Because, the material energy consists of these three gunas. Sattvam rajas tamaiti guna prakati sambhavah. Prakati sambhavah. They are the ingredients of this material nature, these three gunas. And, they influence the body. They influence the living being in this material world. One has to become free from these influences. And, that we described here. The purpose, Srila Prabhupada says, the preliminary activities of the way of yoga are asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dhyana, dharana, etc. Eight steps are there. Maharaja Dhritarashtra was to attain success in those preliminary actions. Because, he was seated in a sanctified place. And, was concentrating upon one objective. What is that one objective? Namely, the supreme personality of Godhead, Hari. So, real yoga practice means, to focus or concentrate one's attention on the supreme Lord who is seated in everyone's heart. The Lord is there. And, everybody's heart he has entered. sarvasya caaham rudhi sannyavishto mattasmrutir jnanam appohanam jnanam In the fifteenth chapter, Krishna says, I am seated in everybody's heart. In the eighteenth chapter also, Krishna explains, ishwaras sarvabhutanam hrudeshe aryoh deshtati The supreme Lord is seated in everyone's heart. And, he is seated as Paramatma. Upadrishta anumanta bharta bhokta maheshwaraha Paramatmeti chaapyukto dehesmin purusha paraha There is a transcendental enjoyer, the supreme Lord as Paramatma. Paramatma iti uktaha He is called as Paramatma. He is not Atma. He is Paramatma. He is supreme Atma. Supreme soul. Super soul.

#### Paramatma, Free Will, Bhakti Yoga, Direct vs Indirect Methods

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Engaging the senses in the service of the Lord means we become very easily focused on the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the role of Paramatma as the witness and sanctioner of desires, contrasting the indirect approach of Ashtanga Yoga with the direct engagement of senses in Bhakti Yoga, highlighting the effectiveness and power of the latter.

Some philosophers say this, super soul and individual soul are one. They don't say two, they say one. But actually, according to the Bhagavad Gita, according to the Vedanta Sutra, according to the Bhagavatam, according to all the Vedic literature, this individual soul and super soul are two distinct identities. Paramatmeti chaapyukto Upadrishta He is a witness. He is a sanctioner. We have no freedom to fulfill our desires unless it is sanctioned by Paramatma who is the actual witnesser and sanctioner of every jiva, every living being in this material world. So therefore, the primary activities are meant of this Ashtanga Yoga. They are meant to concentrate upon the Supreme Lord in the heart. That is the ultimate goal of Ashtanga Yoga practice. Thus, all his senses were being engaged in the service of the Lord. This is the important point. Engaging the senses in the service of the Lord means we become very easily focused on the Supreme Lord. This is actually the way of practice of Bhakti Yoga. To engage all the senses in the service of the Supreme Lord. In Bhakti Yoga, it is done directly. In other yoga systems, it is done indirectly. That is the difference. Of course, indirect methods are slow, very tedious, and they can be very, very difficult at times, and the person can get deviated or distracted in between. When the process is too slow, it takes a very long time, then one can very easily get distracted. But in Bhakti Yoga, it is quick, it is highly effective, it is very powerful. Directly engage all your senses in the service of the Supreme Lord. Just like this chanting Hare Krishna. Directly we engage our tongue, our ears, and our sense of touch, and our mind attentively here. So directly we engage these four things in service of the Lord. This is service. Chanting Hare Krishna, and hearing, and counting, and taking a vow to chant a fixed number of times. Attentively chant and hear. This is actually direct service to the Lord. Direct service. And engaging our senses in direct service is Bhakti.

#### Bhakti Yoga, Purification, Modes of Nature, Lust and Greed

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Even the highest mode, the material mode of goodness, is also a cause of material bondage."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that directly engaging the senses in the service of the Lord purifies one from material contaminations, even the mode of goodness, and contrasts this with the bondage caused by passion and ignorance, which fuel lust and greed, leading to an insatiable desire for wealth and power.

So Srila Prabhupada says, this process of engaging all the senses in the service of the Lord directly helps the devotee to get freedom from the contaminations of the three material modes of nature. Directly engaging the senses in the service of the Lord. Automatically we become purified. We don't have to have a separate process for purifying the contaminations. That is not the way of Bhakti. Even the highest mode, the material mode of goodness, is also a cause of material bondage. This is a secret that is revealed in the scriptures, especially Bhagavad Gita. What does Bhagavad Gita say? Sattvam rajas tamaiti guna prakriti sambhavah Nibaddhanti mahabaho dehe. This is the truth about material nature, even the mode of goodness. It is simply a cause of material bondage. Then what to speak of other qualities namely passion and ignorance? Definitely passion and ignorance are very much the cause of material bondage. But goodness also is the cause of material bondage. Passion and ignorance increase the material propensities of hankering for material enjoyment. Of course there is a qualitative difference between goodness and the other two gunas. Goodness is comparatively better than passion and ignorance. But goodness is not the best. Goodness is relatively better. The best is transcendental goodness, shuddha sattva, the spiritual existence, the spiritual platform, the spiritual existence. That is the best, that is the topmost, that is the true freedom from all material contamination. So this passion and ignorance increases the hankering for material enjoyment. And what happens? A strong sense of lust provokes the accumulation of wealth and power. Driven by lusty desires, people are working hard day and night, I want more wealth, more power, more wealth, more power, more wealth, more power. And there is no end to this. You see around you, there are millionaires who want to become billionaires. And there are billionaires who want to become trillionaires. And where will this end? If one goes on trying to satisfy their desires and somehow they are successful, you think it is going to come to an end? What will the person do with, if somebody has billion dollars or billion rupees, what will he do with trillion rupees? He doesn't know what to do with billion rupees itself. So what will he do with trillion rupees?

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "When the heart becomes free from this lust and greed, that is a big step towards purification."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how lust and greed lead to a loss of intelligence and discrimination, emphasizing that overcoming these base mentalities is a significant step towards purification, ultimately leading to goodness, which, while not complete freedom, allows one to control the senses and surrender to the Supreme Lord through Bhakti Yoga.

But they lose that sense of discrimination. They lose their intelligence. Naśta buddhayaḥ kāmaiṣṭaiṣṭe hṛta-jñānaḥ prapadyante anyadevataḥ Bhagavad Gita says naśta buddhayaḥ. Hṛta-jñānaḥ means naśta buddhayaḥ. This is the acharya's explanation. Their knowledge becomes completely lost, means their intelligence is lost. They lose the power of discrimination. I have so much money, I can do whatever I want with that money. But whatever I am doing, I am not getting satisfaction. Then why do I think I will get satisfaction by accumulating more money? What will you do with that more money? Why don't you think about that? There is no thinking remaining because it is lost by this greed and lust. One who has conquered these two base mentalities, this lust and greed, kāma lobhāda yasya ye, tadārajaṣṭamo bhāva kāma lobhāda yasya ye, cetaye te rana viddham When the heart becomes free from this lust and greed, that is a big step towards purification. But by purifying this lust and greed, one comes to the platform of goodness. And even in goodness, there is no freedom from material existence, but it is better. Why? Because in goodness, one may attempt to control the senses and get proper knowledge to be able to surrender to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord Hari and thereby transcend all the influences. That is the Bhakti Yoga process.

**Key Quote:** "The Ashtanga Yoga system of practice is ultimately meant for liberation from material bondage."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains how it relates to liberation and the Ashtanga Yoga system, as simplified by Srila Prabhupada.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 55th verse of the 13th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: शेत्रग्ञे प्रविलाप्यतं, ब्रह्मणी आत्मानं आधारे, घटां बरं इवां बरे. The meaning of this verse is: Dhritarashtra will have to amalgamate his pure identity with intelligence and then merge into the supreme being with knowledge of his qualitative oneness as a living entity with the supreme Brahman, being freed from the blocked sky, he will have to rise to the spiritual sky. This is a typical philosophical verse in the Bhagavatam which also is explaining the Vedanta philosophy. So what is that philosophy that is being explained here is simplified by Srila Prabhupada in the purport. So basically, in the verse, it is explaining that the Ashtanga Yoga system of practice is ultimately meant for liberation from material bondage, and how that liberation happens technically is being explained.

**Key Quote:** "If we don't have a desire to Lord it over material nature then we act in our constitutional position in our original state as loving devotional servant of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the living being's desire to lord over the material world and the consequences of declining to cooperate with the Supreme Lord.

So Srila Prabhupada attached in the purport, "The living being, by his desiring to lord it over the material world and declining to cooperate with the Supreme Lord, contacts the sum total of the material world." Let me go a little slow and let us try to understand what Srila Prabhupada is telling here. Each one of us is a living being, and the characteristic of every living being is that the living being has the capacity or the ability to desire. Desire is integral with the existence as spirit soul, so you cannot be without desire at any stage, in any condition, in any place, in any situation. Any person cannot be desireless. So specifically, a certain type of desire, what is that desire? To lord it over the material world. I want to be the Lord. Now, who is the Lord actually? Krishna. Krishna is eternally the Lord of the material world, the spiritual world, in the whole existence. That is Krishna's position. Our position is not, never to be the Lord, but if we develop a desire to be the Lord, and as a result of desiring to be the Lord, what happens next? We decline to cooperate with the Supreme Lord. If we don't have a desire to lord it over material nature, then we act in our constitutional position.

**Key Quote:** "Desiring to lord over and declining to cooperate with the supreme lord, the living entity contacts the sum total of the material world called Mahatatva."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the desire to lord over is only possible under illusion in the material world, leading to contact with the Mahatatva, the sum total of material energy.

In our original state as loving devotional servant of Krishna. So we are happily situated, completely blissfully, nicely engaged in Krishna's service as a cooperator. Krishna never forces in the spiritual world anyone to serve him because he is not in need of service. It's for our own self-interest that we must serve Krishna, but how is the service rendered? Lovingly, with devotion, then we are happy, we are perfectly situated. But if we decline, "I don't want to serve Krishna," then what do you want to do, sir? "I want to lord over." So that lording over is only possible under illusion, and that illusion exists only in the material world. So therefore, desiring to lord over and declining to cooperate with the supreme lord, the living entity contacts the sum total of the material world called Mahatatva. The material world, the sum total of this material world, everything material is the original substance or the energy called as Mahatatva. This is a technical term, it's called Mahatatva.

**Key Quote:** "The contact of the living being with this Mahatatva or the sum total of the material energy gives rise to a false ego."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how contact with Mahatatva gives rise to false ego, intelligence, mind, and senses, leading to a false identity with the material world.

The sum total of all material energy. And finally, from this Mahatatva, from this sum total of the material energy, his false identity with the material world, false identity with the material world means my false ego, your false ego, each person's false ego, each person's ahankara. Ahankara is a Sanskrit word, the English equivalent is false ego or false identity. So the contact of the living being with this Mahatatva or the sum total of the material energy gives rise to a false ego and gives rise to a particular kind of intelligence and then a particular kind of mind and particular set of senses. All these are developed by the living beings.

**Key Quote:** "Self-realization means I realize myself as pure spiritual identity completely apart from this material body means material senses apart from the material mind."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that originally we are spiritual beings with a spiritual identity in relationship with Krishna, but this is covered by contact with Mahatatva, and self-realization is reverting to the original position.

Identity. Originally, we are all spiritual beings, pure spirit. We have our spiritual identity in relationship with Krishna. We have our spiritual senses, our spiritual mind, our spiritual intelligence, our spiritual identity as loving servitor of Krishna, but all that is covered when we come in contact with this Mahat Tattva, when a covering is generated suitable for the lording over. Now, by this yogic process, particularly the Ashtanga Yoga process or any yogic process, when his pure identity is realized, in shastra, self-realization, self-realization means I realize myself as pure spiritual identity completely apart from this material body, means material senses, apart from the material mind, apart from the material intelligence, apart from the material ego, I am pure spiritual identity. One has to revert to the original position by amalgamating, amalgamating means bringing together, combining the five gross elements.

**Key Quote:** "The cause of all our material problems in this material existence represents general of birth and death false understanding false identity all kinds of material misconceptions."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a clay pot to explain how the pure spiritual soul takes on material elements to form a material body, and how self-realization means freeing oneself from this material dress.

And the subtle elements, mind and intelligence into the Mahat Tattva. It is just like if a potter is making a clay pot, he takes some clay and then he mixes it with water and then shapes it into a pot and then bakes that pot in fire, it becomes a pot. Now the pot is used, and when the pot is destroyed, what happens? The elements which went into making the pot are all separated. Fire is separated, then water is separated, and the earth as clay goes back to the earth. Similarly, when we come in contact with this Mahat Tattva, the pure spiritual soul, then we take little false ego, little material intelligence, little material mind, little material senses, and then the material covering called the gross and the subtle body is prepared and that becomes a dress for the spirit soul, for the living being, material dress. But self-realization means we don't require this material dress because the cause of all our material problems in this material existence represents a general of birth and death, false understanding, false identity, all kinds of material misconceptions, material miseries, material, material, uh, material existence itself is completely.

**Key Quote:** "Always my identity as servant of the supreme lord and supreme lord's identity as the master of everyone eternally remains that never changes that never is never is at any time lost it always exists."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that becoming free from material existence means realizing the spiritual identity of the soul and merging into the super soul, while maintaining the eternal relationship of servant and master.

Unnecessary. So becoming free from this material existence means becoming free of तो अराओं के रूप में सुन रहे हैं। इसलिए अराओं उंदन दिया जाना है और एलिमेंट्स उनको बेट दबा देगा जो हम के लिए पहले शुरू कर रहे हैं। बेगिनी वे ने वर बी कॉंटाइटेड में महात्तव थी दस गएटिंग फ्रीड फॉर थे क्लाक्शेस वह थे थैंका पाप ला यहां इस टू मर्ज इन एग्जिस्टेंस ऑफ द सुपर सोल जो वह ने बिकंग फ्री फॉर ने महात्तत्व. Then what is left is the spiritual identity of the spiritual soul. Spirit soul in its pure identity is left behind and that has to merge into the super soul. Merge means become one, and what is this becoming one actually mean? In other words, Prabhupada says he has to realize that qualitatively he is non-different from the super soul. It doesn't mean that I become the super soul. Merging into the super soul here does not mean I become the super soul, no. Always my identity as servant of the supreme lord and supreme lord's identity as the master of everyone eternally remains. That never changes, that never.

**Key Quote:** "Realizing the qualitative oneness means I am pure spiritual personality and that pure spiritual personality is eternally the servant of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by explaining that realizing qualitative oneness means understanding oneself as a pure spiritual personality and eternally a loving, devotional servant of Krishna, transcending the material sky and engaging in transcendental service.

Is lost, never is, never is at any time lost, it always exists. So realizing the oneness, qualitative oneness means one in quality. I am spiritual by nature, super soul or quality. I am spiritual by nature, super soul or quality. I am spiritual by nature, super soul or Krishna is spiritual by nature, but Krishna is master, I am servant. So non-different means not that I, the servant becomes the master, no. Servant will never become the master, master will never become the servant. Master is always master eternally, Krishna is always the master eternally and all the living entities are eternally servants. Jivera swarupa hoy krishnera nitya dasa. So, realizing the qualitative oneness means I am pure spiritual personality and that pure spiritual personality is eternally the servant of Krishna. What kind of servant? Loving, devotional servant. And when this qualitative oneness is realized, freed from the mahat-tattva coverings or material coverings, one transcends the material sky. You rise above the material sky, material existence and in the pure spiritual intelligence becomes intelligent engaged in transcendental loving service of the Lord. So, this is explained here by Srila Prabhupada what happened to Dhritarashtra. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

#### subtle body, gross body, detachment, yoga

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So the yogi he is able to be aloof from the gross body and the subtle body."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the difference between the gross and subtle bodies and how a yogi can detach from both.

सन्यस्ता खिलप कर्मणः आहार। सन्यस्ता खिलप कर्मणः आहार। सन्यस्ता खिलप कर्मणः आहार। सन्यस्ता खिलप कर्मणः आहार। means what the senses, even the senses and this body will also deteriorate. As far as the subtle mind and intelligence are concerned, a spiritualist identifies from the material mind and the material intelligence and even the material ego because subtle matter is not exactly like this gross matter which is destructible. In the sense of the term 'destroying', we talk in terms of something gross, and that destruction also, what does it mean actually? Everything gross is a combination of one or more of the five elements: earth, water, fire, air, sky. So, destruction means separating all the elements and returning them to the original reservoir of these five elements in the Mahatatva. As I explained the example of the pot in the previous session, clay pot. The clay pot is formed or produced by combining earth in the form of clay and water and fire. So, clay is first mixed with water and then the pot is given shape and then it is baked in the fire. So, earth, water, fire, three are combined and the pot is produced by the potter. Now when it is destroyed, it means fire goes back to the fire element, water goes back to the water element, the reservoir of water element, and earth, the clay which is earth, nothing but earth, it returns, it is returned to the earthly reservoir. So, like that there is no destruction of the mind, intelligence, and the false ego because they always exist as subtle elements within the gross body as subtle body, bodily covering. So, the yogi is able to be aloof from the gross body and the subtle body.

**Key Quote:** "If I think I am the body, then my satisfaction is satisfaction of the body."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of clothing, the speaker explains how detachment from the body leads to freedom from the desire for sense gratification, which is achieved through yoga.

And become completely immune to whatever is happening with the gross and subtle body without being affected or without worrying what is happening to me because he understands I am not this body, I am not the gross body, I am not the subtle body. It is like your dress. Supposing the dress has become old and sometimes a worn out dress may tear. So, do you think that, oh! I am suffering some injury? Just like if there is something which creates a tear in your skin, some sharp instrument. Something sharp spears in your hand, arm and then there is a cut. So now when you know you are not this body. Supposing there is a cut, now you have no body. And then there is a cut. So now when you know you are not this body. So I have seen, supposing the cloth tears, either it's worn out or it is pierced by some sharp instrument. If the cloth tears, does it mean that something has happened to you or something has happened to your cloth? If you distinctly know you are different from the cloth, which a matured person, an intelligent person will always be aware of that. I am not this cloth. Then nothing has happened to you when the cloth is torn. And if it is old and worn out, you discard this cloth and you take a new cloth. Exactly like that the yogi knows. The body itself is an external covering and one has to disidentify, I am not this body, I am spirit soul, spiritual person, personality, apart from the body. So, the yogic process helps a yogi to completely negate all these material coverings. The effect of the yogic process is, the effects of the material modes of nature draw the victim to indefatigable desires of enjoying matter. This desire for enjoying matter is because of the false identity that I am this body. If I think I am the body, then my satisfaction is satisfaction of the body. But if I realize I am not the body, then my happiness is not simply giving satisfaction to the senses, no. That is not going to make me happy. So, this false enjoyment by trying to satisfy the senses, external senses, is stopped by the yogic process.

**Key Quote:** "The conditioned soul is assaulted on all sides by maya."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how the senses constantly seek pleasure in the material world, leading to instability, and how yoga helps to withdraw from this pursuit.

So, then one escapes false enjoyment by following the yogic process. Every sense is busy searching for its food. That means eyes are looking for beautiful form, ears are searching for some sweet sound. Nose is looking for some nice fragrance, nice smell, like that. The conditioned soul is assaulted on all sides by maya. Material world is filled with all these different sounds, different forms, different smells, aromas, different tastes, different tasting type of edibles, and different types of objects which are very pleasing to the sense of touch. So, there is no chance to become steady in any pursuit of even searching for some pleasing sense object. There is no question of steadiness. Because always if something beautiful attracts the person due to the beautiful form, immediately there will be some sound or some smell or some sense of touch. So, nobody can pursue this. There is no sense object in a steady way. Whereas the yogic processes stop this complete pursuit of sense enjoyment and go within, go within.

**Key Quote:** "Dhritarashtra by practicing the Ashtanga Yoga he had already become detached from everything material."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates how Narada advised Yudhishthira not to disturb Dhritarashtra because he had become detached through yoga and would leave his body by mystic power, burning it to ashes.

That is the actual yogic process. Now, Maharaj Yudhishtira was advised by his uncle, sorry, Maharaj Yudhishtira was advised by Narada not to disturb his uncle by attempting to bring him back home. Why? Because Dhritarashtra by practicing the Ashtanga Yoga he had already become detached from everything material. So, there will be no more any interest or attraction for Dhritarashtra to come and stay comfortably with Yudhishtira. He is beyond that. Nirguna means without reaction. The spiritual quality is distinguished from the material qualities by the word nirguna. Nirguna means the spiritual state where one is indifferent to all material attractions, all material objects, all material actions and reactions. One becomes indifferent, disinterested, completely aloof. The next verse, 57th verse. Sava adhyatanadrajan parata panchame ahani kalevaram hasyati svam tachabhasmi bhavishyati. The meaning of this verse is O king, he will quit his body most probably on the fifth day from today and his body will turn to ashes. So, Narada is telling that Dhritarashtra will perfect his yogic practice that he becomes detached and after detaching he will quit his body by his own mystic power and that mystic power will also enable him to burn the body to ashes, what he is leaving behind. The body will be burned to ashes by the self-generated fire by the yogic process itself. So, perfect yogis, they don't depend on somebody else to burn this body to dispose of the remnants after death or after quitting the body. No, they are able to generate the fire from within to burn the body and the spirit soul cannot be burned by fire. The spirit soul will leave the body by mystic power. So, that is explained here. So, Yudhishthira need not perform any funeral ceremony for Dhritarashtra because Dhritarashtra by the yogic process would perfectly be able to leave the body and also burn the body at the time of quitting, burn the body by self-generated fire. These are all very special facilities for the yogi, Ashtanga yogi.

#### Gandhari's Sati rite, chaste wife, voluntary death

**Key Quote:** "for the woman the fire of separation from her husband is more intolerable than the fire of the burning of the husband's dead body so she decides to quit voluntarily and such quitting the body voluntarily is considered to be the most successful way to get her body into"
**Summary:** This segment explains Gandhari's decision to enter the fire of her dead husband, known as the Sati rite, highlighting it as a voluntary act of a chaste wife who finds separation from her husband more unbearable than death.

The meaning of this verse is, while outside observing her husband who will burn in the fire of mystic power along with his thatched cottage, his chaste wife Gandhari will enter the fire with rapt attention. So, now already Narada has told Yudhishthira, Dhritarashtra will follow the yogic process and quit the body and the body will be burnt by the self-generated fire through the mystic power. Now, along with Dhritarashtra's body burning, the thatched cottage in which he was sitting and performing his austerity or the practice itself will burn. And what will Gandhari do? She is not practicing any yoga. She is just faithfully as a chaste wife following her husband. So, Srila Prabhupada explains, Gandhari was an ideal chaste lady, a life companion of her husband. And therefore, when she saw her husband burning in the fire of mystic yoga along with his cottage of leaves, she despaired. Naturally, wife is very faithfully serving the husband and the husband quits, it's a big loss for the wife because she has always been with him as a chaste wife and she has been serving him. Now, what will she do when he is no longer present in the form as the husband? So, it says here, Srila Prabhupada explains, She left home after losing her 100 sons and in the forest she saw that her most beloved husband was also burning. She lost her sons in the battle of Krukshetra. Our husband also, he quit his body which was a self-generated fire, through mystic yoga practice. What will she do? So, Prabhupada says, Now she actually felt alone and followed her husband to death. She decided to also quit the body now. This entering of a chaste lady into the fire of a dead husband is called the sati rite. You would have heard this term sati, sati, sati ritual, sati rite. What is it? The wife has lost her husband and does not have any surviving sons. Such a wife, if she is a chaste woman, she will enter the fire of her dead husband and quit her body voluntarily and the action, this sati ritual or the sati rite, is considered to be the most perfect for a woman. How is it most perfect? Because Prabhupada says for the woman the fire of separation from her husband is more intolerable than the fire of the burning of the husband's dead body, so she decides to quit voluntarily and such quitting the body voluntarily is considered to be the most

**Summary:** This segment discusses the historical context of the Sati rite, emphasizing that it should be a voluntary act and condemning the practice of forcing widows to commit Sati as a criminal act.

successful way to get her body into per se, but it is considered a to be a and the death her whole life she is having a difficult period instead of releasing it she dies apart out of to perform sacrifices to help stay around her husband and her a coherent with his relationship to nothing else than that so it is sin he would say that in that sense in this four part of the biginating of a direct examination of the body is the Supreme enlightened much approved by the Vedas that she will have a glorious destination after quitting the body in this way. It is not suicide. Please don't think this is suicide. It appears like suicide which is voluntarily entering the fire even though her body still not completely deteriorated but she voluntarily enters fire procedurally is part of you have process of uncaregulated and then that which is much more beneficial it is take only which are different from the different other occasions fire and decides to quit her body along with her husband so that she is guaranteed of a brilliant wonderful future, a bright future. So, Sri la Prabhupada says in a later age this sati rite became an obnoxious criminal affair. It became criminal why? Because the ceremony was forced upon even an unwilling woman. See, mind you, it is totally voluntary for a chaste wife to enter the funeral pyre of her husband. It's totally voluntary. It should never be forced by anyone else. No one can, no one should force, no one has the right to force.

**Summary:** This segment explains that in the present age, the Sati rite is not possible for anyone to follow unless the wife feels the separation from her husband to be more burning than actual fire, and that by following her husband, she can attain liberation without separate spiritual practices.

but when people started forcing a widow, a woman, that became criminal. It is criminal to force somebody to die in this way. It is criminal. So, Sri la Prabhupada says in this present age, fallen age, it is not possible for anyone to follow the sati ritual as Gandhari did and others chaste women did in the past. Why? Because a chaste wife like Gandhari would feel the separation of her husband to be more burning than actual fire. Such a lady can actually observe the sati right voluntarily and there is no criminal being forced by anyone, so her destination will be a glorious destination because she is voluntarily quitting her body following her husband. That means she also desires liberation from material bondage and in following the footsteps of her husband who is also becoming liberated she will also attain liberation, so she doesn't have to separately practice. That is the grahastha dharma. The wife is chaste, she follows her husband especially in his spiritual duties or spiritual activities, she follows her husband and she simply gets the same benefit as the husband without

her having to actually practice the details of all the spiritual practices. So, this is the wonderful destination of Gandhari. The 59th verse, vidurasthu tad ascharyam nishamya kurunandana harsha shokayutastasmad gantatirtha nisevakah. The meaning of this verse is, Vidura being affected with delight and grief will then leave that place of sacred pilgrimage. Vidura is observing all this. He is gone with Dhritarashtra, Gandhari because he only was the inspiration for Dhritarashtra to quit home. So, he went with Dhritarashtra and he saw what did Dhritarashtra do? He followed Vidura's direction and he attained perfection and Gandhari followed as a chaste wife, she followed her husband. So, Vidura is delighted, but why is it described he was also having that grief? Prabhupada explains, Vidura was astonished to see the marvelous departure of his brother Dhritarashtra as a liberated yogi for in his past life, that is Dhritarashtra's past life, he was very much attached to materialism. Of course, the fact is that it was only due to Vidura that Dhritarashtra attained the desirable goal of life. So, Vidura was glad to learn about this Dhritarashtra attaining the ultimate goal that is liberation from material bondage, but Vidura was sorry that Vidura could not make Dhritarashtra a pure monk because he was feigned sobriety for his pure devotee. Why? Why Vidura could not make Dhritarashtra pure devotee? Because Dhritarashtra was inimical to the Pandavas who were all devotees of the Lord. Therefore Vidura could not make Dhritarashtra pure devotee.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that while devotees can guide and inspire, only the Lord can grant spiritual advancement and liberation, and that proper surrender to Krishna requires many lifetimes of understanding one's spiritual identity.

An offence at the feet of a Vaishnava is more dangerous than an offence at the feet of the Lord. Vidura was certainly very liberal to bestow mercy upon Dhritarashtra whose past life was very materialistic but ultimately the result of all such mercy depends on the will of the Lord who grants spiritual advancement, who grants spiritual liberation, who grants spiritual benefits. It's only the will of the Lord. It's only the Lord. Devotees may help, devotees may guide, devotees may direct, devotees may inspire but devotees cannot give anything. It is the Lord only who gives. Lord is completely under the control, in control of a spiritual potency and by spiritual potency the Lord gives spiritual advancement, spiritual benefits, spiritual liberation, spiritual engagement, everything. So Dhritarashtra attained liberation only but Vidura, sorry Dhritarashtra can, Dhritarashtra attained liberation only but he can attain the stage of devotional service after many many many such liberated states of life. So, bahu nam janma namante dhyana vanamaam prapadyate. One is able to properly surrender to Krishna only after many many lifetimes of living that stage of liberation. In proper understanding of one's spiritual identity, in relationship with Krishna. That relationship means, repenting, breathing in words, expressing self forced deeds, confession of great freedom in the spiritual realm, and knowing the divine gift and the real spiritual power, logging into the terms and forms of existence of our forest.

Pradhyatesh has around food und Gen-beav. no more inimical feeling towards devotees or the Supreme Lord. The last verse of this chapter, sixtieth verse, ityuktvā atha āruhat svargam nārada sahatumburuhu yuriṣṭiro vachastasya hṛdī pritvā jahā chuchah. The meaning of this last verse, sixtieth verse is, Having spoken thus, the great sage Nārada, along with his veena, ascended into outer space. Yuriṣṭira kept his instruction in his heart and so was able to get to the fall lamentation. Yuriṣṭira was lamenting that my uncle left home and went away. I don't know where he has gone. Nārada informed him where Dhritarashtra has gone. Nārada informed him what will happen to Dhritarashtra. That Dhritarashtra will be liberated. And therefore, Yuriṣṭira, keeping the instruction of Nārada in his heart, he became free from all lamentation. Now, Nārada is described here by Prabhupāda as an eternal spaceman. He is having a spiritual body, endowed by the Supreme Lord himself. He can travel in outer space of both the material and the spiritual worlds. He is free to travel anywhere without any restrictions and he can approach any planet, either in the material world or the spiritual sky. Spiritual sky are the Vaikuntha Lokas. In the material world, there are different kinds of upper planetary systems: Svarga Loka, Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, Brahmaloka, or the earthly planets, Bhūloka, Bhūvarloka, or even the lower planets, Atala, Vitala, Sutala, anywhere he can go. And why does he travel? He simply travels to preach the message of Kṛṣṇa about bhakti and to deliver people, to liberate people from material bondage.

**Key Quote:** "It is reserved for Great devotees"
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains why Vidura is addressed as Mahatma, emphasizing his spiritual realization and devotion.

Now Srila Prabhupada explains this. What is this poisoning and arson? In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "Due to Pandu's death at an early age, his minor children and widow were the object of special care by the elderly men, the family members of the family, especially Bhishma Deva and Mahatma Vidura." Vidura is addressed as Mahatma because he was not only very conscious of his responsibility as an elderly member of the family, but he was also spiritually self-realized, spiritually advanced, and self-realized after his traveling to pace the pilgrimage and inquiring from Maitreya Rishi and becoming spiritually enlightened. So therefore he is addressed as Mahatma Vidura. This Mahatma title is not for simply somebody great by some material estimation. No, it is reserved for great devotees.

**Summary:** The speaker quotes Bhagavad Gita to define a Mahatma as someone who has taken shelter of Krishna's internal potency and is engaged in pure devotional service.

According to the Bhagavad Gita, Mahatma anastumam partha Daiveem prakritim ashritah Bhajanti ananya manaso Gyaatva bhutadim abhyayam. According to the Bhagavad Gita, who is to be called a Mahatma? One who has taken shelter of Krishna's internal spiritual potency. And the symptom of having taken shelter of Krishna's internal potency is that such a person is always engaged in pure devotional service to Krishna without any interruption. So Vidura was such a pure devotee of Krishna. Therefore he is addressed as Mahatma Vidura.

**Key Quote:** "Dhritarashtra was Not treating the Pandavas Equally with his own sons"
**Summary:** The lecture explains Dhritarashtra's inner desire for his own sons to become emperors and his unequal treatment of the Pandavas, leading to Vidura's partiality towards them.

Vidura was more or less partial to the Pandavas. Due to their political position, the Pandavas were fatherless. Kunti was staying with her minor sons in the palace of Dhritarashtra. Dhritarashtra was the Ketakar king, but Dhritarashtra was not treating the Pandavas equally with his own sons because Dhritarashtra had an inner desire that somehow his own sons should become the emperors of the world and not the sons of Pandu, who are the rightful claimants to the throne of Hastinapura. So Duryodhana plotted to actually kill the Pandavas before they could actually become adults and supported his son Duryodhana in all his nefarious activities. So Srila Prabhupada explains, "Although Dhritarashtra was equally careful for the minor children of Maharaja Pandu, he was one of the intriguing parties who wanted to wash away the descendants of Pandu and replace them by raising his own sons to become rulers of the kingdom. Mahatma Vidura could follow this intrigue of Dhritarashtra and company, and therefore, even though he was a faithful servitor of his eldest brother Dhritarashtra, he did not like Dhritarashtra's political ambition for the sake of his own sons. Therefore, Vidura was very careful about the protection of the Pandavas and their widow mother Kunti. Thus he was, so to speak, partial to the Pandavas, preferring them to the sons of Dhritarashtra, although both of them were equally affectionate."

**Summary:** The speaker describes Vidura's careful balance in protecting the Pandavas while showing affection to both sides, and Dhritarashtra's policy of peaceful annihilation of the Pandavas.

In his ordinary eyes, see how Vidura is carefully, on the one hand, trying to protect the Pandavas. On the other hand, he is also showing equal affection to the Pandavas and Kauravas because both of them are sons of his two brothers. He was equally affectionate to both the camps of Nebus in the sense that he always chastised Duryodhana for his intriguing policy against his cousins. He always criticized his elder brother Dhritarashtra for his policy of encouragement to his sons. At the same time, he was always alert in giving special protection to the Pandavas. All these different activities of Vidura within the palace politics made him well known as partial to the Pandavas. Maharaj Yudhishthira has referred to the past history of Vidura before his going away from home for a prolonged pilgrim's journey. Maharaj Yudhishthira reminded Vidura that he was equally kind and partial to his grown up nephews even after the battle of Kurukshetra, a great family disaster. So Srila Prabhupada explains, "Before the battle of Kurukshetra, Dhritarashtra's policy was peaceful annihilation of his nephews. Peaceful annihilation means they should be eliminated in such a way that nobody will suspect any foul play."

**Summary:** The lecture narrates Dhritarashtra's plan to send the Pandavas to Varanavata and Vidura's tactful warning to Yudhishthira about the impending danger.

It should seem like they died somehow. And then because nobody is there to ascend the throne as descendants of Pandu, therefore Dhritarashtra's sons will become the claimants to the throne of Hastinapura. So this was Dhritarashtra's policy and plan. And what did Dhritarashtra do? He ordered Purochana to build a house at Varanavata. And when the building was finished, Dhritarashtra desired that his brother's family live there for some time because the Pandavas and Kauravas were sharing that palace in Hastinapura. So Dhritarashtra said to the Pandavas, "You can go and live there comfortably. This palace is for you separately, you can live." When the Pandavas were going there in the presence of all the members of the royal family, Vidura tactfully gave instructions to the Pandavas about the future plan of Dhritarashtra. The Pandavas did not know what was Dhritarashtra's plan, but Vidura knew, and Vidura gave instructions to Yudhishthira very, very tactfully about Dhritarashtra coming to know about it. So this is specifically described in the Mahabharata Adiparva 114.

**Key Quote:** "A weapon not made of steel Or any other material element Can be more sharp to kill an enemy"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Vidura's indirect warnings to Yudhishthira about the fire plot and the Pandavas' escape through a tunnel.

He indirectly hinted. What did he say? What did Vidura say to Yudhishthira? "A weapon not made of steel or any other material element can be more sharp to kill an enemy, and he who knows this is never killed." See, in the form of a riddle, he is telling something to Yudhishthira. That is to say, Vidura hinted that the party of the Pandavas was being sent to Varanavata to be killed, and thus he warned Yudhishthira to be very careful in their new residential palace. He also gave indications of fire and said that fire cannot extinguish the soul but can annihilate the material body, but one who protects the soul can live. Kunti could not follow such indirect conversations between Maharaj Yudhishthira and Vidura, and thus when she inquired from her son about the purport of the conversation, Yudhishthira replied to Kunti Devi that from the talks of Vidura, it was understood that there was a hint of fire proceeding later on. Vidura came in disguise to the Pandavas and informed them that the housekeeper was going to set fire to the house on the fourteenth night of the waning moon. It was an intrigue of Dhritarashtra that the Pandavas might die altogether with their mother. By his warning, that is Vidura's warning, Pandavas escaped through a tunnel underneath the earth so that their escape was also unknown to Dhritarashtra, so much so that after setting the fire, the Kauravas were so certain of the death of the Pandavas that Dhritarashtra performed the last rites of their death.

**Key Quote:** "Vidura played A Fair role In the Palace politics"
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by highlighting Vidura's fair role in palace politics, his efforts to prevent injustice, and his constant protection of the Pandavas, comparing it to a bird protecting its eggs.

With great cheerfulness during the morning period, all the members of the palace became overwhelmed with lamentation, but Vidura did not become so because Vidura had knowledge that the Pandavas were alive somewhere. There are many such instances of calamities, and in each of them, Vidura gave protection to the Pandavas. On one hand, and on the other, he tried to restrain his brother Dhritarashtra from such intriguing policies. See how Vidura played a fair role in the palace politics. He tried to prevent his brother Dhritarashtra from doing injustice to the Pandavas, and he also kept warning the Pandavas so that Pandavas might not be killed by Dhritarashtra's intrigues. Therefore, it is described here that Vidura was always partial to the Pandavas, just as a bird protects its eggs by its wing. It is natural when a bird lays an egg so that the egg can eventually mature and hatch into a young one. So before the egg hatches, the bird has to protect that egg against attack by enemies or by some other birds which may come and, or some reptiles can come and eat away the egg. So the bird has to protect. So like that, Vidura, in order to protect the Pandavas against being killed by Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana and the Kauravas, he had to protect them very, very carefully. So this was the special protection of Vidura, and therefore Yudhishthira makes a reference to this after Yudhishthira returned after the battle of Kurukshetra, how because of Vidura's protection, Yudhishthira and his brothers and even Kunti were actually protected against being completely killed and eliminated by Dhritarashtra and company.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the background of Vidura's departure from the palace, focusing on the insult he received from Duryodhana for being the son of a Shudrani and his attempts to give good advice to Dhritarashtra.

The palace where Yudhishthira was staying and ruling from. So in the Purport, Shrila Prabhupada says about Vidura's travel, Vidura went out from the palace to detach himself from household affairs, especially political intrigues. As referred to here and before, he was practically insulted by Duryodhana's calling him a son of a Shudrani. If you remember the background, Vidura was staying in the palace with Dhritarashtra while Dhritarashtra was the caretaker king before the battle of Kurukshetra. And Vidura as a well-wisher and a younger brother of Dhritarashtra, a step-brother, but still nevertheless an affectionate and younger brother, step-brother of Dhritarashtra, Vidura was giving very good advice to Dhritarashtra. And Vidura was very, very intelligent. The fact is Vidura had appeared as the son of a Shudrani. And Duryodhana found Vidura to be not favorable for his nefarious activities in plotting to kill the Pandavas. Even though Duryodhana had the support of his father, still Vidura was advising Dhritarashtra to be favorable. And this was not to the liking of Duryodhana.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the details of Vidura's birth and lineage, explaining how he was considered the son of a Shudrani (maidservant) and therefore not entitled to inheritance.

So Duryodhana at one stage, he insulted Vidura by calling him the son of a Shudrani. And Srila Prabhupada says, Although it is not out of place to talk loosely in the case of one's grandmother, that is Vidura's mother, although a Shudrani, was the grandmother of Duryodhana. How was Vidura's mother a Shudrani, the grandmother of Duryodhana? Duryodhana's father, Dhritarashtra, Dhritarashtra's mothers were the wives of Dhritarashtra's father. Dhritarashtra's father had actually... two wives, Ambika and Ambalika, Pichitravirya, Dhritarashtra's father, was having two wives. And Dhritarashtra's mother, Ambika, her maidservant was a Shudrani. And Vidura was born out of this maidservant of the queen. So therefore, Dhritarashtra was the son of the king and queen, but Vidura was the son of the maidservant of the queen. Therefore, Vidura was considered the son of a maidservant, a Shudrani.

**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain how Dhritarashtra valued Vidura's advice, which was not to Duryodhana's liking, and how the insult from Duryodhana led Vidura to renounce his position and prepare for a life of renunciation.

Therefore, he was not entitled to an inheritance in the royal kingdom. So, Dhritarashtra was maintaining Vidura very affectionately, very nicely in the palace. And he was giving much value to the valuable property of Vidura, valuable advice being given by Vidura, which is not to the liking of Duryodhana. So, Srila Prabhupada says Vidura's mother, although a Shudrani, was a grandmother of Duryodhana and funny talks are sometimes allowed between grandmother and grandchildren. So, even if Duryodhana's remark might have been considered as a humorous remark, but because the remark was an actual fact, it was unpalatable talk to Vidura when Vidura was told that he was son of a Shudrani by Duryodhana. Then, because it was an actual fact, it was unpalatable to Vidura and it was accepted as a direct insult. So, Vidura therefore decided to quit his paternal house

and prepare for the renounced order of life. This is because Vidura is alert as to his ultimate spiritual responsibility. So, this preparatory stage is called Vanaprasta Ashrama or retired life for traveling and visiting the holy places on the surface of the earth. In the holy places of India, like Vrindavan, Haridwar, Jagannath Puri and Prayag, there are many great devotees and there are still free kitchen houses for purification. There are many persons who desire to advance spiritually. This is one special feature of India or Bharata Varsha that people are spiritually enlightened. Therefore, they travel to holy places and take association of great devotees in those holy places and reside in faith. In the holy places of India, there are many great devotees and there are still free kitchen houses called Kshatras. Shri La Prabhupada says, Maharaj Yudhishthira was inquisitive to learn whether Vidura maintained himself by the mercy of the free kitchen houses.

We are going to begin a new chapter, chapter 14 of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The chapter is entitled, "The Disappearance of Lord Krishna." This is the speciality of the Bhagavatam. Bhagavatam topics are not necessarily chronologically described. Chronologically means first this happened, then this happened, then something else happened, then something else happened, then something else happened. No, the sequence of description in the Bhagavatam follows the questions and answers, the questions and the answers. So, according to the question being asked, the answer is given. And the answer is given with support of the historical incidents, describing certain incidents, describing certain important principles illustrated in the life of great devotees or taught by the activities of the Supreme Lord in his various incarnations, etc. So, the disappearance of Lord Krishna is described in the first canto. The appearance of Lord Krishna is described in the tenth canto. This is the peculiarity of the Srimad Bhagavatam. And not only Bhagavatam, even the other Puranas also, there is description of different topics according to the questions raised and according to the sequence in which the answers are given to questions, questions as the questions are raised and the message is important even if one is not able to strictly follow the chronology, the sequence of events very strictly important.

So Srila Prabhupada explains, as stated in Bhagavad Gita, the Lord descended on earth for the protection of the faithful and annihilation of the empires. So after the battle of Kurukshetra and establishment of Maharaja Yudhishthira as the emperor of the entire world, the mission of the Lord was complete. The Pandavas, especially Sri Arjuna, were our eternal companions of the Lord and therefore Arjuna went to Dvaraka to hear from the Lord of his next program of work.

His devotees, they simply follow the Lord, they have no other engagement, they simply want to please Krishna. They want to carry out his orders, they want to follow his program, they have no program of their own. Second verse: Vyateetaha Katichinmasa Tadanayat Tathorjunah Dadarsha Ghorarupani Nimittani Kurudvahaha, meaning of the second verse of this 14th chapter of the first canto, a few months passed and Arjuna did not return. Maharaja Yudhishthira then began to observe some inauspicious omens which were fearful in themselves. So in the purport Shri Ram Prabhupada says, what are these fearful omens that Yudhishthira is observing when Arjuna is away from Hastinapura, has gone to Dvaraka to inquire about Krishna's next program. So Prabhupada says in the purport, Sri Krishna, the supreme personality of Godhead is as a Pontifex. At the time of Arjuna's visit to Kulidwaraka as the principal of the group of Varunachala and Shri Krishna says that I have come to tell you that these are all possible omens and you have seen all the powerful and powerful things that come from far and wide to the extent that you go into the universe. But Krishna is not a complete and infinite Omens and he does not exist and we will not ever find any of that things that come from far and wide. The only thing you do is keep following the Gesture of Krishna's Omens of the Great Omens and you will be able to take that Omens of the Great Omens. The Omens of the Great Omens are the Omens of the Vishwara and Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain Srila Prabhupada's purport on the second verse, describing the power of Krishna and Maha Vishnu, and the importance of the sun for material prosperity.

They are the Omens of the Shri Krishna and Krishna's will. Krishna's will is the highest form of power. Billions of suns are created by Krishna and he only annihilates everything and everything, all his creation and destruction happens within one breathing period of the incarnation of Krishna called Maha Vishnu. Maha Vishnu breathes out universes, universes remain as long as Maha Vishnu does not inhale. So, he breathes out, after some time he inhales, when he inhales everything that that is created is destroyed and enters his transcendental body. Now, in the material world, the sun is considered to be the source of all productivity and material energy and only due to the sun can we have our necessities of life. That is a fact, you may think. We may not be aware of this, we may not be able to figure this out, but the shastras explain this. Therefore, during the personal presence of the Lord on the earth, all paraphernalia for our peace and prosperity, especially religion and knowledge, were in full display because of the Lord's presence.

When Krishna was present, everything was perfect, everything was very nice for everyone in the entire earth planet. Maharaja Yudhishthira observed some discrepancies in his kingdom. Now, when Krishna is present, everything is fine. Now, why suddenly some discrepancies are appearing? Maharaja Yudhishthira is perfectly ruling. So, Yudhishthira is observing the discrepancies, is indicative of what? He suspected, Yudhishthira suspected disappearance of Lord Krishna. Otherwise, there would have been no possibility of any discrepancies. And also, Arjuna had not brought back the news of Krishna's next program. That was another observation by Yudhishthira. Long time Arjuna is gone, he has not come back. And these fearful omens are the same.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport on the third verse, emphasizing the connection between a civilization's disconnection from God and the rise of negative qualities and irregularities in nature.

of livelihood. The purport explains this, in the purport, when civilization disconnected from the loving relation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, symptoms like changes of seasonal regulations, foul means of livelihood, greed, anger and fraudulence become rampant. If people in this, even in this material world, are not following the devotional principles, the directions of the bona fide scriptures, they don't follow, then people become corrupted and nature will not function properly. The change of seasonal regulations refers to one season's atmosphere become manifest in another season. For example, we have experience of this now, nowadays especially, the rainy season being transferred to autumn. Autumn is not supposed to rain, autumn is after the rainy season is over and the rains have stopped, but what if in autumn suddenly there is heavy rain? This is called seasonal irregularity or the fructification of fruits and flowers from one season in another season. Normally we get mango fruit in summer, but what if mango fruit starts appearing in the summer and it is not supposed to rain in winter? That is a seasonal irregularity. Also Srila Prabhupada says, a godless man is invariably greedy, angry and fraudulent. So good qualities cannot be generated in a person or

So nice person or not nice person is not by external appearances or behaviour, it is what is in the core of the heart and depending on what is in the core of the heart that will manifest sooner or later, it cannot be kept inside hidden in a dormant state, it may be there for some time.

Such a man, a godless person who's full of greed, anger and corruption can earn his livelihood by any means, black or white and such godless people don't care how they earn their livelihood, they'll adopt even unfair means if they are unable to earn by a fair means. During the reign of Maharaja Yudhishthira all the above symptoms were conspicuous by their absence, that means in Yudhishthira was properly ruling and Krishna was present, everybody was following all the principles of the Dharma very nicely and they were nicely engaged, there was no scarcity, there was no bad behavior, there was no seasonal irregularities, nothing. But Maharaja Yudhishthira was astonished to experience even a slight change in the godly atmosphere of his kingdom, he detected and is carefully observing that there are some changes taking place, why? Therefore he at once suspected the disappearance of the Land of Future, thought, the only reason why these discrepancies are being observed by me is only because the disappearance of Krishna. Krishna's mission is over, he returns to his personal kingdom

from where he comes. Now what is the meaning of foul means of livelihood? It means deviation from one's occupational duty. There are prescribed duties meant for the Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra. But if a Brahmana without doing his Brahmanical duties, he performs the duties of Kshatriya or Vaishya, Shudra, then that is called foul means of livelihood. Or somebody becomes too greedy for wealth. That is also incorrect, improper. Such a person will become greedy for wealth only if he has no higher objective in life. The goal of life is spiritual realization. But if somebody forgets that goal or misses that goal or does not care for that goal, then such a person has to be affected by greed, anger, corruption, etc. To remain free from all these bad qualities is to be Krishna conscious. And there is no

**Key Quote:** "Material advancement of civilization means advancement of the reactions of the three four miseries due to celestial influence earthly reactions and bodily or mental pains"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of the threefold miseries (tapatraya) - divyaan, bhavmaan, and daihikaan - and how material advancement often leads to increased suffering.

Naravyagra, three-fold miseries, miseries due to three different causes, which is always there in material existence. Tapatraya, in Kannada they say tapatraya. What is this tapatraya? Tapa means miseries, traya means three kinds. Three kinds of fundamental miseries are always part of this material existence and they have been described here as divyaan, bhavmaan, daihikaan. Divyaan is the celestial influences, supernatural powers over which you have no control, just like rain. Too much rain or no rain. Divyaan is misery for people on the earth. They have suffered in so many ways. Or too much heat or too much cold. Or too much of wind. All these are sufferings. Earthquake, tsunami, volcanoes, so many celestial influences. Daihikaan is due to earthly reactions, different kinds of reactions due to other living entities. Other living entities, they give us trouble in so many ways, mosquitoes and wild animals, enemies and all kinds of pathogens, infectious germs. So they give us so much of trouble, miseries we suffer, and bodily pains, our own body, indigestion or some malfunctioning of some organ or some injury or some fatigue or some deficiency in some senses, we suffer in so many ways. So all are actually very dangerous. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "Material advancement of civilization means advancement of the reactions of the three four miseries due to celestial influence, earthly reactions, and bodily or mental pains."

**Key Quote:** "Material advancement means advancement of the reactions of the three four miseries"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts modern life with its complications and occupational hazards to a simpler, less problematic past.

So this is a very important statement we have to understand and we have to internalize. We are very proud of material advancement. What is it that actually has brought about this advancement? Advancement, material advancement means, Prabhupada says, "Advancement of the reactions of the three four miseries." So there are more miseries. People used to live simple life because of which there were less dangers, less accidents, less complications, less problems. You see many of the diseases called psychosomatic diseases, they are all occupational hazards. Middle-age and occupation itself did not exist, so where is the question of any occupational hazard when the occupation doesn't exist? For example, people sit in front of a terminal and work for eight hours or ten hours continuously and then they develop some back pain, neck problem, eye problem, or they develop some headache and some of these are chronic problems. They are not just coming and disappearing after some time. No, day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year they work like that and then they develop permanent problem with the neck or with the back. So or with the hands, fingers. I know a person who keeps on typing, was typing, typing, typing and the finger movement itself has become very painful and doctors told, "No more you can use your fingers in that way." So the person is skilled in typing and if it's told you cannot type, you should not type, how will he earn his livelihood? What will he do to earn his living? So many problems. There is no need of typing in the last about fifteen hundred years back. So they had simple occupation and they will live in a simple life, so they didn't have any of the complications that we have in the modern times.

The aggregate result is the agony of the body and the mind. Whichever the type of misery ultimately it affects our body or our mind or both. Man-made material science cannot do anything to counteract these threefold miseries. These miseries have always existed. It's not in modern times we have eliminated some of the miseries, no, they've always existed and they continue to harass us in this material world. So Srila Prabhupada says, "They are all punishments from the superior energy of Maya under the direct advice of Upadhyaya." This is the clear statement of the pray or not, we are all punished by the laws of nature. Laws of nature are the same restriction of supreme law. We violate, we misbehave and therefore we are punished by the laws of nature. Laws of nature are fair, they're perfectly just, but we are the ones who are individually and collectively violating the laws and we are to suffer the consequences.

body. This is called the science of nimitta. In the Vedic literature there is a, there is a whole compilation of certain symptoms which forebode undesirable happenings, like for example the left side of Yudhishthira's body is quivering, is shaking and there is also quivering in the arms and the eyes and the thighs again and again. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "Material existence is full of undesirables. Things you do not want are forced upon us by some superior energy and we do not see that these undesirables are on the grip of the three modes of material nature." Nature is working, three gunas are always acting. We don't have control over the gunas. The gunas are forcing upon us their influence, sometimes desirable, sometimes undesirable. When a man's eyes, arms and thighs are all quivering constantly, one must know that something is going to happen which are undesirable. Without your movement of the eye, the eye is quivering, is shaking without your moment, then it is to be understood that something undesirable is going to happen in the near future. These undesirables are compared to a fire in a forest. Why? No one goes into the forest to set fires, but fires automatically take place in the forest creating inconceivable calamities for the living beings of the forest. When there's a forest fire there's so much destruction and so many living entities are killed, burnt alive, roasted in the forest fire when they cannot escape. Such a fire cannot be extinguished by human efforts. The fire can be extinguished only by the mercy of the Lord who sends clouds to pour water on the forest. When there's a torrential rain, a big rain cloud pours heavily down water on the forest, the portion where there is fire spreading, then the fire can be extinguished, otherwise there's no possibility of any human intervention. Similarly undesirable happenings in life cannot be checked by individuals. Such miseries can be removed only by the mercy of the Lord who sends his bona fide representatives to enlighten human beings and thus save them from all calamities. Srila Prabhupada has come, he's come to save us from all these calamities by Krishna consciousness. That's the way to receive the mercy of the Lord, chanting Hare Krishna and doing it as directed by Prabhupada, by the representative of Krishna. He teaches exactly what to do, how to do it and if you follow sincerely, faithfully, we will definitely overcome all undesirables and will be successful ultimately in our life in going back to God. I'll stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of Srimad Bhagavatam 1.14.12, explaining Yudhishthira's concern about Krishna's disappearance based on observed bad omens and Arjuna's delayed return.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing verses 12 to 16 of the 14th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This chapter deals with the topic of Disappearance of Lord Krishna. The 12th verse: Shivai Shodhyantam Adityam Abhirauti Analanana Mamanga Sarameyoyam Abhirebhati Abhiruvat. The meaning of this verse is: Just see, O Bhima, how the she-jackal cries at the rising sun and vomits fire, and how the dog barks at me fearlessly. So, in the purport, Shri Leprava says, these are words spoken by Yudhishthira to Bhima. Yudhishthira is observing some bad omens, and he's conjecturing that it may indicate the disappearance of Krishna. But, he has sent Arjuna to Dwaraka to find out Krishna's next program, and Arjuna has not returned for 7 months. So Yudhishthira is becoming concerned, what could be the reason why Arjuna has not returned? Is everything alright in Dwaraka? Has the Lord left this earth planet? This is the concern of Yudhishthira.

**Key Quote:** "In this material world always there is consideration of auspicious symptoms and inauspicious symptoms."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the Vedic science of Nimitta, differentiating between auspicious and inauspicious signs, and emphasizing the scriptural basis for recognizing omens, distinguishing it from superstition.

So he is telling Bhima about the bad omens that he is observing. So, in the purportional pravapa says just one sentence, these are some bad omens indicating something undesirable in the near future. There is a science in the Vedic literature called science of nimitta. Nimitta means certain indications by which we can say we can expect something auspicious to happen, or some other indications which indicate to us that something inauspicious is going to happen. So, in this material world, there is always consideration of auspicious symptoms and inauspicious symptoms. In the spiritual world, there is all auspiciousness; there is no inauspiciousness. So, this difference always exists between the material world and the spiritual world. Besides that, this science of Nimitta is not some superstitious belief as sometimes people may think. Modern man thinks that if the scriptures describe the crying of the she-jackal is inauspicious at the time of the rising of the sun, then people may dismiss it as something superstitious. Well, some people do have some superstitious beliefs which are not based on scriptures, that is all right. But if the scriptures are informing us of some inauspicious happenings, that we can expect undesirables in the near future by some bad omens, and they are very specific. It is not that I think it is bad or somebody else thinks it is not so bad. No, it is actually universally true, these bad omens. So, some of these bad omens are being observed by Yudhishthira and he is indicating them to Bhima.

**Key Quote:** "O Bhima Sena, tiger amongst men, now useful animals like cows are passing me on my left side and lower animals like the asses are circumambulating me."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the 13th verse, focusing on Yudhishthira's observations of unusual animal behavior as bad omens, and highlighting the importance of living in harmony with nature and respecting all living beings.

In the 13th verse, Yudhishthira continues to speak to Bhima and tell him about the bad omens he is observing. The meaning of this 13th verse: O Bhima Sena, tiger amongst men, now useful animals like cows are passing me on my left side and lower animals like the asses are circumambulating me. My horses appear to weep upon seeing me. These are all some of the inauspicious symptoms. Now see the close relationship between the people and the domestic animals. The horses appear to weep upon seeing me. That means they cared for the animals, not just in terms of taking some service from them, but also for their welfare, for their well-being, so the horses are weeping upon seeing their master, means they are also foreseeing something inauspicious is going to happen. So it is said in the scriptures that dogs can see ghosts, and if there's a ghost attack on somebody, the dogs will bark or make a sound in a particular way which is different from the usual barking of the dogs, a whining sound, so that indicates that dogs are foreboding some inauspicious bad happenings. So these are all very much true as explained in the scriptures, and these can be experienced if people learn how to live in harmony with nature. That means in harmony with nature means not to ill-treat or unnecessarily harm any other living being in any type of body.

**Key Quote:** "Not to harm anyone even the lower animals or the insignificant creatures."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Jada Bharat to illustrate the importance of non-violence and avoiding entanglement, even with seemingly insignificant creatures, to maintain spiritual focus.

This is very, very important to note, not to harm anyone. Even the lower animals or the insignificant creatures, like in the Bhagavatam there's a description that there was one saintly person, my name Jada Bharat, that was described in the fifth canto. He was highly enlightened, he was a pure devotee, but because he was misled by some happening in his past life, he became entangled in caring for one baby deer who lost its mother, and being thus entangled, he missed the opportunity at the time of death to think of Krishna, to remember the Supreme Lord, and therefore in this particular future life, he was extra cautious not to get entangled in something which is distracting in this world now. So he was very, very careful in conducting himself in such a way that he would not show any interest in any material activities or material happenings, but when he was walking on the ground, he was careful not to stamp even upon an ant that was passing. He was paying moeten to avatar to see vipassana and Giri 봤sān, he was a pure devotee.

**Key Quote:** "A pure devotee does not want to harm anyone even an insignificant creature like an ant."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the devotee's compassion and ability to see the presence of Krishna in all living beings, connecting this to Yudhishthira's sensitivity to the horses' behavior as a sign of impending calamity.

This is natural for a pure devotee. A pure devotee does not want to harm anyone, even an insignificant creature like an ant. This is very, very striking because that enlightened state enables one to see the part and parcel of Krishna, the living being, the tiny spirit soul in every type of body, every type of creature, in hundred habían saw and every type of body and ninety type of creature, every type of living entity, whatever be the body. Of course, we are not so careful when we walk on the ground, and we do commit some minor sins if we stamp on some ant or some insignificant insect while walking on the ground. And for all these type of minor sins, we have to perform some atonement, prayas chitta, so that these sinful reactions will not come in the way of our ultimately going back to Godhead. But those who are enlightened, they don't want to unnecessarily kill even when they are walking, even some insignificant creature. So similarly, Yudhishthira is pointing out to Bhima, my horses appear to weep upon seeing me. Who would care for a horse in this way other than a devotee? He is noticing that how the horses are responding when he is passing in front of them. Yudhishthira Maharaj is noticing that. They appear to weep upon seeing me, which means that they are indicating something inauspicious is going to happen.

The 14th verse: viśvam vai ABOUT 10 0 the beginning of this Netflix words, just see… the pigeon is like a messenger of death. The shrieks of the owls and their rival crows make my heart tremble. It appears that they want to make a void of the whole universe. Some big calamity is going to happen, that's what all these symptoms are indicating, external symptoms in nature. They are very much living in harmony with nature, so they can notice specifically the shrieks of the owls, they are of a different type of sound, not the usual sound that they make when everything is normal. The 15th verse: Dhoomra Disha Paridhaya ha Kampate bhū sahādra vihi nirgātaś ca mahāṁ sthāta sākam ca sthanayit nubhī Dhoomra Disha Paridhaya ha Kampate bhū sahādra vihi nirgātaś ca mahāṁ sthāta sākam ca sthanayit nubhī. The meaning of this verse: Just see how the smoke encircles the sky. It appears that the earth and mountains are throbbing. Just hear the cloudless thunder and see the bolts from the blue. All these are indications of something calamitous that's going to happen, symptoms in the sky, symptoms on the surface of the earth, and symptoms in one's own body, that will come later in the later verses. The 16th verse, the meaning is: The wind blows violently blasting dust everywhere and creating darkness. Clouds are raining everywhere with bloody disasters. So the violent blowing of the wind blasting dust is also a sign of something inauspicious or calamitous that's going to happen. So these are all controlled. It is not simply something is accidentally or coincidentally happening, no, these are all definite symptoms and these are definite, a cent percent you can be sure that something calamitous is going to happen. Therefore Yudhishthira is particularly pointing out all these to Bhima.

**Key Quote:** "The calves do not suck the teats of the cows, nor do the cows give milk. They are standing crying, tears in their eyes."
**Summary:** The speaker explains verse 19, focusing on the distress of cows and bulls as a bad omen, highlighting the importance of cows in Vedic culture.

So, Yudhishthira Maharaj is describing to Bhima the bad omens that he is observing. Rivers are disturbed, ponds and reservoirs of water are disturbed. How they are so sensitive to note all these indications of something inauspicious or undesirable that is going to happen. People were living in harmony with nature. This is the point I mentioned in the earlier session and I am repeating that, that we are meant to live according to a certain design of the Supreme Lord in this material world. People have become indifferent to nature. Of course, they suffer calamities and they do take note of that. But then, even before a calamity occurs, the bad omens or the symptoms of such calamitous happenings in the future, that nobody is able to, most people are not able to recognize that. It is common knowledge in the Vedic times. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj is asking Bhima, what is this extraordinary time? What is going to happen? The 19th verse, na pibanti sthanam vatsa, na duhyanti ca matara, rudanti ashrumukha gaavo, na hrishyanti hrishabhavraje. The meaning of this verse is, "The calves do not suck the teats of the cows, nor do the cows give milk. They are standing crying, tears in their eyes." And, the bhima says, what is going to happen? What is happening? Then, they have had these long cuckoo calls, and the bulls take no pleasure in the pasturing grounds.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "In the Bhagavad Gita it is particularly said, Gauraksha, special mention is given that it is the duty of householders to give special protection to the cows."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the importance of cow protection in Vedic culture, emphasizing the special care and protection cows deserve, referencing Bhagavad Gita.

Especially in the Vedic culture, the cows and the calves and the bulls were treated by the people who owned them, who reared them, as their own children. This is very important. Among all the domestic animals, the cows were treated as seriously, as nicely, as caringly as their own children. And in the Bhagavad Gita it is particularly said, Gauraksha, special mention is given that it is the duty of householders to give special protection to the cows, though one should never harm any other creature, still specifically the cows had to be given special extra care, extra protection than the other animals, domestic animals. So Yudhishthira is marred, marking, cows do not suck the teeth of the cows, why? Because the cows are not giving milk. And why are they not giving milk? Because they are standing there crying tears in their eyes, something calamitous is going to happen. The cows are also sensing and Yudhishthira is noticing this. And the bulls, they used to happily go to the pasturing grounds and graze, but now they are not taking any pleasure in grazing. They seem to be disinterested. There are also four boardings on calamitous happening.

**Key Quote:** "Deities seem to be crying in the temple, lamenting and perspiring."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses verse 20, describing the deities in the temples as crying and the overall atmosphere as devoid of beauty and happiness, foreshadowing a major calamity.

The 20th verse, Daivathani Rudantiva Svidyanti Hi Ucchalanticha Ime Janapada Grama Purodhyana Akara Ashram. Ima Janapada Grama Purodhyana Akara Ashram. Ima Janapada Grama Purodhyana Akara Ashram. Ima Janapada Grama Purodhyana Akara Ashram. Ima Janapada Grama Purodhyana Akara Ashram Aaha. Brashta Shriyo Niranandaha, Niranandaha Kimmagha Darsha Yantinaha. The meaning of this verse is that deities seem to be crying in the temple, lamenting and perspiring. See even the deities are not just some statues in the temples. They are actually personalities. Verses 10 and 11. He was a tactician. The Prophet is also called a tactician. who are personally present and only in advanced devotee can see the deities seem to be crying in the temples. And these deities also Yudhishthira Maharaj is saying they seem about to leave the temple and go away. All the cities, villages, towns, gardens, mines and hermitages are now devoid of beauty and bereft of all happiness. The entire atmosphere is very sad. There is a sadness that is spread everywhere and natural beauty is absent in gardens, mines, hermitages that natural beauty is missing now. And there seems to be no happiness anywhere. I do not know what sort of calamities are now awaiting us. Yudhishthira Maharaj is telling Bhima. What kind of calamities are we going to face now? We do not know. But certainly there is going to be some major calamity.

**Summary:** The speaker explains verse 21, highlighting the significance of Krishna's presence and the auspicious marks on His feet, referencing Kunti Devi's prayer in the first canto.

The twenty-fifth day of the month is the day of the Lord Krishna. The first verse, the meaning of these verses, I think that all these earthly disturbances indicate some greater lost to the good fortune of the world. Why is he telling this? Why is Yudhishthira Maharaj telling this? The first verse, because in the next part of the verse he's telling the world was fortunate to have been marked with the footprints of the lotus feet of the lord these signs indicate that this will no longer be as long as Krishna was present on the earth the footprints when the lord used to walk the footprints of the lord made impression on the soft ground because the lord's personality is very special as compared to other human beings on our palms there are some lines but Krishna's palms there'll be no lines like this there'll be some special impressions Krishna's feet the sole of Krishna's feet the bottom of Krishna's feet there will be some special marks that's indicated here there is a verse in the 8th chapter of the first canto 39th verse kunti devi is addressing Krishna and she's offering a beautiful prayer which indicates what are the impressions on the feet of the lord underneath the feet of the lord kunti devi is telling oh gadhadhara Krishna our kingdom is now being marked by the impressions of your feet and therefore it appears beautiful but when you leave it will no longer be so so Krishna's presence Krishna is walking on the ground and leaving behind the spirit of Krishna and she's offering a special impression of his feet are all auspicious in every way for the prosperity of the entire world so in the purport to this particular verse Prabhupada says there are certain particular marks on the feet of the lord would distinguish the lord from others the marks of a flag a thunderbolt and an instrument to drive an elephant umbrella lotus disc

**Key Quote:** "The beauty and opportunity of the Lord Krishna is very very fortunate of the world can be enhanced by the grace of the Lord and not by any man-made planning"
**Summary:** The speaker continues to discuss the auspiciousness of Krishna's presence and the impact of His footprints on the earth, emphasizing the loss felt after His disappearance and the decline of prosperity.

etc. are on the bottom of the Lord's feet. See all these symbols are there, impressions are there, these marks are impressed upon the soft dust of the land where the Lord traverses. The land of Hastinapura was thus marked while Lord Shri Krishna was there with the Pandavas and the kingdom of the Pandavas thus flourished by such auspicious signs. It's not simply some decorative marks, no, there is very significant good sign of such marks left behind on the soft dust when the Lord traverses the land of Hastinapura, the Lord traverses the ground while walking. So when Krishna was there with the Pandavas the kingdom of the Pandavas was flourishing with so much of prosperity just because of the auspicious signs left behind by Krishnas traversing the ground. Also Mother Earth is particularly making a statement in the sixteenth chapter of the first canto Bhagavatam it is mentioned Mother Earth is telling I was endowed with specific powers to supersede the fortune of all the three planetary systems by being decorated with the impressions of the flag Thunderbolt elephant driving rod and lotus flower which is signs of the lotus feet of the Lord under the Lord's feet there are some impressions which form a sign of anticipate that elder could have come into the Lord's power these four are mentioned again here by Prabhupada by Mother Earth what Prabhupada mentioned in the earlier verse flag thunderbolt elephant driving rod and lotus flower these are the signs underneath the feet of the Lord Krishna but at the end when I felt I was so fortunate mother earth felt very fortunate that Krishna when he is walking on the ground he is living behind his impressions so mother earth considered herself very very very fortunate but when she was thinking she is very very fortunate the Lord left me and went away this after the disappearance of the Lord mother earth is feeling the separation so the beauty Prabhupada says the beauty and opportunity of the Lord Krishna is very very fortunate the Lord Krishna is very very fortunate of the world can be enhanced by the grace of the Lord and not by any man-made planning so when Krishna was present on this earth the impressions of the special sign of his lotus feet was stamped on the dust and as a result of this specific grace the whole earth was made as perfect as possible so after Krishna disappearance people began to feel the difference that the prosperity is no longer going to be there because Krishna has left this world and stop here thank you very much

So Madhu dynasty, Bhoja dynasty, and so on. So it is said elsewhere in the tenth canto, Krishna was the king of 101 clans of the Yadu dynasty. Krishna was the chief. So there were so many clans and Krishna was the chief of all those, primarily because all of them were heading towards the Yadu dynasty. The members of those clans of the Yadu dynasty, they were all devotees of Krishna, pure devotees of Krishna. So Krishna descended to display his pastimes along with his associates from the spiritual world. Of course, not all are associates. Some of them are associates. Some of them are joining Krishna's pastimes after becoming eligible to go back to Godhead. So Yudhishthira is enquiring first of all about the well-being of all those clans of the Yadu dynasty, whether they are all doing well from Arjuna because Arjuna had gone to Dwarka to find out about Krishna's next program and Arjuna has written.

The meaning of these two verses. Yudhishthira to Arjuna specifically is asking about the different relatives of Krishna living with him in Dwaraka.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, Hastinapura, the capital of the Pandavas, was situated somewhere near present New Delhi, and the kingdom of Ugrasena was situated in Mathura. While returning to Delhi from Dwaraka, Arjuna must have visited the city of Mathura, and therefore, the inquiry about the king of Mathura is valid. Arjuna is returning from Dwaraka, has returned from Dwaraka, to Hastinapura, which is New Delhi. So on the way, he would have passed through Mathura, so he's inquiring about Mathura.

#### Balarama, Vishnu Tattva, expansions of Krishna, Prakasha Vigraha

**Audience:** Full-time devotees
**Key Quote:** "Because Lord Balarama is the immediate expansion of Vishnu Tattva as Prakasha Vigraha of Lord Krishna."
**Summary:** This segment explains the concept of Vishnu Tattva and how Balarama is the immediate expansion of Krishna, possessing the same qualities and power.

Amongst various names of the relatives, the name of Rama or Balarama, eldest brother of Lord Krishna, is added with the words, the personality of Godhead, Bhagavan, because Lord Balarama is the immediate expansion of Vishnu Tattva as Prakasha Vigraha of Lord Krishna. What is this meaning of Prakasha Vigraha? Now, Krishna, The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the one and only one Supreme Lord in the entire creation, the entire existence. But he expands and there are different types of expansions. So the immediate expansion is called the expansion of the Vishnu Tattva. That means the personality of Godhead with his all godly qualities, godly characteristics expands as Vishnu Tattva. They are all the expansions, immediate expansions, the personal expansions, full expansions are having the same power, same qualities. They are all the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna only. So Srila Prabhupada explains this. Balarama is the first expansion of Krishna. So Prabhupada says further, the Supreme Lord, although one without a second, expands himself as many other living beings. The Vishnu Tattva living beings are expansions of the Supreme Lord. Here living beings should not be confused with ordinary living entities. Here living being means their personalities, fully conscious and persons, but they are expansions of the Supreme Lord himself, and all of them are qualitatively and qualitatively equal with the Lord.

#### Vishnu Tattva vs. Jeeva Shakti, spiritual master, Prabhupada's mercy, Balarama as Adiguru
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/LuIn2zkS3ww?t=794
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "One who considers the Vishnu Tattva and the Jeeva Shakti to be on equal level is considered a condemned soul of the world."
**Summary:** This segment differentiates between Vishnu Tattva and Jeeva Shakti, emphasizing the superiority of the former, and highlights Balarama as the original guru and Prabhupada as his merciful representative.

This is called Vishnu Tattva. Balarama, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Keshava, Narayana, all of them are qualitatively and quantitatively equal with the Lord. But expansions of the Jeeva Shakti, the category of ordinary living beings, are not at all equal with the Lord. So even we living beings, ordinary living beings, we are also expansions of the Lord, but we are not equal with the Lord. One who considers the Vishnu Tattva and the Jeeva Shakti to be on equal level is considered a condemned soul of the world. That means you should never equate any ordinary living being, Jeeva, Jeeva Shakti, with Vishnu Tattva, with the personality of Godhead or his expansions. So the Supreme Lord, Krishna, Balarama, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, all of them are on the level of Supreme God, and we are at a much, much, much, much lower level. Insignificant beings who have got the quality of the Supreme Lord as spirit soul, we are spiritual beings, but quantitatively, very, very, very, very tiny. Lord is infinite. We are infinitesimal. So therefore, Balarama is addressed as the personality of Godhead and the protector of the devotees. So Prabhupada says, therefore, Balarama is described also as the mercy incarnation of the Supreme Lord, manifested as the spiritual master who is the savior of the pure devotees. So Balarama is the first guru, Adiguru, and our spiritual master, Prabhupada, is the representative Balarama as the mercy incarnation. Prabhupada is very, very merciful upon the suffering souls, and therefore, Prabhupada is preaching in this world and wants to rescue the suffering souls and take them back to God.

**Summary:** This segment explains the Vishnu Tattva, focusing on Pradyumna and Aniruddha as expansions of Krishna and part of the Chaturvyuha.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Jai Vanarottamam Devim Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing verses 30 to 33 of the 14th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Yudhishthira is making inquiries from Arjuna. Pradyumna Sarva Vrishminam Sukhamaste Maharatha Gambhir Rayo Aniruddho Vardhate Bhagavanuta. The meaning of this verse is, how is Pradyumna, the great general of the Vrishni family, is he happy? And is Aniruddha, the plenary expansion of the personality of Godhead, faring well? The purport, Srila Prabhupada makes a remark, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are also expansions of the personality of Godhead, and thus they are also Vishnu Tattva. Krishna is the originator of the personality of Godhead. His first expansion is Balarama. Balarama expands into the first Chaturvyuha: Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha. So those Pradyumna and Aniruddha are mentioned here also as expansion of the personality of Godhead, and they belong to the Vishnu Tattva category. Vishnu Tattva means they are qualitatively and quantitatively equal with Krishna. At Dwarka, Lord Vaishnodeva, the great general of the Vrishni family, is happy. The quadruple expansions, namely Sankarsana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha, so the Chaturvyuha, the quadruple expansions as Prabhupada says elsewhere, Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, they are all engaged in transcendental pastimes. And therefore, each and every one of them can be addressed as the personality of Kadaj, as it is mentioned in connection with the name Aniruddha. Here, Gambhirarayo Aniruddho Vardhate Bhagawan Uta, Aniruddha Bhagawan. So Bhagawan can be used for all Vishnu Tattva expansions of the Supreme Lord Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, only a few of them are called to associate with the Lord in his transcendental pastimes as the Lord of Dwarka on this earth."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the vastness of Krishna's family in Dwarka, emphasizing the numerous sons and grandsons, and highlighting Krishna's role as the Lord of Dwarka.

The thirty-first verse. The meaning of this verse is, are all the chieftain sons of Lord Krishna, such as Sushena, Charudeshna, Sambha, the son of Jambavati, and Rishabha, along with the Chaturvyuha. Are all their sons all doing well? So here the enquiry by Yudhishthira about the sons of Krishna. Krishna's sons are called Karshna. So, the reference is made to the sons of Krishna, headed by some of the chieftains. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, as already mentioned, Lord Krishna married 16,108 wives, and each of them had 10 sons. Therefore, Krishna had 161,080 sons, if I were to put it in the terms of lakhs, 161,080 sons. They all grew up, and each of them had 10,000 sons. They all had as many sons as their father. Krishna, through each wife, he had 10 sons, and each of the sons of Krishna had 10 sons each. So, the whole aggregate was something near 1,610,800 family members of the Lord. The Lord is the father of all living beings who are countless. Therefore, only a few of them are called to associate with the Lord in his transcendental pastimes as the Lord of Dwarka on this earth. So, everyone is ultimately a son of the Supreme Lord, or a daughter of the Supreme Lord.

#### Transcendental Position, Krishna Consciousness, Spiritual Platform

**Key Quote:** "So if we become connected with Krishna, we also become transcendentally situated."
**Summary:** This segment explains how connecting with Krishna elevates one to a transcendental platform, emphasizing the importance of practicing bhakti and purifying consciousness to remain in that state.

Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, Aham bija pradapita. The Lord is the father of all living beings. It is not astonishing that the Lord maintained a visible family consisting of so many members. In Dwarka, Krishna was having 1,610,000 grandsons and 161,000 sons. And 16,108 queens and a huge family. That's Krishna's own family as Krishna was playing the role of the Lord of Dwarka. It is better to refrain from comparing the Lord's position to ours, and it becomes a simple truth. As soon as we understand the Lord's position, we can understand how He is, even as we understand at least a partial calculation of the Lord's transcendental position. Always we should remember this point that the Lord is transcendentally situated eternally. Even when he comes to this material world, he is untouched by matter. He is completely spirit. He remains in his spiritual position eternally always, and all his connections are completely transcendental. So if we become connected with Krishna, we also become transcendentally situated. The simple example, when I vibrate my tongue and say Krishna, I chant the name of Krishna, I chant the name of the Supreme Lord Krishna, immediately I come in touch with the transcendental sound of his name and I am elevated to the spiritual position or platform. But to remain on the spiritual platform, that requires practice of bhakti and purifying the consciousness. I am elevating my consciousness to always remain on the transcendental platform while in the material world. And in the spiritual world, the entire spiritual world is completely on the spiritual plane. So there is no question of any touch of matter in the spiritual world. But in the material world, everything is tainted by the touch of the matter. Even our body, material body, means it's the touch of matter, so we have to elevate ourselves to the spiritual platform and remain there. If we remain on the spiritual platform always, we are also transcendentally situated like

#### Yudhishthira's Inquiries, Liberated Souls, Eternal Associates

**Key Quote:** "all are liberated souls, eternal associates of the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Yudhishthira's inquiries about Krishna's associates and sons, explaining that the Yadavas and Pandavas are liberated souls and eternal associates of Krishna.

Krishna, and that is exactly what is called as Krishna consciousness. King Yudhishthira, while inquiring about the Lord's sons and grandsons at Dwaraka, mentioned only the chieftains among them, for it was impossible for him to remember all the names of the Lord's family members, 1 million 610,000. He did not mention, he just remembered, he is mentioned the chief chieftains. Verses 32 and 33, they are together. I'll read them both. tathai vanu chara shaure, sruta devodhavadayah, sunanda nanda shirsanya, ye chandye sattvatar shabhaah, api swasti asate sarve, rama krishna bhujaashrayah, api smaranti kushalam, asmakam baddha savrindaya. The meaning of these two verses is given together also, shruta Deva with dhaba and others, Nanda Sunanda and other leaders of liberated souls who are constant companions of the Lord, are protected by Lord Valerian and Krishna, are they all doing well in the respective functions? Do they, who are all eternally bound in friendship with us, remember our welfare? These are Yudhishthira's inquiries to Arjuna, because Arjuna has written from Dvārakā. So in the parport Śrīla Prabhupāda explains, The constant companions of Lord Kṛṣṇa, such as Uddhava, are all liberated souls, and they descended along with Lord Kṛṣṇa to this material world to fulfill the mission of the Lord. The Pāṇḍavas are also liberated souls who descended along with Lord Kṛṣṇa to serve Him in His transcendental pastimes on this earth. So both the Yadavas, in Dvārakā, and the Pāṇḍavas in Hastināpura, all are liberated souls, eternal associates of the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa.

#### Vishnu Tattva vs. Jiva Tattva, Dependence on Krishna, Protection of the Lord

**Verse References:** BG 4.8
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Dependence on Krishna. That is the best dependence."
**Summary:** This segment differentiates between Vishnu Tattva and Jiva Tattva, emphasizing the dependence of Jiva Tattva on Krishna for protection and the eternal servitude of liberated souls.

As stated in the Bhagavad Gita, 4th chapter, 8th verse, The Lord and His eternal associates, who are also liberated souls like the Lord, come down on this earth at certain intervals. The Lord remembers them all but His associates, although liberated souls, do not forget, due to their being tatastha shakti or marginal potency of the Lord. Just like in the 4th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita it is said, Arjuna, he forgot that he had appeared with Krishna several times before. He had forgotten that, whereas Krishna remembers all of them. And that is very clearly explained in the 4th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. That is the difference between the Viṣṇu Tattva and Jīva Tattva. We belong to Jīva Tattva. Krishna, Vāsudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Narayana, Balarāma, Rāma, Narsimha, Varāha, all belong to Viṣṇu Tattva. They never forget anything, whereas we Jīva Tattva, we forget because of our tiny positioning. The Jīva Tattvas are infinitesimal potential particles of the Lord, and therefore they require the protection of the Lord at all times. And to the eternal servitors of the Lord, the Lord is pleased to give all protection at all times. The Lord is very pleased to give protection, and that is our position, dependence. Dependence on whom? Dependence on Krishna. That is the best dependence. That is eternal protection, dependence on Krishna. The liberated souls never therefore think themselves as free as the Lord. The Lord is completely free, completely independent, and the liberated souls, even though they are free from the touch of matter, they don't think themselves independent. They always seek the protection of the Lord in all circumstances, in the material world and in the spiritual world. In the spiritual world there is no question of seeking protection, but their attitude is, I want to be eternally under Krishna's shelter, Krishna's protection. This is the attitude of all devotees, all liberated souls.

**Key Quote:** "This dependence of the liberated soul is constitutional."
**Summary:** This segment uses the analogy of a spark and fire to illustrate the constitutional dependence of liberated souls on Krishna, warning against spiritual ignorance and the dangers of seeking independence from the Lord.

Now Srila Prabhupada explains a very important point. This dependence of the liberated soul is constitutional, for the liberated souls are like sparks of a fire that are able to exhibit the glow of fire along with the fire and not independently. This is the best example that can help us understand what is our active position. A spark of a blazing fire is very, very insignificant, tiny. But as long as the spark is in the fire, it will glow, like the fire. But the spark cannot independently glow when it is separated from the blazing fire. Independently, the glow of the spark is extinguished, although the quality of fire or the glowing is there, as spirit-soul. Our quality of spirit is actually not exhibited when we are separated from Krishna. Those who give up the protection of the Lord and become so-called Lords themselves, out of spiritual ignorance, come back again to the material world, even after prolonged tapasya of this severe type. That is the verdict of all Vedic literature.

**Key Quote:** "Being illusioned by false pleasures of the senses one becomes a servant of the senses."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts material and transcendental pleasure, explaining that attachment to sense gratification makes one a servant of the senses, and emphasizes the need for Krishna's protection.

इस material pleasure इन पिंट transcendental pleasure इस different सुख आध्यं तिकम् यत्तर् बुद्धि ग्राह्यम अतीण्ब्रियम is Bhagavad-gita description of transcendental pleasure. So Krishna gives transcendental pleasure to our spiritual senses or purified senses. Only the impure conditioned living being cannot derive any pleasure from the senses. Impure condition means under the influence of the three modes of material nature, and impure because the senses are contaminated by material contamination, a material conception, material desires, material loading over material nature, loading over material nature, independent material enjoyment. These are all the reasons why we are described as impure condition. So we cannot derive any pleasure from the senses. Being illusioned by false pleasures of the senses, one becomes a servant of the senses, go dasa. This is the description of the shastra. Go means senses, dasa means the servant. We all are servant of the senses. We seek out sense pleasures being driven by the senses demanding for pleasure pleasure by the senses demanding for pleasure pleasure pleasure pleasure by the senses demanding for pleasure pleasure pleasure pleasure material pleasure material pleasure material pleasure. Therefore we need his protection for our interest. We require Krishna's protection for our interest. The Lord is a protector of cows and the brahminical culture.

**Key Quote:** "Prosperity in our human society depends on two things cow protection cow should never be killed."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of cow protection and brahminical culture for societal prosperity, stating that those who neglect these principles are not under Krishna's direct protection, using the analogy of prisoners in jail.

Brahminical culture brahminical culture go brahmana hitaya go brahmana hitaya go brahmana hitaya. There's a description in the shastra. Namo brahmanya devaya go brahmana hitaya jagat hitaya krishna govindaya namo namah. Protector of cows and the brahminical culture. So society devoid of cow protection and brahminical culture is not under the direct protection of the Lord. Is छी होने की थुख है। Is मौसेद व천 society है। भौत खाल के पूर्ति ओर ब्रह्मनिया की वन्निमर दिखाई aparecer केहर, सभितिंगी, पहल्मिक्षणे से लगते हैं, उन्हें पूर्ति को लड़ना देमा नहीं नहीं करतीं and to the Brahminic culture and therefore such people who are not giving cow protection, who are not giving protection to Brahminic culture are described as not under the direct protection of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Just as Prabhupada gives an example to help us understand, the prisoners in the jails are not under the protection of the king, but under the protection of a severe agent of the king. It's like even in modern government arrangement, the citizens who are law-abiding are under direct protection of the government, but those who are law breakers and who are punished in jail, they are under the protection of the jail superintendent. And that is the arrangement. Without cow protection and cultivation of Brahminical qualities in human society, at least for a section of the members of society, no human civilization can prosper at any length. Prosperity in our human society depends on two things: cow protection. Cow should never be killed because they are similar to Krishna and they're very, very useful animals. Every part of the cow is used, every part of the cow.

**Summary:** The speaker continues on the usefulness of the cow, even after death, and then describes the qualities of a brahmana and how developing these qualities allows one to see the Lord.

It gives the most wonderful form of food, milk, cow's milk for human beings. And it's after the cow dies, even when it's living, cow urine and cow dung are very, very, very valuable for human society. So many ways cow dung and cow urine can be used by a civilized human being. And after the cow dies, natural death of course, then the cow hide, the cow skin is very, very useful. Then लोग शिक्षा में विचर बहुत नुपड़ि भी कर सकते हैं ... रूसिक सेum में बड़ा segundo विचर के स्थान में ये नहीं करते। Very, very useful, all of them are useful for human society. So cow is a wonderful animal, wonderful. So such a animal should never be killed by anybody. They should be protected to live their entire lifespan with nice care by human beings, by brahmanical culture. The development of the dormant qualities of goodness, namely truthfulness, equanimity, sense control, forbearance, simplicity, general knowledge, transcendental knowledge, and firm faith in the Vedic wisdom. These are the nine qualities by which brahmanas work. This is the transcendental qualities of the brahmanical culture. One can become a brahmana and thus see the Lord as he is. If we become, anybody can become a qualified brahmana simply by following the brahmanical principles and awaken the good qualities within by practicing brahmanical culture and then one can see the Lord as he is.

**Key Quote:** "After surpassing the brahmanical perfection one has to become a devotee of the lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that after achieving brahminical perfection, one must become a devotee to develop a loving relationship with Krishna as proprietor, master, friend, son, or lover.

And then one can see the Lord as he is. After surpassing the brahmanical perfection, one has to become a devotee of the Lord. So elevate yourself to the brahmanical platform, you become a brahmana with qualifications and then further elevate yourself to become a devotee to the transcendental platform. And then in the transcendental platform what happens? His loving affection in the form of proprietor, master, friend, son and lover can be transcendentally achieved. Krishna is related to every living being on the spiritual platform. So Krishna is related either as a transcendental proprietor, a transcendental master, a transcendental friend, a transcendental son, or a transcendental lover. These are the five kinds of relationships, primary relationships of Krishna which every living entity has on the spiritual platform that is being mentioned. The stage of a devotee which attracts the transcendental affection of the Lord does not

Of course, on the spiritual platform there is no question of any touch of any of the modes, neither goodness nor passion or ignorance. It's a transcendental state. But to come to the transcendental state, one has to first of all elevate oneself to the platform of goodness above rajoguna and tamoguna. These two base qualities, rajoguna and tamoguna or passion and ignorance are degrading our existence, human existence degrading. So one has to rise to the brahminical platform, the platform of goodness and then develop all the transcendental qualifications to come to the spiritual platform, vaishnava brahmana vaishnava. The Lord is inclined to a brahmana of quality, not of false prestige. Some people claim I'm a brahmana by birth though they don't have the qualities of a brahmana. Such brahmanas are not um not the special attention or subject to special attention of Krishna. Those who are not brahmana by quality simply claiming to brahmana doesn't attract the attention of the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of fire, wood, and earth to illustrate that a relationship with the Lord cannot be established without proper qualification, and concludes by stating that Maharaj Yudhishthir did not inquire about Krishna's welfare because Krishna is eternally perfect.

Those who are less than a brahmana by qualification cannot establish any relation with the Lord, just as fire cannot be kindled from the raw earth unless there is wood, although there is a relation between wood and the earth. So this is the example given in the first canto of the Bhagavatam in the second chapter. There is earth, there is wood and there is fire. So fire can be kindled in the wood when earth has been transformed into wood, firewood, only then fire can be kindled. Raw earth you cannot kindle a fire. Since the Lord is all perfect in himself, there could be, there could not be any question of his welfare. So Maharaj Yudhishthir did not inquire about the welfare of Krishna because the Lord is all perfect, is eternally the Supreme Lord. So there is no

In this session, we will be discussing two verses which are given together in the Srimad Bhagavatam, 35 and 36 verses of the 14th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Mangalaya Cha Lokanam Kshemaya Cha Bhavaya Cha Aaste Yadu Kulam Bodhav Adyo Ananta Sakha Pumaan Yad Bahudanda Guptayam Swapuryam Yadavor Chitaha Kshemaya Cha Bhavaya Cha Kreedanti Param Aanandam MahaPavuchika Iva. The meaning of these two verses given together: the original personality of godhead, the enjoyer, and Balaram, the primeval lord Ananta, are staying in the ocean of the Yadu dynasty for the welfare, protection, and general progress of the entire universe. See this description. Krishna and Balaram are staying in the Yadu dynasty for the welfare, protection, and general progress of the entire universe. That is the position of the Lord. The members of the Yadu dynasty, being protected by the arms of the Lord, are enjoying life like the residents of the spiritual sky.

**Key Quote:** "The personality of Godhead Vishnu resides within each and every Universe in two capacities namely as the garbhodaka shayi Vishnu and the kshirodhaka shayi Vishnu."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Prabhupada's explanation of the three forms of Vishnu in the material world: Garbhodaka Shayi Vishnu, Kshirodaka Shayi Vishnu, and Maha Vishnu, describing their roles and locations.

This completes the meaning of the two verses. Now Prabhupada explains elaborately the comparison made here. It's a beautiful comparison to help us understand how Krishna ultimately is the protector of all of us. In the Purport, Prabhupada says, as we have discussed many times, "The personality of Godhead Vishnu resides within each and every Universe in two capacities, namely as the Garbhodaka Shayi Vishnu and the Kshirodhaka Shayi Vishnu." If you remember, three Vishnu forms in the material existence, out of which two are within the universe, and one is outside all the universes. The outside of all the universes is Maha Vishnu, one supreme form, supreme Lord's form is Vishnu, one form. Whereas Garbhodaka Shai Vishnu, the number of forms of Garbhodaka Shai Vishnu are as many universes as there are. Garbhodaka Shai Vishnu enters into each universe. There are millions of universes. And Kshirodaka Shai Vishnu enters into the heart of every living being on each universe. Billions and trillions of living beings on each universe and billions and billions of universes. So we cannot count all this. It's all very, very, very large numbers. The Kshirodaka Shai Vishnu has his own universe, his own planet on the northern top of the universe. That's called Shwetadvipa. And there is a great ocean of milk. Shwetadvipa means ocean of milk. Dvipa means an island. An island is always in the middle of an ocean. Now, in this great ocean of milk, the Lord resides as Kshirodaka Shai Vishnu on the bed of the Ananta incarnation of Baladeva.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Yudhishthira has compared the Yadu dynasty to the ocean of milk, Shri Balaram to Ananta, where Lord Krishna resides."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Yudhishthira's comparison of the Yadu dynasty to the ocean of milk and the citizens of Dwarka to the inhabitants of Vaikuntha, then describes the immense size and layers of coverings of the universe and the causal ocean.

Vishnu resides on the bed of Anantadeva, Anantashayana. He is also called the Anantashayana Lord. Thus Maharaj Yudhishthira has compared the Yadu dynasty to the ocean of milk, Shri Balaram to Ananta, where Lord Krishna resides. He has compared the citizens of Dwarka to the liberated inhabitants of the Vaikuntha lokas. You see the comparison done by Yudhishthira so beautifully explained by Prabhupada. So Prabhupada says about the Vaikuntha lokas, he says, beyond the material sky, further than we can see with our eyes, material sky we can see with our naked eyes, but beyond that and beyond the sevenfold coverings of the universe, each universe. The universe consisting of millions of planets has got several coverings, seven layers of coverings. The coverings are very, very, very, very big. If you consider the entire universe as a huge ball, then if the diameter of our universe is described as four billion miles, diameter of the universe. Now, the thickness of the first layer of covering of the universe is ten times the diameter of the universe. That means it is forty billion miles thick. Forty billion miles thick, the first covering. The second covering over the first covering is ten times thicker than the first covering. So, if the first covering is forty billion miles thick, the second covering is four hundred billion miles thick. So, we cannot even imagine how thick the coverings are and progressively the coverings keep on becoming thicker, thicker, ten times more, ten times more, ten times more than the previous covering. So, the second covering is four hundred billion miles thick. The third covering is four thousand billion miles thick. And then for forty thousand billion miles like that, it goes, it's very, very thick covering. So, beyond these coverings, there is the causal ocean in which all the universes are floating like footballs. So, just imagine this situation of this supreme Lord in the spiritual world. Just try to imagine by these descriptions. We are tiny beings

on this insignificant earth planet among millions of planets in the universe. And the universe is one insignificant universe among millions of universes in the entire material creation. And the entire material creation itself with all the universes and each universe with all the planets and each planet with all the living beings is one insignificant portion of the spiritual sky. So beyond all this, there is the causal ocean in the spiritual sky, one corner of the spiritual sky, there is causal ocean. In that ocean these universes are floating like footballs. Beyond the causal ocean, there is an unlimited span of spiritual sky. Beyond the causal ocean. And that is generally known as the effulgence of Brahman, Brahmajyoti. In Sanskrit, it's called Brahmajyoti. In English it is called Effulgence of Brahman. Within this effulgence, effulgence means that glow, within this effulgence, there are innumerable spiritual planets and they are known as Vaikuntha planets. Vaikuntha means where there is no anxiety, where there is no misery, where there is no suffering, where there is no material inebriety, no material imperfection, perfect spiritual situation. So each and every Vaikuntha planet is many many times bigger than the biggest universe within the material world. So how can we even conceive what is the spiritual world? We can't even conceive, it is inconceivable. At least accept it is inconceivable by these descriptions, factual descriptions. And in each and every one of them, each and every one of the Vaikuntha planets, there is no deity. There are innumerable inhabitants who look exactly like Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu in his four-handed form is there in every Vaikuntha planet as the predominating deity. There are many many many many inhabitants, they are all devotees, pure devotees. They all have forms which look exactly like Lord Vishnu. These inhabitants are known as the Mahapaulukas.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Yudhishthira has compared the inhabitants of Dwarka to the Mahapaulukas of Vaikuntha loka, because even in Dwarka, all the citizens are so happy with the Lord and the Lord is happy."
**Summary:** The speaker further describes the Mahapaulukas and the qualities of life in Vaikuntha, contrasting it with the miseries of the material world and highlighting the happiness of the citizens of Dwarka in the presence of Krishna and Balarama.

So, that reference was made by Yudhishthira, comparing the citizens of Dwarka to Mahapaulukas. So, who are these Mahapaulukas? They are the inhabitants of the Vaikuntha lokas. Now, these Mahapaulukas are called as persons directly engaged in the service of the Lord in his personal abode. They are happy in those planets and are without any kind of misery. And they live perpetually in full youthfulness, enjoying life in full bliss and knowledge, without fear of birth, death, old age or disease, and without the influence of Kala or eternal time. So, material world means full of miseries, fundamental miseries – birth, death, disease, old age – full of the influence of Kala, eternal time. So, time destroys everything systematically, whatever was created in this material world. That influence of time is not there in the spiritual world. That influence of the four miseries, fundamental miseries, is not there in the spiritual world. Maharaj Yudhishthira has compared the inhabitants of Dwarka to the Mahapaulukas of Vaikuntha loka, because even in Dwarka, all the citizens are so happy with the Lord and the Lord is happy. Just like the Mahapaulukas are eternally happy, even the citizens of Dwarka are happy in the Dwarka city, living with Krishna and Balarama. In the Bhagavad Gita, there are many references to Vaikuntha lokas and they are mentioned there as Madhama or the kingdom of the Lord. In the Bhagavad Gita, there is a reference to Vaikuntha loka, not directly mentioned as Vaikuntha. But Krishna says, yad gatva na nivartante tad dhama paramam mama – having gone where one never returns to this material world of repeated birth and death, but lives in the spiritual world with Krishna or with Narayana or with Vishnu, eternal life full of bliss and knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "That is described by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita as his supreme abode because every place belongs to Krishna, even the material world belongs to Krishna because it is a part of his material energy."
**Summary:** The speaker references the Bhagavad Gita to describe Vaikuntha as the supreme abode of Krishna, an eternal existence beyond the material world, and concludes the lecture.

That is described by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita as his supreme abode because every place belongs to Krishna, even the material world belongs to Krishna because it is a part of his material energy – his material energy. All energies are his – Krishna's. So material world also is Krishna's but it is an inferior place. Krishna does not reside here permanently. He sometimes comes to this world, to attract all of us to go back to him in his personal abode, supreme abode, mad-dhama. So that's the description of the Bhagavad Gita. Parastasmat bhavo anyo avyakto avyaktatsanatanah. Beyond vyakta and avyakta, beyond manifest and unmanifest matter, there is an eternal existence. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita in the 8th chapter, yad gatva nani vartante tad dhama param amma. So that is the supreme abode of the Supreme Lord described in the Bhagavad Gita briefly, but details are given in the Bhagavad Gita and other scriptures.

**Summary:** Krishna's devotees are protected from fear and enjoy the best things because of Krishna's affection.

And that is explained by Prabhupāda in the purport. Śrīla Prabhupāda says those who are directly servitors of the Lord are protected by the Lord from all fearfulness and they also enjoy the best of things even if they are forcibly accumulated. Krishna's devotees have a very special position. This material world is characterized by fear. Every conditioned soul has got four characteristics, eating, sleeping, fearing, and mating. So everyone has got the fear of death. And before death comes, there is always the fear of suffering. There is always some other danger from some unknown enemy or so-called enemy. There is always the fear of losing one's possessions. Like this, there are so many different types of fears in this material existence. But those who are directly serving Krishna, they are always protected by Krishna because of which they are always fearless. And they are able to enjoy the best of things under all circumstances.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is also called devotee. Bhakta vatsala. He is specially affectionate towards his pure devotees."
**Summary:** Krishna is especially affectionate to devotees, and Dwaraka was enriched with the best things, surpassing even the heavenly assembly house Sudharma.

So Śrīla Prabhupāda further says, the Lord is equal in behavior to all living beings, but he is partial to his pure devotees, being very affectionate toward them. Krishna is also called devotee. Bhakta vatsala. He is specially affectionate towards his pure devotees. The city of Dvārakā was flourishing, being enriched with the best of things in the material world. The city of Dvārakā was on the earth planet. And earth is in the middle planetary system. The upper planetary system, all the planets have millions of times better facilities for their residents. But the city of Dvārakā, even though on the earth planet, it was special because it was enriched with the best things in the entire material universe. The state assembly house is constructed according to the dignity of the particular state. In heavenly planets, the state assembly house, called Sudharma, was deserving of the place of worship of the best of the demigods. The demigods are all controllers on behalf of Krishna in this material world. So they are exotic personalities who have got a very special state assembly house called Sudharma. Such an assembly house is never meant for any state on the globe on this earth planet because the human being on the earth is unable to construct it however far a particular state may be materially advanced.

**Summary:** The Yadu dynasty brought the Sudharma assembly house to Dwaraka to please Krishna, demonstrating pure devotion.

We cannot match the opulence or the grandeur of the state assembly hall in the heavenly planets. We can never do that. But during the time of Lord Krishna, Lord Krishna's presence on the earth, the members of the Yadu dynasty forcibly brought the celestial assembly house to earth and placed it at Dwaraka. The members of the Yadu family, they are all related with Krishna. So they want to please Krishna by offering the best of everything. So when they saw that, the assembly house in the heavenly planets is very, very grand. So they decided to forcibly bring it and offer it to Krishna. They are not desiring that we want to enjoy. No. It's for Krishna's pleasure.

**Key Quote:** "They were able to use such force because they were certain of the indulgence and protection of the Supreme Lord Krishna."
**Summary:** Devotees serve Krishna with the best offerings, and Krishna reciprocates by providing protection and fearlessness.

That's a characteristic of a pure devotee. They were able to use such force because they were certain of the indulgence and protection of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Krishna is affectionate to his devotees. Affectionate to his devotees means when the devotees require any protection, then Krishna is always ready to give them such protection. In other words, the Lord is provided with the best things in the universe by his pure devotees. Pure devotees serve Krishna out of their heart. And they want to offer Krishna only the very best things in the entire creation. So they will go to any length to actually please Krishna by such offerings. Again, we should remember Krishna is not in need of any of these offerings. He is completely independent. He is full of all opulences. He is not in need of anything. But, the Lord is not in need of anything except as a token of their love for them. Love for Krishna. Lord Krishna was provided with all kinds of comforts and facilities available within the universe by the members of the Yadu dynasty. Whatever the best things that are anywhere in the universe, the Yadu dynasty members, they would go there and fetch it for Krishna, for offering to Krishna. And in return, such servitors of the Lord were protected and fearless. Krishna reciprocates with his devotees. And in this case, Krishna assured them protection.

**Key Quote:** "A forgetful, conditioned soul is fearful. That's our position now."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the difference between a conditioned soul, who is fearful due to forgetfulness of Krishna, and a liberated soul, who is fearless.

Because of it, they became fearless. Now, something important that Srila Prabhupada explains for us, all of us, in this present condition. Srila Prabhupada says, A forgetful, conditioned soul is fearful. That's our position now. We are forgetful of Krishna. And therefore, we have become conditioned. Conditioned means, we have got a material body. And this material body is made up of the material elements. It is subject to the material modes of nature. And we are forced to think in a certain way, work in a certain way, act in a certain way, relate with things in a certain way. All this is called conditioning. And it is a cause for our fear in this material world. But a liberated soul is never fearful. One who is liberated is never fearful. Because a liberated soul knows, I am not this body. I don't belong to this material world. I belong to spiritual world. In this spiritual world, I have a spiritual form. So therefore, the conditioned soul is fearful. And the liberated soul is fearless.

#### Fearlessness, Illusion, Eternal relation with the Lord
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/iNNL1IRLF6w?t=676
**Verse References:** BG 2.12
**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Just as a small child, completely dependent on the mercy of his father, is never fearful of anyone."
**Summary:** Fear is an illusion arising from forgetting our eternal relationship with the Lord, similar to a child's fearlessness due to dependence on their father.

Now Prabhupada gives an example. Just as a small child, completely dependent on the mercy of his father, is never fearful of anyone. So there are instances in the scriptures, where, it is described that, a child, depending on the father, is completely fearless, because of the protection of the father. Similarly, it is explained here, fearfulness is a sort of illusion for the living being. Fear comes out of the effect of the illusion. The effect of the illusory energy. And how does the illusory energy work? The living being, when he is in slumber, slumber means when he is sleeping, and forgetting his eternal relation with the Lord, is actually affected by fear. So fear is a sort of illusion. And fear afflicts every conditioned soul at different times. Since the living being is never to die by his constitution, as stated in Bhagavad Gita, You don't take birth, you don't die. Then, what is the cause of fearfulness?

#### Bodily conception, Illusion, Fear of death

**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Fearfulness is due to forgetting the eternal relation with the Lord."
**Summary:** Fearfulness arises from identifying with the body and forgetting our eternal nature, leading to the fear of death.

So, fearfulness is due to forgetting the eternal relation with the Lord. As soon as we are placed in a material body, we think in terms of the body only. So, a body has taken birth on a certain date, that date is ascribed to the soul, or to the real person. The real person does not take birth, does not die. That's the truth, that's the reality. But, people under illusion, they forget, and they keep on trying and trying and trying to come out of this illusion, but they cannot easily come out. So, in the Bhagavad Gita it is explained, since the living being is never to die by his constitution, as stated in Bhagavad Gita, then what is the cause of fearfulness? If we are never meant to die, why should we be afraid of death? That is because of a bodily conception. Everybody thinks in terms of normal people, they think in terms of body.

**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "This is just like, Prabhupada gives an example, in a dream a person may see, while sleeping, in a dream he may see a tiger."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of a dream, the speaker explains that fear is an illusion, and by being awake in service to the Lord, like the Yadu dynasty, one can overcome fear.

They do not know anything about the spirit. This is just like, Prabhupada gives an example, in a dream a person may see, while sleeping, in a dream he may see a tiger. Now, this tiger in the dream is actually an effect of illusion, because there is no real tiger. For the person who is awake, the tiger does not exist, what the sleeping man is seeing in a dream. So, the person dreaming and the person awake, both are actually, for both of them there is no tiger. But the person who has forgotten his external position, in the sleep, for him the tiger in the dream is very, very fearsome. And for the person who is awake, it is not fearful. So, when this person who is dreaming wakes up, he also becomes free from the fear, because he sees there is no tiger. Similarly, Prabhupada says, the members of the Yadu dynasty were fully awake in their service to the Lord, and therefore there was no fear for them. And even if, in the wakeful state also, there is some cause for fear, the Lord was always there to protect them completely. That was their position.

**Key Quote:** "Please tell me whether your health is all right? You appear to have lost your bodily lust."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verses to be discussed (SB 1.14.39-41) and focuses on verse 39, explaining Yudhishthira's inquiry to Arjuna about his well-being and apparent loss of bodily luster, questioning if it's due to disrespect or neglect during his stay in Dwaraka.

In this session, we will be discussing verses 39, 40, and 41 of the 14th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 39th verse: Kachitte Anamayam Tata Bhrashta Teja Vibhasime Alabdha Mano Avagyataha Kimbatata Chiroshitaha. This is a verse spoken by Yudhishthira to Arjuna. Yudhishthira is addressing Arjuna, "My dear brother Arjuna, please tell me, is your health all right? You appear to have lost your bodily lust. Is this due to others disrespecting and neglecting you because of your long stay at Dwaraka?" This is a question raised by Yudhishthira. See, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "From all angles of vision, Maharaj Yudhishthira inquired from Arjuna about the welfare of Dwaraka, but he concluded at last that as long as Lord Sri Krishna himself was there, nothing inauspicious could happen. But at the same time, Arjuna appeared to be bereft of his bodily lust, and thus, the king inquired of his personal welfare and asked so many vital questions." This is a question raised by Yudhishthira to Arjuna.

#### charity, promise, despondency
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/ad62gGX5cQ0?t=167
**Verse References:** SB 1.14.40
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Has someone addressed you with unfriendly words? or threatened you could you not give charity to one who asked or could you not keep your promise to someone"
**Summary:** The speaker explains verse 40, elaborating on potential reasons for Arjuna's dejection, such as being addressed with unfriendly words, failing to give charity, or breaking a promise, highlighting the importance of fulfilling obligations and the consequences of failing to do so.

The meaning of these verses… Has someone addressed you with unfriendly words or threatened you? Could you not give charity to one who asked, or could you not keep your promise to someone? These are all different reasons why a respectable personality becomes very depressed or dejected or very unhappy. So Yudhishthira is trying to find out what is the cause for Arjuna's dejection. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "A kshatriya or a rich man is sometimes visited by persons who are in need of money. When they are asked for a donation, it is a duty of the possessor of wealth to give charity in consideration of the person, place, and time. If a kshatriya or a rich man fails to comply with this obligation, he must be very sorry for this discrepancy. Similarly, one should not fail to keep his promise to give in charity. These discrepancies are sometimes causes of despondency, and thus, failing, a person becomes subjected to criticism, which might also be the cause of Arjuna's plight," Yudhishthira is trying to guess. So one should never go back on one's promise made to somebody to give charity; that is a very important culture. And if somebody does default, then there is such a problem. The person is subject to criticism. So Arjuna is being questioned by Yudhishthira, "Did you undergo any humiliation like that?"

**Summary:** The speaker discusses verse 41, focusing on the five categories of individuals (brahmanas, children, cows, women, and the diseased) who deserve protection, emphasizing Arjuna's role as a protector and questioning if he failed to provide shelter to those in need.

The 41st verse, kachit tvam bramanam balam gaam vriddham roginam striyam sharanopasrtham sattvam na atyakshi sharanapradah. The meaning of this verse is, "You are always the protector of the deserving living beings such as brahmanas, children, cows, women, and the diseased." Five categories of personalities are mentioned here who deserve protection. Who are they? The brahmanas, the children, the cows, the women, and the diseased people. So the question being raised, "Could you not give them protection when they approached you for shelter?"

**Key Quote:** "The brahmanas who are always engaged in researching knowledge for the society's welfare work both materially and spiritually deserve the protection of the king in all respects."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the importance of protecting brahmanas, children, cows, women, and the diseased, explaining the role of brahmanas in society's welfare and the king's responsibility to provide special protection to these vulnerable groups for the prosperity and peace of the state.

In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The brahmanas, who are always engaged in researching knowledge for the society's welfare work, both materially and spiritually, deserve the protection of the king in all respects." What is the position of a brahmana? Prabhupada is explaining. Why are these five categories singled out specifically for the protection of the king? To be given protection by the king, why? So, one by one, Prabhupada will explain. The brahmanas, they are always engaged in society's welfare work, and what kind of welfare activity do they perform? They are researching knowledge for society's welfare. They are conversant with the Vedas, and therefore they apply the Vedic principles and teach us. So such brahmanas have to be protected by the king. Similarly, the children of the state, the cow, the diseased person, the woman, and the old man specifically require the protection of the state or a chatriya king. They have to be given special protection, not the ordinary one. If such living beings do not get protection by the chatriya or the royal order or by the state, it is certainly shameful for the chatriya or the state. So they deserve to get protection, and the king should be giving them protection.

Then only there will be prosperity and peace in the state, at the state level. If such things had actually happened to Arjuna, Maharaja Yudhishthira was anxious to know about these discrepancies. So these were the different questions raised by Yudhishthira in questioning Arjuna. What is the cause of Arjuna's dejection, unprecedented? So, in different ways, he is questioning just to ascertain that. Is it really true that Krishna has departed to his personal abode, has left the earth planet? Is it true? That is what Yudhishthira is trying to ascertain, and before he concludes anything, he is trying to pacify.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the advanced and cultured nature of the society, emphasizing the importance of respecting great personalities and the significance of bodily luster as a sign of spiritual strength, contrasting it with the lack of such luster in ordinary or materially intelligent people.

And wants to ascertain the actual facts of the case. So the society was a very evolved society. It was not that people were living in an uncivilized way or primitive way. No. It was a highly cultured society. The indications are very clear here. If a great personality is disrespected, then it is a cause for great concern because the society was very, very well organized, and people were properly trained how to respect great personalities, and it was meticulously followed by everyone. The society was an evolved society. So therefore Arjuna appears to have lost his bodily luster. We do not know what is bodily luster in Kali Yuga. Such bodily luster is seen in persons who have got the strength of God's grace, the strength of doing some tapasya, some voluntary penance, and then they develop a certain spiritual bodily luster. Such luster is not seen among ordinary people or even externally intelligent, materially intelligent people. You cannot see such luster.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the potential humiliation Arjuna might have faced and the importance of respectful interactions, warning that a lack of respect leads to societal degradation and hinders spiritual progress.

It is only to be seen in transcendentalists. It is also said here that Arjuna is such a great personality, but somebody threatens Arjuna or addresses him with unfriendly words, that is a cause of great concern. Even though Arjuna is powerful, he does not want to utilize his power for some ordinary purposes. So therefore the questions are being raised to find out whether Arjuna's cause of dejection is something that happened while Arjuna was returning home to Hastinapura from Dwarka. Did somebody threaten you? Did they address you with unfriendly words? That means in the Vedic culture, people greet each other in a very respectable way because the culture is very advanced. Whereas if somebody is not showing the proper due respect for another person, the society

becomes gradually degraded. So you will go to degradation, and loss of such values means people cannot properly practice spiritual life. Spiritual life is always on a foundation of values. You just can't make a show of some ritual and become a spiritually advanced person; that never works. So all the devotees, they are always transiently situated, which means they are untouched by the inferior energy. So therefore they can actually live in the society in a dignified way. Otherwise, it becomes very difficult for civilized people to interact with others who may not be civilized. So therefore, in the former times, the society was properly divided, and people used to follow the principles very strictly, and therefore the culture was very, very advanced. That is what is...

**Key Quote:** "Everybody who is conditioned is prone to cheat others."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Prabhupada's point about the four defects of a conditioned soul, emphasizing the propensity to cheat as the most prominent.

So this is considered as a very serious matter by Yudhishthira, who was perfectly ruling and everybody was living very happily. There was plenty of all supplies by nature, mother nature. But when Yudhishthira started seeing symptoms of some irregularities, then he suspected maybe it is because the Supreme Lord has disappeared from the face of the earth. So in the purport, Prabhupada explains this particular point about cheating. Particularly, a conditioned living being is endowed with four principles of malpractice. This is explained in the Chaitanya Charitamrita, Prabhupada is quoting from Chaitanya Charitamrita: four defects of every conditioned soul in this material existence. What are they? Errors, insanity, inability, and cheating. Everybody who is conditioned is prone to make mistakes. Everybody who is conditioned is prone to cheat others. Everybody who is conditioned is prone to have defective senses, and that is inability. And everybody who is conditioned is subject to illusion. These are signs of imperfection. And out of the four, the propensity to cheat others is most prominent among all the defects and the conditions of all this. This particular defect of cheating propensity is very prominent.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the unnatural desire to lord over material nature as the root cause of the cheating propensity in conditioned souls, contrasting it with the pure state of eternal servitude to Krishna.

This cheating practice is there in the conditioned souls because the conditioned souls are primarily in the material world imbued with an unnatural desire to lord it over the material world. It's unnatural for us, but something unnatural that we all have as conditioned souls is the desire to lord over material nature. A living being in his pure state is not conditioned by the laws because in his pure state he is conscious that a living being is eternally subservient to the supreme being. Eternally we are servants. And in our unconditioned state, in our spiritual state of existence, in our pure state of existence, we are conscious that I am eternally servant of Krishna. And thus it is always good for him to remain subservient instead of falsely trying to lord it over the property of the supreme lord. The supreme lord is a factual proprietor, the factual master, factual controller everywhere of everything. But if we artificially try to control,

**Key Quote:** "Only under illusion somebody may think I am the master. Therefore he becomes the victim of all kinds of cheating."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how the illusion of being the master leads to victimization and cheating, even within close relationships.

then that is an unnatural desire. That's a defective state of existence. In the conditioned state, the living being is not satisfied even if he actually becomes the lord of all that he surveys. Let's say under illusion, somebody thinks I am the master of my family, or somebody thinks I am the master of my factory, or I am the master of my business. He thinks like that. He thinks he has become the lord, but actually he never becomes the lord because the supreme lord, Krishna, remains the master. And only under illusion somebody may think I am the master. Therefore he becomes the victim of all kinds of cheating. We are victimized actually under the influence of illusion. To wrongly think or to falsely think I am the master, I have to indulge in cheating others, even with his nearest and most intimate relations, he engages in all kinds of cheating, even with the nearest and dearest ones, so called near and dear ones.

**Key Quote:** "All these contending difficulties can be mitigated by one process... and that is the devotional service of the Supreme Lord Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker presents devotional service to Krishna as the solution to the problems of cheating and disharmony, quoting Prabhupada's conclusion that it's the only effective counteraction to hypocrisy.

In such an unsatisfactory state of affairs, there is no harmony even between father and sons or between husband and wife. It is expected, at least in a cultured, civilized family life, it is expected that husband and wife, there will be good understanding, good cooperation in the interest of the family, or between father and sons. Because father is very affectionate and he takes good care of his own sons, so there should be good dealings naturally between father and sons. But because of this cheating propensity, the relationship is not always cordial. But one important thing Srila Prabhupada says here, but all these contending difficulties can be mitigated by one process. Is there a solution to these problems? Prabhupada says, yes, there is one solution. What is that? And that is the devotional service of the Supreme Lord Krishna. So, it is devotional service only that can mitigate this difficulty of cheating and all other kinds of defects of the conditioned soul. So, Srila Prabhupada concludes this by saying, the world of hypocrisy can be checked only by counteraction through devotional service to the Lord and nothing else. There is no other solution that works. Factually, only this works: counteraction through engaging in pure devotional service.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Yudhishthira's observation of disparities and his conclusion about the disappearance of Krishna, leading to the prevalence of negative qualities.

Maharaj Yudhishthira, having observed the disparities, conjectured the disappearance of the Lord from the earth. This is Yudhishthira Maharaj's observation and conclusion, only because Krishna is no longer present on the surface of the earth. The fifth verse, nimittani atyarishtani kale tvanugate nirunam lobhadi adharma prakritim drushtvo vachanujam drupah The meaning of this verse is, in course of time, it came to pass that people in general became accustomed to greed, anger, pride, etc. Initially the symptoms started appearing at a certain point in time and in course of time people became used to it as if it's normal. Then Maharaj Yudhishthira, observing all these omens, spoke to his younger brother.

**Key Quote:** "Such a pious king as Maharaj Yudhishthira at once became perturbed when there were such inhuman symptoms as greed, anger, irreligiosity and hypocrisy rampant in society."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Yudhishthira was perturbed by the emergence of negative qualities, indicating their absence during Krishna's presence and the beginning of Kali Yuga.

So next few verses will describe what did Yudhishthira speak to his younger brother. In the purport Srila Prabhupada explains, such a pious king as Maharaj Yudhishthira at once became perturbed when there were such inhuman symptoms as greed, anger, irreligiosity, and hypocrisy rampant in society. He just started seeing such symptoms and he became perturbed. That means they were used to a civilized society where all these things were absent. So when they started appearing, these symptoms of greed and anger and irreligiosity, Yudhishthira Maharaj became perturbed. It appears from this statement that all these symptoms of degraded society were unknown to the people of the time. And when Krishna was present, Yudhishthira Maharaj and all the people, they did not know what is greed, what is anger. It was astonishing for them to have experienced them with the advent of the Kali Yuga or the age of quarrel.

**Summary:** The speaker connects the beginning of Kali Yuga with Krishna's departure, highlighting Krishna's purpose of reducing the burden of the earth and the subsequent emergence of negative symptoms.

You see, it is said, elsewhere it is said, the beginning of Kali Yuga is when the day Krishna disappeared from this earth after winding up his earthly pastimes. When Krishna comes, he comes with his associates, with his abode, with his paraphernalia, with his entourage, and he stays for a certain time, duration of time. One hundred twenty-five years Krishna stayed and performed his wonderful Leela in Vrindavan, Mathura, and Dwaraka. And also he traveled to other places like Hastinapura, Mithila, so many other places. And Kurukshetra, he traveled to Kurukshetra. So he performed his pastimes and when his pastimes are over, time is up, then he went back to his personal abode, Krishnae Swadhamopagati, that was explained earlier, that as long as Krishna was there, everything was very nice. And Krishna had come to reduce the burden of the earth, which was overburdened by demoniac persons posing as kings and oppressing saintly persons and innocent people, unnecessarily. So Krishna came, he reduced the burden of the earth and Krishna went back. But when Krishna went back, Kali Yuga began. It was the end of Dwapara Yuga when Krishna came, but Dwapara Yuga is finished when Krishna left. Kali Yuga began, and the symptoms of Kali Yuga are mentioned here.

#### Bad omens, Arjuna's dejection, Vedic culture, Free mixing of men and women

**Key Quote:** "This free mixing of men and women is not at all good. It results in so many anomalies."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Yudhishthira's questioning of Arjuna regarding his dejection and Srila Prabhupada's explanation of Vedic culture concerning free contact between men and women.

been seeing some bad omens indicating something undesirable is going to happen, and he is anxiously waiting for Arjuna to return. And even as he is discussing these bad omens with Bhima, Arjuna returns, and then immediately Yudhishthira begins asking Arjuna so many questions: what is the cause for Arjuna's dejection? And Arjuna is just not speaking, and Yudhishthira is asking him so many questions, so his questioning continues. Yudhishthira's questioning Arjuna continues till the end of this chapter, we are almost at the end. So this 42nd verse: Kachitvam Nagamo Agamyam Gamyam Vasat Kritaam Striyam Parajito Vatha Bhavan Notamair Nasamai Pathi. The meaning of this verse is, have you contacted a woman of impeachable character, or have you not properly treated a deserving woman? Or have you been defeated on the other hand, by someone who is inferior or equal to you? Yudhishthira is trying to find out what is the cause for Arjuna's dejection, so different reasons he is offering. And Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport a very important aspect of the Vedic culture. It appears from this verse that during the time of the Pandavas, free contact between man and woman was allowed in certain conditions only. We are living in the present time, where there is too much of free contact between men and women, and that is not very good for the society, for the proper upkeep of the society. This free mixing of men and women is not at all good. It results in so many anomalies.

#### Caste system, Respect for women, Seven mothers, Uttama and Adhama contact

**Key Quote:** "The wife of a Brahmana is considered one of the seven mothers."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the Vedic social structure, explaining the rules regarding contact between men and women of different castes, emphasizing the respect due to certain women, particularly the wife of a Brahmana.

So Srila Prabhupada explains this further. The higher caste men, namely the Brahmanas and Kshatriyas, could accept a woman of the Vaishya or the Shudra community. But a man from the lower caste could not contact a woman of the higher caste. Even a Kshatriya could not contact a woman of the Brahmana caste. Why? Why is this so? That is explained by Prabhupada in the next sentence of this purport. The wife of a Brahmana is considered one of the seven mothers. This is a Vedic conception. There are seven mothers who are all respectable by everyone. Who are the seven mothers? One's own mother, the wife of the spiritual master or teacher, the wife of a Brahmana, the wife of a king, the cow, the nurse, and the earth. We say mother earth, mother cow. So these are the seven mothers in the Vedic conception of mother. And mother means everyone respects, everyone offers respect. So therefore, that is the reason a Kshatriya could not contact a woman of the Brahmana caste. This we are talking about openly mixing. That is not allowed. Out of respect. It is not a question of curtailing some freedom. No. It is out of respect. Please understand this point. Such contact between man and woman was known as uttama or adhama. Contact of a Brahmana with a Kshatriya woman is uttama. But the contact of a Kshatriya with a Brahmana woman is adhama and therefore condemned.

#### Varana-sankara population, Undesirable progeny, Code of conduct, Independent enjoyment vs. Krishna consciousness

**Key Quote:** "Undesirable progeny results from improper mixing."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the consequences of improper mixing of men and women, leading to undesirable progeny, and contrasts the pursuit of independent enjoyment with the satisfaction found in Krishna consciousness.

And in the scriptures it is also described, if there is improper mixing of man and woman, there is what is called as varana-sankara population. This means that the child is not a good person. Undesirable progeny results from improper mixing. The children born will not be having good character. So there is a very great science behind this, behind the rules that are given, given for mixing between men and women. So to produce a good population, it is necessary that men and women follow the code of conduct for mixing with each other. A woman approaching a man for contact should never be refused. But at the same time, the discretion as above mentioned may also be considered. See how carefully the rules are laid down in the dharma shastras. The idea is the whole material existence is a chance for the living beings to try to enjoy independently and become realized that independent enjoyment will never give the desired satisfaction. That is the point. It will never give the desired satisfaction. It will never give the desired happiness that we are seeking as spirit souls. So such real happiness and real satisfaction is only available in our association with Krishna, because Krishna is the reservoir of pure transcendental bliss to an unlimited extent. Therefore, Krishna can fully satisfy us, Krishna can fully make us happy beyond even our capacity, beyond our expectation.

**Key Quote:** "A woman approaching a man for contact should never be refused."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Vedic literature guides individuals on how to approach Krishna and develop a loving relationship with Him, while also emphasizing the importance of discretion in interactions between men and women, stating that a woman approaching a man should not be refused.

Only possible for Krishna. Therefore, the whole Vedic literature is guiding us. The Vedic rules, regulations, directions, restrictions, everything is guiding us how we can actually approach Krishna. You see in the pages of the Bhagavatam, in the entire Bhagavad Gita, in all the dharma shastras, there is every instance that is explained there in the scriptures is how each one of us can actually approach Krishna, and by proper contact with Krishna we can develop the loving relationship with him, and in this regard everyone is encouraged. There is no question of some people being denied the opportunity. Nobody is denied the opportunity. So therefore, it says here a woman approaching a man for contact should never be refused. This is a very, very important point. A woman should not be refused. But at the same time there is a certain discretion that one has to apply. Who is the woman who is approaching and who is the man who is being approached. And men cannot approach women freely. Women freely at all. Men cannot approach women freely at all. A woman may approach a man, but man cannot approach a woman.

#### Examples from Bhagavatam and Mahabharata, Uttama and Adama contact, Regulative principles, Good quality population

**Key Quote:** "The result of the contact between man and woman is natural because the way nature has made these mind-body systems a man is attracted to woman and a woman is attracted to a man but that also must be carried out under regulative principles."
**Summary:** The speaker provides examples from the Bhagavatam and Mahabharata to illustrate the principles of Uttama and Adama contact, emphasizing the need for regulative principles to ensure a good quality population.

This is civilized society. Now examples are given by Prabhupada from the Bhagavatam and the Mahabharata. Bhima was approached by Hidimbi from a community lower than the Shudras. Bhima was a Kshatriya, and Hidimbi was from a community lower than the Shudras. And Yayati, another example from the Bhagavatam, Yayati refused to marry the daughter of Shukracharya because Yayati was a Kshatriya and Shukracharya's daughter was Shukracharya was a Brahmana. So a Brahmana's daughter could not be married with a Kshatriya. Vyasadeva, a Brahmana, was called to beget Pandu and Dhritarashtra obviously in the womb of the wife of Vichitravirya, a Kshatriya. In the womb of a Kshatriya's wife, Pandu and Dhritarashtra were begotten by Vyasadeva, he was a Brahmana. So Satyavati belonged to a family of fishermen, but Parashara, a great Brahmana, begot in her Vyasadeva. See, Uttama and Adama contact, this is being explained here. So there are so many examples of contact with women, but in all cases the contacts were not abominable, nor were the results of such contacts bad. If the rules are followed, the result is excellent result. The result of the contact, contact between man and woman is natural, why? Because the way nature has made these mind-body systems, a man is attracted to woman and a woman is attracted to a man, but that also must be carried out under regulative principles so that social consecration may not be disturbed. What is the result of the contact between a man and woman? The population which is generated should be of a good quality, should be of good character, that is the central point.

**Key Quote:** "If somebody is born with a bad character it is not easy to reform even though there is direction in the shastra how even those born with bad character can be reformed but it is difficult."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating the importance of regulated contact between men and women to avoid varana-sankara and the birth of children with bad character, and then returns to the original context of Yudhishthira's questions to Arjuna.

Good character. Now if the contact in man and woman is regulated, then the contact between man and woman is regulated, then there will be no unwanted worthless population, there will be no unwanted progeny. It is called varana sankara. Varana means a population of generating children of very bad character, very bad. If somebody is born with a bad character, it is not easy to reform, even though there is direction in the shastra how even those born with bad character can be reformed, but it is difficult. So therefore here the question is being asked by the shastra, is that the shastra is not good character because you refused her and therefore you are feeling very bad that when such a woman should not have been refused, you refused because she was not very good. Have you done anything to fix your dejection? Tell me what is the cause, or you have been defeated on the way by someone who is inferior or equal to you. So somebody infe if they that is actually a very, very it's a cause for dejection for Arjuna. So Yudhishthira is trying to ask these questions. I'll stop here, thank you very.

#### Grihasta Dharma, Vedic Culture, Social Responsibility
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/UmR2yfB8dDI?t=54

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So grihasta dharma is very very very important for upkeep of the society for the spiritual upkeep of the society."
**Summary:** This segment explains the duties of a Grihasta (householder) in Vedic society, emphasizing their responsibility to provide for children, the elderly, Brahmanas, invalids, and even unknown hungry individuals.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 43rd and 44th verses of the 14th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. These are the last two verses of this chapter. This chapter is entitled, "The Disappearance of Lord Krishna." The 43rd verse: अपिसित परियभुं तास्त्वं संभोज्यान वृद्धबालकान जो परियभुं तास्त्वं संभोज्यान वृद्धबालकान जुगुप्सितं कर्म किञ्चित् कृतवान नयद अक्षमं. The meaning of this verse is, "Have you not taken care of old men and boys who deserve to dine with you? Have you left them and taken your meals alone? Have you committed some unpardonable mistake which is to be considered abominable?" This question itself indicates how very exalted was the Vedic culture, that the consideration always for a person before he takes his food, especially lunch, is that he feeds all those who are desirous of food and he is deserving to be fed by a grihasta. This is called grihasta dharma. In the Vedic society, the four spiritual orders: brahmachari, grihasta, vanaprastha, sannyas. Out of these four orders, the grihasta has got certain duties which is absolutely essential to be carried out by the grihasta for the upkeep of the other three spiritual orders. A brahmachari goes and begs from householders. A vanaprastha, he also, of course a vanaprastha does not really beg from a grihasta, but a vanaprastha may beg from a grihasta if he cannot get anything in the forest in terms of fruits, roots, berries or something edible like that in nature. And a sannyasi, of course, he travels from door to door to enlighten people, but in the pretext of begging he tries to approach householders to enlighten them spiritually. So for his subsistence he may take a little, some, bare minimum bhiksha, some food, that's it! So grihasta dharma is very, very, very important for upkeep of the society, for the spiritual upkeep of the society. So Yudhishthira is asking Arjuna that have you not taken care of old men and boys who deserve to dine with you? So Prabhupada explains in the purport, it is the duty of a householder to feed first of all the children, the old members of the family, the brahmanas and the invalids. Such a wonderful culture it is, the very culture, the duty of the householder to feed these four categories of persons. Who are they? The children, the old members of the family, the elderly people, the brahmanas and the invalids. The brahmanas don't work for earning money or for their own maintenance, they don't work. They just give spiritual guidance to the entire society, rest of the society, after themselves becoming well versed in the scriptural knowledge. So they give free consultation to anybody in any subject matter free of charge and for the service they give to the society they are maintained by the other members of the society, especially householders. So householders they share what they have with brahmanas and the invalids. Due to some reason somebody is not able to work and earn money or get their livelihood then they are maintained by the others who are capable of earning and generating wealth. Those able bodied persons should maintain the invalids. This is the culture.

**Key Quote:** "Any householder before he takes his meals he should go out of his house after having fed all these people children, old members of the family, the brahmanas and the invalids after having fed them before he takes his own meals he goes out and calls three times is there anybody hungry who needs food anyone they can come and actually they will be fed first before the grahastha himself takes his meals he will feed them if any unknown hungry man they won't even ask who are you no questions asked you are hungry at lunch time please take prasad this is the culture."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the Vedic injunction for householders to offer food to any hungry person before taking their own meals, illustrating this principle with a story and highlighting the importance of this practice.

So Prabhupada says further, besides that, an ideal householder is required to call for any unknown hungry man to come and dine before he himself goes to take his meals. Any householder before he takes his meals he should go out of his house after having fed all these people, children, old members of the family, the brahmanas and the invalids, after having fed them, before he takes his own meals he goes out and calls three times, "Is there anybody hungry who needs food?" Anyone, they can come and actually they will be fed first before the grahastha himself takes his meals. He will feed them if any unknown hungry man, they won't even ask who are you, no questions asked, you are hungry at lunch time please take prasad. This is the culture, this is the chastric injunction. So a grahastha, a householder is required to call for such a hungry man thrice on the road. In fact, I have heard this that even now in some provinces there are people who follow this injunction. I know of a certain gentleman who said he was travelling in Karnataka in the south canada district, he was going from one place to another place by his car and while he was passing through one particular village it was about lunch time, say one o'clock in the afternoon and his car was stopped by a gentleman of the village and he stopped the car and he was curious why did that gentleman stop his car. So the gentleman said, "I am from this village. I stopped you to inquire from you, have you had your lunch?" So this person in the car said, "No I have not had my lunch." "Please come to my house for lunch," he invited. So this is grahastha dharma. So then that person in the car said who is travelling, who is a traveller, he was very pleased and he went to that gentleman's house of the village and took his meals. So formerly there were no hotels, there were no restaurants either. People would go to a temple which had the arrangement of feeding any visitors at lunch time. Even now if you go to Udupi temple you will get, you will get lunch at lunch time or if you go to ISKCON Bangalore temple you can get lunch at lunch time. So like this there are still some temples even in north India, even in south India, even in Gujarat, in Rajasthan, in Bengal, in Bihar, in Orissa, there are temples which feed people who are visitors in the afternoon at lunch time and sometimes the householders will to a limited extent they may host a person who is a visitor or a traveller or a person who has no arrangement for cooking his food, they may host such a person and feed him. So this is what is explained by Prabhupada here, the neglect of this prescribed duty of a householder especially in the matter of the old men and children is unpardonable. It is considered as a violation of the Vedic injunction for a householder who does not feed such deserving people. So Yudhishthira's question to Arjuna is, did you refuse to feed such deserving people, refuse to feed somebody who was worthy of being fed as a grahastha dharma?

#### Separation from Krishna, Dejection, Spiritual Loss, Yudhishthira's Inquiries

**Key Quote:** "Or is it that you are feeling empty for all time because you might have lost your most intimate friend Lord Krishna O my brother Arjuna I can think of no other reason for your becoming so dejected."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the 44th verse, focusing on Yudhishthira's inquiry into Arjuna's dejection and suggesting that it stems from the separation from Lord Krishna, referencing Narada's earlier indication of Krishna's departure.

You didn't do your duty because of which you are dejected. The 44th verse, the last verse: कचित् प्रेष्ठतमॆनाथा हृदयेनात्म बन्धुना शुन्योस्मि रहितो नित्यं मन्यसेते अन्यथा नरुक. The meaning of this verse is, "Or is it that you are feeling empty for all time because you might have lost your most intimate friend Lord Krishna? O my brother Arjuna, I can think of no other reason for your becoming so dejected." So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "All the inquisitiveness of Maharaj Yudhishthira about the world situation was already conjunctured by Maharaj Yudhishthira on the basis of Lord Krishna's disappearance from the vision of the world and this is now disclosed by him because of the acute dejection of Arjuna which could not have been possible otherwise." So even though he was doubtful about it he was obliged to inquire frankly from Arjuna on the basis of Sri Narada's indication. If you recollect in the previous chapter, Dhritarashtra quits home, it was indicated by Narada to Yudhishthira that you Pandavas, you remain on the earth as long as Krishna is on the earth and after Krishna's departure you also may leave this world. So Krishna's departure was hinted by Narada when Yudhishthira had inquired from Narada about Dhritarashtra's quitting home. So this was in the back of the mind of Yudhishthira. So he sent Arjuna after that to inquire from Krishna what is the future program of Krishna and Arjuna did not return for seven months. So Yudhishthira became very anxious whether Krishna has departed from this world because of which so many bad omens were being seen by Yudhishthira and those were described in the beginning of this chapter. So now Yudhishthira is directly inquiring from Arjuna, are you feeling so dejected because you have lost your most intimate friend Lord Krishna because Krishna has departed for the spiritual world, Krishna is no longer on this earth planet. So Yudhishthira is even concluding, "I can think of no other reason for your becoming so dejected," and it will turn out that in the next chapter it will be described how Arjuna replies to all these questions with one answer to begin with and later on he recollects how he is feeling separation from Krishna because Krishna has departed for the spiritual abode, for the spiritual abode after winding up his pastimes. So that is what Arjuna is going to reply but Yudhishthira has already figured out by Arjuna not answering in the affirmative for any of the other reasons for Arjuna's dejection. He has denied, "I am not dejected because of all the other reasons that Yudhishthira thought could be the reason for Arjuna's dejection."

In this session we will be discussing from the 6th verse of the 14th chapter of the 1st canto of Shri Mudbhagavatam Yudhishthira Uvacha Sampreshito Dvarakayam Jisnur Bandhu Didrikshaya Jnatum Cha Punya Shlokasya Krishnasya Cha Vicheshtitam. The meaning of this verse is Maharaj Yudhishthira said to his younger brother Bhima Sena, "I sent Arjuna to Dvaraka to meet his friends and to learn from the personality of God Krishna of his program."

**Summary:** Yudhishthira expresses his concern to Bhima about Arjuna's prolonged absence from Dvaraka.

So Yudhishthira begins to describe to Bhima what's happening. First of all he says I sent Arjuna to Dvaraka for what? To find out what is Krishna's next program. And in the next verse, the 7th verse, Krishna Yudhishthira continues to speak to Bhima: Gata Saptadhuna Masa Bhima Sena Tabanujaha Nayatikasyava Hetor Naham Vedaida Manjasa. The meaning of this 7th verse is, "Since he departed 7 months have passed." When did Yudhishthira send Arjuna? Seven months back. Yet he has not returned. I do not know factually how things are going on there in Dvaraka.

**Key Quote:** "Is he going to quit his earthly pastimes as Devarshi Narada indicated? Has the time already arrived?"
**Summary:** Yudhishthira wonders if Krishna is about to leave the earthly realm, as predicted by Narada.

How things are going on I do not know. The 8th verse: Api devarshina diṣṭaha sakāloyaṁ upasthitaha yadātmano angam ākṛdam bhagavān utsi srikshati. The meaning of this verse is, "Is he going to quit his earthly pastimes as Devarshi Narada indicated? Has the time already arrived?" Again Yudhishthira is conjecturing that Krishna has disappeared. Only then there was a reason for all such symptoms to appear. So he is again trying to confirm by asking Bhima, "Is the soul still alive? Yes. Is the Supreme Lord going to quit his earthly pastimes?" And some mention was made about Devarshi Narada. In the previous chapter it is described Narada had told Yudhishthira, "You Pandavas should remain on this earth as long as the Supreme Lord is present, which means that after the disappearance of Supreme Lord you should also quit your position on this earthly planet." Yes. He also stated that "Pralaya montre protege sw Grandi BhoĄ Madonna." So that is exactly what is being referred here as Devarshi Narada had indicated has the Supreme

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is the unlimited personality of Godhead. He expands. That means he is one person, but he is simultaneously present in many forms."
**Summary:** The speaker begins to explain Srila Prabhupada's purport, focusing on the concept of Krishna's plenary expansions and how Krishna manifests in different forms with different functions.

Lord quit his earthly pastimes. So Srila Prabhupada writes elaborate purport to this particular verse. Srila Prabhupada says, as we have discussed many times, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Krishnah, plenary expansions. What is the meaning of plenary expansion? Krishna is the unlimited personality of Godhead. He expands. That means he is one person, but he is simultaneously present in many forms. He himself is present in many forms. And such expansions are called plenary expansions when Krishna's full power is present in each of the expanded forms. Just like Krishna expands, first of all, as Balaram. So Balaram is Krishna only, but Balaram has the full power of Krishna. Balaram is Krishna, but we say he is Balaram because he is Krishna. He has got different function, he's got different, he displays different varied characteristics, he has specific pastimes, he has specific relationships, he has specific characteristics and all appear to be distinctly different from Krishna's own appearance, characteristics, qualities, activities appear to be different.

**Key Quote:** "Whenever wherever there is a decline in religious practice... at the time I descend myself... To deliver the faithful, to annihilate the miscreants, and also to reestablish the principles of occupational duty, I appear in every age."
**Summary:** The speaker continues explaining plenary expansions, citing verses from the Bhagavad Gita to illustrate the purpose and nature of Krishna's incarnations.

So Krishna, the Supreme personality of God, has many plenary expansions. We can't count how many plenary expansions are there and each and every one of them, each and every plenary expansion, although equally powerful, executes different functions. If it were for the same function there is no need. Krishna is all-powerful, so for different functions, different forms, that is Krishna's own personal opulence. Now Srila Prabhupada quotes the Bhagavad Gita. In Bhagavad Gita there are different statements by the Lord and each of these statements is meant for different plenary portions or portions of the plenary portions. Some of them Srila Prabhupada cites here. For example, Shri Krishna, the Lord says in Bhagavad Gita in the fourth chapter seventh verse, what does he say? "Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice or descendant of Bharata and a predominant rise of irreligion at the time I descend myself." Yada yadahi dharmasya glanir bhavati bhavati, that verse is being cited by Prabhupada, the English translation of that verse, so at different times Krishna has different incarnations appear. So these incarnations are possible plenary portions, or they are portions of plenary portions, amsa and kala. Then again, in the fourth chapter, eighth verse, Krishna says, "To deliver the faithful, to annihilate the miscreants, and also to reestablish the principles of occupational duty, I appear

**Summary:** The speaker continues with the explanation of plenary expansions, citing another verse from the Bhagavad Gita, emphasizing that Krishna's different expansions perform different activities.

in every age." In every yuga, Krishna incarnates for three purposes, and those are mentioned here. Now these incarnations are different plenary expansions, different plenary portions, different portions of the plenary portions. They come time to time. Each of the incarnations come appropriately. Then again, in the third chapter, twenty-fourth verse, Krishna says, "If I should cease to work, then all humanity would be misdirected. I would also be the cause of creating unwanted population, and I would thereby destroy the peace of all sentient beings." So this also, Krishna is speaking. But, in his different expansions, different incarnations, he performs different activities. Not all incarnations are doing the same thing. Just like in his expansion as Mahavishnu, he is responsible for the primary creation, breathing out universes, and breathing in the universes.

**Key Quote:** "Particularly Krishna incarnates, he teaches by his own example certain things. In every incarnation he teaches by his example."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna teaches by example in each incarnation and that Krishna is a transcendental personality full of opulences and powers.

Then, as in the server- Meng Bo Tao in the third chapter, and his third chapter, it starts by will follow and whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts all the world pursues. Particularly Krishna incarnates, he teaches by his own example certain things. In every incarnation he teaches by his example. So that is being referred to here, different incarnations, different forms, different activities, different purposes, Krishna appears in different incarnations. So now Prabhupada continues after citing these four verses from the Bhagavad Gita, Prabhupada says, "All the above statements by the Lord apply to different plenary portions of the Lord, namely his expansions such as Sankarsana, Vasudeva, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Narayana, Sankara. These are all he himself in different transcendental expansions. Krishna only, only one person, supreme person, unlimited person. He is not ordinary person like us. Transcendental personality full of all so many opulences, so many powers, so many different forms. Still the Lord and Shri Krishna functions in a different sphere of transcendental exchange

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the timing of Krishna's appearances in different universes and emphasizes the identity of Krishna's body and soul.

with different grades of devotees. As Krishna himself, he also appears. And that appearance is the appearance of the original personality we have got it. In Mathura, he is born and then he transfers himself to Vrindavan and then again comes back to Mathura, then Dwaraka, so different sphere of transcendental exchange with different grades of devotees, different types of devotees are there. And yet Lord Krishna as he is appears once every 24 hours of Brahma's time, once in a day or after a lapse of 8 billion 640 million solar years. This one day and night of Brahma together is unparalleled. In our calculation on the earth, 8 billion 640 million, so many solar years elapse after Krishna appears again. In each and every universe Krishna appears once in the day of Brahma. And all his transcendental pastimes are displayed in each and every universe in a routine spool. Just like cinema is running. Like that. Every Brahmanda, Krishna will appear, perform his pastimes and disappear. Once in a day of Brahma only. In his form as Krishna. Of course, in his other forms, other expansions, other incarnations he appears in so many different yugas in different times. But in that routine spool the functions of Lord Krishna, Lord Vasudeva, etc. are complex problem for the layman. A layman cannot understand. It is the same personality of God that is appearing. There is no difference between the Lord's self and the Lord's transcendental body. This is important.

#### Krishna's Body, Yogamaya, Viratrupa, Different Manifestations
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/WJuULo7ycKs?t=821

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna's body and Krishna's soul are identical... when Krishna appears in his original form, all the other plenary expansions join in him by his inconceivable potency called Yogamata."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Krishna's transcendental body with the material body and explains how Krishna's different expansions manifest through Yogamaya, including the Viratrupa.

Krishna's body and Krishna's soul are identical. In our case what happens? This material body is completely different from I, the spirit's soul. That's why time and again we have heard many, many times, "I am not the body, you are not your body." But Krishna is identical with his form. The expansions execute differential activities. Now, the important point to understand is when Krishna appears in his original form, all the other plenary expansions join in him by his inconceivable potency called Yogamata. Thus, the Lord Krishna of Vrindavan is different from the Lord Krishna of Mathura. Different means a different expansion is present in Mathura, a different expansion is present in Dwaraka, a different expansion is present in some other Leela. The Viratrupa of Lord Krishna is also different from him by his inconceivable potency. Krishna showed his Viratrupa to Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, but Krishna is sitting and Arjuna is seeing the Viratrupa and Arjuna is talking to Krishna. So Krishna is there, Viratrupa is also there. Inconceivably they can be one and they can be different. The Viratrupa exhibited on the battlefield of Kurukshetra is a material conception of his form. It is not his totality. It is a transcendental form, Viratrupa is a material conception of form. Therefore it should be understood that when Krishna apparently was killed by the bow and arrow of the hunter, the Lord left his so-called material body in the material world. So what did Krishna leave behind? For the atheist it appears like Krishna was killed by the hunter, but what did he leave behind? When we die, we leave behind our body. Krishna went and killed his own body. He came and killed the body, Krishna says leave behind our material body. Krishna also apparently left behind a material body. Krishna has no material body, he has no material form, then what did we leave behind? So, he left behind, that is explained here that he left behind his Viratrupa in the material world, which is always there in the material world. And Viratrupa belongs to the material world and he left behind that Viratrupa. That Viratrupa belongs to the material world.

Viratrupa inconceivably when Krishna comes also is there within Krishna so there is no question of Krishna accepting a material form nor any question of Krishna becoming conditioned like us no he is always transcendental is always liberated and he's apart from all this material energy and material

In this session, we are discussing from the 9th verse of the 14th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Yasmanas Sampado Rajyam Dara Prana Kulam Prajaha Asan Sapatna Vijayo Lokascha Yad Anugrahat.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's explanation that material prosperity, including good family and success, is not solely achieved through hard work but also through the mercy of the Supreme Lord.

Srila Prabhupada explains that very nicely in the purport. Srila Prabhupada says material prosperity consists of a good wife, good home, sufficient land, good children, aristocratic family relations, victory over conflict, and that happenings lead to attaining first place position among the competitors and by pious work, attainment of accommodations in the higher celestial planets for better facilities of material amenities. 若突然尊敬uli古 associations을 Sage Prabhatข Thaksosen Koti Rishis vra rasangarigh drinking biryani drinking biryani good home, good children, sufficient land and aristocratic family relations and victorious over competitors and also perform pious work to ensure a better next life in terms of elevating oneself to heavenly powers.

**Key Quote:** "They forget that in addition to the hard work, most important is the mercy of the Supreme Lord in sanctioning the result."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that while personal effort is necessary, the ultimate success depends on the Lord's sanction and mercy, which is often overlooked.

people consider, "I worked hard and I earned some money or some good result in some work and so on. I worked hard and it is my own hard work that is the cause of my success or my achievement." They forget that in addition to the hard work, most important is the mercy of the Supreme Lord in sanctioning the result. That they forget. So Srila Prabhupada says prosperity earned by one's personal endeavour also depends on the mercy of the Lord. Krishna Kripa, Bhagavad Kripa. You also require the mercy of the Lord for success in any endeavour. Personal labour must be there. It is not that Krishna's mercy is enough, I will not do anything. No. Personal labour must be there in this material world, in addition to the Lord's benediction. So both are required. The personal endeavour and the Lord's mercy or Lord's blessing, both are required. But without the Lord's benediction no one is successful simply by personal labour.

#### Kali Yuga, ignorance, five factors of action, divine blessing

**Key Quote:** "The modernized man of Kali Yuga, believes in personal endeavour and denies the benediction of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how people in Kali Yuga tend to rely solely on personal effort, ignoring the importance of the Lord's blessings, and references the five factors of action from the Bhagavad Gita.

Professor is reiterating this point. Your hard work alone is not enough, anybody for that matter, in this material world. The modernized man of Kali Yuga believes in personal endeavour and denies the benediction of the Supreme Lord. This is the position of most people in the present Kali Yuga. They are ignorant and they are not properly educated and they do not know how subtle laws are working, who is ultimately in control of everything that is going on. Why is it that people do not always succeed in all their endeavors? Actually, most people don't have an answer for this. The answer is given here that there are two things: the personal endeavor and the sanction of the Lord, the blessing or benediction or mercy of the Lord. This is explained very nicely in the Bhagavad Gita: five factors of action are dependent on personal endeavor and one is called diva, that is the Supreme Lord's blessing of the mercy.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that both personal effort and the Lord's blessings are essential for success, citing Yudhishthira as an example of a devotee who understands this truth.

So clearly these five factors are responsible for successful accomplishment of any action in this material world by anybody. Srila Prabhupada cites one instance: even a great sanyasi of India delivered speeches in Chicago protesting the benedictions of the Supreme Lord, as if Supreme Lord's benediction don't matter at all. This sanyasi was speaking only your own personal endeavor is important and enough. Sense nor is your gift to Sreenivas or your own that is wrong as far as the Vedic shastras are concerned as we find in the pages of Srimad Bhagavatam the ultimate sanction for all success rests in the hands of the Supreme Lord is the fact that it 신 person Maharaja Udeshetira admits this truth in his personal success U William'sennen Yudhishthira is an ideal personality. He is a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord, so he is not ignorant, he is not foolish, he is not a sentimentalist. He is a powerful Kshatriya, but he does his duties properly. He knows that his success is dependent on Krishna's benedictions also, in addition to his personal endeavour. So neither personal endeavour is to be ignored, nor should one neglect the Supreme Lord's blessings. Both are required. Both are required.

**Key Quote:** "If one could achieve success without the sanction of the Lord, then no medical practitioner would fail to cure a patient."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of medical practitioners to illustrate that even with the best efforts, success is not guaranteed without the Lord's sanction.

Both are essential. Now Maharaj Yudhishthira admits this truth in his personal success and he behooves one to follow in the footsteps of a great king and devotee of the Lord to make life a full success. So Prabhupada is revealing to all of us, how can we ensure full success in our life? We have to personally endeavour and we should also learn to depend on Krishna's blessings. Both are required. Now Srila Prabhupada says one important point and helps us understand the truth, the reality. Prabhupada says, if one could achieve success without the sanction of the Lord, then no medical practitioner would fail to cure a patient. Medical practitioners work very hard, very sincerely to cure somebody who has got a deadly disease. They work very hard. They sincerely work to diagnose, to treat, to administer the medicine, or to do surgery, or to administer specific treatment. And even the most successful people, sometimes they are unable to save the patient. So, one should be very careful. One should be very careful. One should be very careful. One should be very careful. One should be very careful. So, why is it that every time they give good treatment, they are not successful? That is because the Lord's hand is definitely there.

**Key Quote:** "God's sanction is the immediate cause for all happenings, good or bad."
**Summary:** The speaker continues with examples of medical cases where people die despite treatment or survive without it, concluding that God's sanction is the ultimate cause of all events.

In spite of their hard work and very good care, people die. Some people die. So Srila Prabhupada says, despite the most advanced treatment of a suffering patient by the most up-to-date medical practitioner, there is death. And even in the most hopeless case, without medical treatment, a patient is cured astonishingly. I have many instances I can cite. I don't have time now. That there have been cases where people have been rushed to their... to their family doctor, and the family doctor tried his best to treat and cure, and he was not successful. The doctor is the same. The patient is one who has taken treatment earlier, and he has been treated and cured earlier, many, many times. But one particular time, the doctor was not able to cure the patient. The patient died. So, there is... There are instances where people die in spite of the best treatment. And there are instances also where somebody is unable to get treatment, and they are just not having any hope of surviving, because they have got a very deadly disease. And without any treatment, without any medicine, without any kind of intervention, medical intervention, they astonishingly survive. They somehow become cured, without any treatment. There are instances of people following what is called as naturopathy. They purposely don't go to a doctor. They don't take any medicine. They don't take any medical treatment. They just follow a strict diet, and they do fasting. And they become cured. But again, it's not that they're going to live forever. That we have to remember. Whatever be your system of maintaining good health, at a certain time, when the lifespan is over, one has to quit the body in this material world. Death is certain, for one has taken birth after the duration of a certain lifespan. It is certain. Therefore, the conclusion, what is the conclusion? That God's sanction is the immediate cause for all happenings, good or bad.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of gratitude towards Krishna for all achievements, which leads to Krishna consciousness and ultimately, eternal life in the spiritual abode.

So never neglect or ignore God's sanction, Krishna's sanction. Krishna, please remember, Krishna is seated on everybody's heart. He is active in everybody's life. He is a constant companion of the conditioned soul, as long as the conditioned soul is in this material world. So he guides. If I quit this body, Krishna will guide me to my next destination. Krishna knows everything and he will guide me to the next body that I have to accept, if I have to accept the body, or he'll guide me to his personal abode, if I have to go back to God. Exactly everybody is guided by the Supersoul, Paramatma, who is none other than Krishna himself. So Krishna's hand is always there. Any successful man should feel grateful to the Lord for all he has achieved. This is the last statement by Srila Prabhupada in this purport. Have that gratitude. And by having that gratitude for all success in all your endeavors, you become Krishna conscious. Gratitude towards Krishna. You become Krishna conscious. When you become Krishna conscious, that's your success in life. Ultimate success. You get out of this material existence and you go to the spiritual abode of the Supreme Lord to live eternal life full of knowledge and bliss. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

and above all Maharaja Yudhishthira's speculative inquiries. So in the previous chapter we had heard about Yudhishthira seeing bad omens after having sent Arjuna to inquire about Krishna's next program. When Arjuna did not return for several months then Yudhishthira began to conjecture what could be the reason why Arjuna has not returned and what could be the reason why there are bad omens. So he guessed it is only possible because Krishna has returned to his personal abode. He has left this earth planet. Krishna has disappeared. So now this is going to be confirmed by Arjuna and Arjuna has been bewitched He got lost and he returned again. And when Arjuna is there. He is returning again. And Yudhishthira has returned when Yudhishthira was trying to find the cause or the reason for the bad omens and when Arjuna returned immediately Yudhishthira began to inquire why is Arjuna appearing to be very dejected. And therefore he is guessing the cause for Arjuna's dejection and when Arjuna And after, when Arjuna could not immediately reply to Yudhishthira's inquiries, so Yudhishthira went on asking, is it because of this, is it because of that, is it because of something else? And finally, when Arjuna would not reply, either yes or no, then Yudhishthira said, the only reason you are so dejected is because you have lost your dear most friend Lord Krishna, you are separated from him. And now Arjuna is going to reply. So, this verse says, in the Purport Shilaprabha says, being too much aggrieved, Arjuna practically became choked up, and therefore it is not possible for him to reply properly to the various speculations and speculative inquiries of Maharaja Yudhishthira.

**Key Quote:** "This is the whole foundation of the philosophy of Krishna consciousness. Krishna is the supreme lord. Every living being is a very tiny part of Krishna. And every living being has got a specific loving relationship with Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the philosophy of Krishna consciousness, highlighting the loving relationship between Krishna and every living being, contrasting it with material relationships based on the body and mind.

This is the whole foundation of the philosophy of Krishna consciousness. Krishna is the supreme lord. Every living being is a very tiny part of Krishna. And every living being has got a specific loving relationship with Krishna. And in that relationship, Krishna reciprocates perfectly, exactly according to the relationship. So now, how did Krishna relate with Arjuna? That is being explained here. Sri Arjuna is one of the typical pure devotees of the lord, reciprocating in the fraternal relationship. Fraternal. Fraternal relationship means as a friend. Krishna and Arjuna are related as friend. And the lord's dealings with Arjuna are displays of friendship of the highest perfect order. We have friendly relations with different people in this material world. We have experience. But in this world, all relationships with other persons, is tinged with material defects. The first material defect is that all such relationships are based on body. Anything that happens to the body affects the relationship. Body means there is an external body and there is an inside, internal body, the mind. So the gross body and the sub-body. The subtle mind. These are the basis of our relationships in this material world with other persons. Who similarly also have, like I have a gross body and I have a subtle mind. But I am different from these two. I am spirit soul.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's relationship with every living being is soul to the super soul. Perfect relationship."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the difference between material and spiritual relationships, emphasizing the perfect relationship between the soul and the Supersoul (Krishna), and concludes with Arjuna's reaction to Yudhishthira's inquiries.

Similarly, you, if I have a relationship with you, you are also spirit soul. But you have a covering over your spirit soul. You have a covering of the subtle mind and the gross body. So you are. Your subtle mind, your gross body, is covering you and my gross body and my subtle mind is covering me. And the relationship, the material relationship is between or based on this gross body and subtle mind. It has nothing to do with the soul, factually. So, Krishna's relationship with every living being is soul to the super soul. Or soul to the... Supreme soul. He is a supreme soul. He has no covering. Pure devotees don't have any covering. Pure devotees are their individual pure spirit soul. So the relationship is between soul and supreme soul. Perfect relationship. So, Krishna was not only a well-wisher of Arjuna, but actually a benefactor. And to make it. Still more perfect, the Lord tied him into a family relationship by arranging Subhadra's marriage with him. And above all, the Lord became a chariot driver of Arjuna in order to protect his friend from warfare risks. And the Lord became happy when he established the Pandavas to rule over the world after the battle of Rukshetra. Arjuna remembered all these one after another and thus he became overwhelmed with such thoughts. So, this is Arjuna's reaction when Yudhishthira Maharaj made inquiries. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So here is another very very important lesson for all of us. It is explained by Srila Prabhupada. The Lord can tolerate insults upon himself by any miscreant because the father tolerates even insults from the son. But the Lord never tolerates insults from the son."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the story of Draupadi's insult and the consequences faced by the Kauravas, emphasizing the importance of not insulting devotees.

In this session we will be discussing from the 10th verse of the 15th chapter of the 1st Canto Srimad Bhagavatam: पत्न्यास्तवाधी मख त्लिप्त महाविषेक श्लागिष्ठ चारु कबरं कितवै सभायां स्पृष्टं विकीरिय पदयो पतिताश्रु मुख्या यस्तत्स्त्रियो अक्रत हतेश विमुक्त केशा. The meaning of this verse is: It was he only who loosened the hair of all the women, the wives of the miscreants, who dared open the cluster of your queen's hair, which had been nicely dressed and sanctified for the great Rajasuya sacrificial ceremony. At that time she fell down at the feet of Lord Krishna with tears in her eyes. So this is an incident that happened before the Pandavas went to the temple of Lord Krishna, to the forest for exile. In the gambling match something happened that is described by Prabhupada in the purport. Queen Draupadi had a beautiful bunch of hair which was sanctified in the ceremonial function of Rajasuya Yajna. The Rajasuya Yajna took place before the Pandavas went to exile. So Draupadi was actually sanctified in that ceremonial function. She had a very beautiful bunch of hair, but when she was lost in a bet during the gambling match between the Pandavas and Kauravas, Dushasana touched her glorified hair to insult her. These are demoniac natured people. They have no consideration that a chaste lady is never to be insulted. A chaste lady is never to be insulted. So they thought they can do whatever they like and get away with it. So Dushasana actually insulted Draupadi. Draupadi then fell down at the lotus feet of Lord Krishna, and Lord Krishna decided that all the wives of Dushasana and company should have their hair loosened as a result of the banal activity of the Pandavas, the battle of Kurukshetra. Thus, after the battle of Kurukshetra, after all the sons and grandsons of Dhritarashtra died in battle, all the wives of the family were obliged to loosen their hair as widows. You see, all the wives of the Kuru family became widows because of Dushasana

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the dangers of offending Vaishnavas, emphasizing the loss of pious merits and benedictions.

insulting a great devotee of the Lord. So here is another very, very important lesson for all of us. It is explained by Srila Prabhupada: The Lord can tolerate insults upon himself by any miscreant because the father tolerates even insults from the son. But the Lord never tolerates insults from the son. The Lord never tolerates insults upon his devotees. If someone insults Krishna, Krishna may tolerate. But if someone insults Krishna's devotees, Krishna will never tolerate. And it is explained here, by insulting a great soul, one has to forego all the results of pious acts and benedictions also. So Dushasana, by insulting Draupadi, the chaste, the chaste lady and pure devotee of Krishna, invited trouble for himself. So all the Kauravas, all the sons of Dhritarashtra and his grandsons, were all killed in the battle of Kurukshetra. None of them survived. Not even one surviving descendant for Dhritarashtra. Not even one surviving descendant. And the Pandavas, they were actually killed. They were actually protected by Krishna mystically, that they were completely unharmed in that big battle. It was a world war. It was no small battle. It was the world war. And in that the Pandavas were protected by Krishna. So, the lesson for us is never insult a Vaishnava. Never offend a Vaishnava. It is very dangerous. By offending a Vaishnava, one loses all results of the pious activities and all benedictions also are lost.

There is another incident described in the Chaitanya Charita Amrita, in the life of Srila Haridas Thakur.

So when he came to that meeting, that village, he accepted prasadam in the house of Balaramacharya, and he used to perform chanting in a solitary place where there was a thatched hut.

So in that meeting there were discourses taking place and the saintly persons participated in that discourse. So when Haridasa Thakur was invited to come to that assembly in which the discourses were to take place,

**Key Quote:** "Actually, by chanting the holy name without offences, one awakens his ecstatic love for the lotus feet of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts how Haridas Thakur explained that the true result of chanting the holy name is awakening love for Krishna, with liberation being an insignificant by-product.

Haridasa Thakur was invited to come to that assembly in which the discourses were to take place. Haridasa Thakur, accompanied by Balaramacharya, came to the house of the Majumdars. So when all the devotees, particularly these two Majumdars, they saw Haridasa Thakur, they immediately stood up to receive him with great respect, and they fell at his lotus feet, and they gave him a nice place to sit. In that assembly were many people, many learned scholars, brahmanas, and respectable gentlemen. In fact, these two brothers, Hiranya and Govardhan Majumdar, were also very learned. So everyone began to speak of Haridasa Thakur's great qualities. So the brothers were very happy to hear everyone glorifying Haridasa Thakur. So it was mentioned that Haridasa Thakur used to chant three lakh names of Krishna every day. Practically, he would chant the whole day. And the scholars began to discuss the glories of chanting the holy name. Some of them said by chanting the holy name one is freed from all reactions of sinful life. Then somebody else said by chanting the holy name one is liberated from material bondage. Haridasa Thakur, however, said that if you chant the holy name, you will be freed from material bondage. Haridasa Thakur said that if you chant the holy name you will be free from material bondage. These two benedictions are not the true result of chanting the holy name. Actually, by chanting the holy name without offences, one awakens his ecstatic love for the lotus feet of Krishna. Actually, it is described in the scriptures. Chanting of the holy name, offenselessly, awakens the dormant devotion and one becomes a lover of God, Krishna. Now, as regards liberation and becoming free from sinful reactions are concerned, they are insignificant by-products of chanting the holy name. The holy name of the Supreme Lord, insignificant by-products.

**Key Quote:** "even before one becomes a pure chanter of the holy name, even before that, just by a glimpse of offenseless chanting, immediately all sinful reactions are completely nullified."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of the rising sun to illustrate how even a glimpse of offenseless chanting eradicates sinful reactions, emphasizing that liberation is insignificant compared to love of Krishna.

Now, Haridasa Thakur gives an example to help us understand. Just like, when the sun rises, it dissipates the world's darkness immediately. So, similarly, when one chants the holy name of the Supreme Lord, without offences, automatically all the sinful reactions are completely eradicated. Now, Srila Haridasa Thakur explains that even before the sun rises, there is some first glimpse of sunlight that appears before the sun rises, and even with the first glimpse of this sunlight, the fear of thieves, ghosts, demons, immediately disappears. And when the sun actually rises, everything is manifest and everyone begins performing his religious activities and material duties. So, similarly, at the first hint that somebody is chanting offenselessly the holy name of the Supreme Lord, immediately all reactions to sinful life are completely eradicated. So, when actually one chants the holy name offenselessly, one becomes ecstatic in love of Krishna. So, Haridasa Thakur explains that even before one becomes a pure chanter of the holy name, even before that, just by a glimpse of offenseless chanting, immediately all sinful reactions are completely nullified. So, liberation is actually an insignificant thing for a pure devotee.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates how Gopal Chakravarthy insulted Haridas Thakur and suffered severe consequences, reinforcing the danger of offending devotees.

So, when one particular brahmana, Gopal Chakravarthy, who was the official chief tax collector in that village, he heard this, he became very upset. He said, he had a beautiful body, very nice handsome features, and he began to criticize Haridasa Thakur. He said, look at this emotional devotee saying that liberation is very easily obtained by a glimpse of offenseless chanting of the holy name of the Supreme Lord. Liberation is so difficult. It takes millions of births. When one is perfectly situated in absolute knowledge, only then one may attain liberation. But here is the sentimental person who says very easily you can get liberation. So, then Haridasa Thakur said, why are you doubting the revealed scriptures? I am just quoting the revealed scriptures. So, then this brahmana said, if it is not true, then I will cut off your nose. Haridasa Thakur humbly accepted. If it is not true, then Haridasa Thakur said, yes, you can cut my nose. But others became very, very upset at this brahmana Gopal Chakravarthi insulting Haridasa Thakur. So, they all protested and Haridasa Thakur did not take offense and left that place. But very soon, in three days, this brahmana, he got leprosy and his nose was affected and it fell off. So, this is the result of offending a pure devotee that this Gopal Chakravarthi, he became afflicted by leprosy and he lost his nose when he insulted Haridasa Thakur telling, I will cut off your nose if what you are telling is not true. So, we have to be careful not to insult devotees. Otherwise, it is very dangerous for our spiritual life.

So it is described, Durvasa Muni, he was a very powerful mystic Brahmana, and he had performed a lot of austerities. So he had a lot of power, mystic power. And this Durvasa Muni, he was a partial incarnation of Lord Shiva. And when he was satisfied with somebody's service, he would do a lot of good to that person. But if he was dissatisfied, he could bring about the greatest calamity. Once it so happened that he was, this Durvasa Muni was, a guest at the house of Kunti's father. And Kunti was serving him as a young girl, and Durvasa Muni was satisfied with her, and he blessed her with the power to call any devata she desired in order to have a child. Now, Durvasa Muni could foresee that this Kunti, when she grows up, she will not be able to beget children through her husband Pandu. Therefore, Durvasa Muni blessed her in this way. And it turned out that Kunti could beget children only by calling upon some demigods, because she could not beget children through Pandu. So, this Durvasa Muni used to travel in space by his great mystic powers, and he could travel everywhere in the whole universe. Now, once he was a guest at the palace of Duryodhana in Hastinapura. And Duryodhana satisfied this brahmana, Durvasa Muni, and when Durvasa Muni was satisfied, Durvasa Muni wanted to give some benediction to Duryodhana. So, Duryodhana knew that this Durvasa Muni has got a lot of mystic powers. So, what did Duryodhana ask this Durvasa Muni? He requested that Durvasa Muni become a guest of Yudhishthira Maharaj, who is in exile, who was in exile at that time, that you become a guest of Yudhishthira, and you should visit him only after Draupadi has finished her meals. At such a time, on such a day, you should visit the King Yudhishthira in exile.

So, Durvasa Muni agreed because he was very pleased with Duryodhana. Now, Duryodhana's plan was that when Durvasa Muni visits Yudhishthira with 10,000 disciples, and that too after Draupadi has finished her meal, then how will Yudhishthira feed Durvasa Muni and his 10,000 disciples? Because the Pandavas during exile, they had been gifted with one special pot. That pot would give enough food to any number of people, till Draupadi would take her meals. After that, the pot would not give any more food, not produce any more food. So, when Durvasa Muni visited the camp of Yudhishthira in the forest as his guest, he visited after Draupadi had finished her meals. So, Yudhishthira received this Durvasa Muni very nicely and requested the Muni to go to the nearby river and take bath and finish his noon duties and then come for lunch. So, the Muni went, Durvasa Muni went with his 10,000 disciples to the river to take bath. All of them were taking bath and in the meantime, Yudhishthira became very anxious. How is he going to serve lunch for Durvasa Muni and his 10,000 disciples? So, in his anxiety, he was praying to Krishna because they are all devotees of Krishna. So, Yudhishthira realized that Durvasa Muni has come after Draupadi has finished her meals. So, how will they feed? In any case, Yudhishthira requested Draupadi to do something. Then Draupadi began to pray to Krishna. And Draupadi, when she prayed to Krishna, Krishna appeared in front of Draupadi. The Lord is very merciful to his devotees, especially to his devotees. So, because Draupadi was in trouble, she was praying to the Lord and Lord Krishna appeared. Then, when Draupadi told Krishna about their dangerous situation, Krishna just requested Draupadi that you give me some food, then your problem is solved. So, Draupadi, when she heard that Krishna is asking for some food, she felt very bad that she could not serve Krishna with any food because she had finished her meals and there was nothing else in stock.

But, when she began to cry, Krishna called her and said, Why don't you bring that pot which has been gifted by the Sun God to you? Bring that pot now, immediately. So, Draupadi brought that pot. The pot was empty. The pot was not having any food. So then, Krishna examined very carefully inside the pot. There was one small grain of foodstuff sticking to a corner of the pot. So, Krishna picked up that small grain and ate it immediately. After Krishna had taken that one small grain remaining in the pot, he told Draupadi, Now, you can invite your guests and you can feed them. So, on Krishna's instruction, Draupadi went to Yudhishthira and told him, Now, the guests can be invited. So, Yudhishthira sent Bhima to the river to call Durvasamuni and his 10,000 disciples to come for lunch. And meantime, what had happened, that Durvasamuni and his disciples were taking bath in the river and performing their religious duties. They began to feel completely satisfied, completely satisfied. Their hunger was completely mitigated. That, when Bhima came to invite them, Durvasamuni thought, Oh, Yudhishthira should have arranged a big feast and I am feeling very much full. How can I do justice? I better don't go. I don't accept that invitation because I am already feeling completely full in my stomach, in my belly, just by taking this bath. Though actually, Durvasamuni had not taken his meals at all that day, but still he began to feel full. So, since Durvasamuni thought that he didn't want to disappoint Yudhishthira by refusing outright the lunch, so he quietly went away from that place without going to Yudhishthira's camp. He and his disciples all felt completely full and they went away. Now, how is it that without eating anything, actually the 10,000 disciples of Durvasamuni and Durvasamuni himself began to feel full? It is because yasmintushte jagatushtihi When Krishna is satisfied, everyone is satisfied. When Krishna's hunger is mitigated, everyone's hunger is mitigated.

**Key Quote:** "In fact, Krishna is not in need of anything, but he accepts when something is offered with devotion for the sake of benedicting his devotees, for the sake of reciprocating with his devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of offering food to Krishna with devotion, as it pleases everyone and demonstrates Krishna's reciprocity with his devotees.

Because Krishna is the center and everyone else is his part, his amsa. He is a complete whole. So, this incident proves that a householder must always offer food to the Lord and in that way a householder will be able to satisfy or please anybody, any number of guests, including guests numbering 10,000 which Durvasamuni used to travel with. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj was able to actually satisfy Durvasamuni with all his 10,000 disciples simply by Krishna accepting a tiny grain of particle. In fact, Krishna is not in need of anything, but he accepts when something is offered with devotion for the sake of benedicting his devotees, for the sake of reciprocating with his devotees. So, I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam 1.15.12, explaining that Arjuna is recounting his achievements and the grace of Lord Krishna to Yudhishthira after returning from Dwaraka.

Om Agyanati Miran Dhasya Gyananj Nishalakaya Chaksharan Militam Yena Tasmai Shri Gurave Namaha Nama Om Vishnu Padaya Krishna Preshtaya Bhutale Shri Mate Bhakti Vedanta Swamin Nithinamine Namaste Saraswate Deve Gauravani Pracharine Nirvishesha Shunyavadi Pashchatyade Shatarine Jaya Shri Krishna Chaitanya Prabhu Nithyananda Shri Advaita Gadadhara Shiva Sadhi Gauravakta Vrinda Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devim Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet Om Namah Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam In this session we will be discussing from the 12th verse of the 15th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam.

I was able to reach the heavenly planets in this present body and was allowed a half elevated seat.

#### Demigods vs. Supreme Lord, Devotion to Krishna, Srila Prabhupada's purport
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/bgJl9llMpcc?t=124
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "By such a conception one becomes an offender ultimately meets with the same end as Ravana and others."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing that pleasing the Supreme Lord Krishna is superior to pleasing demigods, and that devotees of Krishna respect demigods, but those who consider demigods equal to Krishna are offenders.

These are words spoken by Arjuna. He is speaking to Yudhishthira. He has returned from Dwaraka. He has brought the news that Krishna has departed for his personal abode. And he is recollecting the grace of Lord Krishna, by which he was able to do so many wonderful things. So Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport: By the grace of the Supreme Personality of God, Sri Krishna, all the demigods including Lord Shiva were pleased with Arjuna. The idea is that one who is favored by Lord Shiva or any other demigod may not necessarily be favored by Arjuna. But he was certainly a great devotee of Lord Shiva, but he could not be saved from the wrath of the Supreme Personality of God, Lord Ramachandra. And there are many instances like that in the histories of the Puranas. But here is an instance where we can see that Lord Shiva became pleased even with the grace of Lord Shiva. He was pleased with Arjuna. Even in the fight with Arjuna. The devotees of the Supreme Lord know how to respect the demigods, but the devotees of the demigods sometimes foolishly think that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is no greater than the demigods. By such a conception one becomes an offender, ultimately meets with the same end as Ravana and others. The instances described by Arjuna during his friendly dealings with Lord Sri Krishna are instructive for all who may be convinced by the lessons that one can achieve all favors simply by pleasing the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna, whereas the devotees or worshippers of the demigods may achieve only partial benefits which are also perishable, just as the demigods themselves are.

#### Perishable vs. Eternal, Awards from Krishna vs. Demigods, Bhagavad Gita

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Whereas the Supreme Lord is eternal. His blessings are eternal."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the perishable benedictions received from demigods with the eternal blessings of the Supreme Lord Krishna, referencing the Bhagavad Gita.

In the Bhagavad Gita it is said, Cheene Punye Marthya Lokam Vishanti. In the Bhagavad Gita it is said, the... I am sorry. Less intelligent people worship demigods by which they get benedictions which are perishable, as much as the demigods themselves are perishable, whereas the Supreme Lord is eternal. His blessings are eternal. His alms, awards are eternal. So there is a significant difference between the award given by Krishna and awards given by the demigods.

#### Arjuna's heavenly journey, Suitability of bodies, Grace of Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "But Arjuna, by the grace of Lord Sri Krishna, he was able to go in the self-same body to the heavenly planet of Indra Deva."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights Arjuna's unique ability to reach the heavenly planets in his physical body due to the grace of Lord Krishna, contrasting it with the general limitations of bodies and planetary conditions.

Srila Prabhupada further explains, another significance of the present verse is that Arjuna, by the grace of Lord Sri Krishna, was able to reach the heavenly planet even with the self-same body. Generally, we cannot go to the heavenly planet with this body. Each and every body is suitable for certain living conditions on a particular planet. The living conditions are different on different planets. The duration of life is different. The atmospheric conditions are different. Just like Srila Prabhupada gives the example, there are so many creations. There are so many creatures, aquatics, living in the water, but we cannot live in the water. Similarly, there are creatures living in the air. Now, we cannot live in the air. So, every creature, created being, has got a suitable body for residing on a particular planet in a particular atmosphere. This is the reason why it is said here simply somebody cannot just go by some mechanical means and enter the heavenly planets. It is not possible. But Arjuna, by the grace of Lord Sri Krishna, he was able to go in the self-same body to the heavenly planet of Indra Deva. Not only he went there, it is described. He was also honored by the heavenly demigods.

**Key Quote:** "Kshine Punye Marthya Lokam Vishanti one comes down to the earthly planets when they exhaust their Punyakarma"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while pious acts can lead to the heavenly planets, the enjoyment is temporary, and one returns to the earthly plane upon exhausting the merits, referencing the Bhagavad Gita.

started position compared to the human beings on the earth, but Indra offered his seat, shared his seat with Arjuna, which means that Arjuna was able to please Indra Deva all by the grace of Lord Shri Krishna. So Srila Prabhupada says generally one can reach the heavenly planets but a pious acts recommended in the Shastras in the category of fructive activities, karma Kanda portion of the Vedas, it is described how certain types of pious activities, Punyakarya, makes one eligible in the next life to reach the heavenly planet. And as it is stated in the Bhagavad Gita 9th chapter 21st verse, when the reactions of such pious acts are spent, the enjoyer is again degraded to this earthly planet. One elevates oneself by pious acts, when the Punya is exhausted one comes back to the earth. Kshine Punye Marthya Lokam Vishanti, one comes down to the earthly planets when they exhaust their Punyakarma.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Arjuna was allowed to enter into the heavenly planets in the self same body simply by the grace of the Lord otherwise it is not possible to do so"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the traditional path to heavenly planets through pious acts with Arjuna's unique access through Krishna's grace, criticizing modern scientists' attempts to reach heavenly planets without the necessary spiritual qualifications.

So Srila Prabhupada further says, the moon is also on the level with the heavenly planets and only persons who have performed virtues, only performing sacrifices, giving charity and undergoing severe austerities, yagna daana tapa, can be allowed to enter into the heavenly planets after the duration of life of the present body. I do punya karma while in this body, while on the earth, and after I quit this body by dint of the punya karma I am elevated to the heavenly planet in the next life, not in the same life. Arjuna was allowed to enter into the heavenly planets in the self same body simply by the grace of the Lord, otherwise it is not possible to do so. So it's only the grace of Lord Krishna, by the grace of Lord Krishna anything is possible for the devotees. The present attempts to enter into the heavenly planets by the modern scientists will certainly prove futile because such scientists are not on the level of Arjuna. What was possible for Arjuna is not possible for the modern-day scientists. They are trying to go by some mechanical means to the moon planet or nowadays even the Mars planet. They cannot go like that because they don't have a suitable body which is fit for the atmosphere of the earth and they cannot go like that because they don't have a suitable body which is fit for the atmosphere conditions on those planets. Proper further says these modern scientists who are trying to go there, they are ordinary human beings without any assets of sacrifice, charity or austerities. Most of them are atheists in any case they are.

**Key Quote:** "The material body is influenced by the three modes of material nature everyone who is taken birth in this material world is influenced by the three gunas including Lord Brahma"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how the modes of passion and ignorance (Rajoguna and Tamoguna) lead to lust and greed, preventing one from reaching higher planetary systems, and how only those influenced by goodness can access them.

not performed the necessary punya karma, so how can they go? It's not possible. The material body is influenced by the three modes of material nature. Everyone who is taken birth in this material world is influenced by the three gunas, including Lord Brahma. The present population is more or less influenced by the modes of passion ignorance and the symptoms for such influence are exhibited in the becoming very lusty and greedy. Rajasthamo bhava kama lobha, the influence of Rajoguna and Tamoguna, passion and ignorance modes of material nature, is that one becomes lusty and greedy, kama krodha, sorry kama and lobha. So with such a religious consciousness one cannot enter the heavenly planets. Social a proper further says such degraded fellows can hardly approach the higher planetary systems. Above the heavenly planets there are many other planets also which only those who are influenced by goodness can reach. In heavenly and other planets with inhabitants are all highly intelligent. So this is a piece of information.

**Key Quote:** "Become a devotee of Lord Sri Krishna then you have the favor of the demigods also but somebody is simply trying to satisfy some devata not necessarily they will be favored by Krishna"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the superior intelligence and piety of the inhabitants of heavenly planets, highlighting that they are devotees of the Lord, and reiterates that devotion to Krishna ensures the favor of the demigods, concluding the lecture.

authentic fact for the modern-day scientists. Some of them believe that humans are the most intelligent persons in this entire material creation, but they do not know the devatas in the higher planets, the rishis, the sages, they are many times more intelligent than the human beings from the earth. They are all pious in the higher and highest mode of goodness, that's also a qualification. They are pious, Punya, in the higher and highest modes of goodness, that means they are almost situated in entirely in goodness, though in the material world there's nothing like exclusive goodness, there's always a tinge of the influence of rajoguna, tamoguna, always it is there in the conditioned souls. So these inhabitants of the heavenly planets, they are highly intelligent, they are very pious, they have so much of Punya karma and most importantly they are all devotees of the Lord. All of them in the heavenly planets, they are all devotees, Vishnu Bhaktas, Mitho, Daiva and although their goodness is not unadulterated, there's some tinge still they are known as demigods possessing the maximum amount of good qualities possible in the material world. So this is a very important point that we need to understand. This is the description by Srila Prabhupada in this purport. So we should understand become a devotee of Lord Sri Krishna then you have the favor of the demigods also, but somebody is simply trying to satisfy some devata not necessarily they will be favored by Krishna. I'll stop here thank you very.

**Key Quote:** "When I stayed for some days as a guest in the heavenly planets all the heavenly demigods including King Indradeva took shelter of my arms which were marked with the Gandiva bow to kill the demon named Nivartakavacha O King, descendant of Aja Meedha at the present moment I am dead to you. I am bereft of the supreme personality of Godhead by whose influence I was so powerful."
**Summary:** Arjuna remembers his past glories and acknowledges that his power and success were due to Krishna's grace, expressing his current feeling of separation from the Lord.

In this session we will be discussing from three verses, 13, 14 and 15 of the 15th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 13th verse first: Tatraiva Mev Viharato Bhujadanda Yugvam Gandiva Lakshanam Arati Vadhaya Devaha Sendra Shrita Yad Anubhavitam Aaja Meedha Tenah Madhya Mushita Purushena Bhumah. Meaning of this verse is: When I stayed for some days as a guest in the heavenly planets, all the heavenly demigods including King Indradeva took shelter of my arms which were marked with the Gandiva bow to kill the demon named Nivartakavacha. O King, descendant of Aja Meedha, at the present moment I am dead to you. I am bereft of the supreme personality of Godhead by whose influence I was so powerful. So Arjuna is recollecting when he went to the heavenly planets, he stayed there some time under the grace of Krishna, even Indra was taking shelter of the protection of Arjuna because Arjuna was expert in using his Gandiva bow to kill the misguided demon, to kill the miscreants. So there was one demon by name Nivartakavacha, he was troubling the demigods, but he was killed by Arjuna using his Gandiva bow. So that is being recollected by Arjuna. O King, descendant of Aja Meedha, at the present moment I am bereft of the supreme personality of Godhead.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's purport emphasizes that a devotee's power comes from Krishna's grace and is subject to His will, highlighting the importance of surrender.

Arjuna is feeling the separation from Krishna after Krishna departed for his own personal abode where he is eternally situated. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada gives this brief purport. He says, "The heavenly demigods are certainly more intelligent, powerful and beautiful and yet they had to take help from Arjuna because of his Gandiva bow which was empowered by the grace of Lord Sri Krishna." It is not simply another weapon or another bow or another set of arrows, no. It was the Gandiva bow which Arjuna was actually having and which is described as transcendental in the hands of the pure devotees or the Supreme Lord, whatever be the particular item it is all auspicious. The Lord is all powerful and by his grace his pure devotee can be as powerful as he may desire and there is no limit to it. And when the Lord withdraws his power from anyone he is powerless by the will of the Lord. So devotees powerful or powerless according to the will of the Lord is completely surrendered. He does not demand.

**Key Quote:** "But because of his friendship I, seated on the chariot was able to cross over it and only by his grace was I able to regain the cows and also collect by force many helmets of the kings which were bedecked with jewels that were sources of all brilliance."
**Summary:** Arjuna recalls the formidable strength of the Kauravas during the battle of Kurukshetra and how he was able to overcome them through Krishna's grace, even during the Pandavas' exile.

The fourteenth verse. The meaning of this verse is: The military strength of the Kauravas was like an ocean in which there dwelled many invincible existences and thus it was insurmountable. But because of his friendship I, seated on the chariot, was able to cross over it and only by his grace was I able to regain the cows and also collect by force many helmets of the kings which were bedecked with jewels that were sources of all brilliance. Again Arjuna is recollecting that the battle of Kurukshetra, the Kaurava's strength was formidable, almost unconquerable, but by the grace of Krishna Arjuna was able to conquer it. Arjuna was able to defeat the Kauravas and defeat them. And even in the fight against the Kauravas when they attacked the Pandavas while the Pandavas were in exile, by the grace of Krishna only Arjuna was able to defeat the Kauravas who had defeated them, who had stolen the cows

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's purport highlights Arjuna's unique position in the chariot driven by Krishna and how he single-handedly managed the war, emphasizing Krishna's protection even during the Pandavas' incognito exile and the battle to rescue the cows.

of the king of Virat Pradesh. So all this is possible only by the grace of Krishna. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport: "On the Kaurava's side there were many stalwart commanders like Bhishma, Drona, Kripa and Kripa. And their military strength was as insurmountable as the great ocean. And yet it is due to Lord Krishna's grace that Arjuna was alone sitting on the chariot. Even then he could manage to vanquish the Kauravas one after another without difficulty." Even though their strength was more, but Krishna's grace and Arjuna was able to defeat the Kauravas even though their strength was insurmountable. Now another interesting point Prabhupada says: "There were many changes of commanders on the other side," that means on the Kaurava's side. "But on the Pandava's side Arjuna alone in the chariot driven by Lord Krishna could manage the whole responsibility of the great war." See the mercy of the Lord Krishna on the Pandavas, especially on Arjuna. Similarly when the Pandavas were living at the palace of Virata incognito, that was the challenge offered by the Kauravas, that the Pandavas lost the gambling match and they had to go to the forest, 12 years just live in the forest, and 13th year live in exile. So even while the Pandavas were living in incognito condition in the exile, the Kauravas picked a quarrel and decided to take away his large number of cows of the place where the Pandavas had sought shelter. Arjuna actually fought with those Kauravas even remaining incognito, and he was able to rescue the cows. So Arjuna remembered all this was possible because

**Summary:** The lecture moves to the 15th verse, explaining how Krishna controls the duration of life and influences the battlefield, diminishing the Kauravas' strength and enthusiasm.

of the grace of Krishna. The 15th verse: yobhishmakarana gurushalya chamushvadabhra rajanyavarya rathamandalamanditasu agrecharomamavibhorathayuthapanam ayurmanamsi chadrusha saha oja archat. The meaning of this verse is: It was he only who withdrew the duration of life from everyone, and who in the battlefield withdrew the speculative power and strength of enthusiasm from the great military phalanx made by the Kauravas headed by Bhishma, Karna, Drona, Shalya etc. Their arrangement was expert and more than adequate, but he Lord Shri Krishna was going forward with all this. Sorry. But he Lord Krishna while going forward did all this. He shortened the duration of the life. He enabled Arjuna to cross over the mighty ocean of strength of the Kauravas. So in the purport Shri Ram Prabhupada says: "The absolute personality of Godhead Lord Shri Krishna expands himself by his plenary Paramatma portion in everyone's heart, and thus he directs everyone in the matter of recollection, forgetfulness, knowledge, the absence of intelligence and all psychological activities."

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is seated in everyone's heart regardless of whether they are devotee or not devotee. And Krishna only gives someone intelligence."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's purport explains that Krishna resides in everyone's heart, granting intelligence and knowledge, and that the battle of Kurukshetra was orchestrated by Krishna to establish Yudhishthira as emperor.

This is stated in the 15th chapter, 15th verse of the Bhagavad Gita: sarvasya caaham hrithi sannivitam matta smritir jnanam apohanam ca. Krishna is seated in everyone's heart regardless of whether they are devotee or not devotee, and Krishna only gives someone intelligence, Krishna only gives someone knowledge like that. So it is further described by Shri Ram Prabhupada: "As the Supreme Lord He can increase or decrease the duration of life of a living being." It is in Krishna's hands our duration of life. Thus the Lord conducted the battle of Kurukshetra according to his own plan. He wanted that battle to establish Yudhishthira as the emperor of this planet. So the battle of Kurukshetra was arranged by Krishna. Even though it looked like the Pandavas and Kauravas could not make a settlement of sharing the kingdom, but when a Kshatriya is offered a challenge, he cannot refuse. It is considered that he is not a worthy Kshatriya. So this battle of Kurukshetra was planned by Krishna in order to establish Yudhishthira as the emperor of the planet.

**Summary:** The lecture concludes by reiterating that Krishna's will is supreme and that Arjuna's victory was made possible by Krishna's causeless mercy and tactical support, protecting the Pandavas even before the battle began.

This was Krishna's plan. And Krishna also facilitated the transcendental business to kill all who were on the opposite side by his omnipotent will. Krishna simply has to will. Everything happens whatever he wills. So that was also possible only by the grace of Krishna. The other party, that is the Kauravas party, was equipped with all military strength supported by big generals like Bhishma, Drona, Shalya, and it would have been physically impossible for Arjuna to win the battle had the Lord not helped him by every kind of tactic. So Krishna out of his mercy, causeless mercy, on his affectionate devotee, he enabled Arjuna to actually face the army, defeat the army of the Kauravas, and actually win the battle. And even before the battle, the Pandavas and Arjuna were protected by Krishna. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "protection by the lord means complete protection 100 protection"
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Arjuna was protected by Krishna's grace, comparing it to Prahlad Maharaj's protection by Lord Nrsimadeva from the demons.

In this session, we will be discussing the first part of the sixteenth verse of the fifteenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The sixteenth verse is as follows: Yad doshu ma pranihitam guru bhishma karna, naptra trigarta shalya saindhava bahli kaadyai, astrani amogha mahimani nirupitani, nopas prushur nriharidasam ivasurani. The meaning of this verse is: Great generals like Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Bhurishrava, Susharma, Shalya, Jayadratha, and Balika all directed their invincible weapons against me. But by his, that is Lord Krishna's, grace, they could not even touch a hair on my head. Similarly, Prahlad Maharaj, the supreme devotee of Lord Nrsimadeva, was unaffected by the weapons the demons used against him. So Arjuna is telling, because of Lord Krishna's grace, Arjuna was completely protected, that even the powerful Kaurava generals, they could not touch even one hair of Arjuna. In a fierce battle like that, how is it that Arjuna escaped completely unhurt, only by the grace of Krishna? And a comparison is made, just like Prahlad Maharaj was a pure devotee of Lord Nrsimadeva, and he was unaffected by so much trouble given by the demons, in so many ways, they tried to kill him, but they could not. Similarly, in the battle of Kurukshetra, the enemy party tried to kill the Pandavas, but they could not do anything to the Pandavas. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "The history of Prahlad Maharaj, the great devotee of Nrsimadeva, is narrated in the 7th chapter, Pralad Maharaj, a small child of only five years, became the object of envy for his great father, Hiranyakashyapu, only because of his becoming a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord. The demon father employed all his weapons to kill the devotee's son, Prahlad, but by the grace of the Lord, Prahlad was saved from all the troubles, and he was not killed. He was saved from all sorts of dangerous actions by his father. Hiranyakashyapu attempted in so many ways, let me kill this boy, but Hiranyakashyapu was unsuccessful, because all the while, Prahlad was perfectly protected by Lord Nrsimadeva directly." And Srila Prabhupada lists here how Prahlad was put into dangerous situations: he was thrown in a fire, in boiling oil, he was thrown from the top of a hill, he was attempted to be crushed under the legs of an elephant, he was administered poison, and at last the father himself took up a chopper to kill his son, and thus Nrsimadeva appeared and killed the heinous father in the presence of the son. So protection by the Lord means complete protection, 100% protection. So Srila Prabhupada concludes this portion by telling, "Thus no one can kill the devotee of the Lord. Similarly, Arjuna was also saved by the Lord, although all dangerous weapons were employed by his great opponents like Bhishma, Karna, etc." So it's a fact that Arjuna was really saved only because of...

#### Karna's role in Duryodhana's court, Gambling match, Draupadi's humiliation, Karna's anger towards Draupadi

**Key Quote:** "Karna was very enthusiastic to declare the news, and it is he who ordered Dushasana to take away the garments of both the Pandavas and Draupadi."
**Summary:** The speaker details Karna's involvement in Duryodhana's court, his role in the gambling match, and his anger towards Draupadi, leading to her humiliation.

When Duryodhana was in power, he enthroned Karna in the state of Anga. Being baffled in his attempt to win Draupadi, Karna advised Duryodhana to attack King Drupada, and after defeating him, both Arjuna and Draupadi could be arrested. But Dronacharya rebuked them for this conspiracy, and they refrained from the action. Karna was defeated many times, not only by Arjuna, but also by Bhimasena. He was a king of the kingdom of Bengal, Orissa, and Madras combined. Later on, Karna took an active part in the Rajasuya sacrifice of Maharaja Yudhishthira, and when there was gambling between the rival brothers designed by Shakuni, Karna took part in the game, and he was very pleased when Draupadi was offered as a bet in the gambling. That gambling match was ill-fated for the Pandavas. The Pandavas were losing, and Yudhishthira was placing as a bet even Draupadi, and themselves also as a bet. When Draupadi was in the game, Karna was very enthusiastic to declare the news, and it is he who ordered Dushasana to take away the garments of both the Pandavas and Draupadi, because Karna was very much angry against Draupadi, because Draupadi, Swayamvara, Karna was not able to participate, because he was declared as the son of a carpenter, a shudra. So the Pandavas, when they could not protect Draupadi in that gambling match, at that time, Karna asked Draupadi to select another husband, because she was lost by the Pandavas.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Karna's continued enmity towards the Pandavas, his arrogant claims, and his eventual death at the hands of Arjuna due to Krishna's grace.

Now Karna maintained enmity against the Pandavas, though they had no reason actually. Specifically, he had no reason, but he maintained his enmity against the Pandavas. And he tried to curb them in so many ways. Now, during the battle of Kurukshetra, he could understand that because Krishna was the chariot driver of Arjuna, he understood that the Pandavas will win the battle. And Karna had some difference of opinion on Bhishma, and sometimes he was very, very proud of his prowess, and he said in his pride, "I can defeat the Pandavas in five days, if Bhishma would not interfere with my plan of action." This is the arrogant statement of Karna. Now when Bhishma died, Karna was very much mortified. Karna killed the largest number of Pandava soldiers. When there was a severe fight with Arjuna, then Karna was able to knock off Arjuna's helmet. And that's a big achievement because Arjuna was a very, very powerful fighter. Now when Karna was fighting Arjuna, his chariot wheel got stuck in the battlefield mud. And he got down from his chariot to set the wheel right, but Arjuna took the opportunity and killed Karna when Karna was fixing the wheel of the chariot.

When he was going to marry in the Shalya Desha on the way to Kamyavana, he happened to see Draupadi again. And it was too late. He was too much attracted to her. The Pandavas and Draupadi were then in exile and after losing their empire in gambling and Jayadratha thought that he would send news to Draupadi in an illicit manner through one Koti Shasya, one of his associates. See lust when it attacks. A person becomes a victim and unable to remain focused on his actual present situation and still carries that desire I want to enjoy Draupadi in an illicit way. So when Jayadratha tried to... Approach Draupadi in an illicit manner, Draupadi at once refused vehemently the proposal of Jayadratha. But because Jayadratha was so much attracted by Draupadi's beauty, he tried again and again and again and again to approach Draupadi. So finally he made a plan. To forcibly take away Draupadi on his chariot. And while he attempted that, at first Draupadi gave him a good dashing and he fell down like a cut root tree.

**Summary:** Arjuna is remembering past events and his intimate relationship with Krishna, highlighting Krishna's mercy and kindness towards his devotees.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Jai Vanarottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 17th verse of the 15th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Sautye Vratakumatinatmada Ishwarome Yadpada Padmam Abhavaya Bhajantibhavya Maam Shrantavaham Arayo Rathino Bhuvishtham Napraharan Yad Anubhava Nirastam Yadpada Padmam Abhavaya Bhajantibhavya. The meaning of this verse is: It was by his mercy only that my enemies neglected to kill me when I descended from my chariot to get water for my thirsty horses. And it was due to my lack of esteem for my lord that I dared engage him as my chariot driver, for he is worshipped and offered services by the best men to attain salvation. So Arjuna is recollecting some past incidents in his intimate relationship with the Supreme Lord Krishna. And it is clearly established that Krishna is very, very merciful to his devotees, especially his pure devotees. He is very, very kind, very merciful, and he is ready to do anything for his devotees. So this is a good point that is being brought out by Arjuna that Krishna, who is worshipped and offered services by the best of men to attain salvation, is a very, very merciful person. That Supreme Lord, Arjuna is thinking, I dared engage him as my chariot driver.

#### Impersonalists vs. Devotees, Brahman effulgence, Vedanta philosophy

**Key Quote:** "The Supreme Lord, the personality of God is Sri Krishna, is the object of worship, both by impersonalists..."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains the difference between impersonalists and devotees in their worship of Krishna, highlighting that even impersonalists indirectly worship Krishna's effulgence.

So Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport, a little elaborately, this point. The Supreme Lord, the personality of God is Sri Krishna, is the object of worship, both by impersonalists and by the devotees of the Lord. The impersonalists worship his glowing effulgence emanating from his transcendental body of eternal form, bliss, and knowledge. So there are two categories of transcendentalists who are followers of the Vedanta philosophy presented by Vyasa Deva. The first category are the impersonalists, so they worship the impersonal Brahman. Now what is this impersonal Brahman? This impersonal Brahman is a glowing effulgence coming out of the transcendental form of Krishna. So the impersonalists are also worshiping Krishna, but they are unable to approach the personality of Krishna because of their impersonal conception. They cannot go beyond the Brahma Jyothi or the Brahman effulgence. And Krishna says this in the Eshopanishad, it is mentioned that the Supreme Lord, his transcendental form, is covered by his dazzling effulgence emanating from his transient form, the Brahma Jyothi or the impersonal Brahman. And here Prabhupada continues to explain that devotees, the second category of transcendentalists who are followers of the Vedanta philosophy presented by Vyasa Deva, they are the devotees who involve themselves in and on the...

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is not only for the devotees or only for the transcendentalists who follow the Vedanta which is the correct philosophy but he is for everyone because everyone is his part and parcel"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna is the source of everything, including the Brahman effulgence, and that He is accessible to everyone as all beings are His parts and parcels.

they are the devotees who are the together followers of St Karmakaria know Fifuge USA by the Vere verde by Massalan Kah τιςa veni s flats that precise understanding is there pertamata 지금 the seda the sada usthiyab talk us e voln and vesala brother Wis merely at two details this concept can be explained with the hilaryfficient intent we did not understand sense or logic so we want to understand what is the difference between the 21st classويkat geography of Virtual Republic of India. The bhakti yogis or the pure devotees, they worship him as the supreme personality of Godhead. They directly worship the source, the source of everything including the Brahman effulgence. Krishna is the source of the Brahman effulgence. Brahmanohi pratishtaham, in the Bhagavad Gita Krishna explains, I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman, Krishna says. And the Brahmasamhita says yasyaprabha prabhavato jagadhanda koti govindam adipurusham tamaham bhajami, that primeval Lord Govinda Krishna, yasyaprabha, his bodily effulgence is the Brahma Jyoti. So further Srila Prabhupada says, those who are below even the impersonalists consider him to be one of the great historical personalities. Apart from the Vedantas who follow the Vedanta philosophy presented by Vyasa Deva, there are others also, there are other philosophers, other transcendentalists, they consider him to be one of the great historical personalities. The Lord, however, descends to attract all by his specific transcendental pastimes. Krishna is not only for the devotees or only for the transcendentalists who follow the Vedanta which is the correct philosophy, but he is for everyone because everyone is his part and parcel, his own. Mama eva misho jiva loke jiva bhoota sanatana ha sarva bhutani asheshani drakshasi atmani atomai. So in several places in the Bhagavad Gita Krishna explains very carefully, sarva yonisha kaunteya murtriya sambhavanti yaha tasam brahma mahad yonir aham bija pradapita. I am the seed giving father for all the living entities who take birth in this material world. At the beginning of creation, all living beings belong to me, they are mine.

#### Krishna's omnipresence, Forgetfulness of Krishna, Krishna's incarnations

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna never forsakes anybody Krishna never disowns anybody Krishna is never away from anyone but we are forgetful"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna is always present and active within every living being, even though we may forget or neglect Him, and that He incarnates to attract everyone through His transcendental pastimes.

they are within me, they are in me, they are my own part and parcel eternally, they are my parts, they belong to me. So Krishna does not disown anybody. Though we may forget Krishna, we may try to be independent of Krishna, we may be neglectful of Krishna, though he is prominent in our life even in this material world. Bhagavad Gita elaborately explains this, how Krishna is prominent in our ordinary life even in this material world as Paramatma has entered our heart and then he is conducting all the affairs of this body. We are totally helpless in this body because we are spirit and this body is made up of the material energy. So for us material energy is foreign, a foreign substance. So we do not know what is this body, we do not know how to use this body, we cannot live in this body and utilize this body, but Krishna facilitates us, Paramatma. So he is active every moment, he is active within every living being, only then the living being can actually live in the body and utilize the body for whatever purposes the living entity wants to. So Krishna never forsakes anybody, Krishna never disowns anybody, Krishna is never away from anyone, but we are forgetful. We means the living entities in the material world who have taken birth by force of karma are the ones who are forgetful of Krishna, are the ones who are neglecting Krishna, are the ones who are wanting to be independent of Krishna. So here Srila Prabhupada says the Supreme Lord Krishna descends, comes down to this material world, that's what we say, he incarnates to attract all by his specific transcendental pastimes and thus he plays the part of the most perfect master, friend, son, and lover. These are the personal relationships Krishna has with his personal devotees: perfect master. He plays the part of the master when the devotee wants to serve him as a servant. When the devotee wants to serve him as his friend, then he acts as a perfect friend. When the devotee wants to act as his father or mother, he plays the part of the perfect son. And when the devotee wants him as her beloved, then he plays the part of the perfect lover.

#### Krishna's intimate relationships, Yoga Maya, Devotee's perspective

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Intelligent men are attracted by the transcendental acting of the lord with a pure, unalloyed devotee like Arjuna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Krishna engages in intimate relationships with His devotees, facilitated by Yoga Maya, and that devotees are never at fault for engaging with Krishna in this way.

His transcendental relationship, Arjuna was in friendship and a lot, therefore played the part perfectly as he did with his parents, lovers, and wives. While playing in such a perfect transcendental relation, that devotee forgets by the internal potency of the Lord that his friend or son is a supreme personality of God. Arjuna is repenting that how dare I engaged him as my chariot driver. He is a supreme lord. But the fact is Arjuna is made to forget that Krishna is the supreme lord by Krishna's internal potency, yoga maya, so that it can facilitate the intimate pastimes in Krishna's relationship with his devotees. Now Srila Prabhupada says Krishna wants to play the perfect part as the son or the friend or the lover. And sometimes even though the yoga maya practice is not perfect, the yoga maya covers the fact that Krishna is a supreme lord in his dealings with his devotees. Sometimes the devotee is bewildered by the acts of the lord. So after the departure of the lord, Arjuna was conscious of his great friend. But there is no mistake on the part of Arjuna. We should not think Arjuna made a big mistake by engaging Krishna as his chariot driver. Nor any. Arjuna was not wrongly thinking that Krishna is my friend. No. Intelligent men are attracted by the transcendental acting of the lord with a pure, unalloyed devotee like Arjuna. So it requires intelligence to understand Krishna's dealings with his pure devotees. Others who are conversant with the pure devotional, only they can appreciate Krishna's kindness and magnanimity and love for his devotees. Only on a pure devotional platform, we can understand these dealings of Krishna. Otherwise, we may mistake either that Krishna is an ordinary person or we may wrongly think that devotees are too puffed up and proud to engage Krishna as their friend or as their son or as their lover. No. There is no mistake on the part of the devotees. Neither Krishna is an ordinary person. He retains, he is eternally the transcendental supreme personality of Godhead. But he, out of his own sweet will, he wants his devotees to serve him in an intimate way, as his son or, sorry, as his mother or father or lover or friend. Krishna wants that. And therefore, the devotees are never at fault. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

#### Krishna's mercy, Devotee-Deity relationship, Intimacy with Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This brings out very clearly how Krishna is very, very kind to his pure devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses verses 18 and 19 of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on Arjuna's remembrance of Krishna's pastimes and highlighting Krishna's immense mercy and intimate relationship with his devotees.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Jai Vanarottamam Deviim Saraswatim Vyasam Tatho Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing from three verses, verse numbers 18, 19, and 20 of the 15th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. So, one verse at a time. The 18th verse to begin with. Narmani Udara Ruchira Smita Shobhitani He Partha He Arjuna Sakhe Kuru Nanda Neti Sanjal Pitani Naradeva Hrudis Prushani Smartur Luthanti Hrudayam Mama Madhavasya. Beautiful verse. Now the translation of this 18th verse. This is spoken by Arjuna to Yudhishthira. He is recollecting the nice pastimes of Krishna in Arjuna's relationship with Krishna as his friend. So, Arjuna is telling, "O King! His jokings and frank talks were pleasing and beautifully decorated with smiles. He addresses unto me. His addresses unto me as O son of Pritha, O friend, O son of the Kuru dynasty, and all such heartiness are now remembered by me, and thus I am overwhelmed." The 19th verse. Shayasana Atana Vikathana Bhojana Adishu Aikyad Vyasya Rutavan Iti Vipralabdhaha Sakhyu Sakheva Pitthana Itruvatthana Yasyasarvam Sehe Mahan Mahitaya Kumater Aghamme. Yet another verse spoken by Arjuna remembering Krishna's intimate dealings with Arjuna. So, the translation of this 19th verse. Generally, both of us used to live together and sleep, sit, and loiter together. And at the time of advertising oneself for acts of chivalry, sometimes, if there were any irregularity, I used to reproach him by saying, "My friend, you are very truthful." Even in those hours when his value was minimized, he, being the supreme soul, used to tolerate all those utterings of mine, excusing me exactly as a true friend excuses his true friend, or a father excuses his son. This brings out very clearly how Krishna is very, very kind to his pure devotees. Krishna is worshipped as He Krishna Karunasindho. Karunasindho means he is the ocean of mercy. Krishna is very, very merciful, even to ordinary beings like us. How can we understand this? Because even though we have almost totally forgotten him, he never forgets us, and personally, he is present in each of our hearts as the Paramatma. He is sitting there, guiding us, providing us, fulfilling our desires, acting as our topmost well-wisher, and instructing us how we can go back to him for eternal life full of bliss and knowledge, in our eternal loving relationship with him.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna relishes more the dealings of his intimate devotees when they regard him as their equal or their subordinate and even sometimes reproach him in their dealings."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Krishna's unparalleled mercy, even towards those who have forgotten Him, and explains that Krishna values the intimate dealings and even reproaches from His pure devotees more than formal Vedic hymns.

He is making so many arrangements in this material world. So certainly Krishna is rightly addressed in this prayer as He Krishna Karunasindho, Dinabandho Jagatpate. He is the Supreme Lord, the Master, the Supreme Master, but still he is Dinabandho. He is the friend of the poor, and the weak, and the fallen, and the downtrodden. He is the friend. He is the true friend because he is an ocean of mercy. He is the ocean of compassion, ocean of mercy for all such souls in this material world. But when it comes to Krishna's dealings with his pure devotees, he is even more merciful to them, even more merciful. As it is, he is very, very merciful to everyone, but he is even more merciful to his pure devotees. Now in the purport to this 19th verse, Srila Prabhupada says, a brief purport. Since the Supreme Lord, Sri Krishna, is all perfect, his transcendental pastimes with his pure devotees never lack anything in any respect either as a friend, son, or lover. The Lord relishes the reproaches of friends, parents, of fiancés, more than the Vedic hymns offered to him by great learned scholars and religionists in an official fashion. Here is a very important point. Krishna relishes more the dealings of his intimate devotees when they regard him as their equal or their subordinate and even sometimes reproach him in their dealings. Krishna likes that. Krishna relishes that more. Those are the words used by Prabhupada here. He relishes the reproaches of friends, parents, or fiancés more than the Vedic hymns. The Vedic hymns are, of course, always glorifying Krishna as the Supreme in all respects, as the Supreme Controller, Supreme Master, Supreme Proprietor, Supremely opulent, Supremely knowledgeable, in every way he is the Supreme in every respect.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts formal glorification of Krishna with the intimate loving relationships He shares with His devotees, highlighting that Krishna cherishes the latter more and introduces the next verse.

But, when somebody glorifies Krishna by chanting those Vedic hymns that just glorify his greatness, Krishna doesn't relish that as much as he relishes the dealings with his pure devotees in which they regard him as their intimate friend or intimate son or intimate lover.

#### Krishna's plan, Devotee's surrender, Divine arrangement

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "In order to keep the words of the great Muni, the Lord himself kidnapped his wives from the protection of Arjuna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the apparent contradiction in verse 20, where Arjuna is defeated and Krishna's wives are kidnapped, by narrating a story from the Vishnu Purana and Brahma Purana about a curse and Krishna's arrangement to fulfill it.

The meaning of this verse is, "O Emperor, now I am separated from my friend and dear most well-wisher, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore my heart appears to be void of everything. In his absence, I have been defeated by a number of infidel, and I have heard men while I was guarding the bodies of all the wives of Krishna." After Krishna's disappearance, this was an incident that took place that Arjuna was taking charge of protecting the wives of Krishna and something happened that is very bewildering when we hear that some infidel, coward men, they defeated Arjuna and actually kidnapped the wives of Krishna. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains this point. The important point in this verse is how it was possible that Arjuna could be defeated by a gang of ignoble, coward men and how such mundane, coward men could touch the bodies of the wives of Lord Krishna who are under the protection of Arjuna. So Srila Vishwanachakravarti Thakur, one of our previous Acharyas, has justified the contradiction by research in the Vishnu Purana and Brahma Purana. This is explained in two other Puranas. In these Puranas, it is said that once the fair denizens of heaven pleased Ashtavakra Muni by their service and were blessed by the Muni to have the Supreme Lord as their husband. Ashtavakra Muni was curved in eight joints of his body and thus he used to move in a peculiar curved manner. The daughters of the demigods could not check their laughter upon seeing the movements of the Muni, Ashtavakra Muni. And the Muni being angry at them cursed them that they would be kidnapped by rogues even if they would get the Lord as their husband. Later on, the girls again satisfied the Muni by their prayers and the Muni blessed them that they would regain their husband even after being robbed by the rogues. So, in order to keep the words of the great Muni, the Lord himself kidnapped his wives from the protection of Arjuna. Otherwise, they would have at once vanished from the scene as soon as they were touched by the rogues. Besides that, some of the gopis who prayed to become wives of the Lord returned to their respective positions after their desire was fulfilled. After the departure of Lord Krishna, he wanted all his entourage back to Godhead and they were called back under different conditions only.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna wants back all his entourage, but he is there because he wants back all of his entourage."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating Krishna's desire to bring all His devotees back to Godhead and explains that the events described are part of His divine plan to call them back under different circumstances.

So, here the explanation is given that some incident that took place in the past for some of the devotees that they were first blessed that they would get the Lord as their husband, Lord Krishna as their husband. And then, they displeased the Munis somehow and they were cursed that they would be kidnapped by some rogues. And later on again, they prayed to Ashtavakra Muni to pardon their mistake and being pleased with their prayers, he again blessed them that even after being kidnapped, they would be able to get back the Supreme Lord as their husband. So, Krishna, in order to keep the words of this Ashtavakra Muni intact, he himself disguised as some ignoble covered men and kidnapped his own wives even though they were under the protection of Arjuna. And after being kidnapped by Krishna himself, disguised as ignoble covered men, Krishna later on revealed to them that I am your husband. So, it is described here that after the departure of Lord Krishna, he wants back all his entourage. Krishna wants back all his entourage, but he is there because he wants back all of his entourage. So, he made up his mind for that purpose, for his own sake. And his plan is that people will not be returned to the same state as the ones who have lived all these years in his personal abode. And he calls them under different circumstances as part of this past times. In the ignoble covered men defeating Arjuna and kidnapping the wives of Krishna.

#### Krishna's power, devotee empowerment, detachment
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/IEVtBnCURC0?t=45
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "But in the absence of Lord Krishna, all of them at a moment's notice have become null and void."
**Summary:** Arjuna's realization that his powers were dependent on Krishna's presence, illustrated with analogies of clarified butter on ashes, magic wand money, and seeds on barren land.

In this session we will be discussing four verses, verse numbers twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three and twenty-four of the fifteenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The twenty-first verse is as follows. The meaning of this verse is: "I have the very same Gandiva bow, the same arrows, the same chariot drawn by the same horses. I have the same horses and I am the same Arjuna to whom all the kings offer their due respects. But in the absence of Lord Krishna, all of them at a moment's notice have become null and void. It is exactly like offering clarified butter on ashes, accumulating money with a magic wand or sowing seeds on barren land." So these words are very significant words, which explain to us that as long as it is required, for Krishna's pastimes, He empowers His devotees with extraordinary power. But these powers given by Krishna are not required for the devotees to go back home to Godhead. They were only meant for Krishna to enact his pastimes. So after Krishna's pastimes have been wound up, the devotees do experience that they do not have the same powers they had when Krishna was present. Like Arjuna, he is having the same Gandiva bow, the same chariot drawn by the same horses, he's the same Arjuna, but now he is bereft of all those powers that he had. With the Gandiva bow in his hand, he could defeat many, many, many powerful Kshatriyas. Now when he tried to protect the wives of Krishna, some gnome-like, cavaad men easily defeated him and kidnapped him. So his Gandiva bow was ineffective. So Arjuna is recollecting that in the absence of Lord Krishna, all of them have become null and void. Now Arjuna is giving three examples of how they have become null and void. It is like offering clarified butter on ashes. When you pour clarified butter on it, it's the beginning of the purification process. If you put butter into a blazing fire and there is sufficient fuel, then the fire will blaze even more strongly. But you pour any amount of ghee into ashes, there will be no fire. Or another example given here is accumulating money with a magic wand. Sometimes magicians they show, display some magic. They have got something called a magic wand, like a stick. They just move the stick and suddenly in their hand there will be so much money. But that money is not real money, it is an optical illusion, it is a magical effect for entertaining some audience. There is no real money there. You cannot get money by just waving one stick in a magic show. There is no real money there. Similarly, sowing seeds on a barren land, it is useless. Those seeds won't fructify, they won't grow, they won't germinate. The land has to be fertile. Then only sowing good seeds will have some effect. Then only sowing good seeds will have some benefit. Similarly, in the absence of Lord Krishna, all those empowerments are no longer valid because Krishna has withdrawn them.

**Key Quote:** "All energies and powers are derived from the Supreme Source, Lord Krishna. And they act as long as He desires. And all of them cease to function as soon as He withdraws."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's explanation that all power comes from Krishna, using the analogy of an electrical powerhouse, and that material advancement without Krishna's blessing is futile.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "As we have discussed more than once, one should not be puffed up by borrowed plumes. All energies and powers are derived from the Supreme Source, Lord Krishna. And they act as long as He desires. And all of them cease to function as soon as He withdraws." Prabhupada gives an example to help us understand. "All electrical energies are received from the powerhouse. And as soon as the powerhouse stops supplying energy, the bulbs are of no use. There are so many arrangements for lighting up a big palace or a big mansion. But as long as there is power supply from the electrical source, the powerhouse, these bulbs will glow very nicely. But as soon as the powerhouse stops supplying energy, the bulbs are of no use. In a moment's time, such energies can be generated or withdrawn by the Supreme Will of the Lord. Material civilization without the blessings of the Lord is child's play only. As long as the parents allow the child to play, it is all right. As soon as the parents withdraw, the child has to stop." Prabhupada is giving an example to help us understand. Human civilization and all activities thereof must be dovetailed with the supreme blessing of the Lord. And without this blessing, all advancement of human civilization is like decoration on a dead body. It is said here that a dead civilization and its activities are something like clarified butter on ashes, the accumulation of money by a magic wand, and the sowing of seeds on a barren land. The blessings of the Lord's blessings, all our attempts at independent existence in this material world are futile.

**Key Quote:** "Factually this is all due to the supreme will of the Lord, the personality of Godhead. Sometimes people kill one another, and at other times, they protect one another."
**Summary:** Arjuna recounts the demise of the Yadus due to a brahmana's curse and their intoxication, emphasizing that everything happens according to the supreme will of the Lord.

Verses 22 and 23, they are given together. I will read both of them and then we will hear the translation. Rajamstvayanuprishtanam surdamna suratpure viprashapavimudhanam nignatam mushtibhir mithah varunim madhirampitva madonmathita cetasam ajanatam ivaunyonyam chatupanchavasyeshitah The meaning of these two verses is, "O King, since you have asked me about our friends and relatives in the city of Dwarka, I inform you that all of them were cursed by the brahmanas, and as a result they all became intoxicated with wine made of putrefied rice, and fought among themselves with sticks, not even recognizing one another. Now all but four or five of them are dead and gone." Yudhishthira had sent Arjuna to inquire about the well-being of the Yadus. So now Arjuna is bringing the news, after Krishna's disappearance, all of them, except for four or five, are dead and gone. And how did they die? That is also very bewildering. They fought with each other after becoming intoxicated and killed each other. Twenty-fourth verse, prayenaitad bhagavata ishwarasya vicheshtitam mitho nignanti bhutani bhavayanti chayan mithah The translation of this twenty-fourth verse, factually this is all due to the supreme will of the Lord, the personality of Godhead. Sometimes people kill one another, and at other times, they protect one another. So Arjuna is explaining that as a devotee he knows, supreme will of the supreme personality of Godhead always prevails. And by his will, sometimes people may kill each other. And at other times, by his will, people may protect each other.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "They do not know that behind the law of nature is the supreme direction of the supreme personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** Prabhupada's explanation that the law of nature is directed by Krishna, contrasting it with atheistic views, and emphasizing that peace and prosperity result from following Dharma.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "According to the anthropologists, there is nature's law of struggle for existence and survival of the fittest." One class of philosophers in this world, they are mostly atheists, and they say that this world is working according to the law of struggle for existence and survival of the fittest. But Srila Prabhupada says, they do not know that behind the law of nature is the supreme direction of the supreme personality of Godhead. That they do not know, they cannot see, they cannot understand. They do not know how nature is working. In the Bhagavad Gita, Srila Prabhupada says, "It is confirmed that the law of nature is executed under the direction of the Lord." What is the verse? Mayadhyakshena prakritihi suyatesa characharam Material nature is working perfectly according to the direction of Krishna. Whenever therefore there is peace in the world, it must be known that it is due to the goodwill of the Lord. And whenever there is upheaval in the world, it is also due to the supreme will of the Lord. Both peace as well as upheaval. Battles or wars. Both are according to the supreme will of the Supreme Lord. Not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Lord. Tenavina trinam apina chalati Even a blade of grass won't move without the sanction of the Lord. Completely he is in perfect control. Because he is Paramatman everywhere. Everyone's heart. And every single move by every living entity has to be sanctioned by the Lord. Otherwise, the living entity is unable to act or move. Whenever therefore, Srila Prabhupada says further, "There is disobedience of the established rules enacted by the Lord. There is war between men and nations." So there is a reason why Krishna sometimes wills that there be some fighting or battle between men or between nations. Why? Because there is disobedience to the established rules enacted by the Lord. Dharmam tu sakshat bhagavat pranitam Dharma means the code of conduct given by God personally for all of us. Especially for the human beings. So we have to follow those rules of Dharma given by Krishna. Then everything will be fine. There will be peace, there will be prosperity, there will be plenty of supply. There will be very cordial relations between people. Everything will be very, very nice. Just like when Yudhishthira Maharaj was ruling. When Ramachandra was ruling. When Pariksit Maharaj was ruling. There was peace, there was prosperity, there was plenty of all supplies. People were completely satisfied. They were happy in all respects.

**Key Quote:** "The surest way to the path of peace, therefore, is dovetailing everything to the established rule of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by encouraging listeners to embrace Krishna consciousness as the path to peace and prosperity, offering everything to Krishna.

So that is not a utopian idea. It's a fact. You can observe even now in places where there is predominantly Krishna consciousness, God consciousness. People live very nicely, very nicely in communities. You can visit some of these communities if you are not conversant with this fact. And see for yourself how people live very nicely in such communities. So therefore Prabhupada concludes by telling, "The surest way to the path of peace, therefore, is dovetailing everything to the established rule of the Lord." So the rule of the Lord is everything we should do in Krishna consciousness. Everything we should offer to Krishna. Then certainly there will be peace, prosperity and everything will be nice.

**Key Quote:** "This material world is a place for all those souls who belong to God, who belong to the spiritual world, but are forgetful of Krishna due to their desire to independently enjoy and their desire to lord over material nature."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that the material world is a place for souls who desire independent enjoyment and to lord over material nature, leading to the struggle for existence.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, what does this mean? Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "In the material world, the struggle for existence and survival of the fittest are laws because in the material world there is disparity between conditioned souls due to everyone's desire to lord it over the material resources." This is a very, very important point we have to understand. This material world is a place for all those souls who belong to God, who belong to the spiritual world, but are forgetful of Krishna due to their desire to independently enjoy and their desire to lord over material nature. Two very, very specific desires are the cause of our material existence.

**Key Quote:** "The desire to independently enjoy, independent of Krishna because in the spiritual world everyone is blissfully happy in association with Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the two desires that cause material existence: independent enjoyment and lording over material nature, highlighting the illusion of independence.

What are those two desires? The desire to independently enjoy, independent of Krishna, because in the spiritual world everyone is blissfully happy in association with Krishna. But if anybody wants independent enjoyment, it is not possible in the spiritual world. Then the Lord has created this material world, and in the material world, under illusion, one may think, "I am independent," though we can never be actually independent because we are very, very tiny spirit souls. We cannot be independent. But we may get the feeling that I am independent under illusion, and that's why the illusion energy is working to cover the real knowledge of who we are, the reality of Krishna being the maintainer, Krishna being the protector. The illusion energy is covering our vision of the reality, and under illusion, I am thinking I am independent. Each person is thinking like that. And also, not only that we desire independent enjoyment, we also desire to lord over material nature. And not only I desire, everyone desires like that.

**Key Quote:** "This very mentality of lording it over material nature is a root cause of conditioned life."
**Summary:** The lecture explains that the desire to be the lord is an illusion and the root cause of conditioned life, subject to the three modes of material nature.

So, therefore there is disparity. How can each one think, "I want to be the lord"? There can only be one lord. There cannot be many lords. So, therefore the reality is that under illusion somebody thinks, "I am the boss, I am the lord, I am the master, I am the enjoyer." Under illusion only. And that is created, that illusion is created because of which there appear to be laws which are like struggle for existence and survival of the fittest. So, Prabhupada further explains, "This very mentality of lording it over material nature is a root cause of conditioned life." What is the meaning of conditioned life? Conditioned life means we are subject to the conditions of material nature, which are conditions produced by interaction of the three gunas, the three modes of material nature. They are always interacting and producing different circumstances, conditions, situations. Satvam rajas tamaiti gunas prakriti sambhavaha. This is explained in the 14th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita.

**Key Quote:** "Material nature not only consists of eight elements it also consists of three gunas."
**Summary:** The speaker details the composition of material nature, including the three gunas, and how they create conditions that lead to conditioned life, emphasizing the need for surrender to Krishna.

Material nature not only consists of eight elements, it also consists of three gunas. This is a secret that is revealed in the Bhagavad Gita by Lord Krishna. Generally, people know that material matter or material energy or material nature means the five elements or the eight elements: five gross elements—earth, water, fire, air, sky; three subtle elements—mind, intelligence, ego. But they do not know material nature consists of three gunas: Satva guna, raja guna, tamo guna, and these three gunas are always interacting with each other, producing different conditions. And under those conditions, everyone is living, all those who are under the laws of nature. They are subject to the conditions imposed upon them by the three gunas interacting and producing so many changes. Continuously material nature is imposing different conditions. Adibhutam charo bhavaha. This is also explained in the 8th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. This material nature is constantly changing, in a state of flux, always, as long as material nature is active, as long as this created world is maintained, constantly in a state of flux. So, therefore we are all subject to these conditions, as long as we don't surrender to Krishna, as long as we don't take to devotional service, as long as we don't prepare ourselves to go back to Godhead. We are subject to these conditions. So that situation under which everyone is forced by material nature is called conditioned life.

To give facility to such imitation lords, the illusory energy of the Lord has created a disparity between conditioned living beings by creating the stronger and the weaker in every species of life. If you carefully observe every species, there are many, many living entities of that particular species. Among them, there are stronger and weaker. That is because the mentality of lording it over others always exists in conditioned souls. So, Srila Prabhupada further explains, "The mentality of lording it over material nature and creation has naturally created a disparity." To facilitate the living entities lording over, there are laws of karma working, and there is naturally a disparity. Some are stronger, some are weaker in each species, and therefore there is the law of struggle for existence.

Now, Srila Prabhupada contrasts this with the spiritual world. He says, "In the spiritual world, there is no such struggle for existence, conspicuous by its absence in the spiritual world." This law of struggle for existence, there is no struggle in the spiritual world at all. Nobody has to work. Nobody has to earn his livelihood. No. Everything is completely perfectly provided by Yogamaya, Krishna's arrangement. Everybody is blissful. Everybody is happy. There is no old age. There is no disease. There is no death. There is no scarcity. There is no creation or destruction. There are no modes of material nature. There is no influence of divine creating. There is no state. There is no material. So,

**Summary:** The lecture describes the spiritual world as a place where everyone desires to serve Krishna, and Krishna reciprocates by wanting to please and serve His devotees.

So, Srila Prabhupada is saying that, so in the spiritual world there is no struggle for existence because everyone there exists eternally. There is no disparity because everyone wants to render service to the Supreme Lord. In this material world, I want to be the boss and I want others to serve me. I don't want to serve anybody because I want to be the boss, I want to be the lord. And the opposite of this is the spiritual world. What is the spiritual world like? Everyone wants to serve Krishna because everyone is a devotee of Krishna, a pure devotee, and Krishna is simply sitting and receiving all service. I am the lord. No, Krishna wants to please his devotees. Krishna wants to serve his devotees in reciprocation.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is inviting, please come to that world of mine. If you follow bhakti yoga, you will come to meet in my abode, spiritual abode."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna invites everyone to return to the spiritual world through bhakti yoga, where He shares His enjoyment with all living beings.

What a wonderful atmosphere, isn't it? So this information we get from the Srimad Bhagavatam, from the confidential devotional literatures, we get this confidential knowledge. We all belong to that spiritual world. In that spiritual world, there is no disparity, there is no struggle for existence, there is no death, there is no disease, there is no old age, there are no modes of material nature, there is no destructive influence of time. Krishna is inviting, "Please come to that world of mine. If you follow bhakti yoga, you will come to meet in my abode, spiritual abode." The Lord being the creator of everything, including the living beings, factually is the proprietor and enjoyer of everything that be. If He has created, He is a proprietor, and He has created it in a particular way, it's for His enjoyment. But His enjoyment doesn't mean in His scheme of things, He is the only enjoyer. No, He wants to share that enjoyment with each one of us.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna shares unlimited love unlimited pleasure unlimited bliss unlimited everything with a tiny living entity who can only enjoy in a limited way."
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by describing the unlimited bliss and love shared by Krishna in devotional service, inviting everyone to escape the struggle of material existence and return to Him.

Even though we are very tiny and the Lord is unlimited, Lord, so obviously when He wants to enjoy, there is unlimited enjoyment available. Now Krishna shares that unlimited enjoyment or pleasure with His part and parcel living being, each and every living being. So in our devotional service interaction with Krishna, Krishna shares unlimited love, unlimited pleasure, unlimited bliss, unlimited everything with a tiny living entity who can only enjoy in a limited way. So Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says when we chant Hare Krishna, we get the experience of being immersed in an ocean of bliss, and what kind of ocean? He says, anandambudhi vardhanam, it's an ever-increasing ocean of bliss, because even in the material world we have experience of ocean, but it is always limited, even though there's a huge quantity of salt water in the ocean, but still it is limited. In the spiritual world, the ocean of bliss is ever increasing. There is plenty of bliss in the spiritual world. The ocean of bliss is ever increasing. There is plenty of bliss, but that is also ever increasing. It's not limited. That's the nature of a spiritual one. So Krishna is inviting us, "Come to that world. Don't remain here and be always engaged in struggle for existence. Get out of this place and come to me." That's Krishna's purpose every week. So that's all I have for now. We might have some questions, any questions like that? That's our time.

in all places at all times. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada very nicely explains the gist of the instructions given by Krishna in Bhagavad Gita. So Srila Prabhupada says, "Herein Arjuna refers to the instruction of the Bhagavad Gita which was imparted to him by the lord of the Bhagavad Gita on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. The lord left behind him the instructions of the Bhagavad Gita not for the benefit of Arjuna alone but also for all time and in all lands. The Bhagavad Gita being spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the essence of all Vedic wisdom." Entire Vedas have been condensed in just 700 verses in the Bhagavad Gita. It is nicely presented by the lord himself for all who have very little time to go through the vast Vedic literatures like the Upanishads, Puranas, and Vedanta Sutras. It is put within the study of the great historical epic Mahabharata which was especially prepared for the less intelligent class, namely the women, the laborers, and those who are worthless descendants of the Brahmana, Kshatriyas, and higher sections of the Vaishyas.

**Key Quote:** "Just to teach all concerned that the Bhagavad Gita can be consulted in all critical times, not only for solace for all kinds of mental agonies, but also for the way out of great entanglements which may embarrass one in some critical hour."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Arjuna's remembrance of the Bhagavad Gita serves as an example for all to consult it in times of difficulty for solace and guidance.

The problem which arose in the heart of Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra was solved by the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. Again, after the departure of the lord from the vision of earthly people, when Arjuna was face to face with being vanquished in his acquired power and prominence, he wanted again to remember the great teachings of the Bhagavad Gita just to teach all concerned that the Bhagavad Gita can be consulted in all critical times, not only for solace for all kinds of mental agonies but also for the way out of great entanglements which may embarrass one in some critical hour. Actually, Arjuna is a pure devotee. There is no need for him to specifically consult some specific literature. His personification of the ideal devotee, ideal person who follows all the instructions of Krishna, but he is teaching us through his example how whenever we have any difficulty we can rely on the teachings given by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna is present in the Bhagavad Gita as a sound representation, making it identical to the Lord himself and offering the same benefits as being in Krishna's personal presence.

Everyone can take the instructions of the Lord. So Srila Prabhupada says further, "The merciful Lord left behind him the great teachings of the Bhagavad Gita so that one can take the instructions of the Lord even when he is not visible to material eyesight." Krishna just didn't speak for his time when he was present; he has spoken this for posterity also. Material senses cannot have any estimation of the Supreme Lord, but by his inconceivable power, the Lord can incarnate himself to the sense perception of the conditioned souls in a suitable manner through the agency of matter, which is also another form of the Lord's manifested energy. Lord is completely spiritual, but he can be present in a material medium by his inconceivable power. Thus, the Bhagavad Gita or any authentic scriptural sound representation of the Lord is also the incarnation of the Lord. Krishna incarnated 5000 years back in his original form, transcendental form, but Krishna is present also in his sound representation in the form of Bhagavad Gita. Therefore, Srila Prabhupada says there is no difference between the sound representation of the Lord and the Lord himself. Krishna is identical with the Bhagavad Gita. One can derive the same benefit from the Bhagavad Gita as Arjuna did in the

**Key Quote:** "Activities of the living being are different varieties of aptitudes which can entrap or liberate the living being within and without material nature."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the five factors, explaining the qualitative oneness and difference between the Lord and the living being, the nature of material nature, and how karma can either bind or liberate.

Out of these, the supreme Lord and the living being are qualitatively one. The supreme Lord is completely spiritual, and we are also, each one of us, we are spiritual beings. The difference between the two, still there is a difference between the supreme Lord and each one of us. What is the difference? The difference between the two has been analyzed as the difference between the whole and the part and parcel. We are a very, very, very, very, very tiny part of the Lord, and parcel means we are inseparable. We cannot be separated from the Lord. We have an eternal connection, eternal relationship. Nature is inert matter. Material nature is inert matter displaying the interaction of the three different modes. Material nature is material energy. Energy means there is some force, and that force is the influence of the three gunas while they interact with each other. Eternal time and unlimited space are considered to be beyond the existence of the material nature. Eternal time, time is eternal, and unlimited space, space are considered to be beyond the existence of the material nature. Now what about the karma or activities? Activities of the living being are different varieties of aptitudes which can entrap or liberate the living being within and without material nature. We do some type of activities by which we become more and more entangled in this material nature. We can do some other types of activities in this material world which will liberate us from the entanglement. So one set of activities will get us out, and the usual normal activities which most people do simply entangles them more and more.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Bhagavad Gita is a preliminary study to the Srimad Bhagavatam, and that material activities can be spiritualized to stop material reactions.

All these subject matters are discussed concisely in the Bhagavad Gita, and later this subject matters are elaborated in the Bhagavatam for further enlightenment. Many times Srila Prabhupada says Bhagavad Gita is the preliminary study of Srimad Bhagavatam. So the topics of the Gita are described in the Bhagavatam in great detail. Now Srila Prabhupada summarizes the Bhagavad Gita that out of the five subjects, the Supreme Lord, the living entity, nature, and time and space are eternal, but the living entity, nature, and time are under the direction of the Supreme Lord who is absolute and completely independent of any other control. The Supreme Lord is supremely independent, completely independent, and we ourselves, each one of us, the living entity and the material nature and time, kala, all the three are under the control, complete control of the Supreme Lord. Material activity of the living being is beginningless, anadi karma phale padhi bhava navajale, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur describes. We cannot trace the beginning of our material activity in this material world, but it can be rectified by transferring into the spiritual quality. We can spiritualize

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of eating ordinary food versus prasadam to illustrate karma and akarma, emphasizing the importance of devotional service to overcome misidentification with the material body. The lecture concludes with thanks.

our activities, our ordinary activities, and then the material reactions will stop. This is exactly the subject matter, the fourth chapter, karma and akarma. Karma means that which binds us, akarma means that which liberates us. Just like you eat ordinary food, you become more and more bound up. You eat prasadam, you become liberated. The same activity of eating, but depending on whether you eat ordinary food or you eat prasadam, Krishna prasadam, there will be a difference in the effect of such eating, the action of eating. So this is what we call, we are devotee of Krishna, we are meant to serve Krishna eternally. So we wrongly identify with material nature or the material body, and the whole Vedic wisdom is given to help us come out of this misidentification and reinstate ourselves as servants of Krishna in devotional service, and the Bhagavad Gita is spoken towards this end. I will stop here.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Arjuna's confusion on the battlefield and how Krishna's instructions dispelled his ignorance, comparing the Lord to the sun that dissipates darkness.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, "Since the Lord is absolute, deep meditation upon him is as good as yogic trance." The highest perfection of Ashtanga Yoga is Samadhi, total absorption in meditation on the Lord. And simply a devotee deeply thinks about the Supreme Lord, Krishna, he is immediately in Samadhi. See the difference between Bhakti and Ashtanga Yoga. Bhakti Yoga and Ashtanga Yoga. The Lord is non-different from his name, form, quality, pastimes, entourage, and specific actions. Arjuna began to think of the Lord's instructions on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. He just began to think, what is it that Krishna told me when I was confused and I was searching for an answer to what is my duty under the circumstances, when I am facing my own near and dear ones as the enemy on the opposite side. I have to kill them, my respectable Supreme Lord, my superiors, my dear relatives. How can I kill them? So this duty, he was confused about his duty. And he asked Krishna to instruct him. Shishya Steham Shadhi Maam Tvaam Prapannam. So now, Arjuna is beginning to think of those instructions after Krishna's disappearance, when he is feeling that separation from Krishna. Now he is thinking of those instructions. Now, Srila Prabhupada says, "Only those instructions which Krishna gave on the battlefield of Kurukshetra began to eliminate the tinges of material contamination in the mind of Arjuna." How does it work? Srila Prabhupada says, "The Lord is like the sun. The sun's appearance means immediate dissipation of darkness or ignorance. And the Lord's appearance within the mind of the devotee can at once drive away the miserable material defects."

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Simply we have to remember the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker provides practical advice on remembering the Lord's name, form, qualities, and pastimes to overcome ignorance and confusion, and explains how even the feeling of separation from Krishna can be a source of transcendental bliss.

This is a good instruction for us. Whenever we feel that there is some ignorance, or some darkness, or some confusion, or some lack of direction, simply we have to remember the Lord. Remember the Lord's name, remember the Lord's form, remember the Lord's qualities, remember the Lord's instructions in the Bhagavad Gita, remember the Lord's pastimes described in the Bhagavatam, and immediately the darkness will be dissipated. Lord Chaitanya has therefore recommended constant chanting of the name of the Lord for protection from all contamination of the material world. Hare Nama Hare Nama Hare Namaiva Kevalam. This is a recommendation of Lord Chaitanya. Kalao Nastyaiva Nastyaiva Nastyaiva Gatiranyatam. Kaliva, there is no other remedy, only one remedy: constant chanting of the holy name, form, qualities, pastimes, etc. of the Supreme Lord Krishna. The feeling of separation from the Lord is undoubtedly painful to the devotee, but because it is in connection with the Lord, it has a specific transcendental effect which pacifies the heart. The feeling of separation from Krishna is actually soothing for the heart, even though it is actually a kind of painful situation for a devotee, but even that has got a spiritual effect.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts material and spiritual separation, emphasizing that separation from the Lord is a unique source of transcendental bliss, and introduces the next verse about Arjuna's increasing devotion and the removal of trash from his thoughts.

Of pacifying the, soothing the heart. Feelings of separation are also transcendental bliss. Sorry. Feelings of separation are also sources of transcendental bliss for a devotee. Of course, when he is in association with the Lord, he is very, very happy, very pleased. It's blissful. But feeling of separation is also a source of transcendental bliss of a different kind, and they are never comparable to contaminated material feelings of separation. In this material world, we also sometimes feel that there is some person who is our near and dear one. When we are separated from them, we feel the pain of separation. But what pain of separation Arjuna is feeling now after separation from Krishna, after Krishna's disappearance from this material world, is not the same as our material feelings of separation from some material relationship. They are not the same. In this material world, when there is separation, we feel pain, and we lament about it. But in the spiritual atmosphere, in the spiritual dimension of existence, separation from the Lord is a source of transcendental bliss of a different kind. It's a variety of bliss. Twenty-ninth verse: Vasudeva Angri Anudhyana Paribhramhita Ramhasa Bhaktya Nirmati Tashyesha Kashaya Dishano Arjunaha. The meaning of this verse is, "Arjuna's constant remembrance of the lotus feet of Lord Shri Krishna rapidly increased his devotion and as a result, all the trash in his thoughts subsided."

**Key Quote:** "Material desires in the mind are the trash of material contamination."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that material desires are like garbage in the heart, obscuring our spiritual identity and leading to incompatible and compatible feelings, and discusses the confusion caused by likes and dislikes in the material world.

In the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, "Material desires in the mind are the trash of material contamination." If we have material desires in our mind, they are nothing but garbage, which is somehow sitting in our heart or consciousness. And Srila Prabhupada explains, "By such contamination, the living being is faced with so many compatible and incompatible things." Different kinds of material desires bring about different kinds of compatible and incompatible things that discourage the very existence of spiritual identity. Our spiritual identity is, we are eternally meant to serve Krishna, lovingly. In such service, there is no distress, there is no suffering, there is no pain, there is no ignorance, there is no illusion, there is no misery, none of those things. But, when there is material desire in the heart, then there is so much of incompatible and compatible feelings, and those are opposed to our spiritual identity. They are opposed to devotional service. Birth after birth, the conditioned soul is entrapped with so many pleasing and displeasing elements. Itchadvesha Samuthena dvanva mohena bharata. We are born always with some likes and dislikes, and they are always confusing for us. Because, whole life in a particular body, we are simply chasing something which we think we like, and we are trying to avoid something which we dislike. But, in this material world, there is nothing to like or dislike.

**Key Quote:** "Material existence is not meant for us at all."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts material existence with spiritual life in devotional service to Krishna, explaining that material existence is a source of misery, while spiritual life is total bliss, and discusses how chanting Hare Krishna exposes material desires.

Everything is simply a source of misery. Dukkhalayam, ashashvatam. So, there is nothing to really aspire for. There is nothing which we think if we avoid we will be happy. No. Material existence is not meant for us at all. We are meant for spiritual life in association with Krishna, in devotional service to him, and that is total bliss. There is nothing compatible or incompatible in that spiritual existence. So, all these pleasing and displeasing elements, in material existence, are false and temporary. They accumulate due to our reactions to material desires. How do they get accumulated? Because of the reactions of the material desires. But, when we get in touch with the transcendental Lord in his variegated energies by devotional service, his spiritual energy, devotional service is always under the protection of the devotional energy, spiritual energy. Then, when we touch Hare Krishna, when I say Hare Krishna, I am touching the transcendental sound, spiritual sound of Krishna's name. And by that, what happens? The naked forms of all material desires become manifest. I can clearly see the nature of these material desires which are there in the heart. And the intelligence of the living being is specified in its true color. The intelligence will begin working. Vyavasaya Atmika Buddhi. It will reveal to us, don't chase these material desires. They are all worthless. Don't chase these material desires.

**Key Quote:** "Immediately all material contamination is dissipated."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the power of the Bhagavad Gita to dissipate material contamination and confusion, comparing it to a spark of light that dispels darkness, and encourages remembering Krishna's instructions to achieve spiritual existence.

As soon as Arjuna turned his attention towards the instructions of the Lord, as they are inculcated in the Bhagavad Gita, his true color of eternal association with the Lord became manifest. Arjuna began to feel the effect of associating with the Lord even through his instructions, transcendental instructions in the Bhagavad Gita, in the form of Bhagavad Gita, and thus he felt freed from all material contaminations. Immediately all material contamination is dissipated. It is cleansed away. Instantaneous cleansing. It's exactly like you are sitting in abject darkness. Somebody brings in a tiny spark of light. Immediately darkness dispels, immediately. So like that, even any one instruction of Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, you remember, immediately all your confusion, your ignorance, your illusion, your likes, dislikes, material likes and dislikes, everything will be dissipated, and you simply become situated in transcendence, beyond all material illusion, beyond material duality, beyond material confusion, everything beyond matter. That is spiritual existence. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

#### conditioned soul, three gunas, material existence, spiritual platform

**Key Quote:** "Conditioned soul means one who is subject to material conditions enforced by the interaction between the body and the soul."
**Summary:** This segment defines a conditioned soul and explains how the three gunas influence consciousness in material existence, contrasting it with the spiritual platform where one is free from these influences.

Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya, Narayanam Namaskritya, Naram Chayiva Narottamam, Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tatho Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session we will be discussing from the 30th verse of the 15th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. गीतं भगवता ज्ञानं यत्तत संग्राम मूर्धनी काल कर्म तमो रुद्धं पुनर अध्यगमत प्रभुहू The meaning of this verse is, because of the Lord's pastimes and activities, and because of his absence, it appeared that Arjuna forgot the instructions left by the personality of Godhead. But factually, this was not the case, and again he became Lord of his senses. So, Srila Prabhupada explains what does this mean. A conditioned soul, I have explained what is conditioned soul in a previous session. Conditioned soul means one who is subject to material conditions enforced by the interaction between the body and the soul. So, we have the combination of the three gunas. Three gunas means three kinds of influences: Sattvic influence, Rajasic influence, Tamsic influence on our consciousness in material existence. So, we are called conditioned soul. So, we behave, we act, we think, we feel, we have got the drive to work according to the combination of the influence of these three gunas. But that is material existence. When you elevate your consciousness to the spiritual platform, you are above the influence, you are freed from the influence of the three gunas. You simply act spiritually.

#### eternal time, internal potency, spiritual activities, transcendental

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "All pastimes or activities of the Lord are spiritual in nature."
**Summary:** This segment explains that the Lord is not influenced by time or the gunas, and therefore His activities are eternal and transcendental, stemming from His internal potency, unlike ordinary activities influenced by the three gunas.

So, here Srila Prabhupada begins his purport by telling, a conditioned soul is enwrapped, enwrapped means completely covered, in his fructive activities by the force of eternal time. Kala, through the influence of the gunas, forces us to act in a way that is according to the past karma. But the Supreme Lord, when he incarnates on the earth, is not influenced by Kala, nor is the Supreme Lord influenced by the material conception of past, present, and future. Neither eternal time in the material world, nor the conception of past, present, and future, is influencing the Lord. So, therefore, the activities of the Lord, which may appear like ordinary activities of this material world, are not ordinary. The activities of the Lord are eternal, sanātana, and they are manifestations of his ātma māyā, or internal potency. Our ordinary activities are due to the interaction of the three gunas. Prakṛte kriyamānāni gunai karmāni sarvaśaha ahankāra vimūdātmā kartāḥ mitimanyate Whatever material activities are happening, they are carried out by the three gunas, but I think I am the doer under the influence of illusion. But spiritual activities are not at all like material activities. They have nothing to do with the three gunas. They have nothing to do with Kala, material time. They are completely transcendental to material time and material modes.

#### Krishna's pastimes, transcendence, spiritual nature, devotion

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna is no ordinary child. He is the same supreme Brahman who is the object of worship by all devotees who have accepted him as their master."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the transcendental nature of Krishna's pastimes, even seemingly ordinary ones like crawling, and highlights that Krishna is the Supreme Brahman appearing as a child for the sake of pastimes.

And therefore they are called under the internal potency or spiritual potency or spiritual energy, divine energy, transcendental energy, more than divine, transcendental energy. All pastimes or activities of the Lord are spiritual in nature. All activities of the Supreme Lord are spiritual by nature, even stealing the butter, even crawling in the courtyard of Mother Yashoda like an ordinary child. All those activities are completely transcendental. They are not ordinary activities. Therefore Shukadeva Goswami, he is speaking to all the assembled saintly persons and to Pariksit Maharaj. And Shukadeva Goswami is speaking very, very gravely about transcendental subject matter, about spiritual subject matter, trying to enlighten Pariksit and through Pariksit all the other saintly persons. But he is describing Krishna's childhood pastimes, and everybody is seriously sitting and hearing. And Shukadeva Goswami is telling, Krishna was crawling on the floor and Mother Yashoda was enjoying seeing her beloved child very beautifully decorated with nice ornaments and nice dress and nice beautiful smile on Krishna's face. So what is all this got to do with transcendence? Krishna is transcendence himself, and all of Krishna's activities are transcendental activities. How are they different? Ordinary child gives pleasure to its mother by its movements, by its crawling, by its being decorated by the mother. Here Mother Yashoda is also similarly apparently decorating a small child and taking pleasure in the child crawling, smiling, playing. What's the difference? So that is explained by Shukadeva Goswami in the tenth canto of the Bhagavatam. Ittham satam brahma-sukhanu bhutya dasyaṁgatānām para-daivatena māyāśritānām naradārakena sākaṁ vijagru kṛta-punya-punjā Krishna is no ordinary child. He is the same supreme Brahman who is the object of worship by all devotees who have accepted him as their master. And he is the same object of meditation, of worship or the destination of the impersonalists who are after the brahma-jyoti, Brahman effulgence, that is his own bodily effulgence. So that Krishna is appearing as a beloved child of Nanda and Yashoda, simply for the sake of pastimes, that's all.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna wants his pure devotees to rule the world."
**Summary:** This segment explains that the battle of Kurukshetra was part of Krishna's mission to eliminate demonic forces and establish pure devotees to guide the world towards Krishna consciousness.

So they are completely transcendental, discussing them, hearing about them, describing them, participating or being a spectator of such activities is completely spiritual. There is no tinge of any material guna or material reactions, nothing. It so appeared that Arjuna and the Lord were engaged in the battle of Kurukshetra as the other party was also engaged. But factually, the Lord was executing his mission of incarnation and association with his eternal friend Arjuna. Like so many battles are fought. This battle of Kurukshetra was another battle between the Pandavas and Kauravas, and the whole world was divided, all the kings were divided into two parties. Some took the side of Pandavas, others took the side of Kauravas and they were fighting. Whoever wins the battle will rule the world. No, it is not as simple as that. Krishna being present on the battlefield of Kurukshetra and his pure devotees, the Pandavas, under the complete transcendental protection of Krishna, they are present on the battlefield. They are executing Krishna's mission. Krishna wants his pure devotees to rule the world, and Krishna has arranged this battle simply for eliminating all the unnecessary burden in the form of demoniac forces on this earth planet. He has arranged this battle. They will all be killed and Yudhishthira Maharaj and the other Pandavas, they will come out victorious by Krishna's plan, Krishna's arrangement, Krishna's transcendental mission in this material world. Pure devotees should rule this world. Pure devotees should direct the people in general towards Krishna consciousness.

#### Arjuna's revival, Krishna's instructions, devotion, eternal truth

**Verse References:** BG 18.65
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "One should think of the Lord always."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how Arjuna's consciousness was revived by remembering Krishna's instructions and emphasizes the importance of constantly thinking of Krishna, becoming a devotee, and offering obeisances to receive the Lord's blessings and protection.

That is Krishna's mission. Therefore, such apparently material activities of Arjuna did not drive him away from his transcendental position, but on the contrary revived his consciousness of the songs of the Lord as he sang them personally. Krishna, whatever instructions Krishna gave on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, those instructions Arjuna is trying to recollect. And he is remembering the activities of the Lord also in connection with that battle. And simply by remembering them, Arjuna is re-established in his transcendental position as the eternal friend of Krishna, as the associate of Krishna, as the participant in Krishna's Leela. So all illusion, ignorance are absent in such thoughts. Thinking of Krishna is different from thinking of ordinary subject matter. Big, big difference. The revival of consciousness, the way Arjuna's consciousness is revived simply by thinking of Krishna's instructions, is assured by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, in the 18th chapter, 65th verse. What does Krishna say? Man-mana bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam namaskuru. What is the meaning of this verse in the Bhagavad Gita? One should think of the Lord always. Always think of me, Krishna says. The mind should not forget him. One should become a devotee of the Lord, mad-yaji mam namaskuru, and offer obeisances unto him. Devotee means he bows down before the Lord. mam evaisyasi asamsayah. One who lives in that fashion becomes undoubtedly endowed with the blessing of the Lord. Guaranteed to get blessing of the Lord if you live as a devotee, constantly thinking of Krishna, bowing down before him. And in this way, by the blessing of the Lord, what happens? One achieves the shelter of Krishna's lotus feet. mam evaisyasi asamsayah. Get complete shelter at his lotus feet. Completely protected. Always safe under his protection. There is nothing to doubt about this eternal truth. What is told in the Bhagavad Gita is eternal truth for all times, for all people, in all circumstances, in all places.

**Key Quote:** "One should therefore adjust the activities of life in pace with the mission of the Lord."
**Summary:** This segment explains that Krishna disclosed confidential knowledge to Arjuna because of their friendly relationship and emphasizes the importance of aligning one's life with Krishna's mission of reviving our relationship with Him through bhakti to prepare for returning back to Godhead.

Eternal truth. Because Arjuna was his confidential friend, the secret was disclosed to him. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna tells Arjuna, You are my most dear devotee, situated in a friendly relationship. Therefore, I am disclosing the most confidential knowledge. bhakto 'si me sakha ceti rahasyam hy etad uttamam. Arjuna had no desire to fight with his relatives, but he fought for the mission of the Supreme Lord Krishna. So Arjuna's fighting is also participating in the mission of Krishna. So Arjuna was always engaged in the execution of Krishna's mission only, and therefore, after the Lord's departure, he remained in the same transcendental position, even though it appeared like he forgot all the instructions of the Bhagavad Gita. One should therefore adjust the activities of life in pace with the mission of the Lord, and by doing this, one is sure to return back home, back to Godhead. So what is the mission of the Lord now in this material world? The mission of the Lord is that we revive our lost or forgotten relationship with Krishna through the activities of bhakti, and in this way, we prepare ourselves to go back to Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "This is Suta Goswami describing the position of Arjuna."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains that Arjuna's state was not one of ordinary lamentation but of transcendence due to his spiritual assets.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 31st verse of the 15th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Vishoko Brahma Sampradaya Sanchinna Dvaita Samshayaha Leena Prakriti Nair Gunyat Alingatvat Asambhavaha. The meaning of this verse is: Because of his possessing spiritual assets, the doubts of duality were completely cut off. Thus, he was freed from the three modes of material nature and placed in transcendence. There was no longer any chance of his becoming entangled in birth and death, for he was freed from material form.

**Key Quote:** "Doubts of duality begin from the misconception of the material body which is accepted as a self by less intelligent persons"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of duality arising from the misidentification of the material body as the self, drawing from Srila Prabhupada's purport.

This is Suta Goswami describing the position of Arjuna. Don't think Arjuna was lamenting after Krishna's disappearance and he was suffering like an ordinary person feels pain and suffering due to separation from some beloved departed soul. No, it's not like that. So that is explained here. Arjuna is having those instructions in his heart which Krishna imparted, and that is a spiritual asset. And those spiritual assets are useful to cut off all kinds of doubts of duality, and immediately such spiritual asset places one on the transcendental platform above the three modes of material nature. So then there is no question of becoming entangled in birth and death. So Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport: doubts of duality begin from the misconception of the material body, which is accepted as a self by less intelligent persons. This material existence is

characterized by the fact that the material body is a self, and the self is not a self. This material existence is characterized by dvandva, duality, and this duality is only because I am spirit soul, or each person, individual person, is spirit soul, but wrongly one forgets, wrongly one thinks that I am this material body and forgets that I am spirit soul. I am not the body. The most foolish part of our ignorance is our identifying with this material body as the self. This is the most foolish part. You are thinking something you are without knowing that it is not you. Just like I think I am this body. Now, if I think I'm this body, I think I'm made up of this flesh and blood and bones and so many material parts of the body, and this body's becoming old, and the body sometimes becomes sick, and the body is becoming dirty, and the body is having some possessions, some relationships, and I'm trying to secure them. So all because of the misidentification, wrong understanding, everything in relation with the body is ignorantly accepted as our own. It begins with I, I am this body, and then extends to mine, what is mine, everything connected to the body is mine, my father, my mother, my car, my house, my prestige, my, my, my, my. We are completely in an ocean of misconceptions, doubts due to misconceptions of myself and mine, my body, my relatives, my property, my wife, my children, my wealth, my country, my community, and hundreds and thousands of

**Key Quote:** "By assimilating the instructions of the Bhagavad Gita one is sure to be released from such bewilderment because real knowledge is knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead Vasudeva or Lord Krishna is everything"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that everyone is bewildered by the concept of 'mine' and that the remedy is to assimilate the teachings of Bhagavad Gita and understand that Krishna is everything.

similar illusory contemplations cause bewilderment for the conditioned soul. Everyone in this material world who's having such wrong conceptions are bewildered. Bewildered. Everyone is bewildered, no exception. Even the most prosperous materialist, even the wealthiest person, even the most successful entrepreneur, the most powerful devata, everyone is bewildered by this conception of mine, mine, mine, mine, mine. Now Srila Prabhupada says, what is the remedy for this? By assimilating the instructions of the Bhagavad Gita, one is sure to be released from such bewilderment, because real knowledge is knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead Vasudeva, or Lord Krishna, is everything, including oneself. Krishna is everything. Krishna is everything means Krishna is there and his energies are there. So Krishna has his identity as a Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has his energies, his spiritual, the spiritual world is his spiritual energy, the material world is material energy, we are his marginal energy. So Krishna is everything because non-difference between him and his energies. Energies are his, everything is a manifestation of his potency.

**Key Quote:** "Everything belongs to Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that everything is Krishna's energy and part and parcel of Him, emphasizing the concept of non-duality and how perfect knowledge eradicates the illusion of ownership.

As part and parcel, potency means his energy, his Shakti. So everything that we see in this world is his Shakti, and it is present as his own part and parcel. Parcel means inseparable part, cannot be separated. The potency and the potent are not different. Potency means the Shakti, and the potent, the possessor of the potency, the owner of the Shakti. Shakti means the photoЯ un-xaṁepa Iman, Krishna, Krishna and Shakti, Shakti, Shakti, Iman, they are not different. So, the conception of duality is at once mitigated by attainment of perfect knowledge. Like, I think something is mine and something else is somebody else's. But the reality is, what I think is mine is not mine, it is Krishna's. And what I think is somebody else's is not that person's property, it is actually Krishna's.

**Key Quote:** "So, therefore, the instructions of the Bhagavad Gita eradicate all kinds of material conceptions."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Arjuna to illustrate how the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita can eradicate material conceptions, such as grief over the death of a father, by understanding the eternal nature of the soul.

So, this duality is completely eradicated by perfect knowledge. Everything belongs to Krishna. As soon as Arjuna took up the instructions of the Bhagavad Gita, expert as he was, he could at once eradicate the material conception of Lord Krishna, his eternal friend. Material conception is, let's say, somebody has got his father and the father is his son. And when the father dies, then he feels very sad. My father passed away. My father is no more. This is a material conception. Father is no more means the body, material body, which is not the real person, not the real father, is no more. The spirit soul has no death, has no birth, doesn't belong to this world.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is always present in the form of his instructions."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna is always present through his instructions, form, pastimes, and qualities, and that a devotee never feels his absence due to his transcendental presence in different non-dual energies.

So, therefore, the instructions of the Bhagavad Gita eradicate all kinds of material conceptions. So, Arjuna could realize that the Lord was still present before him by his instruction, by his form, by his pastimes, by his qualities and everything else related to him. Consider this, that Krishna is always present in the form of his instructions. Eternally, those instructions are true. So, if Krishna is present, where is the cause for lamentation that Krishna passed away, Krishna disappeared, Krishna went away to his personal abode? No, Krishna is present. He is present in one form, yet another form, yet another form, unlimited form. Unlimited forms. Krishna is always present. So, in a sense, the devotee never feels absence of Krishna if a devotee is Krishna conscious. So, Arjuna could realize that Lord Krishna, his friend, was still present before him by his transcendental presence in different non-dual energies. All energies are Krishna's. So, in the form of energy, Krishna is present. And there is no question of attainment of the association of the Lord by another change of body under the influence of time and space.

**Key Quote:** "The spirit soul has got spiritual identity, which is eternal."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the temporary material form with the eternal spiritual identity of the soul, emphasizing the soul's eternal relationship with Krishna.

Just like sometimes people ask that I lost my father. And you say my father has gone to some other body. Can I actually again associate with my father, whom I am missing, by myself taking another body like he has taken? Because our conception of existence in the material world is simply based on body. That's all. But the truth is, this body is simply some... material form. Temporary material form. It has nothing to do with the real person, the spirit soul. The spirit soul has got spiritual identity, which is eternal. The material form is simply a dress, a covering, a... a form, a... a material... object. It has no life... by itself. Material form has no life by itself. Whereas the spiritual identity is ever-present. Eternally present. In eternal platform. Spiritual platform. In spiritual form. In spiritual relationship with Krishna. Eternally present.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that one can constantly be in association with the Lord through devotional service, especially by hearing and chanting Krishna's name, which allows Krishna to reveal Himself within the heart.

So therefore, Prabhupada concludes by telling, by attainment of absolute knowledge, one can be in association with the Lord constantly, even in this present life. How? Simply by hearing, chanting, thinking of and worshipping the Supreme Lord. What is true for Arjuna, is true for everyone at all times. Even now, if we chant constantly Krishna's holy name, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, we should understand and should realize this fact, that Krishna is appearing in the form of that holy name, transcendental sound on my tongue. And if I hear, Krishna is entering, as the transcendental sound within, through my ears, and He can enter my heart and touch my soul. Touch me. He means my soul. And then, I immediately feel the... loving presence of Krishna. The soothing touch of Krishna. And this is a fact. This is not some kind of sentiment, or some... some material adjustment in the mind. No. It is a transcendental truth. One can see Him, one can feel His presence, even in this present life, simply by understanding the Advayagyana Lord, or the Absolute Lord, through the process of devotional service. You perform devotional service, beginning with hearing and chanting, about Krishna, and then, the Advayagyana Lord, the Absolute Lord, will reveal Himself to you, within your heart, and you will never feel His absence under any circumstances. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that both Arjuna and Yudhishthira turned to the Bhagavad Gita for guidance after Krishna's departure, emphasizing the Gita's universal relevance.

Shrila Prabhupada explains in the purport, Maharaj Yudhishthira also turned his attention to the instructions of the Bhagavad Gita after hearing about the Lord's departure, from the vision of earthly people. In the earlier verse, it was described, Arjuna turned towards the instructions of Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. Arjuna was personally instructed by the Lord in the subject matter of the Bhagavad Gita, and that was during the battle, just before the beginning of the battle of Kurukshetra. But now, after the Lord's departure, when Arjuna was heartbroken, then in order to pacify himself, he recollected and remembered and applied the same instructions of Bhagavad Gita, which Krishna had spoken before the battle of Kurukshetra. Now, this verse describes, Maharaj Yudhishthira, the elder brother of Arjuna, also turned his attention to the instructions of Krishna, in the Bhagavad Gita.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's appearance and disappearance is totally transcendental. It is not like the appearance or the birth and death of conditioned souls like us."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the transcendental nature of Krishna's appearance and disappearance, contrasting it with the forced birth and death of conditioned souls.

You see, so Bhagavad Gita was not just spoken for Arjuna alone. It is spoken for everyone or anyone who wants to actually go back home, back to Godhead. According to Krishna's instructions, we understand we belong to Krishna, we are meant to actually prepare ourselves to go back to Krishna in his personal abode. And perfect instructions are given by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. So Srila Prabhupada continues, he began to deliberate on the Lord's way of appearance and departure. So Krishna's appearance and disappearance is totally transcendental. It is not like the appearance or the birth and death of conditioned souls like us. Srila Prabhupada says further, the mission of the Lord's appearance and disappearance in the mortal universe is completely dependent on his supreme will. He is not forced to appear or disappear by any superior energy, as the living beings appear and disappear, being forced by the laws of nature. Our birth and death is forced upon us. We don't choose to either take birth or die. We don't choose. But Krishna's appearance and disappearance looks like the birth and death of ordinary living beings, but it is entirely a transcendental pastime of the Supreme Lord. It is completely dependent on his supreme will. He is completely independent and exactly as he wants it, it will happen.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord is present in many many many many many places in many different forms"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's simultaneous presence in many forms in both the spiritual and material worlds, particularly in relation to devotees' desires.

Srila Prabhupada continues, whenever the Lord likes, he can appear himself anywhere and everywhere without disturbing his appearance and disappearance in any other place. So simultaneously, the Lord is present in many many many many many places in many different forms and he appears and disappears without disturbing the other forms of appearance in other places. So simultaneously, he is in the spiritual world. In the spiritual world also, he is present in many many forms. His original form is Krishna, Shamasundara, and he is present in the spiritual world, in different forms according to the devotees' desire to serve him. And he expands for the sake of devotees as Balarama, as Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Kesava, Narayana, Madhava, Govinda, Madhusudana, so many forms. Each of these forms particularly the Narayana forms are predominators of the spiritual planets, the Vaikuntha Lokas. And in those Lokas, they have their devotees and they are receiving the service and reciprocating with the devotees. Similarly, Krishna also, in his personal abode, Goloka Vrindavana, he is reciprocating with his devotees, the devotees who are serving him out of love. So this is the truth about the personality of Godhead.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Krishna's presence in the material world through various incarnations, including Maha Vishnu, Garbhodakshayi Vishnu, Shirodakshayi Vishnu, Paramatma, and other avatars like Rama and Narasimha.

Now, not only in the spiritual world, he is also present in the material world. Which is the first incarnation in the material world? It is the incarnation of the Supreme Lord as Maha Vishnu at the beginning of the creation. Then, Maha Vishnu expands as Garbhodakshayi Vishnu to enter into each universe which he himself generates by his spiritual potency. And, that Garbhodakshayi Vishnu further expands as Shirodakshayi Vishnu, the maintainer Vishnu. And, this maintainer Vishnu further expands as Paramatma in the heart of every living being and enters into everything, every spiritual material atom, every atom of material manifestation, matter, material objects. And, he completely controls everything in existence in the material world in that way. Now, while he is present in the form of Maha Vishnu, Garbhodakshayi Vishnu, Shirodakshayi Vishnu, Paramatma, he also appears in the form of incarnations, past time incarnations, Leela Avatara. He is also present as Guna Avatara, as Brahma, as Shiva. He is present in the form of Shakya Vesha Avatara. Empowered incarnations. He is present as or rather he appears in so many different past time incarnations, Leela Avatara, Rama, Narasimha, Varaha, Krishna, Balarama in the material world.

**Content Type:** analogy

**Key Quote:** "They appear as if they are independent of each other. But it is the same Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of the sun's appearance and disappearance in different parts of the world to explain how Krishna's various incarnations can exist simultaneously without disturbing each other.

Now, this does not disturb or in any way affect any of the other forms or incarnations of the Lord. They appear as if they are independent of each other, but it is the same Supreme Lord. Krishna, Rama in the spiritual world, in the material world, as Mahavishnu, as Garbhodakshayi Vishnu are all the same person, the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. So that is being explained by Srila Prabhupada here. He is like the sun. The sun appears and disappears on its own accord at any place without disturbing his presence in other places. Just like now, at this time, it is 7.30 pm. So, the sun has set for our vision in the place we are now. I am in Bangalore. So, the sun has set now. And, the sun simultaneously is rising somewhere. Simultaneously, the sun is overhead somewhere else, some other part of the world. So, the appearance and disappearance of the sun, the rising and setting of the sun relative to my vision in one place on the earth has nothing to do with, is not disturbing the sun's presence in other parts of the world. So, this is an example that is given by Srila Prabhupada to explain the Lord's appearance and disappearance is undisturbed.

**Key Quote:** "Anyone who factually understands the transcendental appearance and disappearance of the Lord by his inconceivable energy becomes liberated from the laws of birth and death"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that understanding the transcendental nature of Krishna's appearance and disappearance leads to liberation from the cycle of birth and death, referencing the Bhagavad Gita.

His appearance and disappearance in other parts of the world or in other places in other times. So, Srila Prabhupada explains the sun example further. The sun appears in the morning in India without disappearing from the western hemisphere. The sun is present everywhere and anywhere all over the solar system. But, it so appears that in a particular place the sun appears in the morning and also disappears at some fixed time in the evening. The time limitation even of the sun is of no concern. And so, what to speak of the Supreme Lord who is a creator and controller of the sun. If the sun itself is independently appearing and disappearing in different parts of the universe, then what to speak of the Supreme Lord? He can appear and disappear anywhere according to his own sweet will. Therefore, in the Bhagavad Gita, it is stated that anyone who factually understands the transcendental appearance and disappearance of the Lord by his inconceivable energy becomes liberated from the laws of birth and death and is placed in the eternal spiritual sky where the Vaikuntha planets are.

This is what we have to hear from the authentic scriptures from the Acharyas from Srila Prabhupada to hear and understand and and become fixed up in this understanding in the realization and that will clear away all misconceptions about our own self. And then when we have the proper understanding proper we are properly situated without any misconception then we are eligible to become liberated from material influence material and that is called ultimate liberation when we are placed in the eternal spiritual sky in one of the Vaikuntha planets where we belong actually. There that means in the Vaikuntha planets such liberated persons can eternally be liberated from material existence. So all our problems are solved without any separate endeavor simply by becoming Krishna conscious and returning to Krishna. I will stop here. Thank you very

#### Mahabharata, Srimad Bhagavatam, devotee's perspective
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/tVgdAvQhC30?t=134
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So, you understand the position of the devotees of Krishna from the Bhagavatam, particularly the incidents in Mahabharata."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Srimad Bhagavatam provides a deeper understanding of the devotees of Krishna compared to the Mahabharata.

Because the descriptions in the Mahabharata about the different difficulties and troubles Kunti went through is kind of bewildering to people that such a great devotee had to undergo so much tribulation in this world. So, it is not at all a tribulation for the devotee, when the devotee is participating in the pastimes of the Lord in a particular role, according to the will of the Lord. So, if we have to understand the real purport of the Mahabharata, then we have to hear that or understand that from the Srimad Bhagavatam. In the Garuda Purana, it is said, Srimad Bhagavatam is... Artho-yam Brahma Sutranam is the explanation of the Vedanta Sutras, is a natural commentary on the Vedanta Sutras by the self-same author, Vyasadeva. And Bharata-artha-minirnayam, it is also giving the purport of the Mahabharata, Bharata-artha, referring to the Mahabharata. The Mahabharata describes so many historical incidents and also describes Krishna's pastimes related to those historical incidents, in connection with those historical incidents. But Mahabharata may not help us understand the exact position of especially the devotees of Krishna.

**Content Type:** story

**Key Quote:** "So it appears like Kunti was very very very very unfortunate personality simply undergoing one misery after another."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates Kunti's life story as depicted in the Mahabharata, highlighting the numerous hardships she faced.

So, you understand the position of the devotees of Krishna from the Bhagavatam, particularly the incidents in Mahabharata. Just like, to give an example, in the Mahabharata, there is a description that Kunti was feeling very, very sorry that she had to undergo so many tribulations just because of her position in her parents' house, even as an unmarried young girl. She was blessed by Durvasamuni to be able to call upon any demigod and conceive a child through that demigod. Now, she was a young girl. She just happened to try out chanting that mantra, which Durvasamuni had given her. And she is not yet married. She called upon the sun god. And then sun god appeared and said, Now you will conceive a child. But your virginity will be intact. So, she had a child. And she didn't know how to. She is unmarried. She never wanted to have a child. She was so young. So, anyway, she with a very heavy heart, she just abandoned the child. And that was Karna. And then later on she got married to Pandu. And Pandu died an untimely death. Then she was left behind with five sons of Pandu, the Pandavas. And she was the widow mother of these five sons, Pandu's widow. And they were deprived of the kingdom after that. And so many tribulations, one after another, because Duryodhana had some enmity against the Pandavas. So, Duryodhana was giving trouble to the Pandavas. And Kunti, she also had to suffer, because she is not independent. To do anything separately, she is with her sons and whatever difficulty the sons undergo, she is also a part of that, so it appears like Kunti was very, very, very, very unfortunate personality simply undergoing one misery after another.

**Verse References:** —

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "And I wish that those difficulties or problems come again."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Kunti's lamentation in the Mahabharata with her prayers in the Bhagavatam, where she welcomes difficulties as opportunities to remember Krishna.

So in the Mahabharata there is a description that she is lamenting her miseries, but in the Bhagavatam we see Kunti offering prayers to Krishna and telling, "My dear Lord Krishna, whenever we had difficulty, you are always there to save us from calamities and solve our problems. And I wish that those difficulties or problems come again and again because simply by remembering you when we are in difficulty, because we are devotees, we are dependent on you, we are able to completely get rid of the material bondage, we are assured of ultimate liberation simply by thinking of you, remembering you, by praying to you." So she is not at all lamenting about those difficulties rather, she is welcoming them, so this perspective is the speciality of the confidential knowledge in the Bhagavatam that is given to us. Similarly here it's being explained when she heard that Krishna has gone back to his personal abode and the Yadu dynasty also has ended their earthly manifestation, then she decided...

**Key Quote:** "It disappears along with the Lord out of our sight both the Lord and his pure devotees they appear and disappear apparent to our vision they are all eternally present eternally present in the spiritual world eternally present in the spiritual world they are never absent in the spiritual world."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the disappearance of Krishna and his devotees from our sight does not mean their end, as they are eternally present in the spiritual world.

To completely engage herself in pure devotional service, focus her attention completely on Krishna. As a pure devotee, it's natural for her to do that and she gained release from the course of material existence, finished her material existence is over. She had come for participating Krishna's Leela and it's over. Elsewhere it is described she is the eternal associate of Krishna in the material world for his earthly pastimes, for his material pastimes in the material world. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "The setting of the sun does not mean the end of the sun, it means that the sun is out of our sight." Similarly, the end of the mission of the Lord on a particular planet or universe only means that he is out of our sight. The end of the Yadu dynasty also does not mean that it is annihilating the Lord. It disappears along with the Lord out of our sight. Both the Lord and his pure devotees, they appear and disappear apparent to our vision. They are all eternally present, eternally present in the spiritual world. They are never absent in the spiritual world.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of engaging in pure devotional service at all times, citing Krishna's instructions in the Bhagavad Gita.

But they also appear in the material world as required for the Lord's pastime in the material world for our sake. As Maharaj Yudhishtira decided to prepare to go back to Godhead, so also Kunti decided, because both are pure devotees of the Lord. So pure devotees only business is devotional service, that's all. Whether in this situation or that situation, whether in distress or in happiness, whether in the presence of the Lord or in the apparent absence of the Lord, in all circumstances, at all times, in all situations, in all circumstances, always they are engaged in pure devotional service and that's what Krishna instructs in the Bhagavad Gita. Always be engaged in my devotional service. Man mana bhava madbhakto madhyaji mam namaskuru. Several places in the Bhagavad Gita Krishna says always engage in my devotional service in different ways. tasmat sarveshu kaaleshu maa manusmara yudhya chak. You always engage in my devotional service. You always think of me. You always remember me. Always worship me. Always discuss about me. Katayantas chamam nityam. So like this the pure devotees are teaching us to always engage in pure devotional service. So Srila Prabhupada further says...

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Thus she fully engaged herself in the transcendental devotional service of the Lord which guarantees one a passport for going back to Godhead after quitting this present material body."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a passport to explain how devotional service guarantees one's return to Godhead after death.

Thus she fully engaged herself in the transcendental devotional service of the Lord which guarantees one a passport for going back to Godhead after quitting this present material body. See, passport means, as we are citizens of India, the Indian government gives us this document called passport which means our travel in foreign countries may be without any hindrance. So without any hindrance we may be allowed to travel in other countries based on our bona fides of being citizens of this country. So going back to Godhead is guaranteed for pure devotees who are fully engaged in transcendental devotional service of the Lord. When they quit this material world or this place, the earthly planet, it doesn't mean that everything is finished for them. No. They are simply quitting this place to go to the next place where the Lord wants them to go. And they are always guided by the Lord. Even while in this world they are guided by the Lord and even their travel or their transfer from this world to another place where the Lord's pastimes are going on is also guided by the Lord. So they are not destroyed in any way. Their devotional service does not come to an end.

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So spiritualizing this present body begins when we begin pure devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotional service begins the process of spiritualizing the body and consciousness, leading to detachment from the material world and ultimately, going back to Godhead, as Kunti did.

It is always continuously going on. The beginning of devotional service to the Lord is the beginning of spiritualizing the present body. See, we have a material body when we take birth in this material world. And that is due to our own karma, our material activities. But when we begin spiritual life it means that we want to end this material existence and we want to reinstate ourselves in our spiritual position as eternal devotees of Krishna in His personal abode. So spiritualizing this present body begins when we begin pure devotional service. And thus an unalloyed devotee of the Lord loses all material contact in the present body. As we go on spiritualizing this present body means we spiritualize our consciousness. Then our contact with this body, even though I am in this body, the contact with the body is lost in proportion to our development of our spiritual consciousness. The abode of the Lord is not a myth as is thought by the unbelievers or ignorant people. But one cannot reach there by any material means. One can go there after quitting the present body only if one has prepared oneself by practicing devotional service. And Kunti did that and she went back to God.

In this session we will be discussing from the 34th verse of the 15th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Yes Jaya Harad Bhuvobharam Tam Tanum Vijahav Ajah Kantakam Kantakenewa Dwayam Chapi Shituhu Samam. The meaning of this verse is: The supreme unborn Lord Shri Krishna caused the members of the Yadu dynasty to relinquish their bodies, and thus he relinquished their bodies, to relieve the burden of the world. This action was like picking out a thorn with a thorn, though both are the same to the controller. Now this verse is an explanation of the difficult to understand actions of the Lord Shri Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces Srila Prabhupada's purport and Vishwanatha Chakravarti Thakur's explanation of why the sages of Naimisharanya were disturbed by the account of the Yadus' demise, emphasizing the assurance that the Yadus did not suffer.

And his pure devotees. Many places it is said all the Lord's activities or the pure devotees activities in this world are completely transcendental. But these transcendental activities are not always easy to understand. Some of them are very difficult to understand. Especially the members of the Yadu dynasty, how did they relinquish their bodies, how do they give up their bodies fighting with each other, killing each other, getting intoxicated and when fighting with each other, how can this be understood as a transcendental activity of the pure devotees, the Yadavas, the members of the Yadu dynasty, the associates of Krishna? How can we understand? So that is explained in this verse. So let's hear Srila Prabhupada's purport which will wonderfully, very nicely explain this particular verse. In the purport Srila Prabhupada says Srila Vishwanacharya Chakravarti Thakur, who is one of the previous Acharyas, he suggests that the rishis like Shaunaka and others who are hearing Srimad Bhagavatam from Suta Goswami at Naimisharanya were not happy to hear about the Yadus dying in the madness of intoxication. The sages of Naimisharanya, they are devotees, now they're hearing about other devotees and the Yadus as devotees, are they really fighting in the madness of intoxication and dying due to that fighting? So that is not very pleasing to hear for them. So here Srila Vishwanacharya Chakravarti Thakur explains that to give them relief from this mental agony Suta Goswami assured them that they will not

other simply to give up their material bodies that's all. So Srila Prabhupada further explains this point: the Lord and his eternal associates appeared on earth to help the administrative demigods in eradicating the burdens of the world and to remove the burden of the world from the of the world. He therefore called for some of the confidential demigods to appear in the Yadu family and serve him in his great mission. After the mission was fulfilled the demigods by the will of the Lord relinquished their corporeal bodies by fighting amongst themselves in the madness of intoxication. Their material bodies anyway they have to give up after their work is over. Everybody gives up but how they give up? In their case it is by the arrangement of the Supreme Lord. It's not their choice. It's not their Karma. It is the arrangement of the Supreme Lord. So it is the will of the Lord. The demigods are accustomed to drinking the Somarasa beverage and therefore the drinking of wine and intoxication are not unknown to them. Sometimes they were put into trouble for indulging in intoxication. Once the sons of Kuvaira fell in the wrath of Narada for being intoxicated but afterwards they regained their original forms by the grace of the Lord Sri Krishna. This

**Summary:** The speaker explains that both asuras and demigods are part and parcel of the Lord, but the difference lies in their obedience, using the analogy of removing a thorn with another thorn.

is explained in the 10th canto of the Bhagavata. We are still in the first canto. 10th canto this is explained this pastime of the Lord and how the two demigods the sons of Kuvaira were delivered by Krishna even though they were cursed by Narada they were delivered by Krishna. Now Prabhupada explains one important point here for us to understand. For the Supreme Lord both the Asuras and the demigods are equal. Why? Both of them are his part and parcels. All living beings in the entire creation are part and parcel of the Lord. mamaivamso jivaloke jivabhutasanatanah mama amsa they are my part. In the fourth chapter Krishna also says yena bhutanee aseshani drakshasi atmani ataumayee in the 35th of the sixth chapter that every living being is my part and parcel its mine belongs to me is in me Krishna says in the fourth chapter the Bhagavad-gita. So nobody is independent in their entire being. The Bhagavad Gita asks the personality to be independent of the lord nobody is separate from the lord means nobody is unrelated to the lord everybody is related connected as lord's own so that some of them are asuras and others are devatas does not mean that the asuras don't belong to krishna and the devatas alone belong to krishna no both of them belong to krishna so for the supreme lord both are equal same thing krishna says in bhagavad gita the ninth chapter the difference is however between the demigods and the demons or the devatas and asuras the demigods are obedient to the lord whereas the asuras are not obedient to the lord

**Key Quote:** "So then the person to remove that thorn takes another thorn and and uses that second thorn to actually clear the skin in the area where the thorn is pricked"
**Summary:** The speaker provides a detailed explanation of the thorn analogy, drawing on the practical experience of removing a thorn from one's foot in an agricultural setting.

therefore the example of picking out a thorn by another thorn is quite befitting the example that is given here is explained also by shrina pravpa what is this example one thorn which causes pinpricks on the leg of the lord is certainly disturbing to the lord and the other thorn which takes out the disturbing elements certainly gives service to the lord to understand this it's very common thing in in agricultural fields when somebody is walking barefoot and let us say because they're walking barefoot a thorn pricks the leg the bottom of the foot the sole of the foot then to remove that thorn sometimes may not be possible just by pulling it out because it is gone little deep inside so then the person to remove that thorn takes another thorn and and uses that second thorn to actually clear the skin in the area where the thorn is pricked and thereby making it easy to pull out the thorn with the second thorn the first thorn so this may not be um very much an experience of the city people who never have to walk barefoot who never have experience of a thorn pricking their leg but this is the most appropriate example in this instance

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating the distinction between asuras and devatas, emphasizing the Lord's role in protecting the devatas and destroying the asuras, ultimately doing good to both by granting them liberation.

so Prabhupada explains although every living being is a part of the city as long as they owned some of theين parts and parcel of the Lord still one who is a pin prick to the Lord is called an hasura who is disobedient and unnecessarily gives trouble to others and one who is a voluntary servitor of the Lord is called a devata or demigod both are parts and parcels of the lord both belong to the lord but still one is called an asura another one is called the devata In the material world, the devatas and asuras are always contending. There is competition between them. And the devatas are always saved from the hands of the asuras by the Lord. Both of them are under the control of the Lord. Both the devatas and asuras, both. The world is full of two kinds of living beings. Krishna explains this in the 16th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. So, there are two kinds of created beings, the devatas and asuras. The Lord's mission is always to protect the devatas and destroy the asuras. Whenever there is such a need in the world and to do good to both of them. The Lord does. Good to both of them. Because whether he kills the asuras or protects the devatas, both are delivered by the Lord. The contact with the Lord is assured, guaranteed liberation. For whoever comes in contact, whichever way. So, Lord does good to both. He is not partial to the devatas. So, I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (1.15.35) and explains its meaning, focusing on the Lord's appearance and disappearance.

In this session we will be discussing from the 35th verse of the 15th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. Yatha Matsyadi Roopani Dhatte Jahyad Yatha Nataha Bhubharat Shapito Yena Jaho Tacha Kalevaram. The meaning of this verse is: The Supreme Lord relinquished the body which he manifested to diminish the burden of the earth. Just like a magician, he relinquishes one body to accept different ones, like the fish incarnation and others.

**Key Quote:** "So impersonal philosophy is that God is impersonal, God has no transcendental personality no personality and the widest philosophy is God is void, shunya, formless, no form at all."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the impersonal and voidist philosophies, contrasting them with the Vaishnava understanding of God's personal form and Srila Prabhupada's role in countering these philosophies in the West.

This is another difficult verse to understand. The way the Lord appears and disappears in this material world in different forms is very nicely explained by Shri Lasuta Goswami in this particular verse. Shri La Prabhupada elaborates in the purport: The Supreme Lord, personality of Godhead, is neither impersonal nor formless. Shri La Prabhupada elaborates in the purport: Two theories, Maya vada and Shunya vada. And the prayer we offer to Shri La Prabhupada: Nirvishesha Shunya Vadi Pashchakya Deshat Aryane. Prabhupada has come, being empowered by the supreme Lord, for the sake of delivering, especially the western countries, which are filled with this impersonalism and voidism. So, impersonal philosophy is that God is impersonal, God has no transcendental personality, no personality.

**Key Quote:** "the Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead is not impersonal, he is not formless, but his body is non different from him."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the Vaishnava understanding of the Supreme Lord's eternal, blissful form, drawing from authentic scriptures and referencing Brahma Samhita.

And the voidist philosophy is God is void, shunya, formless, no form at all. So, the Vaishnavas, based on the authentic scriptures, explain and understand and realize the fact that the Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead is not impersonal, he is not formless, but his body is non-different from him. Our body is different from our self, Krishna's form or body is not different from his self. Therefore he is known as an embodiment, as the embodiment of eternity, knowledge and bliss.

**Key Quote:** "That Krishna's form or body is never material, though it may appear like that, it may appear like that, but it is not material, it is completely spiritual."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna's form is entirely spiritual, not material, and quotes the Brihad-Vaishnava Tantra to support this point, highlighting the differences between material and spiritual bodies.

This is the description of the Brahma Samhita. In the Brahad-Vaishnava Tantra, it is clearly mentioned that anyone who considers the form of Lord Krishna to be made of material energy must be ostracized by all means. What's the meaning of this? That Krishna's form or body is never material, though it may appear like that, but it is not material, it is completely spiritual. That means in that spiritual form there is no deterioration, there is no action of the gunas, there is no death, there is no birth, there is no disease, there is no pain, there is no blood, there is no flesh, there is no bones, there is no matter.

**Key Quote:** "he displays different kinds of forms suitable for the pastime suitable for the past so the pastime requires Krishna to display his form as a small child of mother Yashoda he displays that form"
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the apparent changes in Krishna's form during His pastimes, explaining that these are displays for the sake of the pastimes and do not affect His eternal, spiritual nature.

So, how to understand this? Because when Krishna performs his pastimes, he appears to take birth as a small infant, son of Devaki, then later son of mother Yashoda, and then he appears to grow from a small infant like ordinarily any child will grow up. But if there are changes in the body and the spiritual body is eternal without any change, then how do we understand that in spite of such changes, apparent changes, the Lord's body is completely spiritual, changeless, without deterioration? How do we understand this? So that is explained that for the sake of his pastimes he displays different kinds of forms suitable for the pastime. So the pastime requires Krishna to display his form as a small child of mother Yashoda, he displays that form. If it requires that he display the form of four-handed Vishnu in front of Devaki and Vasudeva to convince them that he is a supreme lord who has appeared as the son, he displays that form. That's all, he is what he is irrespective of what form he displays. This is the point.

**Summary:** The speaker continues quoting the Brihad-Vaishnava Tantra, warning against associating with those who consider the Lord's body material and emphasizing the need for purification from such contamination.

So therefore, the Brihadra Vaishnava Tantra says one should never consider the supreme lord's form to be made of material energy or material matter. It is not a material form. Our form, this form, is made of matter, therefore it has got blood and bones and it is subject to deterioration, it gets diseased sometimes, subject to death. This is material form, whereas Krishna's form is not material form. That's the thing asserted here by Srila Prabhupada quoting the Brihadra Vaishnava Tantra. Further, the Brihadra Vaishnava Tantra says if by chance the face of such an infidel is seen, one must clean himself by jumping in the river with his clothing. That means never hear or never consider that the Lord's body is material like our

If you happen to hear from somebody who is an infidel, means he is a non-believer, he is a demon, he is a faithless materialist, then better you cleanse yourself, you cleanse yourself by taking bath in a sacred river because all such contaminations are obstacles on the path of progress in spiritual life. Therefore it is recommended like this. Śrīlāprabhu for further saraśaṉadnikaśyap. Yesterday the Lord's body was born, so Śrīla Prabhupada further says the Lord is described as amrita, or deathless because He has no amrita, deathless, so He doesn't have a material body. Only the material body is subject to birth and death. So what is it that is described as born? It is the body. Body is come to natürlich, body is born, body is changing, body is aging, body is becoming infected with disease, not the soul, not the spirit, not the real you. So please understand this

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a magician to explain how the Lord's apparent death or changes are like illusions, not affecting His true, eternal nature.

point. So further Srila Prabhupada says under the circumstances the Lord's dying or quitting his body is like the jugglery of a magician. This is proper explanation. The magician shows by his tricks that he is cut into pieces, burnt to ashes or made unconscious by hypnotic influences, but all are false shows only. I don't know if you have seen a, been to a magic show, especially the magic show in which the magician himself, he will make a demonstration. You can see that he's put inside one box and then he will call somebody from the audience and say I am in seven, I am inside the box completely closed from all sides, then you take one knife and slit the box into two and then separate the two halves of the box, okay. And then when this is done, after this is done, the magician will come out of one of the parts of the box as if he has not been cut at all. So these are all tricks that magician is performing to make it appear like he was in the box and somebody from the audience came and cut the box into two pieces while he was inside and then after that he comes out of the box intact without any cuts. The magician will remove the

**Summary:** Continuing the magician analogy, the speaker explains that the Lord's various incarnations, like the fish incarnation, are exhibitions of His eternal forms, not transformations.

No. So, it is all appearances, they are false shows. Similarly, just as the magician himself is neither burnt to ashes nor cut to pieces, nor is he dead or unconscious at any stage of his magical demonstration, similarly, the Lord has his eternal forms of unlimited variety, of which the fish incarnation was exhibited within this universe, which was exhibited in this universe is also one of them. So, Lord is not fish, neither is entering a fish body, he is coming in his original spiritual form as a fish, that is just exhibited. Because there are innumerable universes, somewhere or other the fish incarnation must be manifesting his pastimes without cessation.

**Summary:** The speaker describes how Krishna's pastimes are continuously unfolding in different universes simultaneously, creating the appearance of change while His eternal Leela remains constant.

So, just like Krishna appeared 5000 years back in this material world. So, when he appeared, the next moment Krishna is appearing in another universe as a small child. Meantime, in this universe what is happening, he appears to be grown up, he has been transferred to Mother Yashoda's house from Devaki's lap in the prison. So, in the other universe, after little time where he has appeared, he will again appear in another universe and in that other universe he will be transferred. So, his pastimes are continuously going on, it appears like here some changes are happening, but actually his Leela is going on, he is not changing.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the word 'dhatte,' meaning eternally accepted, to highlight that the Lord's incarnations are not temporary but eternal forms.

In this verse, the particular word dhatte, eternally accepted and not the word dhitva, accepted for the occasion is used. This is explained by the Acharya. Dhatte means eternally accepted, not temporarily accepting something. The idea is that the Lord does not create the fish incarnation, he eternally has such a form and appearance or disappearance of such an incarnation serves particular purposes. So, the Matsya Avatara, the personal form of the Lord, the incarnation of the personal form of the Lord, Swamsha, his personal form, he appears in different incarnations: Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha. Personal. So, these are eternal forms.

**Key Quote:** "They think that I am formless. And they also have a theory that I accept a form to serve a purpose. Because of which I am now manifested as a human being."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes verses from the Bhagavad Gita (7.24-25) to refute the impersonalists' view that the Lord is formless and only accepts forms temporarily, explaining that the Lord's true nature is concealed by His yoga maya from non-devotees.

These are not temporary forms. In the Bhagavad Gita, in 7th chapter, 24th and 25th verses, the Lord says, the impersonalists think that I have no form. They think that I am formless. And they also have a theory that I accept a form to serve a purpose, because of which I am now manifested as a human being. But such speculators are without sharp intelligence. Avyaktam vyaktimapannam manyantemam abuddhaya manyante. They think like that because they lack sufficient intelligence. Though they may be good scholars in Vedic literature, they are practically ignorant of my inconceivable energies and my eternal forms of personality, param bhavam ajananto, they do not know my eternal nature, my supreme eternal form and his energies, Krishna's energy, they don't know. The reason is that I reserve the power of not being exposed to non-devotees by my mystic curtain, naham prakasha sarvasya yoga maya sama vrittaha. I am covered by my yoga maya potency, therefore I am not manifest. Today I will stop here, thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 36th verse of the 15th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining that Kali Yuga fully manifested upon Krishna's departure, bringing inauspicious conditions.

In this session, we will be discussing the 36th and 37th verses of the 15th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 36th verse first.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna's departure from this world to his personal abode in his self-same form, not change of body."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna's departure was not a change of body like ordinary death, but a return to his eternal abode in his original form, contrasting material and spiritual realities and explaining that Kali's influence is limited to those with a poor fund of knowledge.

So Krishna's departure from this world to his personal abode in his self-same form, not change of body. This difference has to be noted. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says, "Death means change of body." Now here, Krishna is departing to his personal abode in the self-same form. He never changes his spiritual form. So eternally he is the Lord. But eternally he has his form. Eternally he has everything. He has his energies. He has his paraphernalia. He has his name. He has his qualities. He has his activities. Everything eternal. So this distinction should be understood between material name, material form, material paraphernalia, material activities, material possessions, material manifestation. Everything is temporary. Everything material is temporary. And everything spiritual is permanent, eternal, changeless. As long as Krishna was present, Kali could not manifest its actual characteristic of inauspicious conditions. But when Krishna left this earthly planet, from that very day, Kali manifested, became fully manifest. And the full manifestation means creating inauspicious conditions for those who are endowed with a poor fund of knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "The influence of Kali can be enforced only upon those who are not fully developed in God consciousness."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that those fully developed in God consciousness and engaged in pure devotional service are beyond the influence of Kali and the material modes of nature.

Prabhupada explains in the purport: The influence of Kali can be enforced only upon those who are not fully developed in God consciousness. So Kali, or for that matter even the material modes of nature, cannot act upon those who are fully developed in God consciousness. Krishna says this in the Bhagavad Gita: those who are engaged in pure devotional service in an unfailing manner, they are always on the spiritual platform, Brahma Bhuyaya Kalpate Guna Tita. They are above the three modes, above the influence of the three modes. And above the influence of the three modes also means above the influence of Kali because Kali acts in the material atmosphere through the three gunas.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes taking complete shelter of Krishna for protection from Kali, contrasting Krishna's transcendental reality with the illusory nature of the material world.

Prabhupada says further, one can neutralize the effects of Kali by keeping oneself fully under the supreme care of the personality of Godhead. Actually, Krishna is our only protector, only maintainer, and we should take complete shelter of Krishna through the proper method. Our material method will not work because Krishna is not a material personality. This material personality is a concoction, is a creation of the illusory energy, whereas Krishna's personality is beyond all material manifestations, beyond illusion, is a sent person reality, eternal reality. So take shelter of Krishna who always does give permanent eternal protection to everyone except those who turn away from him and are in the clutches of the illusory energy, except for them.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the age of Kali began after the battle of Kurukshetra, but its influence was suppressed by Krishna's presence, and upon his departure, ill omens appeared, indicating the full manifestation of Kali Yuga.

That's what Prabhupada is telling here. The age of Kali ensued just after the battle of Kurukshetra, but it could not exert its influence because of the presence of the Lord, because of the presence of Lord Krishna. The Lord, however, left this earthly planet in his own transcendental body, self-same form. That's what is said in this verse, his own transcendental body. And as soon as he left, the symptoms of Kali Yuga as were envisioned by Maharaj Yudhishthira prior to Arjuna's arrival from Dwaraka began to manifest. And Maharaj Yudhishthira rightly conjectured on the departure of the Lord from the earth even before Arjuna could come back with the actual news of the departure of Krishna from Dwaraka. Yudhishthira Maharaj, seeing the ill omens, conjectured that these ill omens are indicating Krishna's departure from this world. As we have already explained, the Lord left our sight just as when the sun sets it is out of our sight. Nothing happens to the sun when it sets, it is just disappeared from our vision, our sight.

**Key Quote:** "The influence of the age of Kali is meant for godless so-called civilized man."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the symptoms of Kali Yuga, including greed, falsehood, and violence, and contrasts godless, uncivilized people with God-conscious, civilized individuals.

The influence of the age of Kali began manifesting, and from authentic scriptures it is learned that the age of Kali still has to run on for 427,000 years. If I were to put it in the form of lakhs, the total duration of Kali is 4,32,000, out of which 5,000, if you deduct what remains, this balance is 427,000 years. So, the symptoms of the Kali Yuga as mentioned above, namely avarice, greed (avarice means greed), falsehood, diplomacy (diplomacy means duplicitous behavior), cheating, nepotism, violence, and all such things are already involved in the Kali Yuga. And no one can imagine what is going to happen gradually with further increase of the influence of Kali till the day of annihilation. We have already come to know that the influence of the age of Kali is meant for godless so-called civilized man. They call themselves civilized, but they are not civilized. They are godless. So, therefore they are uncivilized. God conscious or godly people are always civilized, are always properly behaving, properly acting, properly situated, have all the good qualities that are to be found in...

Yesyasti Bhakti Bhagavati Akinchana Sarvair Gunai Stratra Samasate Suraha. In fact, demigod means divine nature. So, divine nature means god conscious people, godly character as defined in the scriptures. This is not somebody's concoction. It is a definite description in the 16th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. The first three verses describe divine qualities, divine characteristics. Yesyasti Bhakti Bhagavati Akinchana Sarvair Gunai Stratra Samasate Suraha. Yesyasti Bhakti Bhagavati Akinchana Sarvair Gunai Stratra Samasate Suraha. And you can see each one of them is good quality, good qualification, good behavior. Those who are under the protection of the Lord have nothing to fear from this horrible age. Maharaj Yudhishtira was a great devotee of the Lord and there was no necessity of his being afraid of the age of knowledge. Yesyasti Bhakti Bhagavati Akinchana Sarvair Gunai Stratra Samasate Suraha.

**Key Quote:** "Before death comes one must retire from active household life or one must retire from material activities."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of retiring from material activities, including household life, to focus on spiritual realization and prepare for returning to Godhead, using Yudhishthira's example as a lesson.

Home, back to God. Yudhishthir is a pure devotee, so he doesn't have to actually do any preparation. He is always God conscious. So, but he wants to teach us before death comes, one must retire from active household life, or one must retire from material activities. Even if one is not a householder, even a brahmachari should retire from all material activities and prepare himself to go back home, back to God. So Yudhishthir Mahal is setting the example for us. The Pandavas are eternal companions of the Lord and therefore they are more interested in the company of the Lord than anything else. The eternal companions of the Lord always accompany the Lord in his mission in the material world. That's the meaning of eternal companions in this context. Besides that, being an ideal king, Maharaj Yudhishtira wanted to retire just to set an example for others. As soon as there is some young fellow to look after the family, then after the household affairs, one should at once retire from family life to uplift oneself to spiritual realization. One should not rot in the dark well of household life till one is dragged out by the will of yamaraj. So this is a lesson we should take from Yudhishthira Maharaj's behavior: don't remain in household life till the end of life in the body, before that quit household life.

**Key Quote:** "Human form of life means a life of responsibility, and the king ensures that people take advantage of this human form of life by becoming very responsible."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Yudhishthira Maharaj handing over the kingdom to Parikshit Maharaj, emphasizing the king's responsibility to guide citizens towards spiritual realization and the importance of human life for understanding the difference between temporary and permanent.

In this session we will be discussing from the 38th verse of the 15th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. स्वराट् पौत्रं बिनैनं आत्मनः सुसमं गुनैहि तोय नीव्याः पतिम् भूमेर् अभ्यसिंचत् गजाह्वये The meaning of this 38th verse is: Thereafter in the capital of Hastinapura he enthroned his grandson who was trained and equally qualified as the emperor and master of all land bordered by the seas. So here is the description of Yudhishthira Maharaj retiring from active household life and he is handing over charge of ruling the world to his trained and qualified grandson, Parikshit Maharaj. Parikshit Maharaj was the only surviving descendant of the Pandava family of the Kuru dynasty. Everyone else was killed in the battle of Kurukshetra. So Yudhishthira Maharaj handed over charge to Parikshit Maharaj and he handed over charge as the emperor and master of all lands bordered by the seas, the whole world. He handed over charge of ruling the entire world to Parikshit Maharaj. Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "The total land on the earth bordered by the seas was under the subjugation of the king of the Kuru dynasty, the king of Hastinapura." This is the arrangement. The emperor of the world ruled from the place called Hastinapura. Hastinapura is modern day Delhi. Elsewhere Srila Prabhupada explains. So the capital was always in Hastinapura of the rulers of the entire world. There was subordination. There were subordinate kings and they had their smaller jurisdiction of province or state or some small kingdom, but they were always subordinate to the emperor. So that was actually the system, that there were different territorial kings who were protected by the emperor against any invasion by rogues and thieves and dacoits etc. So they used to rule the citizens very nicely according to the scriptural directions, according to the kshatriya dharma, the perfect system of administration given in the perfect scriptures, coming from the perfect source, the supreme personality of Godhead. So Srila Prabhupada further says, "Maharaja Yudhishtira trained his grandson Maharaj Pariksit, who was equally qualified in state administration in terms of the king's obligation to the citizens." Earlier Srila Prabhupada elaborately explained what were the obligations of the king to the citizens. The king had to essentially ensure that all the necessities were provided for the citizens so that the citizens can actually become responsible for preparing themselves to go back to Godhead after having achieved or after having received a human form of life. So human form of life means a life of responsibility and the king ensures that people take advantage of this human form of life by becoming very responsible, not that they are busy simply earning money or busy with some material activities, busy with some sense gratification, all under the influence of the illusory energy for some temporary effects. No. Human being means should understand the difference between the temporary and permanent, material and spiritual, body and soul, matter and spirit. Clear difference or distinction should be made and the human being has the developed consciousness or intelligence or brain substance to actually be able to do this.

#### Bonafide Spiritual Master, Material World, Sense Gratification, Different Bodies, Conceptions of Enjoyment

**Key Quote:** "If I want to enjoy like a dog, I should get a dog's body."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the need for a bonafide spiritual master, describes the material world as an ocean of sense objects, and explains how different desires for enjoyment lead to different types of bodies, referencing the 15th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita.

Under proper guidance. Therefore scriptures say, approach a bonafide spiritual master who is self realized and who has seen the truth, who is conversant with the subject spiritual subject matter by having properly studied it under another bonafide spiritual master in discipline succession coming from Krishna. These things are all very clearly explained. So these are, that's a creature depending on the type of senses they have acquired, the material senses, there are sense objects and to give an example for a dog, a male dog, the form of the female dog is very attractive, is very attractive. For a male deer, the form of the female deer is very attractive. These type of illusory attractions are plenty in this material world. So one of our acharyas, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, says this material world is like vishaya sagara, an ocean of sense objects. Vishaya means something enjoyable by the senses. For the eyes it is all what we say as beautiful form, form, not form, forms, beautiful forms. For the ears it is sweet sounds. For the tongue it is palatable, tasty edibles and as you know different creatures have different things they consider as edible. For a hog, stool is very much relaxable and is an edible. It eats too. It eats rubbish. Camels eat thorns. And there are different creatures with different kinds of a sense of taste according to tongue they have acquired, according to their desire to enjoy eating or seeing or smelling or touching or hearing. This all simply centered around a concoction in the mind to enjoy materially in a particular way. The business of the living being in this material world, having acquired these material senses, centered around a material mind with a certain conception of enjoyment. Why these different types of bodies, different souls are getting in this material world? Because there are different conceptions of enjoyment. If I want to enjoy like a dog, I should get a dog's body. If I want to enjoy like a cat, I should get a cat's body. If I want to enjoy like a tiger, I should get a tiger's body. This is the whole principle of getting a material body. This is very nicely explained in the 15th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. Please read or study the 15th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita very systematically. Krishna explains this. I just quoted two verses, but it is very elaborately, nicely explained by Prabhupada in the translation and the purports of these verses in the 15th chapter.

#### Guidance, Goal of Human Life, Material Existence, Kingdom of God, Chanting Hare Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Unless we approach a bona fide spiritual master after receiving such guidance, as to real goal of human life is to go back home, back to Godhead."
**Summary:** This segment stresses the importance of guidance from a God-conscious leader and a bona fide spiritual master to achieve the real goal of human life, which is to return to Godhead, and suggests that chanting Hare Krishna can awaken God consciousness and create the atmosphere of the kingdom of God on Earth.

So, unless we are guided by a God-conscious king, administrator, ruler, unless we approach a bona fide spiritual master after receiving such guidance as to real goal of human life is to go back home, back to Godhead, to get out of this material existence, which is temporary and filled with miseries, and go to that place where there are no miseries, which is full of bliss, which is permanent, eternal, abode full of bliss and knowledge. So, unless we receive proper guidance, we will waste our time. We will waste our time. We will waste our time. We will waste our time. We will waste our time. We will waste our time. We will waste our time. We will waste our time and our life only in pursuit of some temporary sense pleasures which are fleeting. So, it is specifically told Maharaj Pariksit was trained in state administration in terms of the king's obligation to the citizens. Thus, Pariksit Maharaj was enthroned on the seat of Maharaj Yudhishthira prior to Yudhishthira's departure back to Godhead. Now, concerning Maharaj Pariksit, one word is used, Vinayinam. The reason is, this Vinayinam means properly trained. He was trained to actually ensure the happiness of the citizens, which was due to the king's obligation to the citizens, which was due to ample production of natural produce, such as grains, fruits, milk, herbs, valuable stones, minerals, and everything that the people needed. They were even free from bodily miseries, anxieties of mind, disturbances caused by natural phenomena, and other living beings. So, this was the standard of administration when Yudhishthira Maharaj ruling, Pariksit Maharaj ruling. This was the standard. Because everyone was happy in all respects, there was no resentment. Although there were sometimes battles between kings, different state kings, for political reasons and supremacy. So, people were trained to attain the highest goal of life and therefore, they were enlightened enough not to quarrel over some trivial material things. So, the influence of Kali gradually infiltrated the good qualities of both the kings and the citizens and therefore presently we can see there is a tense situation developed between the rulers and the ruled, between the kings and the citizens or between the administrators and the citizens. But even today in this condition there can be spiritual emolument and God consciousness if people follow this program of Krishna consciousness simply by beginning with chanting Hare Krishna or chanting God's name, there can be God consciousness awakened in everyone and there can be the kingdom of God, the atmosphere of the kingdom of God even on this earth planet today now by awakening the God consciousness through simply

**Key Quote:** "After responsibly handing over charge To Parvatiya"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of the verse, focusing on Yudhishthira's actions of placing Vajra as king and preparing to renounce household life after handing over responsibilities.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 39th verse of the 15th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam.

**Key Quote:** "So one must quit household life and become detached renounced from all household life attachments from all family attachments from all material attachments saw Srila Prabhupada"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of detachment and renunciation, emphasizing the importance of the Varnashrama Dharma system based on quality and work for real human life.

And one person who we have mentioned, and who has mentioned, everything is related to the Prajapatiya. They affect people, situating themselves. This flows in the way of wholesale. It is meant to be. So, if you remember that before, he had... It will be life, and for quitting household life, he has to actually become detached. Quitting does not mean go away from home and carry within the heart all the attachment for household life. No, that is not the way to quit. So, Srila Prabhupada explained this phrase, "placed in himself the fire for quitting household life." Prabhupada explains in the purport: "Maharaja Yudhishthira, after placing Maharaja Pariksit on the imperial throne of Hastinapura and after posting Vajra, the great-grandson of Lord Krishna, as king of Mathura, accepted the renounced order of life." So, one must quit household life and become detached, renounced from all household life attachments, from all family attachments, from all material attachments. So, Srila Prabhupada explains the system of four orders of life and four castes in terms of quality and work, known as Varna-ashrama Dharma, is the beginning of real human life. Varana ashrama for Varanas according to occupational characteristics, occupational duties: Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra, all are qualified differently according to the acquired nature. Sattvic people, Rajasic people, mixed Rajoguna and Tamoguna, and Tamsic people.

#### Varnashrama Dharma, spiritual elevation, detachment

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So, human life, real human life means Varnashrama dharma."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the four Ashramas (Brahmacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha, Sannyas) as a system for gradual spiritual elevation, highlighting Yudhishthira Maharaj's example of retiring from active life and becoming detached.

So, they should work to maintain themselves for the sake of fixing the ultimate goal of life as self-realization. Not only for Brahmanas, not only for some people, it's for even the Shudras. It's for every human being within the Varnashrama system. Every human being. Four Varnas. And then four Ashramas. What are the four Ashramas? Brahmacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha, Sannyas. These four Ashramas are for gradual spiritual elevation. So, now Yudhishthira Maharaj is quitting household life in order to enter the stage where one completely dedicates his life for preparing for going back to Godhead, with no other responsibilities, no other duties, because all those responsibilities and duties have been handed over to the son or the grandson or somebody else younger. So, human life, real human life means Varnashrama dharma. This is explained in the scriptures. Maharaj Yudhishthira, as the protector of this system of human activities, timely retired from active life as a sanyasi, handing over the charge of the administration to a trained prince, Maharaj Pariksit. He became detached and renounced after handing over charge.

**Key Quote:** "So, these stages are natural and very scientific and progressive for somebody whose ultimate aim of life is to go back to Godhead at the end of this life."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the importance of Varnashrama Dharma and the four Ashramas for achieving the ultimate goal of going back to Godhead, emphasizing that this goal is for every human being due to their developed intelligence.

So, Srila Prabhupada says further, "The scientific system of Varnashrama dharma divides the human life into four divisions of occupation and four orders of life." So, Srila Prabhupada elaborates what I just explained. The four orders of life as Brahmachari, Grhastha, Vanaprastha, and Sanyasi are to be followed by all, irrespective of the occupational division. If somebody is serious about going back home, back to Godhead, they should follow these divisions that are made in the ashrama system. Brahmachari means student life, and Grhastha means householder life, and Vanaprastha means retired life, and Sanyasa means renounced or detached life. So, these stages are natural and very scientific and progressive for somebody whose ultimate aim of life is to go back to Godhead at the end of this life. Before quitting the body, one has to prepare. Now, this goal is for every human being, because human being has developed, developed intelligence, developed consciousness, developed understanding, developed brain. That is the meaning of human life.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that everyone is eligible for spiritual advancement and highlights the necessity of guidance from a bona fide spiritual master (Acharya) who preaches without discrimination.

Now, relatively speaking, one may be more intelligent than the other in terms of some material calculation. But as far as spiritual development is concerned, spiritual advancement is concerned, all are eligible. All are meant for spiritual elevation. Of course, this has to be practiced under the proper direction of the bona fide spiritual master. You require spiritual guidance, not of any ordinary person, but one who is actually qualified, a bona fide spiritual master, Acharya. Therefore, you can see in our culture, in our tradition, there have been acharyas who have preached to the mass of people without discrimination: Madhvacharya, Ramanujacharya, Shankaracharya, and acharyas. So, Prabhupada is the acharya for our times.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Srila Prabhupada's tireless preaching efforts, including translating and distributing books in various languages, to help people awaken their dormant Krishna consciousness.

And he travelled all over the world and preached to everyone, all sections of people in the society. Prabhupada was preaching to everyone tirelessly. He travelled, he wrote books, and he instructed his disciples who were dedicated for this preaching mission in assisting Srila Prabhupada to preach to everyone in the world. He was instructing them to translate these books into all the possible languages of the different parts of the world, because somebody may not be educated in English. So then, they can read their local language. So Prabhupada said, translate his books into the local language and distribute those books in those languages. So, Prabhupada's teachings, Prabhupada's instructions, Prabhupada's explanations are available in all the major languages of the world today. So, people can read that and learn from the devotees how to practice Krishna consciousness simply by beginning with chanting Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Now, by chanting and associating with devotees and hearing or reading these books in their respective languages, people can actually awaken their dormant Krishna consciousness which is already there in everyone's heart.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "They can awaken their Krishna consciousness and actually start making progress simply by beginning with chanting"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna consciousness can be awakened through chanting and association with devotees, emphasizing the preciousness of the human form of life and the inherent inquisitiveness of children.

They can awaken their Krishna consciousness and actually start making progress simply by beginning with chanting and gradually becoming more interested in the spiritual subject matter which is appealing to every human being, especially every human being. Actually, it is meant for all living beings, all spirit souls in all forms of life. But, the human form is special, that every human being has already got the brain substance to understand the importance of spiritual life. Every human being has got it. Therefore, you can see the inquisitiveness in a child which is born in any type of family, any type of background, doesn't matter. The inquisitiveness is indicated when the child begins to speak. It begins asking all kinds of questions from the parents. Any child which begins to talk, any mother will testify to this. All mothers will testify that when it begins to speak, it keeps on asking questions, questions, questions. What is this? What is that? What is this? What is that? Why this? Why that? Now, which means that, now this is true for a child born of poor parents, rich parents, Indian parents, American parents, educated parents, uneducated parents. It's true for all children. That is why our scriptures say human form is very, very precious.

#### Brahma Jigyasa, spiritual guidance, Prasadam, Krishna consciousness

**Verse References:** BG 4.13
**Content Type:** practical
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "That's the duty of the parents."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of directing children towards Brahma Jigyasa (spiritual inquiry), seeking guidance from an Acharya, and spiritualizing existence through chanting Hare Krishna and partaking Prasadam (food offered to Krishna), making Krishna consciousness accessible to everyone.

That's why the scriptures say that. So, that inquisitiveness, Jigyasa, should be directed towards Brahma Jigyasa. Athato Brahma Jigyasa. That's the duty of the parents. And the parents are actually meant to direct the child to the Acharya, to the bona fide spiritual master. And Acharyas preach to everyone how to begin spiritual life by chanting Hare Krishna and how to progress by simple, very, very simple practices: offering food and eat, partaking the remnants of Prasadam. Everybody eats. But then don't simply eat like animals. You take Prasadam and spiritualize your entire existence. Ahara Shuddhau Sattva Sattva Shuddhihi. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita by Srila Prabhupada. Ahara Shuddhau Sattva Shuddhihi. You take purified foodstuff, your existence itself, Sattva existence becomes purified. The entire body becomes purified. The mind becomes purified. The intelligence becomes purified. So it's so important that people be taught to chant Hare Krishna and offer the food they are eating to Krishna and then partake the remnants of such food offered to Krishna, Prasadam, Krishna Prasadam. This is possible for every human being irrespective of who they are, what their social status is, or what their economic condition is. It's possible for everybody, because everybody is eating something for their survival. So it's possible for everybody. They have to be properly directed, guided. Guidance is required. Now in taking guidance, there is no discrimination to be made. Even the most intellectually developed person also requires his guidance. And of course, those who are not so intelligent or those who are not so intellectually developed, they also require guidance. Everyone requires guidance. That direction is given by the Acharya. So simply by this, it's possible for everyone to become Krishna conscious and prepare themselves to go back home, back to God. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

Nirmamo Nirahankara. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, "To become purified of material contamination is the necessary qualification for becoming one of the associates of the Lord." What's the meaning of going back home, back to Godhead? We all belong to the Lord as His associates. So, for reinstating ourselves in our original position as the associate of the Lord, Lord Krishna, we have to acquire the necessary qualification, and that qualification is to become purified of material contamination. This association with material atmosphere or material nature has resulted in our developing different kinds of attachment in our heart towards so many material things, both gross and subtle. Grossly, we are attached to material objects: my car, my house, my table, my chair, my furniture, my clothes, my ornaments. And certainly, we are attached to social status, some honor in society, some respectability in some material hierarchy. All these kinds of gross and subtle material attachments, we have to become purified of all such contamination, should become detached materially. No one can become an associate of the Lord or can go back to Godhead without such purification. This is absolutely required, essential for

everyone. Maharaj Yudhishthira, therefore, to become spiritually pure—spiritually pure means free from all material contamination—this spiritual purity at once gave up his royal opulence, relinquishing his royal dress and garments. So, Srila Prabhupada explains one specific aspect of renunciation in the vanashrama Dharma. Prabhupada says the kashaaya or saffron loincloth of a sannyasi indicates freedom from all attractive material garments. Sympathetically, when one takes sanyasa, then one receives a saffron loincloth. But that is actually indicative of something, not that everybody has to receive a saffron copium. No, it is indicative of freedom from all attractive material garments. We adore the body so much, or we are attached to the body so much, we decorate this body in so many ways, particularly the garments and, of course, the ornaments, garments and the ornaments, decorating this body. So, we have to give up those garments and ornaments and accept some simple clothing. And what did he do? The details will be explained. He actually gave up his royal dress and garments, and the next verse will tell that he dressed himself in some rejected, discarded, torn, old garments simply to cover the body, some simple cloth, any piece of cloth available which is not at all attractive, which is not at all

fashionable. So, he thus changed his dress accordingly. He became disinterested in his kingdom and family and thus became free from all material contamination or material designation. He had ruled as the emperor of the world, and in that position as the emperor of the world, he had his royal dress, he had his royal paraphernalia, he had his royal throne, he had his royal insignia, but it was required for ruling as the emperor of the world. But when he handed over charge, he no longer was keeping any of those garments or ornaments or any of the paraphernalia. Everything he gave up. In this way, he became detached from all those things. Also, it is important to understand becoming free from—it is to understand becoming free from material contamination also means becoming free from material designations. The definition of bhakti is very interesting. One of the definitions of bhakti: sarva upadhi vinir muktam. Bhakti means sarva upadhi vinir muktam.

**Key Quote:** "All these are designations which are the cause for our attachment and bondage in this material world"
**Summary:** Various types of material designations, such as family, society, wealth, and titles, are identified as causes of attachment and bondage.

to actually practice bhakti and advance in Krishna consciousness. So, Srila Prabhupada explains here, "People are generally attached to various kinds of designations: the designations of family, society, country, occupation, wealth, position, and many others." We have different roles in our normal life, householder life, or family life with different roles. I am the head of some family. I am an important member of some society, or I am having a position in the country in the political administration or occupation. I may be an expert technocrat or expert skilled artisan or some very, very expert painter or whatever, or designation of wealth. Oh, he is a trillionaire, he is a billionaire, he is in Fortune 500 list, or in British society, they used to get this designation as lord and earl upon paying some huge amount of money to the government to get such titles. So many of these are the definitions of bhakti: sarva upadhi vinir muktam bhakti sarva upadhi. But too many such institutions are there which have hard according to the the wealth one possess or one can pay for getting such designations, titles. So, all these are designations which are the cause for our attachment and bondage in this material world. As long as one is attached to today's material world, such designations is considered materially impure. This is the material contamination. This is a material impurity. I am having designations. The so-called leaders of men in the modern age are attached by national consciousness, but they do not know that such false consciousness is also another designation of the materially conditioned soul. One has to relinquish such designations before one can become eligible to go back to God

**Summary:** The speaker quotes Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's teachings on renouncing even the designations within the heart and identifying oneself as a servant of Krishna.

head. All designations will become free. Then somebody might say that in the renounced order of life, somebody calls you Maharaj, addresses you as sannyasi, that's also a designation. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu teaches in this regard how even though you are not a saint, you are not a saint, you are not a saint, you are not a saint, you are not a saint, you are not a saint, you are not a saint. For the sake of renouncing, we accept the renounced order formally, but you can become detached even without formally accepting the renounced order, and you should understand that to renounce means to renounce even these designations and titles within the heart. What does Chaitanya Mahaprabhu teach us? Naham vipro na cha narapati na pi vaisho na shudro naham varni na cha grahapati no vanastho yatirva. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, "If you ask me who am I? I am not a Brahmana, I am not a Kshatriya, I am not a Vaishya, I am not a Shudra, I am not a Brahmachari, I am not a grahastha, I am not a vanaprasad, I am not a sannyasi." So, what does He mean by this? He means that we should not be having any designations and the associated respect and honor and kind of this thing in the society, honor in the society for every position within our heart. We should not have any of those expectations or any of those attachments or any of those false egos. We should not have any of those. Then if Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, "I am not a Brahmin, I am not a Kshatriya, I am not a Vaishya, I am not a Shudra, I am not a Brahmachari, Ghrastha, Vana, Prasad, Sanyasin. What are you?" Kintu Prodhyan Nikhil Paramananda Poonamrata Abder Gopi Bhartuhu Pada Kamalayor Dasa Dasa Anudasaha. "I identify myself only as a servant of the servant of the servant of the servant of the Supreme Lord Krishna who is the protector and maintainer of the Gopis." So, this is our constitutional position, this is our eternal position, this is our actual position.

**Key Quote:** "Everyone, every living being, we are eternally Krishna's servants or Krishna's devotees."
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by emphasizing that being a devotee of Krishna is our eternal position, and the role of a sannyasi is to disseminate spiritual knowledge without expecting anything in return, maintaining humility.

Everyone, every living being, we are eternally Krishna's servants or Krishna's devotees. Now, don't misunderstand the word servant. Servant means devotee. Devotee means devoted to serving Krishna out of love, that kind of servant, loving, devotional servant. And that's a very sweet relationship between each one of us and Krishna, eternal relationship. So, that is our actual position, and that is not a designation. That is what we are at the core of our heart. That's what we are. These material designations are external impositions on that eternal position. So that gets covered. I forget I am a devotee, and then I think in terms of the body or in terms of the social position in the society. So actually, even though I have accepted sannyas and people, they recognize me as a sannyasi, that's only for the sake of social interaction so that people understand that here is a sannyasi means here is a person whom I can approach for any spiritual guidance, any spiritual clarification, any spiritual knowledge without the sannyasi expecting anything in return, free of charge, without. Because sannyasi is renounced, he does not require anything. So, he will not charge you anything. He will not ask anything from you. His life is dedicated for simply disseminating this knowledge, this practice, this understanding, this important valuable lesson, this goal of life. That's why the dress. It's like a policeman performs his duty very nicely with a uniform. The policeman actually, as far as skill is concerned, his activity is concerned, he can do without uniform, but for people to be able to easily approach him for traffic guidance and in driving on the road. So, with a uniform, he can perform very easily his job. Similarly, a sannyasi with this uniform. Treat me with honor. No. Sanyasi, if he thinks like that, he's actually fallen. He's not qualified. He's not qualified. This is very important.

**Key Quote:** "So let us go through the purport and try to understand this in a simple manner which Prabhupada explains."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains that they will be using Srila Prabhupada's purport to understand it in a simpler way.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 41st verse of the 15th chapter of the 1st Canto, Sriman Bhagavatam: वाचं जुहाव मनसी तत् प्राण इतरेचतं मृत्याव अपानं सोच्छर्गं तं पञ्चत्वे ही अजोह वीत। What is the meaning of this verse? Then he amalgamated all the sense organs into the mind. Then the mind emulsified. Then the body into life, life into breathing, his total existence into the embodiment of the five elements, and his body into death. Then, as pure self, he became free from the material conception of life. The translation sounds very, very technical, but Srila Prabhupada very nicely explains all these terms in the purport. So let us go through the purport and try to understand this in a simple manner which Prabhupada explains.

#### material conception of life, spiritual identity, relationship with Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Because the fact is, as spirit soul, I don't belong to this world. I belong to Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the material conception of life as identifying with the body and forgetting one's true spiritual identity and relationship with Krishna.

So the purport by Srila Prabhupada is as follows: Maharaja Yudhishthira, like his brother Arjuna, began to concentrate and gradually became freed from all material bondage. So, becoming free from material bondage means becoming free from the material conception of life. What is material conception of life? Actually, I am spirit soul, or you are spirit soul. Each person is spirit soul, but I wrongly think I am this body. I wrongly think I belong to this world, because the fact is, as spirit soul, I don't belong to this world. I belong to Krishna. I belong to Krishnaloka. I have a permanent, eternal, loving relationship with Krishna, but in my present condition, I have forgotten Krishna. I have forgotten that relationship. I have forgotten who I am. I have forgotten who is Krishna. I have forgotten what is my relationship with Krishna. I have forgotten the spiritual world, and by association with this material world, I identify I belong to this world. Because I have taken birth in a certain family, I identify I belong to this family. Now, this family itself, consisting of the family members, my mother, my father, my brothers, my sisters, my aunts, my uncles, my neighbors, my friends, my well-wishers, all this is developed around a false conception that I am the body.

**Key Quote:** "Without the body, there is no meaning to a relationship."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how material relationships are based on the false identification with the body and clarifies that becoming free from material bondage doesn't mean destroying relationships but understanding their relative importance.

You can easily understand. Without this body, is there any meaning to relationships? You just think about it. Without the body, there is no meaning to a relationship. So, all these relationships, my father, my mother, my family, or my friend, my neighbor, my relatives, everything is based on my conception that I am thinking I am this body. So, to become free from material bondage means to become freed from the wrong conception of the self, of who I am, and that is made possible by different methods of spiritual practice. Now, don't think that becoming free from material bondage is to completely destroy all our relationships, our responsibilities, our duties, our affection. No, it's not that. Please don't misunderstand that way.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Because only in the human form of body, it is possible for me as spirit soul to hear, understand, I am not this body."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of the human form for spiritual realization and warns about the consequences of not overcoming the misconception of identifying with the body before death.

It is to understand in the correct way what is the relative importance of this body of mine, the relationships I have with my understanding as I am the body, with my parents, with my... Not to simply negate, but to understand the relative importance. There is a certain importance for this human form of body, because only in the human form of body, it is possible for me as spirit soul to hear, understand, I am not this body. So, the body is also important. In my present condition, body is important, but it doesn't have absolute importance because it's temporal. It's going to perish. It's not going to remain with me forever. So, before it perishes, I should actually come out of this misconception that I am the body. Otherwise, what will happen? Supposing I don't come out of the misconception, then I have to face death, which means I am forced to leave this body. What is death? I don't die. As spirit soul, I don't die. This you have heard many times in the Bhagavad Gita.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Only a devotee, at the time of death, because he understands I am not the body, he is also able to understand now I am leaving the body."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how a devotee understands death and continues devotional service in the next life, then introduces Yudhishthira's specific process of detachment.

It's clearly explained. Only a devotee, at the time of death, because he understands I am not the body, he is also able to understand now I am leaving the body. And depending on Krishna, if I leave the body, then Krishna will guide me and take me to my next body and I continue my devotional service in my next body, provided I was engaged in devotional service in my previous body, and I have cultivated the desire to continue my devotional service even after quitting the body. So that's the devotional process. Now, as far as Yudhishthira is concerned, there is a technical difference in the process Yudhishthira Maharaj is actually employing for becoming detached. Let's hear what is Yudhishthira Maharaj doing. First he concentrated all the actions of the senses and amalgamated them into the mind.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "All our senses are centered about the mind. It is the mind which directs the senses."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how the mind directs the senses and how Yudhishthira is concentrating the actions of the senses into the mind to detach from material identification.

What is the meaning of this? All our senses are centered about the mind. It is the mind which directs the senses. You have heard this earlier. So if the mind is directing the senses, if the misconception around this body and based on the bodily actions of the senses, I try to derive happiness. I try to avoid suffering. I try to gather knowledge. I try to use my intelligence, etc, etc. So many things. Now, this has to be replaced with spiritual understanding of my spiritual self, spiritual intelligence, spiritual mind, spiritual senses, everything spiritual, which is inside. Not these material senses, material body, material mind, material intelligence. No, not this. This is a covering for the real mind, the spiritual mind, the spiritual senses, the spiritual intelligence, the spiritual self. It's a covering for all that. So to actually uncover, to remove the covering, to become free from the covering is possible, first of all, by concentrating all the actions of the senses and amalgamating means gathering them and mixing them with the mind, mixing them with the mind, so that these senses I no longer identify as my senses, these material senses.

**Key Quote:** "He turned his mind towards the transcendental service of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that detaching from material senses doesn't mean becoming senseless, but rather using spiritual senses and turning the mind towards transcendental service.

Then if I don't identify these material senses as my senses, then I become senseless? No! My spiritual senses are there, and I am using my spiritual senses through these material senses in my material condition. So stop using your spiritual senses through your material senses. That's what Yudhishthira is doing. So he doesn't want to anymore use his spiritual senses through his material senses. He doesn't want to use that. Similarly, so what does this mean in terms of devotional service? Prabhupada says, or in other words, he turned his mind towards the transcendental service of the Lord. He prayed that since all material activities are performed by the mind in terms of actions and reactions of the material senses, and since he was going back to Godhead, the mind would wind up its material activities and be turned towards the transcendental service of the Lord.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "when this material mind is turned towards transcendental service of the Lord, then the material mind will no longer be engaged in any material activities or material perceptions, material objects, nothing."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of gross and subtle bodies and how Yudhishthira is preparing to quit his body by spiritualizing his mind and cutting off attachments.

See, there is the gross body and the subtle body. The gross body consists of this gross senses of action and senses of perception, karmendya and jnanindya. The subtle body consists of the mind, material mind, material intelligence, and material ego. So, when this material mind is turned towards transcendental service of the Lord, then the material mind will no longer be engaged in any material activities or material perceptions, material objects, nothing, because now Yudhishthira has nothing to do with the material world. He is handed over charge. He is handed over charge to his grandson and to Vajra, Krishna's great-grandson, all the charge of ruling, and he is prepared to quit home after placing the fire of renunciation in his heart, deciding to become completely renounced, preparing for going back to Godhead. Why all this? Preparing for going back to Godhead, quitting this body. So before he quits the body, the attachments have to be cut off. All the links have to be cut off, which were established when he entered the body. So how they cut off the link? By spiritualizing this material mind, by engaging it in transcendental service.

**Key Quote:** "We're chanting Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, but you have to involve the mind in chanting Hare Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker connects Yudhishthira's process to daily practice, emphasizing the importance of mindfully chanting Hare Krishna to spiritualize the mind and engage in devotional service, concluding the session.

And that's exactly what we are doing every day. What are we doing? We're chanting Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, but you have to involve the mind in chanting Hare Krishna. Here, using the mind, mindfully chant, attentively hear, mindfully hear. So that way the mind turns towards the transcendental service of the Lord. The Harinama Japa, Harinama Kirtana, Hare, devotional service, Krishna Seva. That way the mind becomes spiritualized, and when the mind is spiritualized, there is no longer any need for me, a spirit soul, to utilize these material senses for any material activities. Even if I use the material senses, I'll use it only for devotional service. There was no longer any need for material activities, because he decided to stop all material activities. So I will stop here. We'll discuss this same verse more in the next session. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Then as pure self he became free from the material conception of life"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of Yudhishthira Maharaj's detachment and explains the meaning of a verse describing the process of withdrawing from material existence.

In this session, we will continue to discuss the four principles of the Bhagavad Gita. In the previous session, we had discussed the first half of the purport, and in this session, we will discuss the second half of the purport. Here is a little technical description of how Yudhishthira Maharaj actually cut off all the material attachments when he was preparing to actually go back home, back to Godhead, after relinquishing all his responsibilities by handing them over to his grandson and Krishna's great grandson. So, it was already explained, just to refresh your memory of that time, and we started to learn a little bit more about the verse itself: Vacham Juhava Manasee Tatprana Itareya Tam Mrityav Apanam Sotsargaam Tam Panchatve Hi Ajo Havit. The meaning of this verse is that then He amalgamated all the sense organs into the mind, the mind into life, life into breathing, and its total existence as an entire being, existence into the embodiment of the five elements, and his body into death.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the nature of material desires, the reason for our existence in the material world, and the incompatibility of the spirit soul with material existence.

Then, as pure self, he became free from the material conception of life. So, in the previous session, I had elaborately explained what is this material conception of life, and then to become free from this material conception is to give up all the wrong identifications with the material coverings for the real self, for this spirit soul. Our existence in this material world becomes possible because of all the material coverings that are possible, provided for the sake of material existence. Just like as spirit soul, we have spiritual senses, we have spiritual mind, we have spiritual intelligence, we have spiritual identity, we can perform spiritual activities. It is meant for living in the spiritual world now, but if we have to live in the material world, why have we got to live in the material world? Because we have material desires for enjoyment, and what are the nature of material desires for enjoyment? Independent enjoyment, separate from Krishna, or trying to lord over like Krishna the resources for our existence. So, all this is only possible in the material world: lording over, independent enjoyment, separate existence. All this is possible only in the material world, and spirit soul, material world is a foreign place, like a fish out of water. Can a fish survive outside of water? It's meant to live in the water.

**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain how Krishna fulfills our material desires by placing us in the material world and contrasts this with the bliss and freedom of the spiritual world.

Similarly, we are meant to live in the spiritual world as spirit soul, but if we want material enjoyment, if we... Krishna, just to fulfill our material desires, Krishna actually places us in the material world, and Krishna also arranges for all these material coverings which we use while living in the material world. Conversely, while drinking, you are not allowed to have material around you. You can... we too have the reasons why living in it by moving our behavior, it's in the way of your breathing. The tools we take, if you also smoked how to do it or that by moving your spirit, this body is a reality can produce it, can act out of it, can разбredit you can now see it's effecting on us because it's it's just me now. I am разделing my mind or understanding wrongly. Is it says that life is just that anybody are in environmental smoke, so we can no longer not delve into the physical self based in a safe selecting at all way but in a particular type of body. Now, if you want to go back to Godhead, now that you realized that I don't belong to this place, some way I didn't stay, but I really can't be happy, I really can't be fully satisfied and live there naturally with full freedom from all these material entanglements, freedom from all material entanglements. That is what awaits us in the spiritual world, full of bliss, full of knowledge, eternal life in loving relationship with Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Mind should wind up all material activities and be turned towards the transcendental service of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the difficulty of giving up material coverings, particularly the gross and subtle bodies, and emphasizes the need to redirect the mind towards transcendental service.

That is what is waiting for us, so you prepare yourself to go back to God and give up this material coverings. Now, giving up the material coverings is not as easy as trying to give up this covering that is a piece of cloth. I just remove this and just discard it. Now, the difficulty with this material covering called the gross body and the subtle body is that the gross gross body to some extent is easy to understand what is this gross body, but the difficulty is my thinking is without the gross body I am unable to work, I am unable to act, I am unable to live. Just like somebody unfortunately has got some problem because of which the hand is amputated, without the hand the person is handicapped, so much of difficulty in doing ordinary things. Similarly, not only the gross body, the gross senses, but also the subtle body, the mind, the material mind, the material intelligence. We can't think if we don't have the material mind. Why is that? Because my thinking is all material, my activities are material, I am dealing with material objects. Material objects I can hold with a material hand. I don't know how to use my spiritual hand to hold material objects. I do not know, neither it is it is practical or feasible. It is not meant. The spiritual hand is not meant to hold material objects. No, it's not required either for spiritual existence. It's meant for spiritual existence in association with Krishna. So, when you have to return to Krishna, then cut off all these attachments and free the soul from material entanglement. There's a whole process. So, how to give up all these material coverings, that's been described, and the previous session had already explained that mind should wind up all material activities and be turned towards the transcendental.

Then, actually, the activities of the mind cannot be stopped, for they are the reflection of the eternal soul. Actually, the material mind, we want to stop all material thinking, but that does not mean totally stop all activities of this mind. The present mind that we have. No. Because, it is the desire of the soul that is expressed through the mind. The activities of the soul are expressed through the material mind. So, therefore, Prabhupada says, the activities of the mind are reflection of the eternal soul. I am spirit. I am soul. I am eternal soul. So, the soul in the material world is reflected through the mind. Therefore, what has to be done is, the activities of the mind can be changed from matter to devotional service. So, there is a need to engage the mind differently. That's all. So, the material color of the mind is changed when one washes it from contaminations of life breathing, and thereby frees it from the contamination of repeated births and deaths.

**Key Quote:** "Begin with spiritual life. Let's say, just chant 108 times Hare Krishna every day."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how purifying the mind stops the cycle of birth and death and recommends starting with simple spiritual practices like chanting Hare Krishna to gradually increase spiritual engagement.

If you are having idea of a continuing material existence, then, when this body, the term of life, in this body is over, if I have to continue material existence, I have to get another material body. That's called repetition of birth and death. So, to purify this mind means to stop this repetition of birth and death. That means to end all activities of the mind, all plans for continuing material existence, or rather, change material existence to spiritual existence. Now, Srila Prabhupada says, one has to situate oneself in pure spiritual life. Therefore, we should practice. Therefore, we should practice. Begin with spiritual life. Let's say, just chant 108 times Hare Krishna every day. It just takes about 10 minutes. So, out of 24 hours in a day, 10 minutes at least, perform spiritual activity, whereby 10 minutes you are not engaging the mind in material activity. The mind becomes engaged in spiritual activity. So, this is a very important point. And gradually go on increasing the spiritual activity, thereby reducing the engagement of the mind in material activities. And by the time you retire from all your material responsibilities, you should have completely changed all your engagements of the mind from material to spiritual. It means go on increasing your spiritual activities

**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of Sadhana Bhakti, the 64 principles of devotional service, and emphasizes the importance of associating with dedicated devotees to learn how to manage material duties while minimizing material engagement of the mind, ultimately leading to liberation.

by which you engage the mind in spiritual life. Therefore, the program of Sadhana Bhakti is how to increase the activities that we perform through the body, words, and mind, more and more in devotional service. So, there are 64 principles of Sadhana Bhakti, different varieties of engagement in spiritual life. Why 64? Why so many? Because in different ways, we are engaging our body, words, and mind in material activities. So, if we have to spiritualize our engagement of the mind, we have to find different varieties of engagement for the mind through the body, through the words, and through the mind. So, therefore, there are 64 activities. And one by one by one, we should start adding those activities to our daily routine. Just like chanting Hare Krishna, then singing Hare Krishna, then offering food to Krishna, either a picture of Krishna or a deity of Krishna, accepting Prasadam after offering food, then reading the spiritual literature, Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavatam, hearing about Krishna's pastimes, like that. So many different engagements are possible and increase the engagements. Now, how do the engagements become more and more? When you associate with devotees who are already engaged in such spiritual activities, especially the devotees who are dedicated for Krishna Consciousness. Throughout the day, they are engaged in varieties of activities simply meant for engaging the mind in Krishna Consciousness. So, you also associate, you learn, you become interested, you become attracted. You also get some practical tips about how to manage your material duties, material responsibilities while minimizing the material engagement of the mind. You learn from the devotees. And in this way, the mind becomes purified. When the mind is purified, and that means the mind is constantly engaged in the service of the Lotus Feet of the Lord, then at the time of death, the mind will not produce another material body, but the mind will actually enable the soul to go back home, back to God. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Now, this is a highly technical description of how Yudhishthira Maharaj freed himself from all material attachments."
**Summary:** This segment introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam describing Yudhishthira Maharaj's detachment and sets the stage for understanding the process through Srila Prabhupada's explanation.

In this session we will be discussing from the 42nd verse of the 15th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Tritve Hutvacha Panchatvam Tachayi Katve Ajuhon Munihi Sarvam Atmani Aju Habid Brahmani Atmanam Avyaye. The meaning of this verse is, "Thus annihilating the gross body of five elements into the three qualitative modes of material nature, he merged them in one science, and then absorbed that science in the self, Brahman, which is inexhaustible in all circumstances." Now, this is a highly technical description of how Yudhishthira Maharaj freed himself from all material attachments. But Srila Prabhupada explains very nicely in the precepts.

**Key Quote:** "So the basic understanding is, I am not this body."
**Summary:** This segment explains the concept of Mahat-Tatva, the origin of material elements, and emphasizes the distinction between the living entity and the material body, mind, and ego.

How to understand this process that Yudhishthira Maharaj is applying. So in the precepts, Srila Prabhupada says, "All that is manifested in the material world is a product of the Mahat-Tatva Avyakta, and things that are visible in our material vision are nothing but combinations and permutations of such variegated material products." So the basic understanding is, I am not this body. And this body is one of the many different products of the material elements, which are generated at the beginning of the creation out of the material energy called Mahat-Tatva Avyakta. The material energy in its dormant condition, inactive state, is Avyakta. And when it is activated at the beginning of creation by the glance of Mahavishnu, it becomes Mahat-Tatva, the state in which the material energy becomes activated. Activated means the three gunas become, start working. And those three gunas, they interact with the Mahat-Tatva and produce so many material elements. And those material elements are combined to form this variegated material universe. Different products, different material elements, different objects, and different bodies, everything. So now, whatever we see in our material vision is nothing but the combination of different material objects or products. But the living entity is different from such material products. They are completely different from the body, from the mind, from the intelligence, from the false ego, from the material objects, varieties of material objects.

#### forgetfulness of eternal nature, false sense enjoyment, desire to be the Lord

**Key Quote:** "It is due to the living entity's forgetfulness of his eternal nature as eternal servitor of the Lord, and his false conception of being a so-called Lord, that he is obliged to enter into the existence of false sense enjoyment."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the root cause of material existence as forgetfulness of our eternal nature as servants of Krishna and the false desire to be the Lord of material nature.

We are completely different from all that. Further, Srila Prabhupada says, "It is due to the living entity's forgetfulness of his eternal nature as eternal servitor of the Lord, and his false conception of being a so-called Lord, the Lord of material nature, that he is obliged to enter into the existence of false sense enjoyment." The very fundamental statement Prabhupada is making here to help us understand why this material existence, why this false sense enjoyment. It is because of our forgetfulness of our eternal nature. I am eternal. I am an eternal spirit soul. And as eternal spirit soul, I am eternal servant of Krishna, or servitor of Krishna, or devotee of Krishna, eternally. And also, not only I forget my eternal position as eternal devotee of Krishna, but I also have got a wrong conception that I want to be the Lord of material nature. I want to be the Lord. There is only one Lord, that is Krishna. Material nature, spiritual nature, living entities, everyone, everything. Krishna is the only Lord. Ekala, Eeshwara, Krishna. Nobody else is Lord. All others are very, very, very tiny, insignificant living entities. So this tiny living entity simply foolishly desires, says, I want to be the Lord of material nature. Then you are forced to enter into the existence of false sense enjoyment.

#### material energies, mind affected, gross body, three modes of material nature

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Our actual mind is materially affected because of which there is a need for so many different material products to be generated to give us the facility for the mind to be materially affected."
**Summary:** This segment explains how the mind becomes materially affected, leading to the generation of the gross body and the need for material facilities, and how Yudhishthira Maharaj reversed this process.

Why false? Because it is a concoction for your sake. It is temporarily created and enabled. So, Prabhupada next says, "Thus, a concomitant generation of material energies is a principal cause of the minds being materially affected." Our actual mind is materially affected because of which there is a need for so many different material products to be generated to give us the facility for the mind to be materially affected. Thus, the gross body of five elements is produced. Birth means what? A gross body of five elements, combination of five elements, is produced in the mother's womb. Actually, there is no need of this gross body if we are not having any material engagement. For spiritual life, there is no need. But our present condition is material life. So for that, this is necessary. So Prabhupada explains, Maharaj Yudhishthira reversed the action and merged the five elements of the body in the three modes of material nature. The beginning of creation, the three modes of material nature combined, interacted, and produced the different bodies. Now, this body which is generated by the combination of the three gunas, interaction, it has to be reversed so that the body will go back to the three gunas. The qualitative distinction of the body as being good, bad, or mediocre is extinguished. When the body is dismantled, then there is no question of whether the body is good or bad or it is in between.

#### body as good, bad, or mediocre, detachment from material energy, spiritual sky

**Key Quote:** "When one is thus inclined to become an associate of the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, in one of the innumerable planets of the spiritual sky, especially in Goloka Vrindavana, one has to think always that he is different from the material energy."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the irrelevance of judging the body as good or bad and emphasizes the need to detach from material energy and focus on one's spiritual identity to become an associate of the Lord.

So, we know that the body sometimes when it is in a healthy condition, a very nice body. The same body when it becomes diseased and gives us pain or suffering, or I don't like this body. Or identifying the body with some possessions, I have so many different varieties of things to enjoy, a very nice body. But if I don't have many things that I desire to enjoy with, then this body is not a very nice body. Like that, we have our own conception of body being good, bad, or mediocre. But all these are irrelevant, these distinctions between different types of bodies, when the body itself, we think is unnecessary, un-artha, superfluous. It is unwanted, unwanted. Then when the body is unwanted, then the body becomes merged in the material energy. That means body means the elements, body is transformed into the elements. And the elements become, go to the reservoir of all the elements. When one is thus inclined to become an associate of the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, in one of the innumerable planets of the spiritual sky, especially in Goloka Vrindavana, one has to think always that he is different from the material energy. The whole thinking process has to completely change no more thinking in terms of material body, material enjoyment, material activities, material relationship, none of those. So one has to always think that I am different from the material energy, I am completely spiritual.

#### pure spirit, spiritual training, freedom from material relations, servant of the Lord

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So one has to always think that I am different from the material energy, I am completely spiritual."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes realizing oneself as pure spirit, equal in quality to the Supreme Lord, and how spiritual training helps achieve freedom from material relations and engagement, allowing one to act as a servant of the Lord.

He has nothing to do with the material energy and therefore he has to realize himself as pure spirit. Spirit is always pure but I think otherwise. So that thinking has to change, has to completely be completely absorbed in the thought of I am pure spirit. And as pure spirit I am qualitatively equal with the Supreme Brahman or the Parameshwara or the Supreme Lord, Krishna. Then by such thought process which is possible by training, by spiritual training, Prabhupada further explains Maharaja Yudhishthira after distributing his kingdom to Pariksit and Vajra, did not think himself the emperor of the world or head of the Kuru dynasty. See when he gave away charge, he is no longer thinking I am the emperor or I have got to do anything with ruling the kingdom. Because training, handing charge, everything is over. Pariksit is fully ready to take over. And he is taken over also when Yudhishthira Maharaj is handed over. Now Yudhishthira Maharaj is not going to worry or be concerned how he is going to rule, what if he makes a mistake, what if he wants advice, nothing. Because his job is over, his business is over, he is only thinking of going back to Godhead. This sense of freedom from material relations as well as freedom from the material engagement of the gross and subtle encirclement makes one free to act as a servant of the Lord even though one is in the material world.

#### freedom before death, devotional service, liberated stage, Jeevan Mukta

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So this is complete freedom to act as servant of Krishna, devotee of Krishna and for that the spiritual senses, the spiritual mind, the spiritual intelligence is very much required and is there as the devotee, as a pure devotee."
**Summary:** This segment explains that freedom from material entanglement can be achieved even before death by handing over responsibilities and engaging in devotional service, leading to a liberated stage known as Jeevan Mukta.

Now it is not that exactly when death comes and obviously I have to leave this body, only then I become free from this body. No, even before death comes. If I hand over charge of all my material duties and responsibilities to someone else, a younger person, then by engaging completely in devotional service, I get a freedom from all material relationships. All material relationships I get freedom, no more material relationships. Then freedom from the entanglement or imprisonment in the material gross body of the five elements. The body is there but I have no need for this body, neither I am concerned with any activities of this body, nor the activities of the material mind or the material intelligence, not required. Though they are there, before death they are there, but I don't require to use them, I don't require to engage them, no. So this is complete freedom to act as servant of Krishna, devotee of Krishna and for that the spiritual senses, the spiritual mind, the spiritual intelligence is very much required and is there as the devotee, as a pure devotee. It is there. So this is called liberated stage, even in the material world, Jeevan Mukta. And Yudhishthira Maharaj actually attained that. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces and translates Srimad Bhagavatam 1.15.43, describing Yudhishthira's renunciation of material life.

In this session, we are discussing two verses, the 43rd and the 44th verses of the 15th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. So, to begin with, the 43rd verse: Chiravasa Niraharo Baddhavan Mukta Murdha Jaha Darsayan Atmano Rupam Jadonmatta Pishachavat Anavekshamano Niragad Ashranvan Badhiro Yatha. The meaning of this verse is, after that, Maharaj Yudhishthira dressed himself in torn clothing, gave up eating all solid foods, voluntarily became dumb, and let his hair hang loose. All this combined to make him look like an urchin or madman with no occupation. He did not depend on his brothers for anything, and just like a deaf man, he heard nothing.

**Key Quote:** "Freedom from material entanglement, material engagement, material activities. Completely stop all that."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the meaning of the verse, emphasizing the importance of detaching from material activities and engaging in devotional service, explaining Yudhishthira's actions as a way to avoid material distractions.

So, these are all the verses. These are all different steps towards totally becoming materially free. Freedom from material entanglement, material engagement, material activities. Completely stop all that. And do what? Fully engage only in devotional service. We don't require any of these material activities. We don't require any of these facilities or material senses or material anything. Don't require. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains – Thus being freed from all external affairs, Yudhishthira Maharaj had nothing to do with imperial life or family prestige. And for all practical purposes, he posed himself exactly like an inert mad urchin and did not speak of material affairs. Basically, now he doesn't want to be bothered by anybody for anything material. He himself has cut off from all material engagements, but he doesn't want other people, as long as he's living in the body before he quits the body, doesn't want other people to come and bother him with some material things. So, so let others will not bother him, he was dressed in torn clothing, and he posed as if he is a mad person, some street vagabond simply roaming aimlessly, there's nothing to do, so who will even approach him or think of talking to him or asking him or associating? Nobody will bother.

**Key Quote:** "as long as there is any material relationship or material connection always there is the factor of fear"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the concept of fear in the material world and how spiritualization leads to freedom from fear, highlighting the incompatibility of the spirit soul with the material atmosphere.

They'll rather keep distance, oh, some mad man, better I stay away from him. He had no dependence on his brothers who had all along been helping him. See, when Yudhishthir Maharaj is ruling, he was in family life, so his brothers were assisting him, his brothers were strategizing with him, discussing with him, but all that completely stopped. No more any dependence on brothers or any connection with brothers, nothing. This stage of complete independence from everything is also called a purified stage of fearlessness, purified stage of fearlessness. As long as there is any material relationship or material connection, always there is the factor of fear. Fear in this material world is only due to the material existence. It's called the, it is the second kind of atmosphere in which the pure spirit soul is placed, for an atmosphere incompatible. Spirit soul is meant to live in the spiritual world, spiritual energy in spiritual atmosphere, but the spirit soul is placed in material energy, material atmosphere, material world, it's incompatible, so immediately what happens? Fear. So the purified stage where one is completely spiritualized is freedom from all fear, no material existence, that is complete freedom from all fear.

**Key Quote:** "towards the north, treading the path accepted by his forefathers and great men, to devote himself completely to the thought of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces and translates Srimad Bhagavatam 1.15.44, explaining Yudhishthira's journey north and his devotion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, addressing potential questions about his seemingly strange behavior.

44th verse, 44th verse, 44th verse translation is as follows: the 44th verse, você empezou go para, towards the north, treading the path accepted by his forefathers and great men, to devote himself completely to the thought of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And he lived in that way wherever he went. So in the Purport, Shrila Prabhupada says, it is understood from this verse that Maharaja Yudhishthira followed in the footsteps of his forefathers and the great devotees of the Lord. We have discussed many times before that the system of Varnashrama Dharma, as it was strictly followed by the inhabitants of the world, specifically by those who inhabited the Aryavarta province of the world, emphasizes the importance of leaving all household connections at a certain stage of life. Aryavarta means the tract of land which is now called India, between the Himalayas and the Indian Ocean. This tract of land, India, what we now call India. So this is Aryavarta. And people who inhabit, live in this place, their culture was in the past to leave all household connections at a certain stage of life to completely free oneself from material entanglement, prepare oneself for going back to Godhead. The training and education was so important, and thus a respectable person like Maharaja Yudhishthira had to leave all family connection for self-realization and going back to Godhead. Now somebody may wonder, Yudhishthira was such a respectable person as the emperor of the world, he is dressing in tone clothing and he is acting as a madman. So what's gone wrong with this person? Why is he doing this? Why is he doing that? If somebody recognizes him, oh, he is the same person who was the emperor, now he is like a mad urchin. What has happened to him? Something has gone wrong with his mind, he has become deranged, mentally deranged. No, it is necessary for becoming free from all material entanglement.

**Key Quote:** "No king or respectable gentleman would continue family life till the end."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Vedic culture and the importance of detaching from family life for self-realization, mentioning the stages of spiritual development: Brahmacharya, Grahastha, Vanaprastha, and Sannyas.

For self-realization, for going back to Godhead, this is a necessary step. So Srila Prabhupada further explains the culture, the Vedic culture. No king or respectable gentleman would continue family life till the end. Till the end means till death comes. No respectable person will continue to live in the family atmosphere. It cannot be possible, who knows, he would keep at that side, might abandon carbohydrates to the end, very simply because of somebody's jumpscare. Take theala pie. We sing Geeta M standalone. Estabs the whole body to late a time, if we listen to some kind of music for the duration of life, after that even the lived persons watch the body to death at 9 pm, and right away the body of the physical body is rock solid just like that of Mr. Narayan Rami, Opportunity valuable opportunity in the uniform of life to free himself from material entanglement. So therefore it's considered suicide. In order to be free from all family encumbrances and devote oneself sent person to the devotional service of Lord Krishna. This system is always recommended for everyone because it's the path of authority. See, it is different stages of spiritual development: Brahmacharya, Grahastha, Vanaprastha, Sannyas. Now Brahmacharya is a student life, and Grahastha is the householder life. After this householder life, before death comes, Vanaprastha, freeing oneself from all material restlessness, responsibilities, and duties, and going away from family comforts, separating oneself from all family comforts and family life, so that one can completely devote oneself fully for devotional service of the Supreme Lord.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "That one must become a devotee of the Lord at least at the last stage of one's life"
**Summary:** The speaker quotes the Bhagavad Gita, emphasizing the importance of devotion to the Lord, especially in the last stage of life, and explains that 'Brahmaparam' refers to Lord Krishna.

Complete engagement. Now Prabhupada quotes the Bhagavad Gita. The Lord instructs in the Bhagavad Gita in the 18th chapter, 62nd verse, that one must become a devotee of the Lord at least at the last stage of one's life. A sincere soul of the Lord like Maharaj Yudhishthira must abide by this instruction of the Lord for his own interest. Now earlier it was described, Yudhishthira Maharaj also turned towards the Lord, the instructions of the Bhagavad Gita, which Krishna instructed not only Arjuna but the whole world. So Yudhishthira Maharaj also turned towards the Bhagavad Gita instructions of the Supreme Lord, in which it is said that at least the last stage of one's life, one must become a devotee of the Lord. Of course, Yudhishthira Maharaj was a devotee all through, but to set an example, he is teaching how one must renounce all material attachments and become devoted to devotional service of Krishna. The specific words Brahmaparam indicate Lord Sri Krishna. In this verse, Hrithi Brahmaparam Dhyayan, he is meditating completely or thinking completely of Brahmaparam Dhyayan. What does Brahmaparam mean? Prabhupada says it specifically means Lord Krishna. Now this is corroborated in the Bhagavad Gita 10.13, when Arjuna with reference to great authorities like Asita, Devala, Narada, and Vyasa says Krishna is Parabrahman or Brahmaparam. What does Arjuna say in the Bhagavad Gita? Param Brahma Paramdhama Pavitra Paramam Bhavan. Krishna, you are the Parambrahma. You are the Brahmaparam.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna you are the Parambrahma You are the Brahmaparam"
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain how Arjuna identifies Krishna as Parabrahman, supported by other great authorities, and concludes by reiterating Yudhishthira's devotion and journey towards the north.

And Arjuna is telling, it is not just that I am declaring, because somebody may think Arjuna is Krishna's friend, so he will glorify Krishna, he will flatter Krishna, he will eulogize Krishna. No, Arjuna says, Ahustvam Rishya Sarve Devarishi Narada Sthatha Asito Devalo Vyasa Swayam Chaivam Bravishime. Arjuna is telling, not only I am declaring that you are Parabrahman, it is also so described by Devarishi Narada. He is one of the greatest authorities in the ancient times, in the Vedic times. He declares Krishna is the Supreme Brahman. And Asita, Devala, Vyasa, all the great sages who are Vedic authorities, they all declare Krishna to be the Supreme Brahman. Thus Maharaj Yudhishthira, while leaving home for the north, constantly remembered Lord Sri Krishna within himself, following in the footsteps of his forefathers as well as the great devotees of old times. So he absorbed his mind completely in thinking only of Krishna. And that is what Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, Man Mana. Yudhishthira Maharaj cut off all material connections and began to think of Krishna and proceeded towards north in what we say as Mahaprastha. This will be further described in the next verse. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "There is no training for understanding that we are spirit souls, we belong to the spiritual world, we have to prepare for stopping the cycle of birth and death, we should prepare for going to the spiritual world."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's purport, contrasting the traditional Vedic education system (gurukul) that emphasized both material and spiritual knowledge with modern education, which primarily focuses on material well-being.

So after having described that, Yudhishthira Maharaj retired from household life, the younger brothers also followed the elder brother, they also retired from their respective household lives. So in the purport Shri Lapa Prabhupada says, "The younger brothers of Maharaj Yudhishthira were already obedient followers of the great emperor, and they had sufficiently been trained to know the ultimate goal of life." So in the former times, the brahmanas, the kshatriyas and the vaisyas, the upper three sections of the society, they received systematic training in a gurukul from the teacher. The teacher would teach about spiritual and material knowledge. Material knowledge was meant for their livelihood, and spiritual knowledge was meant for their ultimate goal of life. So this ultimate goal of life is very important. Even nowadays there is training, there is education, but only in terms of how to keep this body fit for living in this world. There is no training for understanding that we are spirit souls, we belong to the spiritual world, we have to prepare for stopping the cycle of birth and death, we should prepare for going to the spiritual world.

**Key Quote:** "Srila Prabhupada many times says that in India, in the Vedic culture, even the most illiterate person in a remote part of any village will know that I am not this body, I am spirit soul."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how even the lower classes in Vedic society were aware of the ultimate goal of life, contrasting this with the ignorance of modern educated individuals regarding the nature of the self.

But formerly, all of them used to be trained in this. So not only the brahmanas, kshatriyas and vaisyas, even the shudras, though there was no training in a gurukul, in their homes, they would be following the elders and the general population was guided by the brahmanas as to what are their duties, material duties, spiritual duties. Everyone had to perform their material and spiritual duties as guided by the brahmanas, who were strictly following the directions of the shastras given by the Supreme Lord Krishna for the whole civilized human society. So everyone knew the ultimate goal of life. Srila Prabhupada many times says that in India, in the Vedic culture, even the most illiterate person in a remote part of any village will know that I am not this body, I am spirit soul. Will know that I am eternal. Will know that my goal is to get out of the cycle of birth and death. Will know that he has to actually perform his material and spiritual duties in order to get out of the entanglement of material existence. Everybody knows, everyone. And today there are so many so-called educated philosophers, scholars, scientists, but they do not know I am not the body, I am spirit soul. They do not know that. They do not know about material entanglement.

**Key Quote:** "So what is the spiritual duty of everyone? Simply to render devotional service to Lord Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the spiritual duty is to render devotional service to Krishna, simplified in this age by chanting Hare Krishna, and discusses the Vedic injunction to retire from family life for self-realization.

So here it is clearly said the younger brothers of Maharaja Yudhishthira were already obedient followers of the great emperor and had sufficiently been trained to know the ultimate goal of life. Therefore they decidedly followed their eldest brother in rendering devotional service to Lord Krishna. So what is the spiritual duty of everyone? Simply to render devotional service to Lord Krishna. That's all. It's very simple. And it has been further simplified in this age by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu that to render devotional service to Lord Krishna means to simply chant Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. This can be done by anybody. It doesn't require any qualification. It is not difficult. It is very very easy. So Sri La Pravapada further says according to the principles of Sanatana Dharma one must retire from family life after half the duration of life is finished. Panchashodram vanam vrajayet. This is the Vedic injunction and must engage himself in self-realization. You see. Engage oneself in self-realization in spiritual activities. But the question of engaging oneself is not always decided. What will they do after becoming retired? So Sri La Pravapada says sometimes retired men are bewildered about how to engage themselves for the last days of life. They don't know what to do. They sometimes think it is very boring to sit and chant all the time or to sit and read some scriptures or do some Deity worship. Oh it's very boring.

Sri La Pravapada says, "Here is a decision by authorities like the Pandavas.

They had trained, they had been trained and they were engaged before retiring, they were engaged in devotional service. So they continued their devotional service with greater emphasis because they are freed from material responsibilities. So further Sri La Pravapada says, "According to Swami Shridhara he is the original commentator on the Srimad Bhagavatam Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha or fruitive activities philosophical speculations and salvation as conceived by several persons are not the ultimate goal of life." See this is something we have to carefully understand. Why is it being said that Moksha even Moksha is not the ultimate goal of life. Why? Because Sri La Pravapada says they are more or less practiced by persons who have no information

And the Pandavas were intelligent enough to follow it without hesitation. Krishna is the ultimate goal of life. Maamey vaisyasi Maa manusmara Madhyaji Maam namaskuru Bhavamad bhakto Matkarmakrth Matparamo. See all the Bhagavad Gita statements clearly indicate Krishna to be the ultimate goal. Krishna to be the ultimate goal. Krishna to be the ultimate goal. Krishna.

The 46th verse te sadhukrtha sarvartha nyatavya atyantikam atmanah manasa dharayam asuhu vaikuntha charanam bujam. The translation of this 46th verse, "They all had performed all the principles of religion and as a result rightly decided that the lotus feet of the Lord Sri Krishna are the supreme goal of all. Therefore they meditated upon his feet without interruption." You see the ultimate goal of life is clearly indicated here.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Arjuna's hesitation to kill his kinsmen as a sign of being a pure devotee, naturally kind and soft-hearted, and averse to sinful activities.

This is very evident that Arjuna was hesitating to kill his kinsmen even though they were so unjust. They were so corrupt. They troubled the Pandavas in so many ways, the Kauravas. But Arjuna hesitated to kill them because Arjuna is the pure devotee. Pure devotees never do any sinful activity. If there is even the slightest doubt whether they are acting sinfully or not, they refrain if they even have the slightest doubt that they may be indulging in sin. So Arjuna, even though he knew that this was a fair battle for a just cause, still, when it came to actually killing his own kinsmen, he hesitated. And he told Krishna, I cannot kill my kinsmen. So Srila Prabhupada says, that is because he is a pure devotee of the Lord. He is kind and soft-hearted. A pure devotee of the Lord is naturally endowed with all good qualities.

**Key Quote:** "This is very significant that the Pandavas went back to Godhead in the self-same body."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces verses 47 and 48 of the 15th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining that pure devotees like the Pandavas can attain the spiritual sky and even return to Godhead in their same bodies due to their constant devotional remembrance of Krishna.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet In this session we will be discussing from two verses, 47 and 48, of the 15th chapter of the first canto, Srimad Bhagavatam. Tadhyana Udriktaya Bhaktiya Vishuddha Dhisana Pare Tasmin Narayana Pade Ekanta Matayogatim Avapur Duravapamte Asadbhir Vishayatmabhihi Vidhutakalmashasthanam Virajena Atmanayivahee The meaning of these two verses is given together: Thus, by pure consciousness, due to constant devotional remembrance, they attain the spiritual sky, which is ruled over by the spiritual sky, and by the supreme Narayana, Lord Krishna. This is attained only by those who meditate upon the one supreme Lord without deviation. This abode of the Lord Sri Krishna, known as Goloka Vrindavana, cannot be attained by persons who are absorbed in the material conception of life. One of us, being completely washed of all material contamination, attained that abode, in their very same bodies. This is very significant that the Pandavas went back to Godhead in the self-same body. Generally, at the end of life, we quit this body. We leave behind this material body. Even those who go back to Godhead, generally, leave the material body behind. But the Pandavas, in the self-same body, they went back to Godhead, because they were purified of all material contamination by constant devotional remembrance of Krishna. This is the situation of the pure devotees: constantly thinking of Krishna, constantly engaged in Krishna's service, pure devotional service, no tinge of any material sense gratification in any of their activities. Such devotees' bodies are all spiritual. They are not material.

**Key Quote:** "Srila Jiva Goswami says, a person freed from the three modes of material qualities, goodness, passion and ignorance, and situated in transcendence, can reach the highest perfection of life without change of body."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Jiva Goswami and Sanatana Goswami, explaining that freedom from the three modes of material nature and engaging in pure devotional service under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master allows one to attain perfection and even the status of a twice-born brahmana.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains this point in the purport. According to Srila Jiva Goswami, a person freed from the three modes of material qualities, namely goodness, passion, and ignorance, and situated in transcendence, can reach the highest perfection of life without change of body. This is the explanation of one of the previous Acharyas, Srila Jiva Goswami. He is one of the six Goswamis of Vrindavan, the direct disciples of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Srila Jiva Goswami says, a person freed from the three modes of material qualities, goodness, passion, and ignorance, and situated in transcendence, can reach the highest perfection of life without change of body. So generally we are engaged in one of the three gunas, because we are influenced by the gunas, the material modes. So our actions are either sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic, or a combination of one or more of these qualities. So we have material activities and material reactions, which bind us to this world. Now those who are freed from these three qualities, because they are constantly engaged in the pure devotional service, Krishna explains this in the Bhagavad Gita, as Srila Prabhupada will quote later, this very verse, that one who is engaged in pure devotional service, without deviation, such a person is completely free from the influence of all the three gunas. All actions of such a person are completely transcendental. And further, Srila Prabhupada quotes Sanatana Goswami. What does he say? Srila Sanatana Goswami in his Haribhakti Vilas says, that a person, whatever he may be, can attain the perfection of a twice-born brahmana by undergoing the spiritual disciplinary actions under the guidance

of a bona fide spiritual master. yatha kanchanatam yati kamsyam rasa-vidhanatah tatha deeksha-vidhanena vijatvam jayate nirunam rasa-vidhana and deeksha-vidhana This is a comparison made by Srila Sanatana Goswami, that just like the bell-metal can be turned into gold by chemical manipulation, by treating it with an alchemical process using mercury, rasa-vidhana. Similarly, any person from any material background, how much ever contaminated he may be, if he undergoes the spiritual disciplinary actions under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, he can attain the perfection of a twice-born brahmana. vijatvam jayate nirunam So, that process is described as sadhana bhakti. sadhana bhakti. And, it is given in the scriptures, anyone who adopts the process of sadhana bhakti under proper guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. One cannot independently do anything in spiritual life, no. You require the proper guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. And under such expert guidance, strictly following the rules and regulations and the process, one becomes purified. And that purification results in one becoming a perfect twice-born brahmana. Perfection of a brahmana is to become a devotee. So one becomes a devotee. So Srila Prabhupada says, it is therefore the actual guidance that matters in the process of becoming a brahmana, even without change of body, or in going back to Godhead without change of body. It is the actual guidance of an expert and engaging properly

in the activities of sadhana bhakti. Now, Srila Jeeva Goswami says here that the use of the word he in this connection positively affirms this truth. What is the word? In the verse, virajena atmana eva he This word he, ending word of the 48th verse, that affirms positively this truth that there is no need to change body if one has to go back to Godhead after having executed pure devotional service. So this fact is affirmed here. And the Bhagavad Gita confirms this that anyone who systematically executes pure devotional service without deviation can attain this perfection of Brahman. Brahman perfection needs to be situated on the spiritual platform above the three gunas. And on the Brahman platform then one engages in pure devotional service. Pure devotional service is only possible on the Brahman platform, on the spiritual platform. Then one becomes completely perfect. Becomes completely perfect. And such a person actually is eligible to directly go to the spiritual world and that also the supreme planet, Koloka Vrindavana,

**Key Quote:** "Even if we practice constant chanting of Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, then we don't have to change our body."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by explaining that Lord Krishna always remains in his transcendental form and that pure devotees, through constant engagement in devotional service, especially chanting the Hare Krishna mantra, can spiritualize their bodies and potentially avoid changing them at the time of death.

without change of body. Now this has already been explained by Srila Prabhupada in an earlier verse where it was said Lord Krishna returned to his own abode without a change of body, because Lord's body is completely transcendental. Even when he comes to this world he comes in his original spiritual form. Ajopisan avyayatma. Avyayatma means Krishna never changes his body. His body never deteriorates. His body is always spiritual. Material bodies are deteriorating. They change. And we have to quit this body at the time of death or at the end of this life or when we are when we are transferred to another body. We have to quit this body. But Krishna never accepts any material body. He never comes in touch with matter. He is always situated in his eternal spiritual form, spiritual body, which may be of different forms according to the need, but all of them are the same spirit, same supreme Lord without any change. The same supreme Lord. So when Lord Krishna returns to his abode he returns in his personal form, the same supreme spiritual form. There is no change of body. Similarly, pure devotees simply because they are engaged in pure devotional service always, constantly, 24 hours a day, they don't change their body because their body is a spiritual one, spiritualized by pure devotional service, spiritualized by pure devotional service. So, even if we practice constant chanting of Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, then we don't have to change our body. Our body becomes spiritualized by constantly engaging in chanting and hearing the holy name. Just like iron in contact with fire becomes red hot and fire-like. Similarly, of course this is a crude example, but in the case of our own material body, that we have now, it also becomes spiritualized by our engagement in devotional service, pure devotional service. So I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

Earlier we had heard how Vidura instructed Dhritarashtra to prepare himself for quitting the body and attaining self-realization. So now Vidura himself, he was constantly absorbed in thought of Krishna. Therefore, when he left his body, he went back to his original post in Pitraloka. So Srila Prabhupada explains this point in the purport. The difference between the Pandavas and Vidura is that the Pandavas are eternal associates of the Lord, the Personality of Godhead.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Yama-Raj's role as a pure devotee who punishes the sinful but is a friend to devotees.

Vidura is an incarnation of Yama-Raj. Yama-Raj is always a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord. Even in his Pitraloka planet, he is always in the position of being a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord. So his devotion and service is eternal. He also has got a responsibility of punishing the sinful people, extremely sinful people in the post of Yama-Raj. So he is not like the other devatas who have got a desire for material enjoyment and therefore they occupy a post. No. Yama-Raj is not like that. Vidura is not like that. So Srila Prabhupada says about Vidura as Yama-Raj, Men are afraid of Yama-Raj because it is he only who awards punishment to the miscreants of the material world. Those who are very very sinful, they are punished by Yama-Raj by being sent to hellish planets for punishment. Hellish planets are not places of inhabitation for any kind. They are not places of inhabitation for any condition. So it is exclusively meant for giving punishment to extremely sinful persons. So these miscreants, sinful people, they are afraid of Yama-Raj. But those who are devotees of the Lord have nothing to fear from him because he himself is a devotee. Yama-Raj is devotee, pure devotee. So other devotees, pure devotees of the Lord have nothing to fear from Yama-Raj.

**Summary:** The speaker recounts the story of how Yama-Raj was cursed by Manduka Muni to be born as Vidura, the son of a maidservant.

To the devotees, Yama-Raj is a cordial friend. But to the non-devotees, he is fear personified. He is doing his duty of punishing the non-devotees who are engaged in grievous sinful activities. As we have already discussed, it is understood that Yama-Raj was cursed by Manduka Muni to be degraded as a Shudra. Once Yama-Raj made a mistake in the past that this Manduka Muni who did some mistake when he was a small boy, he was punished later on for the mistake innocently committed. So Manduka Muni became angry and he cursed Yama-Raj to take birth as the son of a Shudrani, a maidservant, Dasiputra. So that curse, because the curse, even though he is a pure devotee, he accepted the curse and therefore he had to take birth as Vidura. But as the son of a maidservant.

So he was, Yama-Raj was born as Vidura, considered as a Shudra. Therefore Vidura was an incarnation of Yama-Raj. Because he is cursed to take birth as a Shudra. As an eternal servitor of the Lord, he displayed his devotional activities very ardently and lived a life of a pious man. Devotees always live a pious life. They don't commit sinful activities. This is the wonderful nature or characteristic of a devotee. Even in this material world. Even if they are harassed. Even if they are insulted. Even if they are cheated. Even if the others try to mislead them. They are fixed in devotional service. They don't get misled. On the other hand, it is described here, such pure devotees as Vidura, about them Prabhupada is telling, that Vidura lived a life of a pious man so much so that a materialistic man like Dhritarashtra also got salvation by his instruction. Dhritarashtra was very materialistic. But even Dhritarashtra got salvation or moksha by the instructions of Vidura.

So remembering constantly the lotus feet of the Lord is a devotional service. And that is possible by constant engagement in devotional activities. This remembrance is not some idle meditation or lazily sitting in the excuse of doing meditation and actually sleeping. No, it's not that.

What is the difference between Pandavas and Vidura? Pandavas are in constant touch with the Supreme Lord as his direct associates. The demigods like Yamaraj they are also associates of the Lord but they don't have that personal touch.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord and his personal associates incarnate in many universes without cessation...the Lord remembers all of his previous incarnations whereas the associates forget due to their being very minute parts and parcels of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Lord remembers all his incarnations, while his associates do not, due to their minute nature, using the example of Krishna and Arjuna.

They participate in the Lord's pastimes when they are given an opportunity because Lord's pastimes are an internal potency. So unless they are given an opportunity they have to engage in such devotional activities as constantly remembering the Lord constantly hearing the glories of the Lord from the Bhagavatam constantly chanting and hearing the Holy Name there is constant association constant engagement in devotional service. So Srila Prabhupada says further the Lord and his personal associates incarnate in many universes without cessation. Without cessation no stopping. No stoppage. They continuously incarnate in many many universes. Now the difference is between the Lord and his associates is the Lord remembers all of his previous incarnations whereas the associates forget due to their being very minute parts and parcels of the Lord. We are very very tiny parts and parcels of the Lord. Just like Arjuna Krishna tells Arjuna many many births you and I have taken in the past. You and I have taken many many births in the past. Now the Lord remembers all his previous incarnations. I remember all of them but you do not. So Prabhupada explains Arjuna is a pure devotee. Arjuna is a constant companion of the Lord. But he cannot remember his past appearances with the Lord. He can't remember. That Lord only knows. Lord only can remember. Because the Lord is supreme Lord unlimited Lord. He has unlimited memory. We are very very tiny part so we have limited memory. Therefore this difference always exists. I will stop here.

**Key Quote:** "Arjuna said O King, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Hari, who treated me exactly like an intimate friend, has left me alone."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam 1.15.5, focusing on Arjuna's feeling of separation from Krishna and the loss of his divine power after Krishna's departure.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Jai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudhirayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 5th verse of the 15th chapter of the 1st Canticle. The meaning of this verse is, Arjuna said, O King, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Hari, who treated me exactly like an intimate friend, has left me alone. Thus my astounding power, which astonished even the demigods, is no longer with me. So immediately Arjuna's response is that the Supreme Lord has returned to his abode and Arjuna is feeling separation from that dear most Lord Krishna. And the immediate response of Arjuna is that Arjuna's astounding power, which he displayed in the presence of Krishna, is no longer with Arjuna. And that power was astounding even to the greatest of demigods in the heavenly planets.

**Key Quote:** "Anyone specifically powerful and opulent in wealth, strength, beauty, knowledge, and all that is materially desirable, is to be considered but a product of an insignificant portion of the complete whole of my energy"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces Srila Prabhupada's explanation of Arjuna's statement, referencing Bhagavad Gita 10.41, which describes Krishna as the source of all opulence and power.

And that power is no longer with Arjuna. So, Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport very nicely. What is the significance of this statement by Arjuna? Srila Prabhupada explains on the basis of what is said in the Bhagavad Gita by Lord Krishna. Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, In the Bhagavad Gita, in the 10th chapter, the 10th chapter of Bhagavad Gita is entitled The Opulence of the Absolute. What is the meaning of that? The opulences of Krishna, which are displayed by him in the material world. So those opulences are described in the 10th chapter, specifically on the request of Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita. So, one such verse, 41st verse, in the 10th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna says, Anyone specifically powerful and opulent in wealth, strength, beauty, knowledge, and all that is materially desirable, is to be considered but a product of an insignificant portion of the complete whole of my energy. Everything, this Krishna statement in the Bhagavad Gita, the 41st verse and 10th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita.

**Key Quote:** "all wealth all strength all knowledge all beauty is actually Krishna's own energy in different forms in different varieties"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept that all forms of wealth, strength, beauty, and knowledge are manifestations of Krishna's energy, emphasizing the dependence of everything on Krishna.

So, what does it mean? Anybody may have some wealth, or they may have extraordinary beauty, or strength, or knowledge, or any possession, anything glorious, anything magnificent, wonderful, anything astounding, but that is only Krishna's own energy, which is a tiny fragment of that energy being displayed. So this is to be understood, all wealth, all strength, all knowledge, all beauty is actually Krishna's own energy in different forms, in different varieties, Krishna's own beauty. Each one of us, if we have some beauty, it is a tiny portion of Krishna's total beauty. Even for a matter, this material body that we have, which is made up of the five elements, earth, water, fire, air, and sky, this material body is also a tiny portion of the earth, water, fire, air, and sky, which is Krishna's material energy. From that a small portion is taken, combined, and this body is formed. So the body is also part of Krishna's material energy. I, a spirit soul, I am also part of Krishna's marginal energy. So everything is Krishna's own energy, everyone is.

**Key Quote:** "no one therefore can be independently powerful in any measure without being endowed by the Lord"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotees are empowered by Krishna to participate in His mission, receiving the necessary wealth, strength, and knowledge.

Krishna's own energy. This is very carefully understood. So therefore, Srila Prabhupada says, no one therefore can be independently powerful in any measure without being endowed by the Lord. So if I have any wealth, it is bestowed upon me by Krishna. Now, if somebody else has more wealth or less wealth than me, even they are having that greater wealth or lesser wealth bestowed by Krishna only. Now this is irrespective of somebody's being a devotee or a non-devotee. Independent of that, everyone's wealth actually is a portion of Krishna's own wealth. Everyone's strength, everyone's beauty, everyone's knowledge. It is a portion of Krishna's knowledge. Now further, Srila Prabhupada explains, when the Lord descends on the earth along with his eternal, ever-liberated associates, he not only displays the divine energy possessed by himself, but also empowers his associate devotees with the required energy to execute his mission of incarnation. Lord Krishna comes. Lord Krishna comes to this world as incarnation. He comes with his associates, eternal associates from the spiritual world. Now he comes with his energies, with his power, with his wealth, with his beauty. His devotees also, they come here and they are bestowed with required wealth, strength, beauty, knowledge, etc. by the Lord in order for them to participate in Krishna's mission in this material world. So, they are endowed with the required, necessary wealth, strength, etc. And Krishna comes, of course, with his totality of his wealth, strength, knowledge, beauty, etc.

#### incarnation, memory, Krishna's associates

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "both you and I have come to this earth many many times in the past I remember all those previous appearances but you have forgotten them"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the concept of Krishna's incarnations and the role of His eternal associates like Arjuna, highlighting Krishna's perfect memory and the limited memory of the jivas.

Now, in the same Bhagavad Gita, in the fourth chapter, fifth verse, it is stated, The Lord and his eternal associates descend on the earth many times, but the Lord remembers all the different roles of incarnations whereas the associates by his supreme will forget them. Now in the fourth chapter, Krishna explains to Arjuna, both you and I have come to this earth many many times in the past. I remember all those previous appearances, but you have forgotten them. So it is a fact that the eternal associates of Krishna like Arjuna, whenever Krishna incarnates, Arjuna also incarnates with Krishna, but Arjuna cannot remember. In his present life, he cannot remember his past lives, but Krishna remembers everything, all his past appearances, everything. Krishna's incarnation and even Krishna remembers with whom he has appeared in which incarnation, that also remembers because Krishna's memory is unlimited, our memory is limited. Krishna's knowledge is unlimited, our knowledge is limited, like that. So Krishna remembers everything, we don't remember everything. That difference eternally exists between us.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is always the Supreme Lord as much as all of us are subуется to ob Arms and we are always limited"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the eternal difference between Krishna as the unlimited Supreme Lord and all living beings as limited, and explains that Krishna withdraws powers when they are no longer needed for His mission.

Each one of us, all the jivas, they are always limited and so it is for that release and the life of us on Earth and the Supreme Lord. So Krishna is always the Supreme Lord as much as all of us are subjected to his arms and we are always limited or finite and we can't for even be in material terms. This difference in the unmanageable, unlimited jiva exist in this this height completely Wayne. Even in the case of pure devotees, even in the case of liberated souls, and definitely so in the case of conditioned souls or beings, living beings who are entangled in this material world. In all cases, all circumstances, all situations, all positions, every jiva, liberated jivas, all souls, all living beings, they are always limited and Krishna is always unlimited. Now further, Srila Prabhupada says, the Lord takes away with him all his associates when he disappears from the earth. The power and energy which were bestowed upon Arjuna were required for fulfillment of the mission of the Lord. But when his mission was fulfilled, the emergency powers were withdrawn from Arjuna. Arjuna was bestowed some extraordinary powers by Krishna, but when the mission was over, Krishna withdrew the powers of Arjuna. Why? Because Prabhupada says, because the astounding powers of Arjuna, which were astonishing even to the denizens of heaven or the demigods, were no longer required.

#### detachment, humility, service to Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "the lesson is therefore that no one should be puffed up for his powers borrowed from the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of humility and detachment from material possessions and powers, advocating for the use of all resources in the service of Krishna.

As they were not meant for going back home, back to Godhead. So now what Arjuna requires to do is to go back to Godhead, because that's where he actually is eternally present. He had come when Krishna came along with Krishna for the sake of participating Krishna's pastimes. So when Krishna's pastimes are wound up, then Arjuna's powers are gone. Then Arjuna's power is also withdrawn by Krishna. It is Krishna only who gave Arjuna the power, extraordinary power. And Krishna only withdraws it when the power is no longer required by Arjuna. So that extraordinary power is not required for Arjuna to go back home, back to Godhead. If endowment of powers and withdrawal of powers by the Lord are possible even for a great devotee like Arjuna, or even for the demigods in heaven, then what to speak of ordinary living beings who are but fixed compared to such great souls, even any person in this world, however great he or she maybe. They display certain extraordinary power or knowledge or strength or skill or wealth because Krishna has bestowed it upon them. And when Krishna withdraws or takes away what is best for them, then they will be unable to possess them. They will be unable to use them. They will feel the absence of such extraordinary power or wealth when Krishna withdraws. So Srila Prabhupada concludes by telling, the lesson is therefore that no one should be puffed up for his powers borrowed from the Lord. Whatever anyone may have, they are actually borrowed from Krishna. And don't be proud about the borrowed power thinking, I have power or I have become powerful on my own, which means that nobody's independent. Independently, nobody's powerful. The same man should rather feel obliged to the Lord for such benefactions and must utilize such power for the service of the Lord. Such power can be withdrawn at any time by the Lord. So the best use of such power and opulence

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating the importance of using all one's resources in Krishna's service to avoid bewilderment and ensure lasting benefit, ending with Hare Krishna.

is to engage them in the service of the Lord. So if you have got some extraordinary wealth or whatever wealth you have in your possession, it is best utilized in the service of Krishna. If you have any power, if you have any skill, if you have any knowledge, if you have any strength, please use it in Krishna's service. Otherwise, if you use it for something else, you will be completely bewildered. You will be baffled in your attempts to use it some other way because it will be withdrawn when it is no longer required by the Lord who bestows it. So don't be proud. Don't use it for anything other than the Lord's service. That's a lesson to be learned. I'll stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.

#### Separation from Krishna, Loving relationship with Krishna, Forgetfulness of Krishna

**Verse References:** SB 1.15.6
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "For a living being, there is no one dearer than the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse and explains that everyone has a loving relationship with Krishna, but we have forgotten it.

In this session we will be discussing from the 6th verse of the 15th verse. The meaning of this verse is, I have just lost him whose separation for a moment would render all the universes unfavorable and void like bodies without life. Arjuna is further describing to Yudhishthira the feeling that he is having after having lost the association of Krishna. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport that factually for a living being, there is no one dearer than the Lord. For any living being, not only for devotees, for every living being, who is the dearest person? It is Lord Krishna. So, which means that we should understand, if we are not experiencing that loving relationship with Krishna right now, in our present condition, it is because we have forgotten Krishna, somehow. We don't know exactly how. We cannot trace back, how did I lose my dear most friend, my relationship with my dear most friend Krishna, how did I lose? We cannot trace it. So, we have to accept on the authority of the scriptures that we have lost our dear most friend. We have lost Krishna. We have lost the relationship with our dear most friend Krishna, dear most person.

#### Svamsa, Vibhinamsa, Expansions of Krishna, Paramatma, Jivas

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Lord Krishna has got His own expansions, His personal expansions."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concepts of Svamsa (personal expansions of Krishna) and Vibhinamsa (living beings as expansions of Krishna's energy).

Prabhupada says, the Lord expands himself by innumerable parts and parcels as Svamsa and Vibhinamsa. I will explain what this means. Svamsa. Lord Krishna has got His own expansions, His personal expansions. He himself expands in forms called Svamsa. His own personal expansion. Just like Krishna expands as Balaram, Narayana, Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Ram, Sankarsana, Vibhinamsa, Svamsa. Lord Krishna has got His own personal expansions. Lord Krishna has got His own personal expansions. Lord Krishna has got His own personal expansions. Lord Krishna has got His own personal expansion. Like Adha, Rama, Narasimha, Varaha, Vamana. Like that He expands in so many forms of incarnation, of different expansions in the spiritual world, incarnations in the material world. He expands Himself, His own Self. That means all these Swamsa expansions or incarnations, meditators from the Yantlingam, our nations are actually Lord Krishna himself. So, Swamsa is equal in power with Lord Krishna himself. So, Krishna only is present in another form as Rama, Narasimha, Varaha. And Krishna expands himself in another kind of expansion called Vibhinamsa. Vibhinamsa is the expansion of Krishna as the living beings. That is an expansion of Krishna's energy, expansion of Krishna's energy. So, those expansions are very, very, very, very, very, very tiny. They don't have equal power as that of Krishna. The expansion called Vibhinamsa, which is the living beings, they don't have the same power as Krishna. They have a very, very, very, very, very, very, very tiny fraction, fragmental portion of Krishna's energy, Krishna's power, Krishna's wealth, Krishna's beauty, Krishna's strength, Krishna's knowledge, very tiny bit of that. That is what

#### Paramatma, Swamsa, Vibhinamsa, Living beings, Material body, Soul

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Without the living being, the material body has no value."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the difference between Paramatma (Swamsa) and Jivatma (Vibhinamsa) and emphasizes the importance of the soul within the body.

says further in the purport, Paramatma is the Swamsa part of the Lord. Who is Paramatma? The Lord seated on everybody's heart in this material world. Paramatma is the Swamsa part of the Lord. Who is Paramatma? The Lord seated on everybody's heart in this material world. Paramatma. He is the Swamsa part. That means he has full power as Krishna. Whereas the Vibhinamsa parts are the living beings. Vibhinamsa parts, the living beings have got every, very, very, very less power. So, the English terms that are used by Prabhupada, we are infinitesimal part of Krishna and the incarnations of Krishna are infinite incarnations of Krishna. So, infinite and infinitesimal. Unlimited, limited. Param Brahma and Brahma. So, the difference always exists, eternally exists in all conditions. The living being is always tiny, limited. The Lord, including all his incarnations of his personal self, are always unlimited, always full with all power, all strength, all beauty, all knowledge, etc. Therefore, all those incarnations are called Bhagavan, Bhagavan Rama, Bhagavan Varaha, Bhagavan Narayana, Bhagavan Krishna. Therefore, whenever Krishna speaks in the Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavan Narayana, Bhagavan Krishna. Therefore, whenever Krishna speaks in the Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavan Narayana, Bhagavan Krishna. mijita-vedavyasa records it as Shree Bhagowanu Aacha. When the Lord incarnated as Kapila, then the description in the Bhagavatam is, Shree Bhagawanu Aacha. When Kapila speaks, the Samkhya philosophy explains. So, that is recorded by Vyasadeva in the Bhagavata, the Bhagavatam as Shri Bhagavanu Acha. So, this is important to understand. As the living being is the important factor of the material body, now all living beings, the important factor is the spirit soul, the living entity, the living being. Without the living being, the material body has no value. We know what happens when we say a person died. What happens? The living being, the spirit soul, has left the body. The body is a lump of matter, flesh and bones and skin and all that material covering. That's all that is left. Then we immediately dispose it off, because the person is not there.

#### Paramatma, Brahman, Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Subordinate features of Krishna

**Verse References:** BG 9.4, BS 5.40
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna is the Supreme Personality of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Brahman and Paramatma are expansions of Krishna and do not have independent existence, emphasizing Krishna's supreme position.

Now, the soul also in the same way, body has its existence based on the Paramatma within the heart of the living being, within the heart of the soul. It is only because of Paramatma's presence in the heart of the soul that the soul is able to utilize the body and do some activity while in the body. Without the presence of Paramatma we are completely helpless, we are totally lost, we are incapacitated. So Paramatma enters to facilitate our life in this body. Now further Srila Prabhupada says, Brahman or Paramatma has no locus standing without the Supreme Lord Krishna. Now Krishna the Supreme Personality of the Supreme Lord Krishna is the Supreme Personality of the Supreme Lord. You've got it? He expands as Paramatma, He expands as Brahman. Now both Brahman and Paramatma expansion of Krishna, they have no independent or separate existence without Krishna. Krishna only expands as Paramatma. Krishna's bodily effulgence only is Brahman or the impersonal feature or the energies. In different ways this Brahman is explained in the scriptures, which is one of the features of the Supreme Lord Krishna, the Absolute Truth. So that feature is a subordinate feature to Bhagavan, Krishna. Krishna says this in the Bhagavad Gita, brahmanohi pratishta aham. I am the basis of the Brahman, impersonal Brahman. Elsewhere in the Brahma Samhita it is said, yasya prabha prabhavato jagadandakoti. This entire jagadandakoti, the crores of universes, they are a rest. They are resting in the Brahman effulgence, which is the bodily luster of the Supreme Lord Krishna, yasya prabha. His bodily effulgence is the Brahman. And in that Brahman all the universes are resting, they are sustained. So that is explained also. This is all explained

They are all interrelated. They are linked with one another or independent factors. It appears like each one is existing independently, but actually none of them are independent of Krishna. So Krishna is the source of the Paramatma. Paramatma is the source of the Jivatma. Jivatma is the source of the body. . . I am just talking only of Jivatma and so there is no other source of the Paramatma. You have to Wohn the . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

**Key Quote:** "Only by his merciful strength was I able to vanquish all the lusty princes assembled at the palace of King Drupada for the selection of the bridegroom."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains that Arjuna is remembering how Krishna empowered him to win Draupadi's hand.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 7th verse of the 15th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Yad Samshrayat Drupadageham Upagatanam Ragnam Swayamvara Mukhe Smara Durmadanam Tejo Hritham Kalu Mayabihadascha Matsyaha Sajji Krtena Dhanusha Adhigata Cha Krishna. The meaning of this 7th verse is as follows: Only by his merciful strength was I able to vanquish all the lusty princes assembled at the palace of King Drupada for the selection of the bridegroom with my bow and arrow. I could pierce the fish target and thereby gain the hand of Draupadi. Arjuna is remembering all the different incidents in the book of Draupadi, and he is remembering all the different incidents in the past in the association of the Lord, how he was specially empowered by Lord Krishna to do something, many things very, very extraordinary, even amazing to the demigods. So Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport, what is amazing about Arjuna winning the hand of Draupadi in that Swayamvara ceremony, Draupadi Swayamvara, how did Arjuna actually defeat the other princes? How was he able to pass the test which Drupada had actually arranged to select the proper bridegroom for Draupadi, to select the proper bridegroom for Draupadi? So Srila Prabhupada explains that in the purport.

#### Draupadi Swayamvara, Drupada's desire, Pandava's escape

**Key Quote:** "Drupada Maharaj decided to hand over his daughter to Arjuna only, this was Drupada's desire."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Drupada's desire for Draupadi to marry Arjuna and the circumstances surrounding the Pandavas' supposed death in the shellac house.

Srila Prabhupada says Draupadi was the most beautiful daughter of King Drupada, and when she was a young girl, almost all the princess desired her hand. The Kshatriyas, they want to marry the most beautiful princess of their time in their, in the neighborhood. So it was well known in the different parts of this Bharat Varsha during the time of Draupadi that this daughter of Drupada, she was the most beautiful princess of her time. And when Drupada announced that she is going to be married to the prince who can actually successfully pass a test, then so many princess came. So here Srila Prabhupada explains something confidential, that Drupada Maharaj decided to hand over his daughter to Arjuna only. This was Drupada's desire. He wanted to marry his daughter Draupadi only to Arjuna, and therefore Drupada contrived a peculiar way. Drupada is very intelligent, because it's not explained in the purport by Srila Prabhupada, the details are there in the Mahabharata, that Drupada actually could have directly approached Arjuna and expressed his desire to marry his daughter to Arjuna, but Arjuna was reportedly killed in a fire accident. This was the time when Duryodhana was plotting to kill the Pandavas, and Duryodhana along with the support and the encouragement by his father Dhritarashtra, Duryodhana built a palace, separate palace for the Pandavas in another place, and that palace was made of combined combustible materials, shellac, and the Pandavas were told by Dhritarashtra, you don't have to share the palace in Hastinapura with the Kauravas, you go and stay separately in a beautiful palace that I have specially arranged to be built for you, and you stay there comfortably. Now Pandavas, they came to know through some secret messages, basically from Vidura, the Pandavas came to know that this was a plot to kill them by setting fire after they went to that new palace and in that way burn them alive. So this was the plot, and the Pandavas what they did, because they knew that they are being sent there to be killed alive, so Vidura secretly had arranged to dig a tunnel from underneath that new palace to escape, to escape and save themselves. This was also another secret not known to Duryodhana or Dhritarashtra or any of the Kauravas. So when Pandavas agreed to go, Dhritarashtra thought now somehow eliminate the Pandavas. So then the Pandavas actually escaped after going there, and even though the palace was set on fire, the people thought Pandavas were living inside, and they were very, very unhappy that the Pandavas were killed in apparently a fire accident, and externally the Kauravas who knew the real reason why the Pandavas were sent there to be killed alive, burnt alive, so they externally expressed some sorrow, very unfortunate the Pandavas were burnt alive, some accident, but actually practically nobody knew that the Pandavas had escaped. Drupada was doubtful whether the Pandavas were really killed in that fire accident. So in order to discover where are the Pandavas, he decided to actually contrive a peculiar way of arranging a test for the princess to discover where is Arjuna if he is in hiding.

**Key Quote:** "The condition was that out of the princely order the contending prince must be able to pierce the fishes eyes through the wheel of protection."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the difficult test Drupada devised for the Swayamvara and how Draupadi avoided Karna.

So what was the test for the prince who wanted to marry Draupadi, which was arranged such a way only Arjuna could pass? What was the test? There was a fish hanging on the inner roof of the house under the protection of a wheel. There is a fish hanging on the inner roof of the house, and that underneath the fish there was a wheel. The condition was that out of the princely order, the contending prince must be able to pierce the fishes eyes through the wheel of protection. The eye of the fish has to be pierced by the prince who shoots an arrow, that eye has to be pierced through the wheel, and no one will be allowed to look up at the target. They can't directly look up and aim the arrow at the eye of the fish. On the ground there was a water pot in which the target and wheel were reflected. The target, which is the eye of the fish, and the wheel were reflected in the water pot, and they can only look down into the reflection, and one has to fix his aim towards the target by looking at the trembling water in the pot. The water is not steady, the target is steady, but the water is shaking, is trembling, and the water is not steady. The water is not steady because the water is not. So what did he do? In the assembly of the princely order, when Drishtadyumna, the brother of Draupadi, introduced all the princes to his grown-up sister, Karna was also present in the game. But Draupadi tactfully avoided Karna as the rival of Arjuna, and she expressed her desires through her brother Drishtadyumna that she was unable to accept anyone who was less than a Kshatriya. So Karna was also there. Karna came forward, but Draupadi expressed through Drishtadyumna that she will not marry anybody who is less than a Kshatriya. Karna was known as the son of a carpenter or a shudra, and in those days, the Vaishyas and the Shudras are considered to be less important than the Kshatriyas. So Draupadi... Draupadi avoided Karna by this method. Karna was known as the son of a shudra, so he was called a shudra. So Draupadi said, I don't want to marry a shudra or a Vaishya. I want to marry a Kshatriya.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates how Arjuna, disguised as a brahmana, succeeded in piercing the target, defeating Karna with Krishna's grace, and winning Draupadi's hand.

When Arjuna, who was also present in that assembly, he was disguised as a poor brahmana. When the Pandavas escaped from that shellac house when it was set on fire, they actually came away to the forest, and in the forest they were disguised, because they were still not clear how they are going to reveal to everyone that they have escaped, and how will they protect themselves against the attack of Duryodhana and the other Kauravas, who are always thinking of how to kill the Pandavas. So how to protect themselves and how to reveal to the others that they are alive. So they were disguising themselves. So in this Swayamvara ceremony they came disguised as poor brahmanas. Arjuna was disguised as poor brahmana. So Arjuna, when none of the other princes were able to pierce the target, who were Kshatriyas, they all failed to pierce the target. It was not possible for them. Then, Arjuna came forward, though he was dressed as a poor brahmana, because a brahmana is superior to a Kshatriya. So he came forward and said, let me try, even though I am not a Kshatriya, let me try, if I am permitted to. So, Drupada, Draupadi and Drishtadyumna all were very curious. Who is this brahmana who is going to try? Let us see. When everyone else has failed, whether this brahmana will succeed. Let us see. So he was allowed. Then Arjuna, actually in the dress of a poor brahmana, he pierced the difficult target, and everyone was astonished. This brahmana is able to pierce the target which everyone else has failed to do so. Who is this brahmana? Then, especially Karna offered a stiff fight to Arjuna. That in Swayambara, the others who have lost, they will not allow the winner to simply take away the beautiful bride, Draupadi. So when Karna put up a fight against Arjuna, then Arjuna was able to defeat Karna only by the grace of Krishna, and he thus was successfully able to win the hand of Draupadi. Now Arjuna remembered this incident that only because of Krishna, because having that extraordinary strength to fight against all the princes, including Karna, and thus win the hand of Draupadi. So Arjuna remembered that.

So here the description so far has been how Yudhishthira is curious to know, anxious to know, not just curious, he is anxious to know why Arjuna has returned from Dwaraka and is very much aggrieved. And Yudhishthira asked so many questions as to the cause for Arjuna's grief. And when Arjuna did not reply, Yudhishthira guessed that actually it is only because Krishna has left the planet and Arjuna is feeling the intense separation. He has become his dearest friend. So, Arjuna is now recollecting the different incidents in the presence of the Supreme Lord. How Arjuna had a very nice, wonderful companionship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As is Diyamohar Xin. As is Diyamo's friend. Arjuna had a wonderful friendship with Krishna. So he is describing to Yudhishthira

**Key Quote:** "It was actually Krishna's desire that a pure devotee rule the world and lead people on the path of devotional service to achieve the ultimate liberation."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Yudhishthira's devotion to Krishna and Krishna's desire for a pure devotee to rule the world, emphasizing Yudhishthira's intention to glorify Krishna through the Rajasuya Yajna and the worship of Krishna in the assembly.

This was during the Rajasuya sacrifice that Yudhishthira actually performed after this assembly house was built. Now Yudhishthira himself is a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord Krishna. He was interested in performing his Rajasuya Jnana for his own sake. Generally a king declares himself as the emperor of the world and he offers a challenge to those who do not want to be subordinate to him, that they fight and defeat the emperor or the would-be emperor. If they do not want to be under his subordination. So Yudhishthira was not very much interested in himself becoming the emperor. It was actually Krishna's desire that a pure devotee rule the world and lead people on the path of devotional service to achieve the ultimate liberation. Now, Yudhishthira himself, he wanted to glorify Krishna. And in order to glorify Krishna, he wanted an assembly of all the state princes. And when they assembled, in that assembly, Yudhishthira worshiped Krishna as the foremost among all the personalities in the entire creation. Because Yudhishthira's yajna was attended to by even the devatas. So in the presence of all great kings and devatas and saintly persons, in that assembly, Yudhishthira wanted to glorify Krishna. So Yudhishthira would be the first appearant as the guest 같이. So this was just a demonstration of the great Yudhishthira as Yudhishthira, the great king.

**Key Quote:** "The modern demons are the harmful material scientists."
**Summary:** This segment explains the nature of demons and divine beings, drawing from the Bhagavad Gita, and equates modern demons with harmful material scientists who create disturbances in society, using the example of nuclear weapons.

by Arjuna, he constructed this wonderful assembly house which was used to perform the Rajasuya sacrifice. Then Srila Prabhupada says, the demons possess wonderful and supernatural powers to create material wonders, but they are always disturbing elements to the society. That is a demoniac nature. There are people in this world, Dvabhuta Sarge Lokesmin, Daiva Asura Evachara. In the 16th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna explains there are two kinds of created beings. Some with divine qualities and some with demoniac qualities. Daiva Asura. So these demons, they have some supernatural powers. Supernatural powers to create material wonders. But they are disturbing elements because of their demoniac nature. That is why they are called demons. The modern demons are the harmful material scientists. In our age also now, there are demons. Who are the demons? The harmful material scientists. Why? Because they create some material wonders for disturbance in the society. And Prabhupada gives the example here. For example, the creation of nuclear weapons has caused some panic in human society. So much of nuclear weapons are there all over the world in different countries. So the intelligence of a demoniac natured person is always used for destructive purposes. And the intelligence of a divine natured person is used for constructive purposes. So there is a difference between the divine nature and the demoniac nature. Therefore Prabhupada says they create disturbance in society.

**Key Quote:** "So it is described devotees are more merciful than the Lord."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Maya's materialism and how he sought shelter from Arjuna to escape Krishna's Sudarshan Chakra, emphasizing the mercy of devotees and the importance of pleasing the devotee to please the Lord.

Always they are disturbing the people in general. So Maya was also a materialist like that. But he knew the art of creating wonderful things. And yet, when Lord Krishna wanted to kill him. So Maya Dhanava was chased both by the fire and by the wheel of Lord Krishna. Krishna wanted to eliminate this demon by using Sudarshan Chakra. And this Maya Dhanava was also in danger because of the fire in the Khandava forest which was his place of residence. So he was chased both by the fire and the Sudarshan Chakra of Lord Krishna. Then what did Maya Dhanava do? He simply took shelter of Arjuna. Arjuna who is a great devotee. Now when Arjuna saw that Maya Dhanava's life is in danger. Arjuna saved him from the wrath of the fire of Lord Sri Krishna. So it is described devotees are more merciful than the Lord. So by the mercy of a devotee, even the Lord will pardon someone who is an offender. So when somebody is given shelter by a devotee, they are actually blessed by the Lord. They are actually benedicted by the Lord. So therefore it is more important to please the devotee of the Lord, pure devotee of the Lord, even more than trying to please the Lord. And the Lord is automatically pleased when we please his pure devotee. Asya Prasada Bhagavata Prasada. So this is the moral to be learnt from this incident.

**Key Quote:** "Out of curiosity, she joined the two parts and the child became complete and regained life."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's purport explains the unusual birth story of Jarasandha, involving a king, two queens, a mango, a she-demon named Jara, and the joining of two body parts.

And this Krishna Mantra Prasurtyamantra was a very powerful king of Magada, and the history of his birth and activities was also very interesting. His father, King Brihadratha, was also a very prosperous and powerful king of Magada, but he had no son, although he married two daughters of the king of Kashi. Being disappointed in not getting a son from either of the two queens, the king, along with his wives, left Kashi home to live in the forest for austerities. But in the forest, he was blessed by one great Rishi to have his son, and that Rishi gave him one mango to be eaten by the queens. The queens did so and were very soon pregnant. The king was very happy to see the queens bearing children, but when the right time approached, the queens delivered one child in two parts, one from each of the queens' wombs. The two parts were thrown in the forest where a great she-demon used to live, and she was glad to have some delicate alnya flesh and blood from the newly born child. Out of curiosity, she joined the two parts, and the child became complete and regained life. The king was in a haste. He thought the queens have delivered two parts which are not complete. He thought they are useless. Both the queens have delivered something which is incomplete. So, they simply discarded the parts. But when the she-demon joined the two parts, they became complete and regained life. The child became complete and regained life because the child was born due to the blessing of the rishi in the forest. The rishi blessed that the king have only one child through the two queens, one child. Becoming common, the class 4 queen came out. So, therefore, the she-demon was known as 'jara', that was her name, who lived in that forest where the king had retired, and being compassionate on the childless king, she went to the king and presented him with the nice child. Instead of, she presented the king with the child. The king was very pleased with the she-demon and wanted to reward her according to her desire. The she-demon expressed her desire that the child be named after her. And thus, the child was surnamed Jarasandha, or one who was joined by Jara, the she-demon. Sandha means to join.

**Key Quote:** "Shiva is the lord of all ghostly and demoniac men."
**Summary:** The lecture explains that Jarasandha was born with demoniac qualities, making him a devotee of Lord Shiva, who is easily pleased and often worshipped by demons.

So, this child got the name Jarasandha. So, it is also explained here that this Jarasandha was born as one of the children of the king. He was also one of the parts and parcels of the demon Viprachitti. So, he was also a demon, this Jarasandha, as a part and parcel of another big demon, Viprachitti. The saint by whose benedictions the queens bowed, the child was called Chandrakaushika, who foretold of the child before his father, Brihadratha. Now, this child, since he possessed demoniac qualities from birth, this is what the Bhagavad Gita explains, by birth, somebody is born with divine qualities, somebody else is born with demoniac qualities. So, this child was born with demoniac qualities. Naturally, he became a great devotee of Lord Shiva. Now, Shiva, who is Shiva? Shiva is the lord of all ghostly and demoniac men. Because Shiva is very easily pleased, these demons, they try to appease Shiva and get some material benedictions from him. And Shiva is very powerful, so he bestows material benedictions very easily. He is easily pleased. So, therefore, you can find many demons are devotees of Lord Shiva. So, Srila Prabhupada gives the example here: Ravana was a great devotee of Lord Shiva, and so also was King Jarasandha.

#### Jarasandha, Kamsa, Krishna, enemy

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Jarasandha became very angry against Krishna."
**Summary:** The lecture details how Jarasandha became an enemy of Krishna after Krishna killed Kamsa, who was Jarasandha's son-in-law, leading to Jarasandha's daughters becoming widows.

Jarasandha also was a devotee of Lord Shiva. This Jarasandha used to sacrifice all the demons, all arrested kings before Lord Mahabhairava or Shiva. And by his military power, this Jarasandha defeated many small kings and arrested them to butcher before Mahabhairava. This is offering as a tribute to Mahabhairava, another form of Shiva. So, Srila Prabhupada also says here that there are many devotees of Lord Mahabhairava or Kalabhairava in the province of Bihar. This was called formerly Magadha. Jarasandha was a relative of Kamsa, the maternal uncle of Krishna. And therefore, after Kamsa's death, King Jarasandha became a great enemy of Krishna. Why? Because Jarasandha's daughters were married to Kamsa. So, when Kamsa was killed by Krishna, Jarasandha's daughters became widows. After becoming widows, they went back to their father's house, Jarasandha's house. And Jarasandha was very unhappy that his daughters became widows, and he thought the cause of their becoming widows is Krishna. He never considered that Kamsa was doing all kinds of atrocious activities. Kamsa harassed Vasudeva and Devaki so much. So, Krishna, in order to actually give protection to Vasudeva and Devaki, who are devotees, he had to kill this Kamsa. So, Jarasandha became very angry against Krishna, and that way, Krishna became Jarasandha's enemy, simply because Krishna tried to protect his own parents and had to kill this Jarasandha.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is the real cause for all these happenings."
**Summary:** The lecture describes how Krishna orchestrated Jarasandha's death through Bhima, leading to the release of imprisoned kings who then paid tribute to Yudhishthira, highlighting Krishna's role as the prime mover.

So, Jarasandha became enemy. Actually, Lord Krishna wanted to kill Jarasandha, but he also wanted that those who served as military men for Jarasandha might not be killed. Therefore, a plan was adopted to kill this Jarasandha by Lord Krishna. What is the plan? Krishna, Bhima and Arjuna disguised themselves as poor brahmanas and went to Jarasandha and begged charity from him. Jarasandha never refused charity to any brahmana. So, when Krishna, Bhima and Arjuna asked Jarasandha for the facility of fighting him, to settle that Jarasandha would fight with Bhima only. So, all of them were guests and combatants of Jarasandha. So, Bhima and Jarasandha fought every day for several days, and Bhima became very disappointed that he could not kill Jarasandha, could not defeat or kill Jarasandha, because both were very powerful. Then Krishna gave hints that, he gave hints to Bhima about Jarasandha being joined together as an infant. Two parts of a child were joined together. That's why Jarasandha was born. So, Bhima dissected him again and killed him. So, all the kings who were detained in the concentration camp to be offered as Bali in front of Mahabhairava, they were released by Bhima. Now, when the kings felt obliged to the Pandavas, they paid tribute to King Yudhishthira. In this way, Arjuna is recollecting how by Krishna's mercy, Bhima was able to kill Jarasandha. And because the kings who were arrested by Jarasandha were released by Bhima, after Bhima killed Jarasandha, so the released kings, they paid tributes to Yudhishthira in the Rajasuya Yajna. So, Krishna is the real cause for all these happenings. Though Krishna remains in the background, he is the prime cause for all these incidents. This is the way of the Lord's pastimes in this world. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the new chapter about Pariksit Maharaj and explains how he ruled as a devotee, guided by Brahmanas, and possessing qualities foretold at his birth.

In this session, we will be discussing the importance from the first verse of the 16th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. This is a new chapter we are beginning in this session. The chapter is entitled, "How Pariksit Received the Age of Kali." So, in the previous chapter, we heard that the Pandavas retired timely. They handed over charge of ruling the world to Yudhishthira, who handed over charge to Pariksit Maharaj, the only surviving descendant of the Pandavas. And now, how did Pariksit rule? That is going to be described in this chapter. So the first verse: sutavvaca tata pariksit vijavariya shikshaya mahi mahabhagavata shashasaha yatha hi sutyam abhijatko vidaha samadhisan vipra mahagunas tatha. The meaning of this verse is: Suta Goswami said, remember Suta Goswami is speaking to the sages of Naimisharanya. They are asking different questions and Suta Goswami is replying to them. So, he is describing how Pariksit Maharaj began to rule. Suta Goswami said, O learned Brahmanas, Maharaj Pariksit then began to rule over the world as a great devotee of the Lord under the instructions of the best of the twice-born Brahmanas. He ruled by those great qualities which were foretold by expert astrologers

**Summary:** The speaker explains that good qualities develop naturally through devotion to Krishna and stresses the importance of preaching Krishna consciousness for world peace.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, at the time of Maharaj Pariksit's birth, the expert astrologer Brahmanas foretold some of his qualities. Why some of his qualities? Because a devotee has so many good qualities. So, they just foretold some of the good qualities at the time of the birth ceremony. Maharaj Pariksit developed all those qualities of the Lord and gradually all the good qualities worthy of possession develop. In the twelfth chapter of the Bhagavad-gita, Shila Prabhupada says when Krishna describes the wonderful qualities of a pure devotee, Prabhupada says one does not endeavor to develop each quality by separate effort. No, that's not the main way to develop good qualities by a devotee. Simply one has to become a devotee of the Supreme Lord, then naturally, automatically, very easily one develops all the good qualities gradually while practicing bhakti. So therefore, it is important everyone practices bhakti and naturally, automatically they all will develop good quality. Therefore, there is a great need to preach this Krishna consciousness among all classes of people in this world simply to make them devotees and thereby they become first-class citizens and there will be peace and prosperity in

the whole world. So further, Shila Prabhupada says Maharaj Pariksit was a Mahabhagavata or a first-class devotee who is not only well versed in the science of devotion but also able to convert others to become devotees by his transcendental instructions. Why is this being said of Pariksit as a devotee? He naturally had all good qualities, but being a first-class devotee, Mahabhagavata, Mahi mahabhagavata shahrhah, so Pariksit is described in the verse as Mahabhagava, first-class devotee, the topmost devotee, the pure devotee. So pure devotee, his specialty is that he is himself got all the good qualities that are we found in a devotee and then he is well versed in the science of devotion and therefore, such a first class pure devotee of the Lord is able to convert others to become devotees by his transcendental instructions. His instructions are very, very effective, very practical, very powerful. They impact the heart. Association with pure devotees impacts the heart of the person who takes such association, who contacts such pure devotee. So as a leader, Parikshit is the leader because he is the king, emperor of the world, of the citizens. They have all these common people. So he influences them, himself being a first class devotee, himself being a Mahabhagavata, so that they also become devotees. They also develop all good qualities. They also become prepared to go back to godhead. They are also completely liberated from the cycle of birth and death.

Maharaj Pariksit, further Srila Prabhupada says Maharaj Pariksit was therefore a devotee of the first order. There are three classes of devotees. I think that is also explained by Prabhupada. No, not in this purport. So there are three classes of devotees, first class devotee, second class devotee and third class devotee: Uttam Adhikari, Madhyam Adhikari, Kanishad Adhikari. So Pariksit was first class devotee, the top most class, the pure devotee, perfected devotee. Thus he used to consult great sages and learned brahmanas who could advise him by the shastras how to execute the state administration. Just because he is a first class devotee does not mean he acts independently. This is the important point to note. Even a first class devotee does not act independently. He will consult the right people for specific purposes. So it is said here, Srila Prabhupada, Pariksit

**Key Quote:** "The rules and regulations were already set forth by great sages like Manu, Yajnavalkya, Parashara and other liberated sages and the enactments were all suitable for all ages in all places."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the rules and regulations set forth by liberated sages in Dharma Shastras are perfect and suitable for all times and places, unlike the flawed laws made by imperfect people in modern systems.

They are great authorities. They are themselves first class leaders because they follow the proper authority and thereby they are able to give perfect guidance to the common people. There was no need for impractical fools to enact daily a new legislative bill and to conveniently alter it again and again to serve some purpose. See, this is important. In the modern system of administration, we see that the laws are made by imperfect people. So therefore, what is working for one time or one situation may not be working for another time with changing times. The laws have to be amended but Srila Prabhupada says the rules and regulations were already set forth by great sages like Manu, Yajnavalkya, Parashara and other liberated sages and the enactments were all suitable for all ages in all places. See the wonderful thing about the Dharma Shastras. There is Parashara. There is Parashara Smriti. There is Manu Smriti. Yajnavalkya Smriti. And these are instructions given for different classes of human beings including the kings. How they should rule over the citizens? Perfect instructions because they are given by liberated sages. They are not conditioned. They are not having the defects of a conditioned soul. So when they give some advice or instruction or direction, they are perfect. So when they give some advice or instruction or direction, they are perfect. So when they give some advice or instruction or direction, they are perfect. They are good for all times, they are good for all places, all kinds of people. They are good for all times, they are good for all places, all kinds of people. They are good for all times, they are good for all places, all kinds of people. Therefore the rules and regulations were standard and without flaw or defect. Therefore the rules and regulations were standard and without flaw or defect. Therefore the rules and regulations were standard and without flaw or defect. No defect, no mistake, no limitation of time or place. No defect, no mistake, no limitation of time or place. No defect, no mistake, no limitation of time or place.

**Key Quote:** "The state would get the best advice without expenditure."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the council of advisors of kings like Pariksit, consisting of great sages and Brahmanas who provided selfless advice without expecting salaries, highlighting the benefits of the Vedic system.

No defect, no mistake, no limitation of time or place. Kings like Maharaj Pariksit had their council of advisors. Kings like Maharaj Pariksit had their council of advisors. And all the members of that council were either great sages or brahmanas of the first order. So who constituted this council of advisors of Parikshit Maharaj? All great sages, liberated souls. They did not accept any salary, nor had they any need for such salaries. These brahmanas, they were not paid by the king. Unlike modern day advisors, the IAS officers or the council of ministers, everyone is paid. Of course they need to take some salary, because they don't have any other means of subsistence. But in the former times, the brahmanas would give advice, they would not accept any salary. The state would get the best advice without expenditure. You see, this is the wonderful system in the Vedic times. The state would get the best advice because they are the topmost people, intelligent people, well versed in chastity. And they would not charge any fees. They would not take any salary. So without any expenditure, the state is getting the best advice. Now these kings, they were themselves samadarshi, equal to everyone, both man and animal. Sorry, the brahmanas. They were equal to both man and animal. This is important in the modern context. They would not advise the king to give. They would not give protection to man and instruct him to kill the poor animals. That is not the way to run the state administration. That human beings, they deserve protection. But animals, they can be sent to the slaughterhouse.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the superficial happiness of a 'fool's paradise' with the genuine happiness that self-realized souls can provide, ensuring well-being in both this life and the next.

Now, such council members were not fools or representatives to compose a fool's paradise. What is a fool's paradise? A person who in ignorance thinks he is very happy and everything is fine, without being able to perceive potential trouble or impending danger. That's called a fool's paradise. So these brahmanas simply would not give instructions in such a way that, oh, everything is very nice. Everything is going on first class. No. There is no internal dwelling. They were all self-realized souls. And they knew perfectly well how all living being in this state would be happy, both in this life and the next. Both in this life and the next. People can be happy in this life, as well as in the next, in the future, also. They were not concerned with hedonistic philosophy of eat, drink, and be merry and enjoy. No. So they were actually able to give perfect advice, perfect instruction for everyone to be happy.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam 1.16.10, explaining that it describes how Maharaja Parikshit perceived the influence of Kali Yuga entering his kingdom.

In this session we will be discussing from the 10th verse of the 16th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Sūta Vāca Yadā Parikṣit Kuru Jāngale Avasat Kalim Praviṣṭam Nija Chakra Vartite Nishamya Vārtām Anathipriyāṃ Tatah Sharāsanam Samyuga Saundirādade. The meaning of this verse is: Sūta Gosvāmī said while Mahārāja Parikṣit was residing in the capital of the Kuru Empire, the symptoms of the age of Kali began to infiltrate within the jurisdiction of his state. When he learned about this, he did not think the matter very palatable. This did, however, give him a chance to fight. He took up his bow and arrows and prepared himself for military activities. So, as the title of this chapter indicates, how Parikṣit received his military service.

**Key Quote:** "Actually, Kali Yuga began when Krishna departed for his personal abode after winding up his pastimes."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the timeline of Kali Yuga's influence, connecting it to Krishna's departure and Yudhishthira's retirement.

He received the age of Kali. So, the appearance of Parikṣit was at the end of Dwapar Yuga and the beginning of Kali Yuga. And the age of Kali is symptomized, as Srila Prabhupāda will explain in this purport, by so many sinful activities. Kali is called Adharma Bandhu, friend of irreligion. So, irreligion is prominent in Kali Yuga. So, therefore, this Kali Yuga began when Parikṣit Mahārāja was ruling. Actually, Kali Yuga began when Krishna departed for his personal abode after winding up his pastimes. But, still, as long as Krishna was there, sorry, Kali Yuga began when the battle of Kurukshetra ended. But, as long as Krishna was present, Kali Yuga could not exert its influence on the people. As soon as Krishna departed from this world, after winding up his pastimes, the influence of Kali began to affect the people of this earth planet. So, it is said here, Yudhishthira Mahārāja, he decided to retire from his kingly duties when he learnt about the disappearance of Lord Krishna. And he handed over the charge to Mahārāja Parikṣit to rule the entire world.

**Key Quote:** "A king is responsible for people to understand the real ultimate goal of life as human beings, that is self-realization."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the responsibilities of a king, highlighting that a king should guide citizens towards self-realization and spiritual culture.

Now, the description is being given that Parikṣit Mahārāja performed Ashwamedha Yajña and he was ruling. So, it is described here, while he was residing in his capital, the symptoms of the age of Kali began to infiltrate within the jurisdiction of his state. And he was not very happy about it, because the symptoms of the age of Kali are all indicative of people taking to sinful activities. Parikṣit being an ideal representative of the Supreme Lord, he protects his citizens from engaging in sinful activities. Because a king rules the kingdom, not only for providing the people with their material needs, or arranging for their material necessities, but more importantly, a king is responsible for people to understand the real ultimate goal of life as human beings, that is self-realization. And he arranges for their preparation to go back home, back to Godhead, by having spiritual culture disseminated in the entire kingdom.

**Key Quote:** "The first one is illicit connection with women. The second one is indulgence in meat eating. The third one is intoxication. And the fourth one is taking pleasure in gambling."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Parikshit Maharaja decided to act against the symptoms of Kali Yuga, which are defined as illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication, and gambling.

So when Parikṣit learnt about the symptoms of the age of Kali infiltrating his kingdom, then he decided to deal with the matter by taking up his bow and arrows and prepared himself for military activities. He decided to go and examine where exactly are these symptoms very prominent, in which part of the kingdom. So Śrīla Prabhupāda says in the purport, the state administration of Mahārāja Parīkṣit was so perfect that he was sitting in his capital peacefully. He was such an able administrator that all the subordinate kings were paying the taxes properly and carrying out their duties in their own respective smaller zones very nicely. And they had the full protection of Parīkṣit himself and his army. So everything was going on nicely, but he got the news that the symptoms of the age of Kali had already infiltrated into the jurisdiction of his state and he did not like this news. So Śrīla Prabhupāda now explains what are the symptoms of the age of Kali. This is very important for us to understand. We are all living in Kali Yuga. What are the symptoms of the age of Kali? They are four. Four symptoms of the age of Kali, particularly prominent. What are they? The first one is illicit connection with women. The second one is indulgence in meat eating. The third one is intoxication. And the fourth one is taking pleasure in gambling.

Over and above this, it is mentioned here, the age of Kali literally means the age of quarrel. Kali means, it comes from the word Kalaha. Kalaha means quarrel. And the above mentioned four symptoms in human society are the root causes for all kinds of quarrel. You see how these four symptoms of the age of Kali are linked up to so many quarrels taking place in Kali Yuga over trifles. So Maharaj Parikshit heard that some of the people of the state had already taken to those symptoms. And he wanted to take immediate steps against such causes of unrest. That means, as long as people are not sinful

**Key Quote:** "Nowadays you see the symptoms of Kali that it is prevalent amongst so many people."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the restricted nature of sinful activities in earlier times with their widespread prevalence in Kali Yuga, using the example of the increase in non-vegetarianism in India.

with regard to these four sinful activities, particularly meat eating, intoxication, gambling, and illicit sex. As long as people don't take to these four sinful activities as a routine, it's not that in early ages, nobody was eating meat, no. Meat eating was under heavy restriction. And that also some real low-class people, they would indulge in meat eating or intoxication, gambling or illicit sex very restrictedly. So it is not prevalent in human society in a big way. Nowadays you see the symptoms of Kali that it is prevalent amongst so many people. Just to give you an idea how as Kali progresses, these sinful activities become more and more prominent among the mass of people. When India got independence, this is the statistics I am giving from some census data that was published recently. When India got independence in 1947, overall population of the whole country, the percentage of vegetarians was 75% and non-vegetarians was 25%. Sometime in 2010, the census was again done and they said, according to the census, I'll survey, the percentage of people who are non-vegetarians had jumped up to 75%. And percentage of people who are still vegetarians in 2010 was 25%. So you see, just tripled the number of non-vegetarians. So, this is the influence of the age of Kali, how the mass of people take to sinful activities, that means they unrestrictedly indulge in sinful activities.

**Key Quote:** "Pariksit Maharaj being the ideal king...he wanted to take action or steps against such causes of unrest."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates Parikshit's role as an ideal king who took action against sinful activities, contrasting it with the open promotion and ignorance surrounding these activities in modern times.

Now, Pariksit Maharaj being the ideal king at the beginning of Kali Yuga, he wanted to take action or steps against such causes of unrest. So, Prabhupada says, this means that at least up to the regime of Maharaj Pariksit, such symptoms of public life were practically unknown. And as soon as they were slightly detected, he wanted to root them out. That means people could not freely indulge in meat-eating, intoxication, gambling, publicly. Some remote place, some rare instance, some real low-class fallen person may do it occasionally. But not that there are advertisements everywhere. Come, enjoy meat-eating, intoxication, gambling, illicit sex. Of course, we don't see advertisements in India for illicit sex openly, but neither for gambling, but for intoxication, you see boats, bar, bar and restaurant, pub, and non-vegetarian food, so much advertisement. So, this means that people openly indulge in it and they are not conscious, they are not aware many times that it is sinful and sinful activities are the cause of our suffering. People are ignorant.

**Summary:** The speaker argues that sinful habits are not innate but are acquired through bad association and influence, emphasizing the importance of culture and religion in avoiding such activities.

People are victimized by bad influence. It's not that people are born with some habit like meat-eating or intoxication. Prabhupada says that. Nobody is born with a cigarette in his mouth no, and as soon as a child is born what is he fed? He's fed the mother's milk, correct? So it's not true that right from birth somebody is a non-veteran or a person who indulges in the sinful activities no, it is only by bad association, it is only by bad influence, it is only by enticement by other sinful people that somebody really becomes addicted or habituated to sinful activities. So Pariksit Maharaj he decided to root out these symptoms of Kali. So even though Kali Yuga is destined to be an age of sinful activities, it doesn't mean that the king should sit back and say after all it is destined so I don't have to bother about it no. Maharaj Pariksit as his duty to save the citizens from the association of agents of Kali, he wanted to punish the miscreants indulging in the symptoms of Kali and thus save the innocent citizens were pure in habit by culture of religion, you see our culture is very culture is to avoid sinful

activities almost completely, that is the culture. Just like even today in the state of Gujarat and Rajasthan it is recorded in the census data, most of the people are vegetarians in these two states particularly Gujarat and Rajasthan, maximum people are vegetarians, so that is the kind of culture that is there, that was the culture that is prevalent in the whole country, but in course of time people became more and more degraded and the influence was more. So Srila Prabhupada says it is a duty of the king to give such protection and Maharaj Pariksit was perfectly right when he prepared himself to fight against miscreants who indulge in sinful activities. I'll stop here.

#### royal procession, Vedic aesthetics, Pariksit Maharaj, Arjuna

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Even a royal procession...is a sign of a civilization that is aesthetic even on the fighting front."
**Summary:** This segment describes Maharaj Pariksit's procession and compares it to Arjuna's, highlighting the Vedic culture's aesthetic sense even in warfare.

In this session we will be discussing from two verses, the eleventh and the twelfth verses of the sixteenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The eleventh verse. The meaning of this verse is, Maharaj Pariksit sat on a chariot drawn by black horses, Shyamaturanga. His flag was marked with the sign of a lion, Mrigendra Dhwajam, being so decorated and surrounded by charioteers, cavalry, elephants and infantry. Cavalry is soldiers on horseback, infantry is soldiers on foot. And there were warriors or soldiers on chariots and soldiers on elephant back. He left the capital to conquer in all directions. So, Pariksit Maharaj is going to root out the symptoms of Kali from his kingdom, when Kali is just trying to conquer and to infiltrate his kingdom. So, that's the description given here. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, Maharaj Pariksit is distinguished from his grandfather Arjuna, for black horses pulled his chariot instead of white horses. You remember the description of Arjuna's chariot being pulled by white horses. This is the description of the first chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. Both Krishna and Arjuna were seated on a chariot, on a great chariot, Mahatishyandane, Shwetahayai, drawn by white horses. And in contrast to that, Maharaj Pariksit was the grandson of Arjuna. His chariot was being pulled by black horses, Shyamaturangayojitam. Then again, Srila Prabhupada says, the distinction between Pariksit's chariot and Arjuna's chariot. Again, one more difference is, Pariksit marked his flag with the mark of a lion, Mrugendra Dhwajam, and his grandfather Arjuna marked his with the mark of Hanumanji, Kapit Dhwajam. Kapi refers to Hanuman. A royal procession like that of Maharaj Pariksit, surrounded by well decorated chariots, cavalry, elephants, infantry, and band, not only is pleasing to the eyes, but also is a sign of a civilization that is aesthetic even on the fighting front. There is a good sense of aesthetics in everything people did in the Vedic culture, even a royal procession. The king is proceeding to conquer all directions. The emperor. He is not just a king. He is an emperor. So he is surrounded by beautifully decorated chariots, elephants, infantry. So this is very very pleasing to the eyes to see, and also this indicates how well prepared he was to actually give protection to the citizens, innocent citizens, or the well behaved citizens.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Pariksit then conquered all parts of the earthly planet...and exacted tributes from their respective rulers."
**Summary:** This segment explains Maharaj Pariksit's conquests and the division of the earth into Dvipas and Varshas, focusing on Jambudvipa.

The twelfth verse. Bhadrashvam ketum alamcha bharatam chottaran kuram kim purushadini varshani vijitya jagrihe balim. So these are names of different parts of the earthly planet that Pariksit conquered. So in the translation. The translation is as follows. Maharaj Pariksit then conquered all parts of the earthly planet, Bhadrashva, Ketumala, Bharata, the Northern Kuru, Kim Purusha, etc., and exacted tributes from their respective rulers. The system was the subordinate kings had to pay a portion of the tax they collected from their citizens to the emperor. So Maharaj Pariksit went to different parts of his kingdom, that means the whole world, earthly planet, and exacted the taxes from the respective rulers. So Srila Prabhupada gives a brief description of these different parts that were the parts of the earth, as divided during the time of Maharaj Pariksit. So first of all in the purport he describes Bhadrashva Varsha. It is a tract of land near Meru Parvata, and it extends from Gandhamadana Parvata to the salt water ocean. There is a description of this Varsha in the Mahabharata, in the Bhishma Parva 7th chapter verses 14 to 18. Mahabharata is the history of greater India. So it is called Itihasa. It is compiled by Vyasadeva. So Srila Prabhupada is quoting from this, that this Bhadrashva Varsha is described in this particular portion of the Mahabharata. The description was narrated by Sanjaya to Dhritarashtra about this Bhadrashva Varsha. Maharaj Yudhishthira also conquered this Varsha, and thus the province was included within the jurisdiction of his empire. Maharaj Pariksit was formally declared to be the emperor of all lands ruled by his grandfather, but still he had to establish his supremacy while he was out of his capital to exact tribute from such states. The king is not simply a namesake king. He has got his power to rule, and he challenges the subordinate kings. If they accept his supremacy then there is no fighting. Otherwise there is a battle fought between the two kings, and whoever is victorious becomes the ruler. Ketumala Varsha. Another part of his kingdom. This earth planet is divided into seven Dvipas by seven oceans, and the central Dvipa called Jambudvipa is divided into nine Varshas, or parts, by eight huge mountains. See. The whole earth planet, even as we know it today, there are so many oceans, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Atlantic Ocean, like that. So there are seven oceans dividing the earth planet into seven islands. The land mass between two oceans, surrounded by water is called an island.

**Key Quote:** "So, a description of this Varsha or this part of the world is available in the Mahabharata in Sabha Parva, 28th chapter, 6th verse."
**Summary:** This segment details the different Varshas within Jambudvipa, referencing descriptions from the Mahabharata and highlighting the characteristics of each region and its inhabitants.

Dvipa. So Saptva Dvipa Vasundhara. This is a description in the Mahabharata. The earth planet is divided into seven islands, and the central island is called Jambudvipa. Dvipa means island. Jambudvipa. And this Jambudvipa, the central part, central island, is divided into nine Varshas, or nine parts, called Varshas. Dvipa and Varsha. So the names here, Ketumala Varsha, Bhadrasho Varsha, and, sorry, Bharata Varsha, Ilaavrata Varsha, Kimpurusha Varsha, like that. There are nine Varshas, nine divisions. And how are these nine divisions made? In the central island, in the Jambudvipa, by eight huge mountains separating some tracts of land. So, a description of this Varsha or this part of the world is available in the Mahabharata in Sabha Parva, 28th chapter, 6th verse. So, Prabhupada gives the reference also. Somebody is interested in the details of the description of this Varsha can refer Mahabharata, that particular portion. Further, Srila Prabhupada says, it is said that this part of the world is situated on the western side of Meru Parvata and inhabitants of this province used to live up to 10,000 years, as per the reference in the Mahabharata, Bhishma Parva, 6th chapter, 31st verse. Human beings living in this part of the globe are of golden color and the women resemble the angels of heaven. The inhabitants are free from all kinds of diseases and grief. This is the description of the Mahabharata. Next is Bharata Varsha. This part of the world is also one of the nine Varshas of Jambudvipa, Bharata Varsha. A description of Bharata Varsha is given in the Mahabharata, Bhishma Parva, chapters 9 and 10. In the center of Jambudvipa is Ilaavrata Varsha and south of Ilaavrata Varsha is Hari Varsha. The description of these Varshas is given in the Mahabharata, Sabha Parva, 28th chapter, verses 7 and 8. That Prabhupada quotes here. It is mentioned here that the women in both these Varshas are beautiful and some of them are equal to the Apsaras or heavenly women.

**Key Quote:** "In other words, Maharaja Parikshit conquered all the world, all the different parts of the world."
**Summary:** This segment continues describing the Varshas, including Uttarakuru and Kimpurusha, referencing the Mahabharata, and summarizes Maharaj Pariksit's conquest of the entire world.

That's the description in the Mahabharata. Next, Srila Prabhupada describes Uttarakuru Varsha. According to Vedic geography, the northernmost portion of Jambudvipa is called Uttarakuru Varsha. Uttara means north. It is surrounded by the saltwater ocean from three sides and divided by Sringavan Mountain from the Hiranyamaya Varsha. That's the description in the Mahabharata. Next, Kimpurusha Varsha is stated to be situated north of the great Himalayan mountain, which is 80,000 miles in length and height and which covers 16,000 miles in width, the Himalayan mountain. These parts of the world were also conquered by Arjuna as described in Mahabharata's Sabha Parva, chapter 28, verses 1 and 2, the Kimpurushas are descendants of a daughter of Daksha. When Maharaja Yudhishthira performed a horse sacrifice, the inhabitants of these countries were also present to take part in the festival and they paid tributes to the emperor Yudhishthira. This part of the world is called Kimpurusha Varsha or sometimes the Himalayan provinces. It is said that Sukadeva Goswami is born. He was born in these Himalayan provinces and that he came to Bharat Varsha after crossing the Himalayan countries. So, to summarize this whole thing, Srila Prabhupada says, In other words, Maharaja Parikshit conquered all the world, all the different parts of the world. He conquered all the continents adjoining all the seas and oceans in all directions, namely the eastern, western, northern and southern parts of the world. So, all the Dvipas and in the central Jambudvipa, all the Varshas. He conquered all the parts and became the emperor of the entire, and actually, he exacted the taxes from all the rulers of these different provinces.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's translation of the verses is read, followed by an explanation of the verses, focusing on Parikshit's hearing the glories of his forefathers and Krishna's protection.

given by Srila Prabhupada is as follows: Wherever the king visited, he continuously heard the glories of his great forefathers who were all devotees of the Lord. That means basically the Pandavas. All the Pandavas were great devotees of Krishna, Keshava, and also of the glorious acts of Lord Krishna. People used to describe the forefathers of Parikshit and even the glorious activities of Krishna, because Krishna was also ruling Dwaraka when Yudhishthira was ruling in Hastinapur. So Parikshit also heard how he himself had been protected by the Lord from the powerful heat of the weapon of Ashwatthama. Parikshit's birth was extraordinary. He's protected by Krishna even when he was in his mother's womb. He was attempted to be killed by Ashwatthama at the end of the battle of Kurukshetra, but Krishna saved him in his mother's womb. So that also people were glorified. People also mentioned the great affection between the descendants of Vrishni and Prutha due to the latter's great devotion to Lord Keshava. The descendants of Kunti, that is the Pandavas, and descendants of Vrishni, that means the family members of Krishna, there was a very nice affection between these two families because Kunti was a pure devotee of Krishna. So therefore, there was a nice affectionate relationship between the Vrishnis and the Pandavas.

He was very pleased to hear. What was he pleased to hear? The glories of Lord Krishna and the glories of Krishna's pure devotees, the Pandavas. And when he was pleased by such an act of glorification of Krishna and his pure devotees, he rewarded the singers with very valuable necklaces and very valuable clothing.

#### Vedic culture, welcome addresses, Krishna Samhita

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The subject matter of those welcome addresses was Krishna. This is the most important point."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Vedic culture involves welcoming great personalities with addresses focused on Krishna, highlighting that Srimad Bhagavatam is also known as Krishna Samhita.

So Srila Prabhupada explains a significant point to be noted in these verses. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "Kings and great personalities of the state are presented with welcome addresses." This is the Vedic culture. This is a system from time immemorial, and Maharaj Parikshit, since he was one of the well-known emperors of the world, was also presented with addresses of welcome in all parts of the world as he visited those places. He was a very great emperor, so naturally people would welcome him. A great personality is welcomed when he visits a certain place. People who are conversant with his greatness, they will glorify him for the benefit of everyone else. The subject matter of those welcome addresses was Krishna. This is the most important point. How is it that Krishna is the subject matter of all those welcome addresses when Parikshit was travelling in different parts of his kingdom? Because Parikshit was a great devotee of Krishna. Parikshit's forefathers who were ruling the earth planet, the Pandavas, they were also great devotees of Krishna. So whether somebody glorifies Krishna or Krishna's pure devotees, always the subject matter of such glorification is Krishna. That's why the Bhagavatam, which contains nothing but the glorification of Krishna and his pure devotees, is also called Krishna Samhita. That means it is that special Vedic literature, Samhita means Vedic literature, which is exclusively devoted to descriptions of the glorifications of Krishna.

#### Krishna and devotees, inseparability, Bhakti

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna and his unalloyed devotees cannot be separated. And therefore, glorifying the devotee means, glorifying the Lord and vice versa."
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the inseparability of Krishna and His devotees, explaining that glorifying a devotee is equivalent to glorifying Krishna, and that true Bhakti is devotion to Krishna alone.

That is the speciality of the Bhagavatam. So therefore, it is called Krishna Samhita. It is a very special literature. Similarly, here it is said, wherever Parikshit went, the welcome addresses that were given to Parikshit, the subject matter was Krishna. So Srila Prabhupada clarifies, "Krishna means Krishna and his eternal devotees as the king means the king and his confidential associates." A king is never alone. When a king travels, he has got his confidential associates. Similarly, Krishna is never alone. Krishna is always with his confidential associates, who are all his devotees. All are his devotees. Krishna is the one and only one Supreme Lord, and everyone else, especially in the spiritual world, everyone else is a devotee. Actually, everyone in the material world also is a devotee of Krishna, but in the material world, people are forgetful of their devotional relationship with Krishna. That is the difference between the spiritual world and the material world. So Srila Prabhupada says, "Krishna and his unalloyed devotees cannot be separated, and therefore, glorifying the devotee means glorifying the Lord and vice versa." So glorification of devotee means it is nothing but glorification of Krishna only, because the object of the devotion of the devotees is Krishna only and nobody else. So when Shastras say Bhakti, Bhakti refers to devotion towards Krishna only and not devotion towards some other material personality, some other object of glorification.

#### Bhakti, Krishna consciousness, Parikshit's remembrance
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/d30rNAe9YZg?t=621
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "devotees are all the time thinking of Krishna, speaking about Krishna, remembering Krishna, do every activity for the sake of pleasing Krishna. That is Bhakti."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to define Bhakti as constant remembrance and service to Krishna, illustrating how Parikshit's experiences reminded him of Krishna.

No. Just like they say, Desh Bhakti, devoted to the country. That word Bhakti cannot be used, strictly speaking, for somebody who is very devoted to, who is patriotic. The word Bhakti cannot be used. Bhakti refers to devotion to Krishna only. So even if somebody glorifies the devotee, that glorification will necessarily be glorification of Krishna only, because devotees are all the time thinking of Krishna, speaking about Krishna, remembering Krishna, doing every activity for the sake of pleasing Krishna. That is Bhakti. So Srila Prabhupada further says, "Maharaj Pariksit would not have been glad to hear about the glories of his forefathers like Maharaj Yudhishthir and Arjuna had they not been connected with the activities of Lord Krishna." This is a characteristic of a devotee. He is not simply attached to his family members like ordinary people are. No. His attachment is for devotees. His attachment is for Krishna and Krishna's devotees. The devotees are glorified by the presence of the Lord because they cannot live for a moment without the presence of the Lord and His different energies. This is the symptom of a devotee. A devotee always wants the presence of the Lord. And how does a devotee always be in the presence of the Lord? By constantly thinking of Him, by constantly remembering Him, by constantly chanting His name, by constantly hearing about His glories, by constantly engaging in different acts of devotion and service to Lord Krishna. So therefore, Maharaj Pariksit felt the presence of the Lord when Krishna was glorified by His activities, especially when Pariksit was saved by Lord Krishna in the womb of His mother. So that reminded him of Krishna. Whatever glorification people did simply reminded Pariksit of Krishna.

#### Krishna's protection, dangers in material world, Krishna Leela
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/d30rNAe9YZg?t=796
**Verse References:** BG 1.1
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The material world is full of joy. There are dangers at every step."
**Summary:** The lecture discusses how Krishna protects devotees in the dangerous material world, using the example of the Pandavas' involvement in the battle of Kurukshetra as part of Krishna's Leela.

So therefore, Krishna was the only object of glorification in all such welcome addresses. That is the important point. So Srila Prabhupada explains, "The material world is full of joy. There are dangers at every step." That's the description of the Bhagavatam, padam, padam, yat vipadam, every step there is danger, and the devotees sometimes are apparently placed into dangerous positions, and when they are saved by the Supreme Lord Krishna, Krishna becomes glorified. See, this is the description that is there in the scriptures. Sometimes devotees are also put into dangers, but devotees have no other shelter other than Krishna. So when they are in danger, especially devotees pray to Krishna, they think of Krishna, they seek shelter in Krishna's lotus feet, and Krishna is always very, very, very attentive to his devotees. First of all, devotees cannot be harmed by anybody. In case, apparently, they are harmed by anybody, immediately Krishna is there to save the devotees, as is in the current Bhagavad Gita. So Srila Prabhupada says, "Krishna would not have been glorified as speaker of Bhagavad Gita had his devotees like the Pandavas not been entangled in the battle of Kurukshetra." See, the Pandavas' involvement in the battle of Kurukshetra is part of Krishna's Leela for what purpose? Many multiple purposes, that Krishna came to reduce the burden of this earth planet which is overburdened by demons. So Pandavas assisted Krishna by fighting in the battlefield of Kurukshetra and killing those demons or demoniac Nietzsche persons. So they are simultaneously participating in Krishna Leela and also reducing the burden of this world, which was Krishna's purpose of descent.

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "nowadays also there are presentations of welcome address but people glorify or flatter"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the authentic glorification of the past with the often insincere flattery prevalent in modern welcome addresses, also noting the lack of genuine rewards.

So Srila Prabhupada also says nowadays also there are presentations of welcome address, but people glorify or flatter, that's the correct word, the leaders, even though it's allowed to say the word of God of abundance, these people, junkies, or leaders, or the great personalities, but always such glorification is not factual, simply for pleasing the person. They may say so many things. He or she may or may not be actually worthy of all such glorification. The singers of the glories of the great kings would not simply flatter them by some false statements, no never. And also the Kings would actually reward the singers with nice presentations, but nowadays where is such a reward being given? Because they themselves are not sufficiently rich, and if they are rich, they are not willing to part with their wealth. So there is a difference between the way formerly great personality used to be received and welcomed and rewarded.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Pariksit heard that out of his causeless mercy Lord Krishna, or Vishnu, who is universally obeyed, rendered all kinds of service to the malleable sons of Pandu"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 16th verse of the 16th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining how Lord Krishna, despite being supreme, served the Pandavas, inspiring devotion in Maharaj Pariksit.

In this session we will be discussing from the 16th verse of the 16th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is a very important verse. It is a very nice verse. Sarathya Parashada Sevana Sakya Dautya Veerasana Anugamana Stavana Pranaman Snigdheshu Pandushu Jagat Pranathimcha Vishno Bhaktim Karo Tindrapathish Charanara Vinde. Beautiful verse. What is the meaning of this verse? Maharaj Pariksit heard that out of his causeless mercy Lord Krishna, or Vishnu, who is universally obeyed, rendered all kinds of service to the malleable sons of Pandu by accepting posts ranging from chariot driver to president, to messenger, friend, night watchman, etc. according to the will of the Pandavas, obeying them like a servant and offering obeisances like one younger in years. When Pariksit heard this, he became overwhelmed with devotion to the lotus feet of the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "When somebody performs bhakti for some material benefit, then such bhakti is called materially contaminated bhakti."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of pure devotion (unalloyed bhakti) versus devotion contaminated by material desires, emphasizing that true bhakti aims to awaken love for Krishna and purify oneself.

What a beautiful description here. So the people were describing, glorifying Krishna, that Krishna, even though he is a supreme Lord, he is obeyed universally by everybody, everyone else is a servant. He is the only master. But, because of his affection for his devotees, Krishna agrees to become a servant of his devotees. He is willing to pay obeisances to his devotee even though he is the superior in all circumstances. He is the supreme in all circumstances. So, Shrila Prabhupada says in the purport, Lord Krishna is everything to the unalloyed devotees like the Pandavas. Unalloyed devotees means pure devotees. Their bhakti is not mixed with any material contamination. What are the material contaminations in our rendering devotional service? When somebody performs bhakti for some material benefit, then such bhakti is called materially contaminated bhakti, because bhakti should be rendered only for the sake of awakening our love for Krishna, awakening our devotion to Krishna, for the sake of becoming purified of all material contamination, not increasing the material contamination, not keeping the material contamination very, very securely. No. That's not real bhakti.

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Similarly, when we say bhakti in the scriptures, when it is said bhakti, it means pure devotion. 100% devotion to Krishna."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of gold purity (carats), the speaker explains that pure devotion is free from any material desires and is 100% dedicated to Krishna.

Though sometimes that also is called bhakti. When somebody prays to Krishna, I want some wealth or I want some relief from some disease, this is called bhakti. Bhakti which is contaminated by material desires. So the Pandavas and many such great devotees described and glorified in the Bhagavatam are all pure devotees, unalloyed devotees, just like pure gold. So unalloyed, that is no mixture of any other metal. Pure gold. Similarly, pure bhakti. Bhakti means pure bhakti. Of course, nowadays they have a concept of 18 carat gold or 16 carat gold. That means it's not pure gold. 16 parts out of 24 are gold. So that means 8 parts, 1/3 of that ornament is actually some other cheaper metal like copper or some other metal. So that's not pure gold. So 16 carat gold strictly cannot be called gold. When you say gold, we mean pure gold. Similarly, when we say bhakti in the scriptures, when it is said bhakti, it means pure devotion, 100% devotion to Krishna. And what is that 100% devotion? No material desires, free from all material desires. So whenever somebody renders devotional service to Krishna, it should be free from any material desires. That's called unalloyed devotion.

**Key Quote:** "Simply to please Krishna by one's service. That's all."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the sole purpose of rendering devotional service to Krishna is to please Him, as exemplified by the pure devotion of the Pandavas.

Pure devotion. Real devotion. If there is no material desire or material ambition to be fulfilled while rendering service to Krishna, then why render service at all? So there is a certain particular purpose in rendering devotional service to Krishna and that is only for one purpose: simply to please Krishna by one's service. That's all. So all pure devotees render service to Krishna only to please him and for no other purpose. So the Pandavas, they are pure devotees. They render service to Krishna simply for the sake of pleasing Krishna. So for the Pandavas, Krishna was the supreme lord, the spiritual master, the worshipable deity, the guide, the chariot driver, the friend, the servant, the messenger, and everything they could conceive of.

**Key Quote:** "In their intimate relationship, devotees forget Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the intimate relationship between devotees and Krishna, where devotees sometimes forget Krishna's supreme position, allowing for deeper loving service, using the examples of Arjuna and Mother Yashoda.

Why would the Pandavas make Krishna their chariot driver, Arjuna? Why did he make Krishna his chariot driver? If he has got devotion to Krishna, how can he even think of asking Krishna, can you please be my chariot driver when I fight in the battle? This is because of the intimate relationship between Arjuna and Krishna. That's described in the scriptures. Intimate relationship. In their intimate relationship, devotees forget Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead. And Krishna also likes the devotees reciprocating with him or serving him intimately while not being conscious of Krishna's supreme position, because that supremacy of Krishna comes in the way of their rendering intimate loving service. Just like Mother Yashoda. If she is conscious that Krishna is the supreme lord, then she cannot show her motherly affection to Krishna. If Krishna becomes naughty, Mother Yashoda does not chastise Krishna, then where is motherly affection? Nor can Mother Yashoda actually do any service in terms of her motherly affection? If she knows Krishna is the supreme lord, where is the question of feeding Krishna? If Krishna is the supreme lord, he never becomes hungry, he is never in need of any food. He is the one who is supplying everybody. He is completely self-satisfied. He is full in himself. He is not in need of any food. He never gets hungry. So, the service is simply for the sake of loving reciprocation between the lord and his pure devotees.

**Key Quote:** "The servant is the master. The master is the servant. There is no difference."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of reciprocity between Krishna and His devotees, where Krishna also serves His devotees to please them, highlighting that the relationship is not like a material master-servant dynamic, using the example of Krishna as Arjuna's chariot driver.

This should be understood. Now, when the devotee renders service to Krishna, to please Krishna, Krishna reciprocates by himself becoming the servant of his devotees, or himself rendering service to the devotees, again to please the devotees. Just like devotees want to please Krishna by serving Krishna, Krishna wants to please his devotees by serving them. Please understand, when scriptures say we are servants of Krishna, the concept of servant of Krishna is not like the concept of servant in the material world. Never mistakenly think that servant means servant like in the material world. No. In the spiritual world, all positions are absolute positions. Prabhupada explains this in another place. The servant is the master. The master is the servant. There is no difference. What is the meaning of that? Like Krishna demonstrated, before the battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna is the lord, or playing the role of the lord, and Arjuna is playing the role of the subordinate to the lord. But on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, Krishna agreed to become the chariot driver of Arjuna, and Arjuna ordered Krishna, please take my chariot between the two armies, so that I can see with whom I have to fight. He is ordering Krishna. Krishna says, okay, according to your order, I will take the chariot between the two armies. So, this is the kind of reciprocation between the lord and his devotees.

#### transcendental reciprocation, Krishna's kindness, night watchman, Veera Asana, ecstasy

**Key Quote:** "Krishna acted as a night watchman for the Pandavas, because they were exiled."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how Maharaj Pariksit was overwhelmed by Krishna's kindness and willingness to do anything for His devotees, such as acting as a night watchman for the Pandavas, leading to tears of love and ecstasy.

So, Maharaj Pariksit, as a pure devotee of the lord, he could appreciate the lord's transcendental reciprocation of the feelings of his devotees. And thus, he himself was also overwhelmed with the dealings of the lord. He began to feel Krishna is so kind to his devotees, that he is willing to do anything for his devotee. Just like the Pandavas, Krishna acted as a night watchman for the Pandavas, because they were exiled. And in the forest, you see, they are not with all their army and the security. No. They are without that. So, if there is danger, what happens? Krishna's devotees. So, naturally, when they are in danger as devotees, they think of Krishna. And Krishna immediately responds to his devotees. So, because Pandavas were in forest, and there was danger at night, Krishna used to be guarding the Pandavas as the night watchman. Then they have to take some rest. You see, there is a word used here. Prabhupad says that in this description of what all Krishna was to the Pandavas, Veera Asana. Veera Asana, Krishna accepted the post of Veera Asana means acceptance of the post of a watchman with a drawn sword at night. Like he is holding a sword and waiting upon the Pandavas that nobody should harm the Pandavas. If somebody comes or attempts to even attack the Pandavas, they are going to be immediately killed with the sword. So, that kind of service Krishna accepted out of his affection for the Pandavas, simply because of affection. So, in this way, Pariksit heard that the dealings of the Lord and his pure devotees is so very sweet, so very relatable, that Pariksit began to feel himself, his devotion towards Krishna being aroused into ecstasy. And out of ecstasy, he began to shed tears of love for Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Hearing about Krishna's activities itself is devotional service. It is completely a transcendental activity. And it purifies us and makes us eligible to go back, come back to God."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing that Krishna's dealings with His devotees are transcendental and free from material contamination, and that hearing about these activities is a form of devotional service that purifies and leads one back to God.

And that is being described here. So, Srila Prabhupada says, even though the Lord's feelings towards, dealings with his devotees appear to be like ordinary human dealings, but the truth is that they are all completely transcendental. They are spiritual reciprocation between Krishna and his pure devotees. They have no tinge of any material contamination in them. There is no material sentiment, that Krishna did this to me, gave me this favour, so now I have to actually do some other favour to Krishna. No. None of those calculations are there. Neither they think, oh, Krishna is powerful, so he is capable of protecting me. No. No such calculation. So, there is a distinct difference between Krishna's activities, his dealings with his devotees, his incarnations, and the conditioned souls performing some activities or relating with other conditioned souls. There is a lot of difference between the two. So, therefore, hearing about Krishna's activities itself is devotional service. It is completely a transcendental activity, and it purifies us and makes us eligible to go back, come back to God. So, I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "So this is the wonderful relationship that exists between Krishna and his pure devotees in the spiritual world. And even in the material world when Krishna incarnates, he comes down with his confidential associates and he demonstrates to us what is life like in the spiritual world."
**Summary:** This segment describes Maharaj Pariksit's rule, the devotion of the Pandavas, and Krishna's willingness to serve his devotees, highlighting the relationship between Krishna and his pure devotees.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devim Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session we will be discussing from two verses, the seventeenth and the eighteenth verses of the sixteenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The seventeenth verse is as follows: Tasyaivam Vartamanasya Purvesham Vrittim Anvaham Natidhure Kilashcharyam Yadasi Tannibodhame. The meaning of this verse is as follows: Now you may hear from me of what happened while Maharaj Pariksit was passing his days hearing of the good occupations of his forefathers and being absorbed in thought of them. So this has reference to the previous few verses in which Suta Goswami is describing the regime of Maharaj Pariksit. If you remember, the Pandavas retired after they heard that Krishna has gone to his personal abode after winding up his pastimes. And before retiring they, Yudhishthira Maharaj handed over charge of ruling the world to Pariksit Maharaj. So Pariksit Maharaj was trained, he took charge and he performed, he got married, he had good sons, headed by Janamejaya and he performed three hard sacrifices under the able guidance of qualified Acharyas, Brahmanas and he was ruling very nicely. So when he went out for conquest, he heard everywhere he went how the Pandavas who were ruling before him, actually were great devotees of the Supreme Lord Krishna and how the Pandavas were able to actually get from Krishna anything they desired because of their service attitude towards the Supreme Lord. So it was described, that Krishna, who is the Supreme Lord, he rendered service to the Pandavas by accepting posts ranging from chariot driver to president to messenger to friend to night watchman. Like that, Krishna is willing to do anything for his devotees. And devotees are completely surrendered to Krishna. They simply want to please Krishna in whichever way Krishna wants them to actually serve him. So this is the wonderful relationship that exists between Krishna and his pure devotees in the spiritual world. And even in the material world when Krishna incarnates, he comes down with his confidential associates and he demonstrates to us what is life like in the spiritual world. So that's what Krishna is demonstrating.

#### Reviving our relationship with Krishna, Questions about life and death, Vedic literature, Kali Yuga

**Key Quote:** "So, actually each one of us have got a relationship with Krishna. And we are meant to actually revive that relationship, especially when we have this human form of body."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the importance of reviving our relationship with Krishna, the fundamental questions answered by the Vedas, and the unfavorable conditions of Kali Yuga.

In his relationship with the Pandavas, in his relationship with Kunti, in his relationship with Draupadi, in his relationship with Yashoda, Nanda Maharaj, the whole Brajavasis, the Mathura Nivasis, the Dwarka Nivasis, the Yadu, members of the Yadu dynasty, they were all so attached to Krishna. So, actually each one of us have got a relationship with Krishna. And we are meant to actually revive that relationship, especially when we have this human form of body. Because we realize in the human form of body, I don't want suffering, but it is forced on me. I want to know who am I, I want to know what is my source. Okay. Where was I before birth? What will happen to me after death? So, these questions are best answered in our Vedic literature, the Vedas. They are very special because they answer these fundamental questions. And not only they answer the questions, they show us the way how to be living, really. They continue to stay out of this predicament that we are in right now. We don't want suffering, but suffering is forced on us. So, we can become free from all suffering if we study the Vedas, hear from the Vedas, or learn the Vedas, and adopt a lifestyle which is in accordance with the Vedic principles. The Vedic principles meant for those human beings who want to make a permanent solution to all their problems and get out of all this entanglement. So now Suta Goswami is going to describe when Parikshit Maharaj is ruling and he was passing his days hearing of the good occupation of his forefathers, what happened? I mean, already it has been told that Parikshit was ruling when Kali Yuga was just beginning. So what are the symptoms of Kali and what are the remedies for the specific conditions in Kali Yuga which are unfavorable for peaceful and living and for prosperity of the people. So he is, Suta Goswami is going to describe this now. In the 18th verse he says,

**Key Quote:** "The personality of religious principles, Dharma, was wandering about in the form of a bull, and he met, that is, Dharma, met the personality of earth in the form of a cow, who appeared to grieve like a mother who had lost her child."
**Summary:** This segment explains the symbolism of Dharma as a bull and Mother Earth as a cow, describing their condition at the beginning of Kali Yuga and the state of moral principles.

The meaning of this verse is, now Suta Goswami is addressing the sages of Naimishananya. He is telling, The personality of religious principles, Dharma, was wandering about in the form of a bull, and he met, that is, Dharma, met the personality of earth in the form of a cow, who appeared to grieve like a mother who had lost her child. She had tears in her eyes and the beauty of her body was lost. Thus, Dharma questioned the earth as follows. So what will follow after this 18th verse are the questions, various questions asked by Dharma to Mother Earth. So in the Purport, Srila Prabhupāda comments on this condition of mother earth in the form of a cow in which Dharma found her wandering when he was wandering so Srila Prabhupada says the bull is the emblem of the moral principle what's the meaning of emblem emblem is a symbolic representation of something just like the moral principles that human beings follow in human society are reflected in the condition of the bull and the cow is the representative of the earth so mother earth in the form of a cow is indicating what is the status of the earth in Kali Yuga and bull is indicating the status of the population in terms of moral principles that they follow or don't follow so Srila Prabhupada says when the bull and the cow are in a joyful mood it is to be understood that the people of the world are also in a joyful mood people are happy and are very joyful if the bull and cow are in a joyful mood

**Key Quote:** "Among all the domestic animals, the most important are the bull and the cow."
**Summary:** This segment contrasts domestic and wild animals, emphasizing the importance of protecting the bull and cow in Vedic culture.

these bull and cow are very important domestic animals perhaps you are aware that animals are divided into two categories the domestic and the wild animals wild animals live in the forest and there the law of the jungle prevails. There is no... Ultra virgin. There are so many other words. I have to... They're trying to bring restrictions different governments are telling that animals wild animals should not be exploited for entertaining the people in general. And taming a wild animal that is no longer encouraged or permitted by so many governments. Anyway, so the wild animals live in the jungle and there the very nature of those animals is such that nature regulates them in nature's own way. Whereas these domestic animals, they are dependent for protection and engagement in a specific way on the human society. Just like cows, bulls, goats, sheep, and dogs, and cats. All these are domestic animals. They very easily are befriended by any human being. Very easily. And they give some service and they are also taken care. They are given some food or they are given some shelter or they are given some kind of protection. There is reciprocation also with these domestic animals. So, among all the domestic animals, the most important are the bull and the cow. Why? So, Prabhupada says because the bull is the emblem of moral principles in human society and cow is the representative of the earth. And scriptures, the Vedic scriptures especially recommend that human society should particularly protect the bull and the cow.

**Key Quote:** "So, if the cow and bull are protected for the good of human society, then there is advancement of Brahmanical culture."
**Summary:** This segment explains the benefits of protecting the bull and cow for human society and the negative consequences of mistreating them, linking it to the decline of Brahmanical culture and spiritual values.

Particularly they should protect the bull and the cow. Why? Because the bull helps production of grains in the agricultural field. Not only production of grains. The bulls are used in so many ways, at least in the Vedic culture, for drawing water from the well, for removing the husk from the grains after they are grown, for extracting oil from oilseeds, for transportation. The bull can pull. It has got an immense amount of strength to do all these activities. And the cow delivers milk, the miracle of aggregate food values. So, cow is specially meant for giving us milk, which is meant for our well-being, that it contains all the nourishment and nutrition that we require as human beings, particularly the cow's milk is highlighted. So, if the cow and bull are protected for the good of human society, then there is advancement of Brahmanical culture. Brahmanical culture is a culture meant for self-realization, spiritual realization, spiritual advancement. And if the bull and cow are neglected, or worse still, they are killed for being eaten as food. So, that is done by people who do not know the value of Brahmanical culture. They are uncultured, uncivilized, non-Brahmanical people. They have no spiritual values in life. They have no higher goal in life. Simply they live like for eating, sleeping, mating, defending, like animals they live. So, then if the cow and bull are mistreated, then the whole human society has to suffer in so many ways. And that is what is going to be described in the next few verses. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker presents the translation of Srimad Bhagavatam 1.16.19, where Dharma, in the form of a bull, inquires about the well-being of Mother Earth, represented as a cow, and notices her grief.

In this session we will be discussing from the 19th verse of the 16th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Dharmavacha Kachit Bhadre Anamayam Atmanaste Vichayasi Mlayateshan Mukhena Alakshaye Bhavateem Antaradhim Dure Bandhum Shochasi Kanchanam Ba The translation of this 19th verse. Dharma in the form of a bull asked madam, addressing the cow, "Are you not hale and hearty? Why are you covered with the shadow of grief? It appears by your face that you have become black. Are you suffering from some internal disease? Or are you thinking of some relative who is away in a distant place?"

**Key Quote:** "You are covered with the shadow of grief... Are you suffering from some internal disease? Or are you thinking of some relative who is away in a distant place?"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the verse, explaining the meaning of each question posed by Dharma, highlighting the cow's distress, potential internal suffering, and possible separation from a loved one.

So this symbolic representation of the condition of human society reflected in the condition of the cow, the representative of mother earth, the cow. And even the condition of the bull, that will be described in the next verse, the condition of the bull. So dharma is inquiring from mother earth, madam addressing Bhadre. This is a respectful way of addressing a lady in the samsara. In Sanskrit language, Bhadre, madam. Are you not hale and hearty? Are you not keeping good health? Are you not happy? Why are you covered with the shadow of grief? That means not only is mother earth unhappy, but she is unhappy about something which seems like it is a cause for distress or unhappiness. Continues to linger for a long time. It's not something which comes and immediately goes away. It's not like a pinprick. That momentarily there is some pain and after the cause for the pinprick is removed then the pain is gone. It's not like that. You are covered with the shadow of grief. And it appears by your face that you have become black. That means the pain has been there. The problem of this cause for the pain has been there, and your face has become black because you have been suffering for quite some time, a good length of time. Are you suffering from some internal disease? And what is the cause of your pain? Why are you suffering? Some internal disease? Is there some disease that has afflicted you? Or are you thinking of some relative who is away in a distant place? You are separated from your relative, and you are not able to live together happily. You are separated, and you are not able to actually be together due to some reason.

#### Kali Yuga, Anxiety, Suffering, Sadhus, Devotees

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "This exactly reflects the condition of people in this present age Kali Yuga... Sadhus means they live for welfare of others... He is unhappy because of others unhappiness."
**Summary:** The speaker connects the verse to the current age of Kali Yuga, explaining how the anxieties and suffering described are prevalent today, and defines the role of a sadhu as someone who is compassionate and concerned about the suffering of others.

So Aushriya Prabhupada very nicely explains that this exactly reflects the condition of people in this present age, Kali Yuga. We can relate with it because as Prabhupada explains, this is our position today in Kali Yuga. Shriya Prabhupada says in the purport, "The people of the world in this age of Kali are always full of anxieties." In the beginning of the first chapter, when the sages Naimisharanya could foresee the conditions of people in Kali Yuga, fourth coming age Kali Yuga, at the end of Dwapar Yuga, then they were anxiously inquiring from Suta Goswami, what is the remedy for people's problems in Kali Yuga? Because these saintly persons, they are called sadhus. And sadhus means they live for welfare of others. They themselves are situated in Krishna consciousness, God consciousness so they are happy, and they have solved their problems by God consciousness, by being in God consciousness. But they can't tolerate to see the suffering of the other people who are not in God consciousness, who suffers in this material world especially in Kali Yuga, those who are not God conscious. So the saintly persons who are happy because of being God conscious, they can't tolerate to see the suffering of others. Therefore they want a remedy to remove the suffering of the people in general. How can their suffering be removed? How can they become happy? This is the position of the sadhu. Sadhu is not a person with a big beard, with some big tilak, with some saffron dress. That is not a real sadhu. Those may be external symbols to indicate to somebody else that I am a sadhu, but real symptom of a sadhu is, Paradukhe Dukhi. Actually sadhu means a devotee, a genuine devotee of Krishna, because a genuine devotee is, Paradukhe Dukhi. He is unhappy because of others unhappiness.

**Key Quote:** "A devotee of Krishna has no reason to be unhappy on his own account. But he is unhappy looking at the condition of the suffering souls... The people of the world in this age of Kali are always full of anxieties."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to describe the suffering in Kali Yuga, emphasizing that devotees are happy in Krishna consciousness but are pained by the suffering of others, and highlights the anxieties and diseases prevalent in this age.

Himself he is not unhappy on his own account, because a devotee by practicing Krishna consciousness, by being in Krishna consciousness, he is always happy in Krishna consciousness. Krishna is the protector, Krishna is the maintainer, Krishna is the provider, Krishna is the servitor of his devotees. So a devotee of Krishna has no reason to be unhappy on his own account, but he is unhappy looking at the condition of the suffering souls who are bereft of God consciousness, who are non-devotees. So in this age of Kali, the sages of Naimisharan were pointing out to Suta Goswami, Upadrutaha. People are always disturbed in the mind. That means the mind is full of anxieties. That is what Prabhupada is telling here, "The people of the world in this age of Kali are always full of anxieties." Some reason will be there for them to be filled with anxiety. So it is said here by Srila Prabhupada, "Everyone is diseased with some kind of ailment." Needless to say, hospitals are prospering in business, in doing business. The private hospitals of course, not the government hospitals. The private hospitals are prospering, and hospital beds are not available, not easily available, specially during the pandemic and after the pandemic. So many cases of sickness, ailments. People are suffering in so many ways, even before the pandemic, because of Kali Yuga. People have some heart problem, people have some cancer, some people have some kidney problem, some people are diabetic, some people have got high blood pressure, and there are accidents, and there is nutritional deficiency. Constitutionally some people are weak, so they are susceptible to fall sick because of not having the necessary nourishment. The food is, I mean I can go on like this. It can be very lengthy tale of woe, but it is a fact. People suffer in so many ways in this present age, but some kind of ailment. Very few people are very healthy and very cheerful, free from anxieties, very few people. Then further Prabhupada says, "From the very faces of the people of this age, one can find out the index of the mind." This is another saying in the scriptures, "The face is the index of the mind." If you look at somebody's face, you can understand whether they are internally happy or not happy. You can make out. So you look at the face of people in general in Kali Yuga, most people, you can make out that they are not happy.

**Key Quote:** "Everyone practically feels the absence of his or her relative who is away from home... The particular symptom of the age of Kali is that no family is now blessed to live together."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the breakdown of the joint family system and the separation of family members due to work and other circumstances in Kali Yuga, contributing to unhappiness and anxiety.

Everyone feels the absence of his relative who is away from home. First thing is, people are, people's mind is always disturbed because of some anxiety that they go through. Second symptom is being described here, that they have some kind of ailment, some nutritional deficiency, or some weakness, or some particular condition, heart, condition of the heart, or condition of the kidney, or condition of the digestive system, or some kind of skin rashes, or some kind of allergy. So many, we can go on listing so many problems in terms of the poor health of the people in general in this Kali Yuga, majority of the people. And the third thing is that everyone practically feels the absence of his or her relative who is away from home. And what does this mean? Srila Prabhupada says, "The particular symptom of the age of Kali is that no family is now blessed to live together." It's very rare. As you know, the joint family system is already broken. Very few joint families are there. So there are very very small family units, husband, wife, and children, at the most. And even that husband, wife, and children, it is described by Prabhupada, this small unit, even if they have just one son or one child, to earn a livelihood, the father lives at a place far away from the son because the job demands. The father has to travel, or the father is transferred from one city to another city. You see. Or the wife lives far away from the husband. Sometimes the wife is working, she has to work in a different location, and the husband is working in a different location, and both of them have to work for making ends meet, although they can't maintain the family. So in this way, the family members are not together. They are not able to stay together. There are sufferings from internal suffering, but from internal diseases, separation from those near and dear, anxieties for maintaining the status quo proper summarizes three specific problems of people in Kali Yuga mentioned in this verse. These are but some important factors which make the people of this age always unhappy that's reflected in

**Key Quote:** "Even though they are cousin brother and sister, they can get married if they don't belong to the same gotra."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the family relationships between Parikshit, Uttara, and Arjuna, explaining the Vedic custom of gotra and its importance in marriage.

So this chapter describes how Parikshit received the age of Kali. Parikshit ascended the throne as the emperor of the world after Yudhishthir Maharaj. Then he married and begot four sons. He married the daughter of King Uttara. So Srila Prabhupada explains the purport. Maharaj Uttara was the son of Virudhara. And this Maharaj Uttara was the maternal uncle of Maharaj Parikshit. Why? Or how is this relationship? Because when the Pandavas were living incognito in the kingdom of Virudhara, Arjuna was instructing Virudhara's daughter. So, of course Arjuna was in disguise as a dance teacher. Then when later on Virudhara came to know that this Arjuna as a dance teacher was not ordinary dance teacher but he was Arjuna. Then Virudhara wanted to marry his daughter to Arjuna. But Arjuna refused because Arjuna said as a teacher I am like the father. I am in the position of a father. So I can't marry her. But my son can marry her. So Arjuna's son Abhimanyu, he married Virudhara's daughter. Now Parikshit is the son of Abhimanyu. So Uttara, sorry, Iravati, the daughter of Maharaj Uttara, who is the brother-in-law of Abhimanyu, is actually a cousin to Parikshit. So Iravati was a cousin sister of Maharaj Parikshit. Maharaj Uttara's daughter and Abhimanyu's son Parikshit were cousins. So Srila Prabhupada says cousin brothers and sisters were allowed to get married if they did not belong to the same gotra or family. So this is the important point. Even though they are cousin brother and sister, they can get married if they don't belong to the same gotra. Gotra means family.

**Key Quote:** "In the Vedic system of marriage, the importance of the gotra or family was stressed."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain the importance of gotra in Vedic marriages, providing examples from the lives of Arjuna and Krishna, and then returns to the topic of Janamejaya's birth and parentage.

In the Vedic system of marriage, the importance of the gotra or family was stressed. Sagotra marriage is not allowed because the progeny will be weak. Sagotra marriage. The children they conceive will be weak. So therefore, different gotra, belonging to different gotra, is important for consideration of marriage. And Prabhupada gives another example. Arjuna also married Subhadra, although she was his maternal cousin sister. Arjuna married Krishna's sister. Krishna was the cousin brother of Arjuna because Arjuna's mother Kunti and Krishna's father Vasudeva were sister and brother. So therefore, Arjuna and Krishna were cousins. But therefore, Arjuna and Krishna, not only Arjuna and Krishna, Arjuna and Subhadra were also cousins. How could they marry each other if they were cousins, brother and sister? That is because they belong to a different gotra. Now Srila Prabhupada in the purport explains the brief history of Janamejaya. Janamejaya was the eldest son of Parikshit. Parikshit begot four sons headed by Janamejaya. So Janamejaya's brief history is given by Srila Prabhupada. He says, one of the Rajarshi kings and the famous son of Maharaj Parikshit, Janamejaya, is a Rajarshi, a saintly king, Raja, Rishi. Both Raja and Rishi. That means he is a saintly king. His mother's name was Iravati. Janamejaya's mother's name was Iravati. Or according to some, Madravati.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Janamejaya's sons and his eventual succession to the throne, emphasizing the importance of qualified leadership and proper training of successors.

Maharaj Janamejaya begot two sons of the names Gnatanika and Shankukarna. He celebrated several sacrifices in the Kurukshetra pilgrimage site. This Janamejaya, later on it will be described that Maharaj Parikshit handed over charge of ruling the world to his eldest son Janamejaya. When Parikshit retired from his royal duties, when he was cursed to die within seven days by a snake bite. Those incidents will be described in the later chapters. So therefore it is described when Janamejaya took charge of ruling the world from his father Parikshit. He also got married and he begot two sons of the names Gnatanika and Shankukarna. These emperors or kings were very responsible in leaving behind a well trained, qualified successor. For the welfare of the world, for ruling the world properly, there is a need for a good Kshatriya, a qualified Kshatriya, a proper Kshatriya to rule the world for the welfare of the citizens. So these emperors, they themselves were very good rulers and they also begot good children, satsantana, by the proper process, by the proper methods, by following the proper instructions

**Key Quote:** "This Janamejaya, when he learnt about it, he wanted to take revenge against the snake which bit his father."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Janamejaya's performance of sacrifices at Kurukshetra and his subsequent attempt to avenge his father's death by performing the Sarpayagna to kill all snakes.

Then it is described here, Janamejaya celebrated several sacrifices in the Kurukshetra pilgrimage site. Kurukshetra is famous for being a holy place. Dharmakshetre Kurukshetre. The beginning of Bhagavad Gita, it is described, Kurukshetra is Dharmakshetra, holy place. A place where religious rituals are performed. It is a very sacred place. So, this Janamejaya, he performed several sacrifices in Kurukshetra. Why would they perform sacrifices? For the welfare of the citizens. They are really responsible kings. And it is also described here, Janamejaya had three younger brothers named Shrutasena, Ugrasena, and Bhimasena II. So he had three younger brothers also. He invaded Takshashila Rajanta and he decided to avenge the unlawful curse upon his great father, Maharaj Pariksit. Later on it will be described that is, Pariksit was cursed to die by snake bite. So this Janamejaya, when he learnt about it, he wanted to take revenge against the snake which bit his father. According to the curse. So what did he do to take revenge? This is Janamejaya. He performed a great sacrifice called Sarpayagna. To kill the race of serpents. He wanted to kill all the snakes. Because one serpent bit his father. Of course, his real anger was against Takshaka, one of the serpents. One of the serpents who bit his father. Because his father was cursed to die by snake bite. Particularly Takshaka's bite. So this Janamejaya arranged a Sarpayagna to be performed by qualified Brahmanas. And his aim was to kill the race of serpents, including Takshaka. Now on request from many influential demigods and sages, he had to change his decision to kill the race of serpents. That means, when he undertook this sacrifice, he was told by, advised by many influential devatas and sages and saintly persons, don't do this. Don't simply kill all the serpents. This is unfair. This is not proper. And then he actually agreed to stop the sacrifice when he was instructed or advised by many saintly persons and even devatas not to do this kind of sacrifice to kill all the serpents.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how Janamejaya was convinced to stop the Sarpayagna and how he compensated those involved, also mentioning the presence of Vyasadeva and the narration of the Kurukshetra battle.

But in spite of stopping the sacrifice, what did Janamejaya do? He satisfied everyone concerned in the sacrifice by rewarding them properly. He gave the proper Dakshina, even though the sacrifice was stopped. It was not conducted. But he did give the Dakshina to the sages, to the brahmanas who were appointed for performing the sacrifice. In this ceremony, Maharaj, sorry, Mahamuni Vyasadeva was also present in the sarpayagna, preparation for sarpayagna. And he personally narrated the history of the battle of Kurukshetra before King Janamejaya. So Vyasadeva, he is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord for the sake of preparing the scriptures, especially the scriptures for the people of Kali Yuga and the common people. So Mahamuni Vyasadeva was present in that sacrifice and he personally narrated the history of the battle of Kurukshetra to Janamejaya. How? Janamejaya's great grandfather, Pariksit's grandfather is Arjuna. So Janamejaya's great grandfather is Arjuna.

**Summary:** The speaker details the narration of the Mahabharata to Janamejaya, his desire to see his father again, and his generous offering of Dakshina to the brahmanas.

Later on, by the order of Vyasadeva, Vyasadeva's disciple, Narayana, narrated before King Janamejaya the subject matter of Mahabharata. Now the Bhagavad Gita is a small portion of Mahabharata. The Mahabharata is the history of greater India. It is a very, very big scripture. While Bhagavad Gita has 700 verses, Mahabharata has 100,000 verses or one lakh verses. Mahabharata has lakh shlokas. Bhagavatam has only 18,000 shlokas. Mahabharata has one lakh shlokas. So that Mahabharata was narrated to Janamejaya by Vaishampayana, Rishi, who was a disciple of Vyasadeva. On the instruction of Vyasadeva, he did so. So this Janamejaya was affected very much by the father's untimely death. And he expressed his desire to Vedavyasa, I want to see my father again. And Vyasadeva fulfilled his desire. So when his father was presented by Vyasadeva, that is Pariksit, then both Pariksit and Vyasadeva were worshipped. They were worshipped by Janamejaya. And being fully satisfied when he was able to see his father due to the mercy of Vyasadeva, then he very liberally gave Dakshina to all the brahmanas present at the sacrifice

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of charity, especially towards brahmanas, and the responsibilities of a king in providing for their welfare.

This is very important. A king's duty to give in charity to especially the brahmanas because brahmanas, they don't charge any fees. They don't collect any amount as their fees for giving advice or instructions or directing the people. But that doesn't mean that people simply take advice or instructions or directions without giving anything. They give something according to their means. Dakshina, that's called dana or dakshina. And the brahmanas are satisfied with very minimum. But kings, they reward brahmanas very liberally because kings are very rich. So that the brahmanas needn't have any anxiety about their maintenance. That's the principle. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "So different questions raised by Dharma are indicative of the different ways people suffer in Kali Yuga due to this age."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 20th verse of the 16th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining that it describes Dharma's lamentations to Mother Earth about the suffering in Kali Yuga.

In this session we will be discussing one verse, the 20th verse of the 16th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, but since the purport is a big one, we will discuss this verse in two different sessions. So, this session we will be discussing part one, the first half of the purport of this verse, as Prabhupada explains this elaborately, it is a very important verse. So, the 20th verse: Padair Nyunam Shochasi Maikapadam Atmanam Vavrushalair Bhokshamanam Aaho Suradeen Hruta Yajna Bhaagaan Praja Uthasvin Maghavatyavarshati. Further, here is a description of the conditions in this Kali Yuga of people in general, in various ways they suffer, in so many ways. Okay. So, the meaning of this 20th verse is as follows: Dharma is speaking to Mother Earth, Dharma in the form of a bull is speaking, addressing Mother Earth in the form of a cow. So, what is Dharma telling the cow? I have lost my three legs. If you have lost your six legs, you are now standing on one leg only. Are you lamenting for my state of existence? Or, are you in great anxiety because henceforward the unlawful meat eaters will exploit you? Or, are you in a sorry plight because the demigods are now bereft of their share of sacrificial offerings because no sacrifices are being performed at present, or are you grieving for living beings because of their sufferings?

**Key Quote:** "With the progress of the age of Kali, four things particularly namely the duration of life, mercy, the power of recollection and moral or religious principles will gradually diminish."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's purport is introduced, focusing on the diminishing qualities of life, mercy, memory, and morality in Kali Yuga, referencing the 12th canto of Srimad Bhagavatam.

In the purport Srila Prabhupada says, with the progress of the age of Kali, four things particularly, namely the duration of life, mercy, the power of recollection, and moral or religious principles will gradually diminish. Diminish means they will keep reducing. So the duration of life is reducing. This is already explained in the beginning of the Bhagavatam that Kali Yuga people's maximum duration of life is 100 years, about 100 years. Actually the Chastras say maximum duration of life in Kali Yuga is 120 years. That's how you hear sometimes in Japan somebody is living whose 107 years, 110 years. So the maximum duration of life in Kali Yuga is 120 years, which means that people in the earlier ages called Satya Yuga, Tretha Yuga, Dwapar Yuga, they used to live a longer life span. And that is described in the Bhagavatam. What is the life span of people in earlier ages? In Dwapar Yuga, people used to live an average of 1000 years. That is the duration of life. So 20 years is equivalent to 10 times more than that in Kali Yuga approximately. And previous to Dwapar Yuga and Tretha Yuga people used to live 10,000 years. Now you may not believe this. People may have difficulty in accepting this fact. Chastras are speaking facts, saint person facts. There is no exaggeration. There is no mythology. There is no fiction. These are all sent person facts, perfect knowledge is available accurately described in the scriptures and in Satya Yuga, the first in the cycle of four yugas, the best age on this earth planet, Satya Yuga millions of years back, the duration of human form of life was 100,000 years. What is 100,000 years? Come to 1 lakh years in our Indian system of counting, 1 lakh years, a 100,000. So as the deterioration sets in when time progresses then the duration of life reduces. In fact even in Kali Yuga the duration of life further reduces from 120 years maximum to 100 years, 80 years, 60 years, 40 years and towards the end of Kali Yuga people will live maximum of 20 years. This Kali Yuga will last 4 lakh 32,000 years. Specific calculation has given the bhagavata say 4 lakhs of years and towards the end of Kali Yuga the duration of life would have been reduced so much that if somebody is 20 years old he be considered a grand old man. This is the nature of Kali Yuga. So here the 12th canto specifically described proper is quoting from the 12th canto the bhagavata with a proses of the age of Kali 4th things keep on diminishing. What is that?

**Key Quote:** "People are losing that sense of compassion for the fellow human being"
**Summary:** The speaker illustrates the decline of compassion in Kali Yuga with the example of people's indifference to those in need, contrasting it with past behavior and highlighting increasing selfishness.

conditions and other things reduce, people become more hard-hearted, they become indifferent, they don't care. And we can see this even in our own lifetime, like just about 30 or 40, 50 years back if a person is on the street affected by some accident or something immediately a passerby would try to do something to help that person, but nowadays with the progress of the age of Kali we can see that most people are so very concerned about their own family, their own business, their own personal things that they won't even turn and look at others on the street when they are walking. You can particularly see this especially I've seen this in New York. New York people are so busy, busy, busy, busy that they are straight looking and keeping on walking with their own thing, they're not just even turning and seeing this side of that's it what's happening. So people are losing that sense of compassion for the fellow human being, that humanitarian quality. Fellow human being society means we concerned about fellow human beings not just about ourselves, we're not so selfish but that

**Key Quote:** "People are becoming more and more irreligious, immoral, immoral, irreligious."
**Summary:** The lecture continues discussing the diminishing power of recollection and moral/religious principles in Kali Yuga, emphasizing the rise of irreligion, immorality, and cruelty, especially towards cows and bulls.

selfishness increases in Kali Yuga and the third thing is power of recollection. Memory power, memory power reduces in Kalyug, that is also very obvious. We have got devices like mobile phone because of which we do not have to remember phone numbers, but you just speak to somebody who was not living in the, with the mobile phone. The elderly people in your house, you talk to them, they used to remember so many phone numbers. I used to remember phone numbers, so many phone numbers I used to remember. But now there is no need, besides that even the power of recollection is reduced. With these gadgets it has made our memory power less and less and less. And, this has got a particular significance why this being mentioned, memory power is reduced what way memory power we will discuss that and moral or religious principles also reduce, go on reducing with Kalyuga, progress of Kalyuga. People are becoming more and more irreligious, immoral. They go on hand-in-hand, morality and religious principles, they are not disconnected, please don't think they're disconnected. So people are becoming more religious and there hence more immoral, they don't hesitate the lies, they are more cruel, especially they are cruel towards innocent creatures like the cow and bull. This is one symptom of Kali Yuga, present age of Kali, they become more and more and more sinful, cruel, sinful means cruel, cruel towards the cow and bull. So therefore the indication of this reducing duration of life, reducing memory power, reducing moral values in society and compassion people have for fellow human beings or other creatures, this presentation of the therefore the indication of

**Summary:** The speaker explains the symbolism of Dharma standing on one leg, representing the loss of religious principles, and notes that three-fourths of the world's population is becoming irreligious at the beginning of Kali Yuga.

This is indicated by dharma standing on one leg, bull standing on one leg. Why? What is the indication? Dharma standing on one leg. Since dharma or the principles of religion would be lost in the proportion of three out of four, the symbolic bull was standing on one leg only. Why? The condition of the cow was described in the previous verse. The condition of the bull is being described. Dharma is addressing mother earth. Dharma in the form of a bull. The personality of religious principles is addressing mother earth in the form of a cow. And asking. Three-fourths of the population of the whole world becomes irreligious. That means the number of atheists, faithless people is increasing more and more as Kali Yuga progresses. So this is the beginning of Kali Yuga. Three-fourths of the population is irreligious.

**Key Quote:** "Chanting Hare Krishna is the best way of atoning for all sinful activities"
**Summary:** The speaker describes the extreme degradation expected towards the end of Kali Yuga, focusing on the widespread killing of cows and the severe karmic consequences, and emphasizes chanting Hare Krishna and avoiding sinful activities as a means of atonement and salvation.

but as Kali Yuga progresses towards the end of Kali Yuga the 12th canto describes most people will be living like animals, they will be living like animals, there will be no human values left, practically zero, almost zero. Of course it will never be zero but almost zero, very very very very few people who follow religious principles, who are kind, who have compassion, who are having some good memory power, who know what is the goal of life, who care for others, all this type of symptoms of human society will vanish as Kali Yuga progresses towards the end of Kali Yuga will be very bad situation. But even now we can see although it's not as bad as it can get towards the end of Kali even now for the animals particularly there is no protection, there is no one to voice their their grievances that millions of cows are killed every day simply for being eaten as beef in the United States of America particularly and in general in many other countries also it is being killed so many cows are being killed and cow killing is the greatest sin. The greatest punishment in hell for as many years as there are hair on the body of the cow. Cow killing is the greatest sin. Cow killing is the greatest sin commanding absolute most painful disease. The greatest punishment also has to rot in hell. Punishment is the greatest punishment in hell. Yamadutas will come and take us to hell if we have been very very sinful and we are not atoned for these sinful activities so chanting Hare Krishna is the best way of atoning for all sinful activities and of course stopping meat-eating, intoxication, gambling, illicit sex we can be saved.

**Key Quote:** "In the age of Kali, godless civilizations will create so many so-called religious societies in which the personality of godhead will be directly or indirectly defied."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the godless nature of Kali Yuga, explaining how people directly deny God or indirectly defy Krishna's authority by accepting bogus incarnations, giving the example of a man worshipping Hitler for material gain.

So, one by one we will discuss. In the purport which I have read already in the previous session, I will continue further. In the age of Kali, godless civilizations will create so many so-called religious societies in which the personality of godhead will be directly or indirectly defied. Basically, people are godless, but externally they want to make a show of religion. Some people openly say, "I am atheistic, I don't believe in God." But there are other godless people who actually are faithless when it comes to God, but they will profess to follow some so-called religion. "I don't believe Krishna is God. Then who do you think is God? Some bogus incarnation, I accept him as God." Because they want to deny or defy Krishna, Krishna's authority. And why will they accept somebody else as God? Because they are getting some sense gratification out of that person. Prabhupada gives a very nice example. In the Bhagavad Gita, in the 18th chapter it is mentioned, those in the mode of passion, they worship, and those in the mode of passion, human beings, who are actually bewildered by the material energy, influence of the material energy, illusory energy, they worship some powerful person as God. They don't worship real God. Krishna they won't worship, but they worship some powerful person as God. Now why is it, Prabhupada says, during the Second World War, which lasted about six years or so, there was one man in Calcutta, Prabhupada was living in Calcutta at that time. So one man in Calcutta, he was worshipping Hitler. Hitler was the chief of the government in Calcutta. Then, in 1939, he came to India. In that year, he worked there in Australia, Vietnam, Germany. So why was this person in Calcutta worshipping Hitler? What is the connection? Because, thanks to the world war due to Hitler, he amassed a lot of wealth in the black market, dealing in the black market. So he attributed this whole black market phenomenon due to the world war, and world war was a responsibility of the government. So, he dabbed a lot of effort in understanding of the black market and at that time of this work of secularism and Christianity. He was a very big supporter of the community of the Black Market. He often carbonoed, he was an afternoon expert, and was the chairman of the organization of the Black Market and the United Nations. In those days for many years, he was an violations dizerer and he lived in the same battle fields of military administration in the United States. the world war and world war who is responsible of course we can't say hitler is the only one responsible but there was some reason to be attributed world war to be attributed to hitler so this foolish person instead of worshipping krishna he is worshipping hitler

**Key Quote:** "They say there is God, but God is no form. God has no eyes, God has no hands, God has no legs, God has no ears, God has no hands, God is crippled, God is blind."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how people indirectly deny God by claiming God is impersonal and without form, which he equates to blasphemy and atheism.

So people will in Kali Yuga directly or indirectly deny God. Like some people, they directly say there is no God or there is no need to worship God or that there is, everyone is God. Different ways they deny God. So directly, those who deny, they say there is no God. Indirectly, how do they deny God? They say, "Yeah, there is God, but God is no form." See how they cleverly deny God in an indirect way. They say there is no God because externally or for the sake of making a show of being religious say, "Yeah, yeah, there is God, I believe in God." Who is God? If you ask this person, "Oh, God is something impersonal." Impersonal means, "I believe God has no form." That means God has no eyes. Do you mean to say God has no eyes means God is blind? And indirectly that's what they're telling. God has no eyes means what? God is blind. And they even have prayers like this, "Oh, you who have no eyes, oh, you who have no legs." This is the way they worship. They offer prayers to God. If you say somebody, a person, you say, "Oh, you have no eyes," that means what are you telling a person who has no eyes? What do you call him? Blind. Person who has no legs? Lame. Blind person who has no eyes, what do you call him? Blind. A person who has no ears? Deaf. So is this the way to pray to God? This is outright atheism and this is blasphemy of God. "You have no eyes, you have no ears." So this is another class of people. They say there is God, but God is no form. God has no eyes, God has no hands, God has no legs, God has no ears, God has no hands, God is crippled, God is blind.

**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that God does not have a material form but possesses a transcendental, spiritual form, explaining the meaning of 'Nirakar Brahman' as having no material form but possessing a transcendental one.

This is their God. This is actually not the truth. God certainly has got a very, very, very beautiful transcendental form, indestructible. That form cannot be destroyed, doesn't deteriorate, has no material limitations. God's form is spiritual, transcendental. So when the scriptures say, "God doesn't have a form," it is to be understood that God does not have a material form like I and you have. That's what the scriptures are describing. God as having no material form. Nirakar. Nirakar. Nirakar Brahman. Nirakar Brahman means Brahman who is completely transcendental, has no material eyes, has no material hands, but Brahman has got transcendental form, transcendental eyes, transcendental hands, transcendental legs, transcendental ears, transcendental body.

**Summary:** The speaker describes how godless civilizations create religious societies that blaspheme God and criticize genuine devotees, emphasizing the importance of a standard interpretation of scriptures like Bhagavad Gita, similar to the standard understanding of scientific laws.

So that is God, you see. So these godless civilizations, they create so many religious societies in which simply they will criticize the genuine devotees. They will blaspheme God, real God, create their own incarnation, bogus incarnation. "I believe so and so is God." What's your basis of believing? No standard scriptures are followed. No proper authority from whom the spiritual knowledge is received. Everyone interprets their own way, the Bhagavad Gita. So many translations of Bhagavad Gita. Why? Because each one wants to interpret, give his or her own interpretation. So this is blasphemy of God. This is godless civilization. Godless civilization. Only when it comes to understanding Bhagavad Gita, people will think, "Oh, each person can have his or her own understanding." Do you say that for a physics, book of physics, book of chemistry, book of science, will you say? "Oh, you can have your own interpretation. You can have your own understanding. You can have your own meaning. Newton's laws of physics." Will each person interpret Newton's laws in his or her own way in the physics field? No, no way. It is standard. Whichever university you go, whichever school you go, whichever college you go, whichever scholar you go, the scholar or the school or the college or the university cannot give their own definition of Newton's laws of motion in physics. Anywhere you go, it is the same. This is standard. Similarly, Bhagavad Gita, there is a standard. You cannot have your own interpretation

**Key Quote:** "Krishna says, I am the source of everything. Everything emanates from me."
**Summary:** The speaker criticizes those who misinterpret Bhagavad Gita, specifically denying Krishna's personal form and authority, highlighting Krishna's statement in BG 10.8 that He is the source of everything.

or somebody else cannot have their own interpretation. Krishna says, "I am the source of everything. Everything emanates from me." And the symptoms of one who is in knowledge of me is that they are engaged in pure devotional service to me, knowing me as the ultimate cause of all causes. Clearly, this is told in the Bhagavad Gita, 10th chapter, 8th verse, aham sarvasya prabhava. Who is speaking? Krishna is speaking. The Supreme Personality of God is speaking. Bhagavan. Vacha. Bhagavan is telling, Aham. I. Person is speaking. And person is telling, I. But one other translator, he is translating, "Oh, you should not worship the person Krishna. You should worship something inside Krishna." Where is it said and how is he understanding something else inside Krishna is there? As if Krishna's body is like our body? In our case, inside this body I am seated as spirit soul. You think Krishna also has got one material body and in that body Krishna has the spirit, Supreme Spirit is sitting there? No. Krishna doesn't have a material body. Never. Krishna's form is identical with Krishna's soul. In fact, the form of the soul only, spiritual form. Krishna appears in his original spiritual form. Ajop is an avyayatma. Avyayatma means his form never deteriorates. His form is transcendental. Janma karma cha me divyam. So clear in the Bhagavad Gita. But some people they interpret. Godless people. They interpret.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by describing how faithless societies in Kali Yuga make the world a hellish place for saintly persons, who are targeted and troubled by the godless.

Their own meaning they give. So, this is another symptom of the people in this Kali Yuga. Thus, faithless societies of men, what happens if people become faithless? They will make the world uninhabitable for the saner section of people. There are some sensible people who know who is real God and they live according to some moral principles. They follow some religious principles, genuine religious principles that we should not tell lies. We should not hurt others. We should not kill the innocent animals when you got plenty of supply of fruits and vegetables and grains. So there are saner people. Now for these saner people, the faithless, godless atheists make this world a hellish place. They make it very very difficult for saintly persons to stay. They unnecessarily target saintly persons and criticize them, harm them, deny their rights, become obstacle in their life like that. Unnecessarily give trouble. So, like this, the description is given in this Bhagavatam. So, we will discuss more in the next session. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam 1.16.20, discussing Dharma as a bull and Mother Earth as a cow, and the symptoms of Kali Yuga.

In this session, we will continue to discuss from the 20th verse of the 16th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. We already have discussed this verse in two previous sessions. So, this is part 3 of the same verse. The 3rd session will be discussing the remaining portion of the purport because it is a very big purport. Just to refresh your memory, this 20th verse: 'I have lost my three legs and I am now standing on one only. Are you lamenting for my state of existence? Or are you in great anxiety because henceforward the unlawful meat eaters will exploit you? Or are you in a sorry plight because the demigods are now bereft of their share of sacrificial life? Because no sacrifices are being performed at present? Or are you grieving for living beings because of their sufferings due to famine and drought?' These are the various questions raised by Dharma in the form of a bull to Mother Earth in the form of a cow. So, this is actually describing the symptoms of the Kali Yuga. Of course, Dharma in the form of a bull, the symbolic representation of Dharma in the form of a bull, and Mother Earth symbolically represented by the cow, form of a cow, shape of a cow. So, Srila Prabhupada describes these things in the purport.

**Key Quote:** "Real faith is completely based on perfect knowledge, is based on reality, is based on knowledge, is based on knowledge, is based on reality, is based on truth and facts."
**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between real faith and blind faith, emphasizing that real faith is based on knowledge and truth, using the example of knowing about China without having visited it.

There are gradations of human beings in terms of proportionate faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Actually, Bhakti means 100% firm faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And Bhakti means 100% firm faith in Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in real God. That is Bhakti. But this faith should not be mistaken to be something like blind faith, what they say blind faith. Now, what's the difference between real faith and blind faith? What's the difference? Is there a difference? Yes, there is a difference. What's the difference? Now, blind faith is not having the foundation of proper knowledge. Proper facts, is not having the foundation of reality. That's called blind faith. Now, real faith is completely based on perfect knowledge, is based on reality, is based on knowledge, is based on truth and facts. For example, if I have not seen, let us say, I have not seen China, I never been to China, I never seen China, the country called China. But then, my faith that there is a correct knowledge, there is another country called China, people are living there, and it is another country as much as our India, present day India is a country. It's one of the many countries in the world. And they have their own culture, they have their own kind of living conditions, they have their mountains, they have their plains, they have their lands, they have their rivers, they grow some different food items like we grow. So, this faith is not blind faith. Why? Because it is based on the solid foundation of knowledge, proper knowledge from authoritative sources have gathered this fact that there is another country called China, even though I have not seen it, I have not actually visited that place. I can visit if I want to, but I don't have to necessarily visit that place in order to actually know for certain and be 100% sure that there is a country called China. You understand? So this understanding and the firm faith is based on solid foundation of perfect knowledge. So I don't have any reason to doubt, though I have not seen the place called China, I have no reason to doubt that there is a place called China.

**Key Quote:** "We have to know about Krishna we have to hear from the perfect authority perfect source and that perfect source are the authentic scriptures like Srimad Bhagavatam Srimad Bhagavad Gita"
**Summary:** The speaker explains how to develop faith in Krishna through hearing from authorized scriptures and Acharyas, emphasizing that Krishna has a transcendental form not visible to material eyes.

Which is really existing. Similarly with God Krishna. Now a devotee of Krishna knows Krishna actually is real, is the real person, is the Supreme Lord. How does he know? How does he have that faith even though he may not have seen Krishna in the sense of seeing with these eyes a person that we know in this world? It's not like that. Seeing Krishna is not possible to see with these eyes because Krishna is not a person who has got a material form. Krishna has no material form. Krishna has only transcendental form, spiritual form. These eyes cannot see spiritual form. Therefore we have to know about Krishna, we have to hear from the perfect authority, perfect source and that perfect source are the authentic scriptures like Srimad Bhagavatam, Srimad Bhagavad Gita, the authorized devotees, the Acharyas, Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. All these are authorized perfectly perfect sources, authorized sources for hearing about Krishna, knowing about Krishna, establishing that firm faith simply by hearing Prabhupada and practicing Krishna consciousness. Of course the hearing leads to the practice, leads to a certain transformation of heart which is what establishes that firm faith. So try to understand the difference.

**Key Quote:** "Real faith has to be ascertained by perfect knowledge from the perfect source has to be ascertained by by a transformation of heart through a through the process of Bhakti"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts real faith (Shraddha) with sentimental belief systems, emphasizing the importance of perfect knowledge and transformation of heart through Bhakti.

Between Shraddha, which is a Sanskrit word for real faith, and ordinary belief systems. Material, there is something called I believe, I believe so and so is God, Tittaasakhyama, Durga is God. Somebody else will say no no I don't believe Durga is God I believe Ganesha is God. So this belief system is something of a sentiment, something of a feeling that is effective or it has an immediate meaning. We usually believe or act along the line of will whether it is personasope, helping or what's outside the organizations, as in the nature of the nature of God. And it is important to build one's heart with the correct mind and spirit. Within the heart is something of a benefit, a material benefit somebody might have got by believing, by doing something based on a belief but that is not the proper way of ascertaining the fact, the reality, the truth. Simply going by some belief which is a sentimental belief or going by a similar sentimental belief that another close friend of yours has or another family member has in whom you have got a good amount of faith or trust, whom you trust, who's trustworthy okay but it is not just that you see. It has to be real faith has to be ascertained by perfect knowledge from the perfect source, has to be ascertained by a transformation of heart through the process of Bhakti, the process of hearing chanting, process of following instructions to

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is not a new person to any of us previousitem number hard Realm knowledge within the heart which is already there see mind you Krishna is not a new person to any of us this questionnaire seated in ever heart"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna is not new to us and that the process of Krishna consciousness awakens the knowledge already within our hearts, leading to a permanent eradication of doubts through purification.

Awaken that real knowledge within the heart which is already there. See, Bhakti, the process of hearing chanting, process of following the instructions to remind you, Krishna is not a new person to any of us. This Krishna is seated in every heart. Krishna is seated in every heart, Intelligence every moment as we use the intelligence. Krishna is our eternal, we are eternally related to Krishna. As spirit soul we are eternal beings. Krishna as a supreme spirit is eternal lord and we have an eternal relationship. So, these are all facts, hard facts. These are cent percent truth. This is reality. Not because I am just saying it in a very very forceful way. No, it is actually based on shastra, authorized shastra. It is based on the acharyas. See Prabhupada travelled all over the world and preached and actually convinced and made people realize through the authentic process of Krishna consciousness. Anybody who practices Krishna consciousness by receiving that knowledge and the proper instructions from the proper source, they can become convinced, they can develop the firm faith. They can awaken their knowledge. Their heart can undergo transformation by which doubts are eradicated permanently. It is not that somebody has got doubt and somehow by some argument or logic or some kind of feeling their doubts are gone. But again something else happens by which again the doubt comes back. You see. Not that kind of eradication of doubt. Some temporary mitigation of the doubt. No. This change of heart by which doubts are eradicated is due to the purification of the heart by the authorized spiritual process. So therefore when Prabhupada says there are gradations of human beings in terms of proportionate faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, what he means is the real faith, the transcendental faith. That's the correct word. The transcendental faith, which is nothing to do with material sentiments, material beliefs, material knowledge, material experience, material relationships. Nothing to do with any of those. It is completely different.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the gradations of human beings in terms of faith within the Varnashrama system, emphasizing transcendental faith as distinct from material sentiments and beliefs.

So this is explained by Prabhupada here. As first class faithful men are the Vaishnavas and the Brahmanas, qualified ones. The second class faith are those qualified Kshatriyas. The third class faith are those for qualified Vaishyas. And the fourth class faith are the qualified Shudras. So this is the proportionate faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the gradations of human beings in the Varnashrama society. So I'll stop here. We'll continue this in the next section, next session. Thank you very much.

At the end of life when we have to quit this body, Yamadutas will come and take us to hell if we have been very very sinful and we are not atoned for these sinful activities. So chanting Hare Krishna is the best way of atoning for all sinful activities. And of course stopping meat eating, intoxication, gambling and illicit sex, we can be saved from going to hell. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "There is widespread sinful activities, particularly four kinds of sinful activities characterizing this Kali Yuga, meat eating, intoxication, gambling, illicit sex."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the degradation of human character in Kali Yuga due to the influence of sinful activities like meat-eating, intoxication, gambling, and illicit sex.

They two are completely different. As I mentioned earlier, the word Shraddha that is used, that's a beginning of Bhakti. Shraddha is the beginning of Bhakti, real faith in Krishna. That is a beginning of Bhakti. So till one actually has got that Shraddha, the real faith in Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no question of Bhakti at all. So what passes off as Bhakti or devotion is some sentiment, some blind faith, some belief system. Like sometimes people ask, do you believe in God? One person may ask another person. The other person may say, yeah, yeah, I believe in God. Somebody else may say, I don't believe in God. So this belief system is not what we are talking about here. When you say faith, this is different. This is completely, it is coming from the core of the heart. It's a transformation of the heart by purification through the authorized process of executing Bhakti, devotional service. So it is not just a mental state or it's not an intellectual exercise. It is actually a transformation of the heart by purification. Heart means here we are talking of consciousness, which is a symptom of the soul, conscious symptom of the soul. So let me continue the purport. The degradation of the human instinct begins from the mlechas and the Chandala state of life is the last word in human degradation. Why is Prabhupada telling this? He's telling in Kali Yuga, the human beings degrade, become degraded in their character, in their consciousness due to the evil influence of the age, the Kali Yuga. And what is the evil influence of Kali Yuga? There is widespread sinful activities, particularly four kinds of sinful activities characterizing this Kali Yuga: meat eating, intoxication, gambling, illicit sex. So these

**Summary:** The lecture explains how even those born into good families can be influenced by sinful activities and emphasizes that designations like Mlecha or Brahmana are based on qualifications, not birth.

four sinful activities are prominent in Kali Yuga. And it is, it is practiced, it is these sinful activities are very much prevalent among more and more people in Kali Yuga. Even though somebody may be born in a very, very comfortable state of consciousness, you can feel the presence of the soul, human being. Even though somebody may be born in a very, very cultured and very good family, by mixing with other people outside the family in the society who are sinful, who are breaking these four principles of no meat eating, no intoxication, one becomes influenced and a good person, a cultured person, a pious person becomes sinful. So that's what we are talking about degradation in this Kali Yuga. So Prabhupada says all the above terms mentioned in the Vedic literatures are never meant for any particular community or birth. When you say Mlecha, it's not because somebody is born in a particular family or belongs to a community that we call the person. Which I know, they are different qualifications of human beings in general. Any human being, what is this qualification? Based on that we say he's a brahmana, he's a chatriya, he's a mlecha, he's a yamana, based on qualifications. And if somebody practices bhakti, then their qualifications can change. Just like a child is born ignorant, but you send the child to school and the child gets trained in mathematics, then it becomes knowledgeable in mathematics. So it's no longer ignorant of mathematics. So ignorant person becomes a knowledgeable person by training, by education, by culture. Same way, a mlecha means a person who is not following, a mlecha who is following the Maekas, but they call such a religious, the Vedic principles, uncultured, uncivilized according to the Vedic standard, not having cleanliness, not having good habits, not, does not know how to show respect to elders. Such a person by training, by education, spiritual education, by association with transcendentalists can become completely a changed person, can become a nice devotee, can become a wise, no ma, can become a first-class human being, possible. So it's not that permanently somebody is labeled as malecha, Sudra, no, never. That is not the orderly medical system. That is the principle of a person. This is the principle of spiritual education,

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on how qualities, not birth, determine one's designation and how association with devotees and devotional service can transform a person, even from a low background, into a Vaishnava.

authorized Vedic tradition or Vedic culture. No. Nowadays, there is a tendency to label people like that. Somebody says, I am a Brahmin. How do you say you are a Brahmin? I was born in a Brahmin family. Or my forefathers were very nice, first class qualified Brahmin. That's fine. Your forefathers are first class qualified Brahmin because of which you have a good possibility of getting trained up in first class behavior, first class qualities. Yes. But unless you get trained and unless you actually exhibit those qualities, you are not a Brahmin. You cannot be called a Brahmin. So, that is what Prabhupada is telling. Never these designations as Brahmana, Chhatriya, Vaishya, Shudra, Mlecha, Yavana are never meant for any particular community or they are not to be, these designations are not to be given based on birth. They are based on qualifications. There is no question of birthright or community. No. That is not the way. One can acquire the respective number of birthrights by birthright. One can acquire the respective number of birthrights by qualification by one's own efforts and thus the son of a Vaishnava can become a Mleksha, born in a nice Vaishnava family but by bad association by not following the principles of Vaishnava conduct one becomes a Mleksha, or the son of a Chandala can become more than a Brahmana, can become first-class Vaishnava all in terms of their association and intimate

**Summary:** The lecture defines a Vaishnava and then distinguishes between Mlechas (unregulated meat-eaters) and those who regulate their meat-eating according to scriptural injunctions, explaining that the latter are not considered Mlechas.

relation with the Supreme Lord. Vaishnava means one who connects with Krishna through the process of bhakti, devotional service, bhakti yoga. And then when the connection is established by qualification, by practice, by association, by behavior, by culture, then even though a person by birth was not having any good qualities or any good behavior can become qualified, can exhibit all the good qualities by training, by culture, by association, develop that relationship and become a first-class Vaishnava. Next Prabhupada talks about the meat eaters. The meat eaters are generally called Mlechha's. Mlechha means meat eaters who are particular kind of meat eaters. Prabhupada says all meat eaters are not Mlechha's. Those who accept meat in terms of scriptural injunctions are not Mlechha's. In scripture there is a concession given to somebody who is very much habituated to eating meat. If they want to regulate their meat eating according to scriptural directions because they can't totally give up eating meat immediately when they come to know about the fact that meat eating is sinful activity because of which they have to suffer sinful reactions. So they don't want suffering, so they have to stop meat eating. But they can't immediately stop. They can regulate their meat eating according to scriptural injunctions.

**Key Quote:** "Those who want to regulate their meat eating so that they don't get very very ghastly sinful reactions. Severe suffering. No. They should avoid cow killing."
**Summary:** The speaker details the scriptural regulations for those who cannot immediately give up meat-eating, emphasizing the restriction to goat flesh, once a month, after sacrifice to Kali, and the absolute prohibition of beef due to the Vedic culture's protection of cows and bulls.

So in one place in the scriptures it is said meat eating is sinful. You should not eat meat. Avoid meat eating. Now that may not be possible for everyone on hearing such a scriptural direction or injunction. A person cannot immediately stop because of habit. So such a person who is habituated to meat eating but would like to gradually reduce and give up over a period of time. So then the scriptural injunctions are there that in a restricted way such a person can accept meat. What is that restriction? In this Kanda Purana it is said those who want to regulate their meat eating so that they don't get very, very ghastly sinful reactions, severe suffering. No. They should avoid cow killing. They should only take the flesh of a goat. Only one creature. Goat. Goat flesh. Not any animal flesh. Not any bird flesh. No. Only goat. And that also only one the way as say that goat attacks the goat. Once a month they can take this flesh. Once a month only on a mavasya. A mavasya occurs once in a month. Lunar month. And only by sacrificing a goat to Goddess Kali. Performing a sacrifice. Yajna. Yajna is the way of performing a sacrifice. Yajna. Yagya is the way of using money. Lifting up. Islam wish-doing, Yajna is the way of took freshner比如 So a cow that is going crazy with its father and said me에는 purifying our existence. So, that is the regulation to be followed. So, those who are following these regulations are called descriptional directions are not natures even if they are eating meat. So, those meat eaters who accept meat without any regulation or restriction are called natures. This is the accurate definition of who is a nature. Beef is forbidden in scriptures. Beef means the flesh of a cow and the bulls and cows are offered special protection by the followers

#### kali yuga, exploitation, suffering, designated food

**Key Quote:** "In this age of Kali people will exploit the body of the bull and the cow as they like and thus they will invite sufferings of various types."
**Summary:** The lecture discusses the exploitation of cows and bulls in Kali Yuga and the resulting suffering, contrasting it with the Vedic principle of cow protection, and then introduces the concept of designated food for different species.

of the Vedas. So, in the Vedic culture nobody, even meat eaters, never touch the flesh of a cow or a bull, never. So, on the other hand the cows and bulls are offered special protection. They are going to die. Natural death of course, but they never killed for the sake of eating the cow meat. No, never. In this age of Kali people will exploit the body of the bull and the cow as they like and thus they will invite sufferings of various types. See, this is the unfortunate situation Kali Yuga. They are ignorant. They don't care for any restrictions or regulations. They don't follow Shastra or they don't have proper guidance. So, they are going to die. They are having needs of animal Wars. They are hungry. They are going to die. But the necessarily eating the animal flesh is out of blood debate. So, they cannot searching out forerkind neuroimaging of the individual. Thank you they are very good but just to have proper guidance, they say it is my choice which kind of flesh I eat, eating is my choice. You like to eat vegetables, you eat vegetables. I like to eat them vegetables and some meat also or somebody else likes to eat fish. Somebody else likes to eat eggs. Astrology. So whatever one's choice one may eat, this is not correct understanding. There is consideration of what a person should eat. Every living being by arrangement, higher arrangement has got designated food. Just like a cow will never eat any flesh. A tiger will never eat grass. See that designated food for tiger is the flesh of certain animals. Designated food for cow is grass.

**Key Quote:** "If you have to eat meat there is restriction by which if you follow this restriction only goat flesh, only once a month, only after sacrificing the goat to Kali then that person is saved from grievous sinful reactions."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while humans have some freedom in choosing food, it is restricted to vegetables, fruits, grains, and dairy, and that if one must eat meat, it should be done according to strict regulations to avoid sinful reactions, which are often ignored in Kali Yuga, leading to suffering.

So this is by higher arrangement in nature. But among human beings there is no such thing. There is a certain freedom given that you may eat different kinds of edibles. But that is restricted to vegetables, fruits, grains, dahl, cow's milk like this. It is restricted to that for human beings. Designated food for human beings. Now if somebody thinks that I will eat what I like to eat or I will eat what is good for my health. Somebody may say for you vegetable may be okay, for me vegetable is not enough to be healthy, to develop good strength. I require to eat some non-vegetarian food. So that may be some consideration some people may have. But if you have to eat meat there is restriction by which if you follow this restriction only goat flesh, only once a month, only after sacrificing the goat to Kali. Only to Kali, not to any Devata, not to any, not to Krishna, not to Vishnu, no. And it must be sacrificed. There is a procedure for sacrificing according to Shastra. Then that person is saved from grievous sinful reactions. But in Kali Yuga people don't care. For all this restriction they don't bother. Therefore they invite sufferings of so many kind. So that is one unfortunate situation in Kali Yuga.

**Key Quote:** "What is the reason for all suffering in this material world is our sinful activities."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the degradation in Kali Yuga due to godlessness and faithlessness, emphasizing the importance of performing yajna to become free from sinful reactions.

In this session, we will continue to discuss from the 20th verse of the 16th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is the fifth part of the discussion on this verse from the purport. This is a very big purport. So we were discussing about the degradation in Kali Yuga due to people becoming godless and they become faithless. And they are unrestricted in meat eating and they don't follow the very principles because they think they are, they can't believe, or they are not superstitious, various reasons they get like that. So here, Prabhupada says that people in this age, they suffer in Kali Yuga because they don't perform any sacrifice, yajna. So, Prabhupada says the Mleccha population will care very little for performance sacrifices, although performance of sacrifice is essential for persons who are materially engaged in sense enjoyment. What is the reason for all suffering in this material world is our sinful activities. What are sinful activities? For the sake of satisfying my senses, I don't care for any restrictions or regulations or rules that are actually enforced in this material world. I don't care for them, or either I'm ignorant, or even if I have knowledge, I don't bother about it. So, therefore, those who are engaged in sense enjoyment, material sense enjoyment, which is majority of the population, they have to perform yajna in order to become free from sinful reactions.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that performing work as a sacrifice, as directed in scriptures, prevents one from being bound by sinful reactions and suffering.

So, in the Bhagavad Gita, it is said, if work is done as sacrifice, as it is directed in the authentic scriptures, then you don't become bound up by sinful reactions. You don't become bound up by reactions. Otherwise, those who don't perform yajna, but keep on doing yajna, you don't become bound up by sinful reactions. You don't become bound up by yajna. If a mortal body and one plant tries to stop their yajna, it needs to do something or another, or he should not do something involving it. So the eternal behavior, to be a material intention I am trying to send to you, the ultimate, to be the ultimate Thinking and religion is somewhere where he is doing some work for their different purposes. They become bound up more and more and more and more and get entangled to material existence and are forced to suffer against their wish. Suffering material reaction. It is forced on somebody who is not performing yajna. So, Bhagavad Gita says,

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of following scriptural injunctions and performing work as yajna to avoid suffering and sinful reactions, highlighting the Varnashrama system.

you want to avoid suffering, you want to get free from the future reactions, then now you stop all sinful activities, follow the injunctions of the scriptures, and perform work as yajna. So, Srila Prabhupada says that this world is created in such a way that for maintaining the living beings, there is the system of working according to one's guna and karma. Guna, karma, Varnashrama. Varnashrama is the way of classifying the civilized human beings into four social orders, and four spiritual orders. And thereby they do the appropriate kind of work for maintaining them off earning their livelihood. And, they also follow the restrictions of the scriptures in the work they do... what they eat, how they dress, how they interact with other fellow human beings and what is their ultimate goal, what should be their ultimate goal in life. Everything is directed, is regulated,

past. They don't accumulate any fresh reactions and they become purified. For example, we have to eat to survive, but eat only vegetarian food. That also, after preparing the vegetarian food, it has to be offered. Offered to Krishna as yajna, sacrifice. And then yajna shishta asinaha santaha. Devotees always offer food for sacrifice called naivedya. Offering to Krishna and then parting the remnants as prasadam, Krishna prasadam. So by eating Krishna prasadam, you are purified of the old reactions. And you don't get any fresh reactions. Rather you develop your bhakti. So this is the way of performing yajna in the matter of eating, worshipping Krishna and offering him foodstuff which we have cooked, only vegetarian foodstuff. And that also cooked without any contamination in a pure way, cooking in a pure way. So that is now a very important point.

**Key Quote:** "Proper rainfall is possible only by performance of yajna."
**Summary:** The speaker connects sacrifice to proper rainfall and food production, contrasting this with the practices of 'mlechas' who misuse resources by feeding grains to livestock and then slaughtering them.

It is said that there will be sufficient grains, agricultural produce, if there are proper rains. And proper rainfall is dependent on performing sacrifice. So if people perform sacrifice, there will be cause. It says parjanyad annasambhavaha in the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna says this. Parjanya means rain. Yajna bhavati parjanya. Rainfall, proper rainfall, not too much, not too little. Proper rainfall is possible only by performance of yajna. If people perform yajna, there will be proper rainfall. If there is proper rainfall, there will be proper production of grains, vegetables, fruits, etc. And then there will be plenty of grains. Food, all edibles for the human beings and the animals also. So the mlechas, they don't grow proper food grains. Or if they grow food grains, they use that to feed the livestock. They feed the cows. They feed the chickens. And then they slaughter them for their own food. They eat chicken flesh or cow flesh. Instead of growing some grains and vegetables and themselves eating and also leaving the remnants for the other creatures like chickens and cows, instead of that, they misuse

their superior position in society. The dumb animals, the innocent animals, they are killed unnecessarily. So this is the anomaly in Kalyuga. But people must know that there is severe sinful reactions for cow killing. For unnecessarily killing even a chicken, unnecessarily killing. When there is plenty of food grains, after all the same grains they are using to feed the livestock. Why don't you eat the grain? Instead of feeding the chicken or the cow and then killing that poor animal and then eating the flesh. Why do you do this? So therefore, by spiritual culture, by spiritual education by spiritual training a person can actually change his or her life and become peaceful become happy become free from sinful reaction become free from suffering and have a very bright future all that is

**Key Quote:** "Sacrifice means to please Vishnu and how to please Vishnu by practice of bhakti yoga"
**Summary:** The speaker advocates for Bhakti Yoga as the most feasible sacrifice in Kali Yuga, particularly chanting Hare Krishna, hearing the Bhagavatam, and offering vegetarian food to Krishna.

so sacrifice means to please Vishnu and how to please Vishnu by practice of bhakti yoga the most feasible type of sacrifice packet india the the sacrifice of chanting and hearing the holy name of krishna the sacrifice of worshipping Krishna, Deity of Krishna or picture of the Deity of Krishna. All these methods of practicing Bhakti are called different varieties of sacrifices performed in Bhakti Yoga. Shravanam, Kirtanam, Smaranam, Padasevanam, all these are sacrifices performed by Bhakti Yogis. When we chant Hare Krishna, we are performing sacrifice to Vishnu called the Kirtana sacrifice, Sankirtana sacrifice, Sankirtanayanya. When we hear the Bhagavatam, we are performing Shravanam sacrifice, Shravanam sacrifice, hearing. Hearing what? About Vishnu, about Vishnu's devotees, about Vishnu's glorious activities like that. So, this is the sacrifice that is most recommended. It is simple, it is effective, it is very very powerful. And easily performed by anyone, any human being without any previous qualification. Therefore, that is what is being recommended here by Prabhupada that Lord Chaitanya, he recommended only one type of Yagna, that is Sankirtanayanya, chanting Hare Krishna, hearing the Bhagavatam, offering nice vegetarian foodstuff to Krishna and partaking the remnants, Krishna Prasadam.

You can just say this in English or your own language. Better still, you pray to Krishna to accept the offering by chanting the Hare Krishna Mantra three times. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Three times you chant. And then leave that for five minutes in front of the picture or the deity of Krishna. And after five minutes, you take it out and you mix it with whatever you have cooked.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (1.16.21) which poses questions about the suffering in Kali Yuga, specifically concerning the plight of women, children, and the degradation of Brahmanas.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 21st verse of the 16th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The meaning of this verse is: are you feeling compunction for the unhappy women and children who are left forlorn by unscrupulous persons, or are you unhappy because the goddess of learning is being handled by brahmanas addicted to acts against the principles of religion, or are you sorry to see that the brahmanas have taken shelter of administrative powers?

**Key Quote:** "Are you feeling compunction? What is the meaning of compunction? Compunction means are you feeling sad or sorry for the unhappy women and children who are left forlorn."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the context of the verse, where Dharma, in the form of a bull, questions Mother Earth, in the form of a cow, about her sorrow for the suffering in Kali Yuga, focusing on the meaning of 'compunction' and the abandonment of women and children.

So this verse is a continuation of dharma questioning mother earth. Dharma in the shape of a bull is asking mother earth in the shape of a cow. Three more questions are raised here. All these are symptoms of suffering of the people in Kali Yuga. Mother earth is feeling for the people of this earth planet who are suffering in this Kali Yuga in different ways. So, dharma is questioning mother earth, "Are you feeling compunction?" What is the meaning of compunction? Compunction means, are you feeling sad or sorry for the unhappy women and children who are left forlorn? Forlorn means they are completely deserted.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the second question in the verse, concerning the degradation of Brahmanas who, despite possessing knowledge, fail to adhere to religious principles and thus cannot properly guide society.

Prabhupada will explain how this is happening in the purport, but I am just going through the verse itself. This is the first question. Then the next question being asked by dharma in the same verse, in these 21st verses, "Or are you unhappy because the goddess of learning is being handled by brahmanas addicted to acts against the principles of religion?" That means knowledge is in the hands of brahmanas. They learn and they disseminate that knowledge to the people in society. Now, these brahmanas, if they don't have the knowledge to follow the principles of religion, the dharmic principles, then they become disqualified as brahmanas. Then they are no longer able to properly either learn or properly disseminate or set a right example or teach people the right values, right principles. They are unable to do.

We don't have qualified brahmanas. We have teachers, but they are not qualified brahmanas. They don't follow principles. Then the third question is, "Or are you sorry to see that the brahmanas have taken shelter of administrative families that do not respect brahmanical culture?" These brahmanas, then knowledgeable or learned people, they work for the government, and they are not treated properly by the government. They are forced to commit sinful activities in spite of having knowledge because they are dependent for their livelihood upon the government's salary. So, they cannot say, "I won't do something" that they are asked to do. So, they will do it, even though they know it's wrong, it is bad, it is sinful, it is going to bring about a lot of misery, suffering for the people. Still, they cannot avoid, they cannot refuse, they cannot instruct the administrators that this is not correct, what you are doing. They cannot do that. So, this is a sorry plight of the people in this Kali Yuga due to the...

degradation or the bad, evil influence of Kali. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "In the age of Kali, the women and the children along with brahmanas and cows will be grossly neglected and left unprotected." This is Kali Yuga symptom. In the scriptures it is said very clearly, in a civilized society five categories of people deserve to be protected by the government and by the respective guardians, respective leaders, or respective protectors. The women had to be protected by men, especially in the young age by the father, a girl has to be protected in the middle age by her husband, and in old age by her son or another guardian family guardian. So this is the protection that shastras say must be given to women. What happens if they are not given protection? Then they are exploited by unscrupulous ruffians, rogues, and uncultured mlechas, yavanas, gundas, drunkards, meat-eaters, womanizers, woman hunters, prostitute hunters. Women are exploited, therefore women should be protected. But in the age of Kali there is no protection. Children definitely require protection. Children should be protected by the state government and children should also be protected by the parents. In case the parents, the child doesn't have parents because it's an orphan, parents died or separated from parents, then the state has to give protection to such children, orphans. So children require protection, again they will be exploited, they will be uncared for, there will not be proper upbringing, there will be no proper development of the child for a...

**Summary:** The speaker explains why Brahmanas and cows require special protection, highlighting the Brahmanas' role in spiritual education and the importance of cow's milk for physical and spiritual development.

good future etc. Now brahmanas, they require protection because they don't have time for earning their livelihoods. They are supposed to be busy with worshipping God and learning the scriptures and disseminating that knowledge in society free of charge to everyone else who is ignorant or who doesn't have the aptitude to learn this by the system of gurukula. So brahmanas have got a very irresponsible task and brahmanas they are not strong enough to defend themselves against any attack. They have to be protected by the Kshatriyas government. Government has to give protection, law and order situation has to be maintained by the government. So brahmanas specially require protection for the welfare of the entire society. Cows require special protection because cow is the only animal that gives the human society what is called as cow's milk, which is a miracle food which contains the aggregate of all nutritional values required for a human being. It's required for our subsistence, it's required for our development and growth and development of finer brain tissues to understand spiritual subject matter.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the lack of protection in Kali Yuga and illustrates the problem with examples of broken families and uncared-for women and children, especially in Western countries.

We discuss this many times earlier, so cow should be specially protected. So in Kali Yuga there is no proper protection for these four categories of persons. They'd be grossly neglected and they left unprotected in this age of Kali. Illicit connection with women will render many women and children uncared for. You can see this specially in the western countries in America. So many women, because somehow they get married or even if they are not married, they have their living partner. Then they have a child and the person who is supposed to be the father of the child that is born, he just walks out due to divorce or separation or broken family.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the dangers of women seeking independence outside of marriage, arguing that it makes them vulnerable to exploitation and that marriage provides necessary protection and guidance.

And one more problem in this Kali Yuga's present age is circumstantial. The women will try to become into the relationship independent of the protection of marriage. Sorry, independent protection of men through marriage. They want to be independent. This independent is dangerous for the woman. Why? Because then she is prone to be exploited by rogues, ruffians. As long as they are married and there is a proper family unit, where they are married, they are given proper protection, they are guided and they are cared for, women will be exploited.

**Key Quote:** "Very intelligent, very educated, very learned, but as far as morality is concerned, very, very poor, very bad."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the degraded state of Brahmanas in Kali Yuga, who may be highly educated but lack moral and religious principles, leading to a disconnect between intelligence and character.

The brahmanas, they are traditionally intelligent people who can pick up knowledge, who can learn, who can teach. But in Kali Yuga, they will acquire modern education, but as far as moral and religious principles are concerned, they don't care for that. They shall be most fallen in terms of following good moral principles. Very intelligent, very educated, very learned, but as far as morality is concerned, very, very poor, very bad. So, education and bad character don't go together, normally, but in Kali Yuga, they will run parallel. The person is very intelligent, very educated, very learned, but as for, don't ask what is his character, character is worst character, because they don't care to follow the principles, moral principles, religious principles, they don't care to follow.

**Summary:** The speaker criticizes secular administrators who disregard Vedic principles, leading to a flawed system of governance and a lack of protection for genuine Brahmanas and followers of Dharma, resulting in societal degradation.

And, what about the administrators? They call themselves secular. Because of it, they don't follow any of the eternal Vedic principles. So, they say we don't believe. And, they have their own so-called system of administration. They don't follow the standard authorities, Manusamhita, etc. So, they have some concocted system of governance. And, they will actually not give protection to the genuine brahmanas, to followers of real dharma, because of which, there will be so much of degradation in society, because people don't get proper guidance from a qualified brahmana, they become degraded. The innocent people, the common people become degraded. And, society will actually become very, very, very, very fallen.

So, these are some of the symptoms of the age of Kali, which are harmful to the general welfare of the human society. That's why this is being raised here. Dharma, personified in the form of a bull, to Mother Earth, personified in the form of a cow. So, this conversation is going to lead to some real enlightenment in understanding what is the necessity of dharma, what is the necessity of following the Vedic principles, absolute necessity for the well-being of the entire society.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 22nd verse of the 16th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, discussing the degraded condition of Kali Yuga and the bewilderment of administrators.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 22nd verse of the 16th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 22nd verse is as follows: Kim Chhatra Bandhun Kalinopa Srishtan Rashtrani Vaatair Avaropitani Itas Tato Vasana Pana Vasaha Snana Javayon Mukha Jeevalokam. The meaning of this verse is: The so-called administrators are now bewildered by the influence of this age of Kali, and thus they have put all state affairs into disorder. Are you now lamenting this disorder? Now the general populace does not follow the rules and regulations for eating, sleeping, drinking, mating, etc., and they are inclined to perform such any business whether they are staying in their inner community that they have been advised by God how to behave in this global and they have too much to stay in them to live anyway. How can one save himself? How to take care of one's life, every life in the world? Cow because mother earth was very much agreed and dharma is trying to find the cause for her grief, her condition. So different questions are being raised which are basically indicative of the

**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the influence of Kali Yuga, highlighting the prominence of irreligion and the resulting disorder in state affairs due to irreligious administrators.

degraded condition of the Kali Yuga, the present age. So here the administrators are being particularly mentioned as biblical by the influence of this age of Kali. What are the influence of age of Kali? Adharma Bandhu. Kali is described as Adharma Bandhu, friend of irreligion. So irreligion becomes prominent. Same thing in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says, yada yadahi dharmasya gladi bhavati bharata dharmasya gladi means the religion is going down and down and down, people are not following religious principles, abhyutthanam adharmasya religion becomes very prominent and that is exactly what Kali does, makes irreligion very prominent. So the administrators, they don't follow religious principles, they themselves are religious and the people they have to administer are also irreligious, so all the State affairs are in disorder. There is no proper law and order situation prevailing, which was the, which was the law and order was much, much better in the earlier ages.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of rules and regulations in a civilized society, contrasting it with the unregulated behavior prevalent in Kali Yuga, comparing human and animal needs.

There were very strong administrators, the kings, and they had excellent administration. So things were very much well maintained. But now, due to the influence of Dejav Kali, there is disorder in the state affairs. And one more thing pointed out here is general populace, general people in general do not follow the rules and regulations for eating, sleeping, drinking, meeting, etc. Civilized society means there should be some regulation, otherwise people who are unregulated, they simply perform these activities anywhere and everywhere without any restriction, unrestrictedly they eat, they drink, and they create nuisance. So in general, there is no peace, there is no law and order, so Dharma is questioning mother earth, are you unhappy because of this? So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, there is some necessities of life on a par with those of lower animals and there is some necessity of life on a par with those of lower animals, common activities, but for humans and animals what are they? Eating, sleeping, fearing, and meeting, ahara nidra bhaya my tuna, these bodily demands are for both the human beings and the animals.

**Key Quote:** "The influence of the age of Kali is bewildering people that means they are overwhelmed by the prospect of becoming irreligious not following the the rules and regulations given in the scriptures."
**Summary:** This segment focuses on the code of conduct for human beings, the bewildering influence of Kali Yuga, and the resulting moral decline as people disregard scriptural rules and regulations.

We require to eat as much as the animals have to eat to maintain themselves, sleeping is required, but the human being has to fulfill such desires, not only to fulfill such desires, but also to fulfill the position they have on them and the human human desire to act or be considered a public nuisance and to personally criminally prosecuted. So human beings, there is the code of conduct. 601 Singapore immigrants have not been lied to as the iwo Hong Delta human equal. There is a code of conduct, civilized society of education, civilized society of education, civil behavior, they cannot openly engage in sex. So proper says therefore for the human being there are some rules and regulations even for fulfilling common demands. The human society avoid such rules and regulations when it is bewildered by the influence of the age of Kali. The influence of the age of Kali is bewildering people, that means they are overwhelmed by the prospect of becoming irreligious, not following the the rules and regulations given in the scriptures are traditionally being followed that they do not do so. Sheila proper says in this age, the age of Kali, people are indulging in such necessities of life without following the rules and regulations. They don't want to follow the rules and regulations, they are unrestricted in doing these activities and this deterioration of social and moral rules is certainly lamentable.

**Summary:** The speaker laments the gradual social decline, even in India, and emphasizes the challenges faced by parents in raising children amidst bad influences in the age of Kali.

It is a very sorry or sad state of affairs the present age. Of course, we are seeing a gradual decline. It's not so bad in our country as it is in the Western countries, it's much worse condition. But even in India where the very culture is still prominent, still there are people who are in a small number, a minority of the section of the human population here are not so much strict in following the rules, traditional rules and regulations in their social and moral behavior. They are not so strict in following the rules because of the harmful effects such beastly behavior. Proper is a strong words, they are behaving like animals, their behavior is not up to the mark, not up to the standard of a human being, a civilized human being. And particularly proper says in this age the fathers and the guardians are not happy with the behavior of their wards. The children have become disobedient to the parents or to the elders, they don't know how to respect the elders and the children also are misguided by bad advertisement by too much of freedom to do whatever they like to do without any restriction without any curtailment of their so-called freedom. So proper says here particularly the parents should know that so many innocent children are victims of bad association awarded by the influence of

**Key Quote:** "Even though the house household atmosphere may be good because parents are very cultured they their upbringing is very good and the child is very small but once the child starts going to school it is exposed to so many bad things outside the house."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Ajamila, illustrating how a single instance of bad association can lead to moral corruption, even for someone from a cultured background.

this age of Kali. Even though the house household atmosphere may be good because parents are very cultured, they their upbringing is very good and the child is very small, but once the child starts going to school it is exposed to so many bad things outside the house. Outside the house there's so much exposure to the wrong things, bad things, bad behavior. Now from the Srimad Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada says we know from Srimad Bhagavatam that a Jamila, an innocent son of a Brahmana was walking down a road and he saw a Sudra pair sexually embracing. If you're not familiar with this, it is described in the sixth canto of the Bhagavatam, this a Jamila story. This is something that happened very, very, very long back in a bygone age and a Jamila was the son of a Brahmana and he was well behaved, very, very cultured. He had gone to pick pick some flowers from the forest just outside the village and on the way when back when returning to his village after picking flowers, he happened to see a low-class pair of man and woman sexually embracing each other and this disturbed his mind very much disturbed his mind. So it said here this attracted the boy and later on the boy became a victim of all debaucheries, all kinds of bad habits. He got attracted to that it was a prostitute who was entertaining one customer, but this Brahmana is nothing to do with prostitutes and all such low-class behavior, but somehow he happened to glance and lusty desires awakened in his heart and he became very mischievous and even then he got attracted to these women with this man. I have she let me tell you something he didn't get a chance to know and at first I thought this was a very nice one, but this was a very nice man, he actually saw him as an important man and the man he was attracted to and he was tormented by that desire to enjoy like that low-class man was enjoying with the prostitute. He also developed a strong desire, lusty desire to enjoy and he later on he sought out that prostitute, brought her home, deserted his wife and elderly parents, chaste wife, he sent her away and he started enjoying with a prostitute. So from a pure brahmana he fell down to the position of a wretched urchin. It was all due to bad association just because he happened to see a prostitute embracing a low-class person.

**Summary:** The lecture concludes by reiterating the pervasive influence of Kali Yuga, leading to social problems and challenges, particularly for those trying to maintain a cultured upbringing.

So Sushila Prabhupada comments there was but one victim like a Jamila in those days, but in this age of Kali the poor innocent students are daily victims of cinemas which attract men only for sex indulgence. What they show in cinemas is not very much commendable, it's not very good, it has a very adverse impact. So therefore by the influence of the age of kali everywhere politically, socially, religiously everything is topsy-turvy. Therefore for the same person it is all regrettable, it's a very serious problem for sober people, behaved cultured people, it's a big challenge that the atmosphere is presenting for their upbringing of their children in a proper way. It's a it's quite a difficult thing.

#### Krishna's presence, burden of the earth, transcendental activities, grief

**Key Quote:** "So, one more reason for Mother Earth to be aggrieved, feeling that grief is because the Kali Yuga began after Krishna's disappearance, after Krishna wound up His pastimes on the earth."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains the 23rd verse of the 16th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on the earth's grief after Krishna's departure and the beginning of Kali Yuga.

In this session, we will be discussing from two verses, the 23rd and the 24th verses of the 16th chapter of the Shri Advaitha Gadadhara. This is the 16th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. The 23rd verse first: Yadva Amba Te Bhuri Bharaavatara Krataavatarasya Hare Dharitri Antarhitasya Smarati Vishrishta Karmaani Nirvana Vilambitani. The meaning of this 23rd verse is, "O Mother Earth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Hari incarnated Himself as Lord Shri Krishna just to unload Your heavy burden. All His activities here are transcendental and they cement the path of liberation. You are now bereft of His presence. You are probably now thinking of those activities and feeling sorry in their absence." So, one more reason for Mother Earth to be aggrieved, feeling that grief, is because the Kali Yuga began after Krishna's disappearance, after Krishna wound up His pastimes on the earth. So, as long as Krishna was present, there was no possibility of any evil influence of any sort. And not only that, the Supreme Lord Himself incarnated to reduce the burden of the earth, which was overburdened by demoniac persons posing as kings. And as long as Krishna was present, His activities were all completely transcendental. And because of that, there was no possibility of any bad influence. So, in the absence of Krishna, those transcendental activities are not there anymore. And maybe Dharma is asking Mother Earth, maybe you are feeling sorry in the absence of Krishna and His transcendental activities.

**Key Quote:** "In fact, those seriously practicing pure devotional service are not at all interested in liberation, are not interested in any of the four Purusharthas, not interested in dharma, artha, kama, moksha."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing that pure devotional service is far more relishable than liberation, making devotees disinterested in the four Purusharthas.

So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, nirvana vilambitani. That is explained specially by Srila Prabhupada in the purport. What does it mean? In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The activities of the Lord include liberation, but they are more relishable than the pleasure derived from nirvana or liberation." This is a very important point. In bhakti, liberation is a secondary benefit or a secondary result of practicing Bhakti. In fact, those seriously practicing pure devotional service are not at all interested in liberation, are not interested in any of the four Purusharthas, not interested in dharma, artha, kama, moksha. Why? Because the activities of the Lord, which are the essence of all activities of Bhakti, they are more relishable than the pleasure derived from liberation. Millions and billions of times more relishable. The description is given in the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, Nectar of Devotion, this book, written by Srila Rupa Goswami, describing the characteristics of pure devotional service. Srila Rupa Goswami says, quoting authentic Vedic references, he says, "The pleasure derived from liberation is so very insignificant as compared to the pleasure derived from pure devotional service, that even one drop of pleasure of pure devotional service cannot be compared with an ocean of pleasure that may be derived from liberation. The two cannot be compared at all." That means, the pleasure derived from pure devotional service is billions upon billions of times greater than the pleasure of liberation. So therefore, devotees who are seriously practicing in knowledge the system of pure devotional service, they are not at all interested in liberation.

**Key Quote:** "Simply by remembering such activities of the Lord, one can defy the pleasure derived from nirvana and reach the transcendental abode of the Lord to associate with Him and eternally engage in His blissful loving service."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the term 'nirvana vilambitani' and how devotional service minimizes the value of liberation, leading to eternal service in Krishnaloka.

So, according to Srila Jeeva Goswami and Vishwanath Chakraborty, two previous acharyas, the word used here is nirvana vilambitani. What's the meaning of this? These two terms? That which minimizes the value of liberation. Pure devotional service is such that it minimizes the value of liberation. It makes it insignificant. To attain nirvana, liberation, one has to undergo a severe type of tapasya or austerity. But the Lord is so great, so merciful, that He incarnates to diminish the burden of the earth. Krishna comes down, He definitely removes the burden of the earth. Simply by remembering such activities of the Lord, one can defy the pleasure derived from nirvana and reach the transcendental abode of the Lord to associate with Him and eternally engage in His blissful loving service. So Krishna comes to attract us by His activities. And if we become attracted, we straight go to Krishnaloka, after quoting this body, and there we are eternally engaged in the wonderful loving service of Krishna, which is many, many, many billions of times more relishable than the pleasure derived from nirvana.

**Key Quote:** "Kala deteriorates everything that is created in the material world. That's a fact."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains the 24th verse, discussing the deteriorated condition of the earth after Krishna's departure due to the influence of time (kala).

The 24th verse: idam mamachakshva tavadhi moolam vasundhare yena vikarshitasi kalena vate balinam baliyasa surarchitam kim hrutam amba saubhagam. The meaning of this verse is, "Mother, you are the reservoir of all riches. Please inform me of the root cause of your tribulations by which you have been reduced to such a weak state. I think that the powerful influence of time which conquers the most powerful might have forcibly taken away all your fortune which is adored even by the demigods." So dharma is making a reference to the condition of the earth when Krishna was present here, and the present condition of the earth after Krishna's disappearance. So there is a big difference between the two. So why has the earth been reduced to such a weak state after the disappearance of Krishna? So it is mentioned here in the verse itself, "the powerful influence of time which conquers the most powerful." Kala. Kala deteriorates everything that is created in the material world. That's a fact.

**Key Quote:** "The problem with material existence is people think they are independent. While the truth is we are entirely dependent on the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of recognizing our dependence on Krishna, contrasting it with the illusion of independence in material existence.

Including our own body and all the other things in the surrounding atmosphere. They go on gradually reducing in strength, reducing in potency, reducing in their vitality. So it goes on reducing, reducing, reducing, reducing, reducing. So that is very much experienced by us now. So Srila Prabhupada says, "By the grace of the Lord, each and every planet is created fully equipped." Earth is fully equipped for maintenance of the inhabitants of this earth planet. But when the Lord comes, Krishna comes to this earth planet, the earth becomes enriched with so many different opulences that even the devatas who have much better conditions of living in the heaven as compared to earth, they become impressed by the extraordinary opulence on this earth planet. So Srila Prabhupada says, "We should always remember that by the will of the Lord, the whole earth can at once be changed." Either the earth is lacking resources, then by Krishna's will, earth can become enriched to a great extent. Or if earth is having lot of opulences, then by the will of the Lord, all those opulences can be lost in a fraction of a moment. So Srila Prabhupada says, "Therefore no one should consider himself to be self-sufficient or independent of the Lord." The problem with material existence is people think they are independent. While the truth is we are entirely dependent on the Supreme Lord. In all conditions of existence, in the spiritual world, in the material world, in the liberated state, in the conditioned state, any condition, we are completely dependent on the Lord. Fully dependent. And the Lord being the actual maintainer, protector, guardian, well-wisher of everyone, He happily maintains us. He doesn't have to exert himself, He is full of all opulences. So He does maintain us. But if we foolishly think why should I depend on Krishna? I want to be independent. This is exactly the mentality of people in this world, in this material world. That they somehow mistakenly think that they can be independent and they turn their face away from the Supreme Lord in the spiritual world.

**Key Quote:** "This material nature is completely controlled by Krishna under His superintendence everything is working, everything is happening."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that material nature is controlled by Krishna and that the illusion of independence leads to suffering, ending with a thank you and Hare Krishna.

They are placed in the material world. And in the material world the laws work by which they don't get everything they really need very freely. They have to work and they have to get their needs according to the work they do and according to what they deserve and desire. Both are considered. And foolishly people think that this material nature is meant for our exploitation or can be brought under our control. No. From the Bhagavad Gita we get the information, the knowledge: mayādhyakṣeṇa-prakṛteḥ sūyateśa-carācaram. This material nature is completely controlled by Krishna, under His superintendence everything is working, everything is happening. He's got many agents to maintain everything. He doesn't have to exert himself. He directs. So, material nature is not independent. This earth planet is not independent. The conditions on this earth planet are not simply because of some human endeavor or effort. No. So, it is completely dependent on the Lord. So, nobody should think I am self-sufficient. I am independent. Nobody should think like that, because that's the truth. That's the reality. If they somehow think like that and live like that then under illusion they will actually have to suffer so many bad consequences of such a wrong thinking that I am independent. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "The principles of religion are laid down by the Lord himself"
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, discussing the origin of religious principles from the Lord, the role of Yama Raja, and the full implementation of Dharma in Satya Yuga.

Mother Earth to Dharma. So Srila Prabhupada comments on this, he says in the purport, "The principles of religion are laid down by the Lord himself, Dharmaṃ tu sākṣād bhagavat pranītam and the executor of such laws is Dharma Rāja or Yama Rāja." Yama is a very powerful Devata. He is responsible for enforcing the laws of Dharma given by God. Such principles work fully in the age of Satya Yuga. There are four cycles of four ages that rotate like calendar months. So the first Yuga is called Satya Yuga and then Treta Yuga and then Dvapar Yuga and then Kala Yuga and after Kala Yuga again Satya Yuga begins.

**Key Quote:** "Kali Yuga is the lowest of the four yugas but in Kali Yuga the religious principles are reduced to one-fourth means seventy-five percent is lost"
**Summary:** The speaker describes the cyclical decline of Dharma through the four Yugas (Satya, Treta, Dvapara, and Kali), highlighting the increasing influence of irreligion and the eventual devastation at the end of Kali Yuga when religious principles are practically nonexistent.

So in Satya Yuga, the first of the four ages, the principles of Dharma are fully followed by the people in general, this earth planet. In the Treta Yuga they are reduced by a fraction of one-fourth. That means by the time Treta Yuga starts, Satya Yuga is over. Then the irreligion creeps in to the society and one-fourth of the religious principles are lost. In the Dwapar Yuga, the third Yuga, they are reduced to one-half. Irreligion has increased and religion keeps on decreasing. So irreligion has become half and religion is only the other half. And in Kali Yuga they are reduced to one-fourth, gradually diminishing to the zero point and then devastation takes place. So Kali Yuga is the lowest of the four yugas, but in Kali Yuga the religious principles are reduced to one-fourth, means seventy-five percent is lost and this twenty-five percent also it will go on reducing, reducing, reducing as Kali Yuga progresses and towards the end of Kali Yuga devastation takes place because all the religious principles have been reduced to zero, practically nobody follows anything, so that is when there

#### Qualities of the Lord, Truthfulness, Cleanliness, Tolerance, Knowledge, Leadership, Beauty, Eternity, Krishna

**Key Quote:** "In him reside means the supreme lord 40 qualities will be mentioned now by mother earth"
**Summary:** The speaker lists 40 qualities of the Supreme Lord as described by Mother Earth, emphasizing that these are just a few of the Lord's innumerable transcendental qualities and that Krishna has closed his transcendental pastimes on the face of the earth.

These are the five verses and the translation of this verse as given by Prabhupada in the Bhagavatam, "In him reside," means the Supreme Lord, 40 qualities will be mentioned now by mother earth, 40 qualities, 4-0. What are those 40 qualities? She mentions here: truthfulness, cleanliness, intolerance of another's happiness, the power to control anger, self-satisfaction, straightforwardness, steadiness of mind, control of the sense organs, responsibility, equality, tolerance, equanimity, faithfulness, knowledge, absence of sense enjoyment, leadership, chivalry, influence, the power to make everything possible, the discharge of proper duty, complete independence, dexterity, fullness of all beauty, serenity, kind-heartedness, ingenuity, gentility, magnanimity, determination, perfection in all knowledge, proper execution, possession of all objects of enjoyment, joyfulness, immovability, fidelity, fame, worship, pridelessness, being as the personality of Godhead and 40th one, eternity. And these 40 qualities are not the only qualities that are to be found in the Lord. Earth and many other transcendental qualities which are eternally present and never to be separated from him. Another place Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur says, samastha guna gana dhama, the Supreme Lord is the reservoir of all good qualities, samastha guna gana and they are innumerable, we cannot count them. So it is said here, the personality, that personality of Godhead, the reservoir of all goodness and beauty, Lord Shri Krishna has now closed his transcendental pastimes on the face of the earth. This is a fact, as long as Krishna was present there were wonderful pastimes going on always, but moment Krishna left this earth planet for returning to his personal abode and since then the influence of the age of Kali is spreading everywhere and therefore mother earth is saying, "I am sorry to see this condition of existence on the earth planet after the Lord has left for his personal abode."

#### Qualities of the Lord, Unlimited Qualities, Anantadeva, Shastra, Acharyas

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The lord is the reservoir of all good qualities and his unlimited good qualities to an unlimited extent"
**Summary:** The speaker prepares to discuss the qualities of the Lord further, referencing Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the Lord's unlimited and wonderful qualities, and the attempt by Anantadeva to enumerate them, emphasizing the importance of accepting knowledge from the shastras and acharyas.

So we will discuss these qualities. Before discussing the qualities we will hear what Prabhupada says about the qualities of the Supreme Lord. Supreme Lord is full of wonderful qualities, unlimited qualities he has got and all are wonderful qualities, very nice qualities and we as living beings we possess some of those qualities in a very, very, very, very tiny quantity. Krishna has unlimited qualities and he has to an unlimited degree. So we will hear Prabhupada's explanation of what it means, unlimited degree he has got unlimited qualities. We will understand first of all Prabhupada says in the purport, "Even if it were possible to count the atoms after smashing the earth into powder still it would not be possible to estimate the unfathomable transcendental qualities of the earth." What are the transcendental qualities of the Lord? Lord has so many wonderful qualities that even a scientist if he could count the number of atoms after smashing the earth into powder, the earth planet, humans planet, still he could not estimate the number of wonderful qualities present in the Supreme Lord. And Prabhupada says that Lord Anantadeva, one of the expansions of the Lord has tried to enumerate these transcendental qualities of the Supreme Lord with his numberless tongues. He has millions of faces and in each face he has one tongue. So with his numberless tongues he is trying to describe the unlimited qualities of the Supreme Lord but it has not been possible for him to estimate all the qualities of the Lord even though he is going on describing the qualities of the transcendental qualities of the Lord with his numberless tongues, he is not able to exhaust it. So therefore we should accept from the shastra and from the acharyas that the Lord is the reservoir of all good qualities and his unlimited good qualities to an unlimited extent and we will understand this further more in the next few sessions. So I will stop here, thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of the Lord's unlimited good qualities, mentioning that 40 of these qualities are listed in the verses being discussed, contrasting them with the lack of such qualities in Kali Yuga.

This is part 2 of the description of these verses. Now we heard how the Supreme Lord is full of wonderful qualities, of which some 40 qualities have been listed by Mother Earth when she was questioned as to the cause for her grief in this Kali Yuga. So people in general lack these good qualities in Kali Yuga, whereas the Supreme Lord and Mother Earth, they always are having good qualities. So here the description is given by Srila Prabhupada in the purport that nobody can estimate how many good qualities the Lord has. So in these verses, 5 verses, 40 of the unlimited number of qualities the Lord has are being enumerated.

#### prowess of Vishnu, Trivikrama, Vamandeva

**Verse References:** SB 2.7.40
**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Who can describe completely the prowess of Vishnu?"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the immeasurable nature of Vishnu's prowess, using the example of Trivikrama's expansion to cover the universe and pierce its coverings, allowing the water from the causal ocean to enter this world.

We will try to discuss some of them. So before that, it is described in another place in the Bhagavatam. It says in the 40th verse of the 7th chapter of the second canto of Bhagavatam, it is said, "Who can describe completely the prowess of Vishnu? Who can describe completely the prowess of Vishnu?" By asking this question, it is understood that nobody can describe completely the prowess of Vishnu. Even the scientist who might have counted the particles of the atoms of the universe cannot do so. Is it a small thing? For the scientist, the achievement is to have discovered the atom, the tiniest particle of matter. But even if a scientist can count by scientific advancement the particles of atoms in the whole universe, still such a scientist cannot actually estimate how many qualities the Supreme Lord has. Now an example is given here that only in his form as Trivikrama, the Supreme Lord, he moved his leg effortlessly beyond the topmost planet Satyaloka up to the neutral state of the three modes of material nature. The Lord as Vamandeva or Trivikrama, he tricked Bali Maharaj into giving him charity of three paces of land. And when he actually wanted to measure three paces of land, he said, "According to my measurement." So it was agreed that according to this small boy's measurement it will be awarded. But actually the boy started growing and growing and growing and growing, and he extended his leg, one of his legs, to pierce the coverings of the universe and touch the shell of the universe and make a hole there by which the water from the Causal ocean, the spiritual water, started coming to this world.

#### qualities of the Lord, truthfulness, cleanliness

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Cleanliness means not only external cleanliness, which all of us know, but also internal cleanliness."
**Summary:** The speaker begins to discuss the 40 qualities of the Lord mentioned in the verses, focusing on truthfulness and cleanliness, emphasizing the importance of both external and internal cleanliness, with internal cleanliness being achieved through chanting Hare Krishna.

So this is the prowess of Vishnu, one prowess of Vishnu being described here. So actually nobody can estimate how much, how many qualities, wonderful qualities Vishnu has got. And now these forty qualities mentioned here in these five verses, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, the qualities will be divided into many subheadings. So I'll just read the qualities, and then some of them are elaborated in the purport. We will discuss them in a little more detail. So these forty qualities that are listed here are to be found completely in the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna. The first quality is truthfulness, Satyam. Truthfulness is a virtue that is absolutely essential for everyone. Then only we can, we can be free from sinful reactions. Anybody who tells lies, they are punishable by the laws of God, which are always working. So one should not tell lies, one should tell the truth, and that is called truthfulness. People who follow this, this being truthful, this quality, they are respected in society, they are held in great esteem, like that, truthfulness. Second is cleanliness. Cleanliness means not only external cleanliness, which all of us know, we take a bath, we wash our clothes, we keep our surroundings clean, etc., not only that external cleanliness, but also internal cleanliness. This is very, very important. Internal cleanliness is cleanliness of the consciousness, and that is possible by the appropriate method of chanting Hare Krishna. We can cleanse the heart.

#### qualities of the Lord, intolerance of unhappiness, Daya

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Daya refers to not being able to tolerate another's unhappiness."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the third quality, 'Daya' or intolerance of another's unhappiness, explaining that it encompasses protection of surrendered souls and well-wishing for devotees, based on Srila Jiva Goswami's teachings.

By chanting Hare Krishna and by executing pure devotional service, our heart becomes cleansed. Otherwise the heart is filled with so many material contamination by our long association with this material nature from time immemorial. So the third quality described here is intolerance of another's unhappiness. See, very interesting. The Sanskrit for that third quality being mentioned in this list is Daya. Daya literally means, one of the meanings is kindness, but here specifically Daya refers to not able to tolerate another's unhappiness, intolerance of another's unhappiness. So about Daya, Daya refers to not able to tolerate another's unhappiness. So about this quality, Srila Prabhupada is telling in the purport, quoting Srila Jiva Goswami, one of the previous Acharyas. Srila Jiva Goswami says that this quality can be subdivided into two divisions, subdivisions. The first one is protection of the surrendered souls, and the second one is well wishes for the devotees. Protection of the surrendered souls and well wishes for the devotees are two subdivisions of the third quality called intolerance of another's unhappiness.

#### surrender, protection, well-wishing
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/ywd495Suhz4?t=595
**Verse References:** BG 18.66
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna says don't fear, don't worry about some sinful reactions from the past, I will free you from all those reactions, you simply surrender to me."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the Lord's intolerance of suffering, explaining that He protects surrendered souls from sinful reactions, referencing Krishna's assurance in the Bhagavad Gita to provide protection upon surrender.

The Lord cannot tolerate our suffering. We are unhappy because of so many sinful reactions that we have to undergo, suffering. And the Lord is not happy about it. So how does he exercise his intolerance? He protects the surrendered souls. He protects the surrendered souls because of which they don't suffer the reactions in his material world. And second is well wishes for the devotees. Krishna is the topmost well wisher of all the devotees. Actually Krishna is well wisher of every living being, but particularly devotees of single doubt, those who are surrendered to Krishna, those who are engaged in serving Krishna through devotion, they are particularly maintained by the Lord in such a way that the Lord acts as their topmost well wisher. So these two are indicative of the Lord's intolerance towards another's unhappiness. Now Srila Prabhupada explains, why is it said protection of the surrendered souls? Why not protect the unsurrendered souls also? Why not protect everybody? Why is the Lord selective about whom he protects? Prabhupada explains elaborately in the purport. Prabhupada says, to understand this, we have to remember in the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord states that he wants every soul to surrender unto him only, and he assures everyone that if one does so, Krishna will give protection from the reactions of all sins. Krishna says, "Don't fear. Don't worry about some sinful reactions from the past. I will free you from all those reactions. You simply surrender to me. You leave it to me. You surrender to me and leave it to me. I will take care. Take care means I will free you from all sinful reactions."

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Because they don't surrender and they want to be independent, Krishna does not interfere in their life and therefore they are not particularly protected by the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why the Lord specifically protects surrendered souls, noting that those who choose independence and do not surrender are not particularly protected, as Krishna does not interfere with their choices.

So he gives assurance. But there are people who are not surrendered to the Lord in this material world. In fact, majority of people are not surrendered. They don't want to surrender to Krishna, either because they think themselves independent, or they think God is another ordinary person of this world, or they think that they can compete with God. Even if he is powerful, they can compete with him. They think God's position as powerful personality, if at all they know something about God, is a relative position. Just like we see people around us, somebody is more powerful than us, somebody is less powerful than us. So they think like that. God may be another more powerful person than me, but I can eventually by working my way to become more powerful, I can become as powerful as God. I can become more powerful than him. So these are all some of the misconceptions because of which people don't surrender to Krishna, don't surrender to God. Then because they don't surrender and they want to be independent, Krishna does not interfere in their life, and therefore they are not particularly protected by the Lord.

#### general protection, laws of karma, devotee maintenance
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/ywd495Suhz4?t=844
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Devotees Krishna maintains completely perfectly in all respects, 100% maintenance, all desires are fulfilled."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the general protection provided to all living beings with the complete and perfect maintenance offered to devotees, highlighting that non-devotees are provided for according to the laws of karma, and concludes by announcing the topic for the next session.

Though in general Krishna protects everybody, that means what is this general protection of everyone, even the unsurrendered people? It is that Krishna only provides for them, for their maintenance, even in the material world, in the material world, in the spiritual world, everywhere Krishna is the only maintainer of everyone else. His maintenance is different of the devotees and non-devotees. Devotees Krishna maintains completely, perfectly, in all respects, 100% maintenance. All desires are fulfilled. They are completely blissful under shelter of Krishna directly. The living beings in the material world who are not surrendered to Krishna, they are provided for by the Lord according to certain laws of karma, laws of karma. Because why the laws of karma? Because they are not surrendered and they have a tendency to exploit others, to lord over others, to ill-treat others, like that. So they are not provided like the devotees are provided. So this difference exists, and we will discuss in the next session how this difference comes about. We will discuss in the next session. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker begins with invocations and introduces the topic of discussion: the 40 transcendental qualities of the Lord as described by Mother Earth in response to Dharma's questions, emphasizing the importance of understanding dharma and the Lord's qualities for those interested in Krishna Consciousness.

In this sense, we continue to discuss from the verses 25 to 30 from the 16th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam.

**Key Quote:** "Which means that the number of transcendental qualities of the Lord are unlimited, whereas the number of atoms in this universe is a finite number is not unlimited."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the unlimited nature of the Lord's transcendental qualities, contrasting it with the finite number of atoms in the universe, setting the stage for discussing some of these qualities.

So the discussion is very important because to understand, actually, what is dharma and to also understand the different transcendental qualities which are there in the Supreme Lord is very important for anyone interested in Krishna Consciousness. So Srila Prabhupada writes a very elaborate purport for these verses in the Srimad Bhagavatam. And we have already finished discussing in the past two sessions, part one and part two, some of the qualities described here, particularly the first point that Prabhupada makes in this purport to this set of verses. He says that it is not possible to count the number of transcendental qualities the Lord possesses. Even if one were to compare this number to the number of atoms one can obtain by smashing the entire universe into small particles of dust, still you cannot compare that number of atoms in the universe, total number of atoms, to the number of transcendental qualities possessed by the Lord, which means that the number of transcendental qualities of the Lord are unlimited, whereas the number of atoms in this universe is a finite number, is not unlimited.

#### Dharini's reply to Dharma, qualities of the Lord, spiritual nature

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So, since we are a very, very insignificant part of the Lord, we have some qualities of the Lord in a very, very minute quantity."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Mother Earth (Dharini) is replying to Dharma's questions about the Lord's qualities, highlighting that all good qualities are present in the Lord and that living beings possess minute quantities of these qualities due to being part of the Lord.

It is not unlimited. So therefore, some qualities are being mentioned here just for our understanding, still the number is not a small number. Forty qualities are mentioned here by Mother Earth while replying to Dharini, Dharini Vacha. That is the beginning of these words, Dharini Vacha. She is replying to the questions asked by Dharma. The previous set of verses before this, Dharma Vacha, that is the principle of, sorry, the personality of religious principles, Dharma, in the shape of a bull, is inquiring from Dharini, Mother Earth, in the shape of a cow. And Dharini is replying that in the Supreme Lord, there reside all good qualities which are to be found among different people in this world. So, since we are a very, very insignificant part of the Lord, we have some qualities of the Lord in a very, very minute quantity. So, we should remember, Lord is completely spiritual, we are also completely spiritual beings, but the Lord is unlimited personality and we are always limited. Unlimited transcendental qualities we have and he has those qualities to an unlimited extent.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So, he cares for every one of us and his compassion is so much that he personally comes to this world in the form of three Vishnus and incarnates as three Vishnus."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Krishna's unlimited compassion, explaining how He incarnates as three Vishnus and expands as Paramatma to reside in the heart of every living being, fulfilling their desires.

Just like the prayer we offer to Krishna, we say, Hey Krishna, Karuna, Sindho, you are an ocean of compassion. Now, comparison to the ocean means that he has got unlimited compassion. And what is the proof? That even though there are so many millions and billions and trillions of living entities who are almost completely forgetful of the Lord in this world, still the Lord out of compassion for each one of them, because they are insignificant. They are many and they are insignificant, but still, as far as Krishna is concerned, every living being, he says, is my part and parcel. Cannot be separated from me, Krishna says. So, he cares for every one of us and his compassion is so much that he personally comes to this world in the form of three Vishnus and incarnates as three Vishnus: the Mahavishnu, the Padmanabha Vishnu, and the maintainer Vishnu. Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, you would have heard these three names. So, that maintainer Vishnu, that maintainer Vishnu expands as Paramatma and enters the heart of every living being. Why? Why does he do so? In order to actually direct and satisfy the desires and give the intelligence and make the living entity, the Jeeva, in a particular body for the Jeeva to live in that body and to utilize this bodily functions, the Lord is facilitating as Paramatma. So, that is his kindness.

**Key Quote:** "Even though we are not meant to live in the material world, we are not meant to have material body, we are not meant for material enjoyment, we are not meant for that."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the nature of material desires and how they lead to suffering, contrasting them with the spiritual pleasure and existence that living beings are truly meant for, emphasizing the stubbornness with which people cling to material enjoyment despite its inherent miseries.

He fulfills the desires of the living being. Even though those desires are not really very conducive for the actual happiness of the living being, still, because we are very, very adamant, we are stubborn, we want to fulfilment of our material desires. Even though we are not meant to live in the material world, we are not meant to have material body, we are not meant for material enjoyment, we are not meant for that, because we are spirit soul. So, we are meant for spiritual pleasure, we are meant for spiritual existence, we are meant for spiritual body. We are meant for spiritual happiness, and that is wonderful. That is very, very nice. That is everlasting. But anyway, as long as we desire and we are stubborn, we desire material enjoyment and we are stubborn about it, we don't want to give up. Even though, in all the scriptures it is said, if you give up these material desires, then immediately you become free from so much of suffering. All the material desires are the cause of our suffering and the cause of our suffering and the cause of our material existence are the cause of so many problems and complications in our life. But still, if we are very stubborn, and we are about to give up all our catacombs, and we are about to give up our service, we must, we have to give up everything. That is, if I don't give up, they will come after me. If we don't give up the service, the service will not come after us. If we don't give up everything, the service will not come after us. That is the only way. So, we have to fear our universe, sitting next to the particular soul who has got that body, so he is actually fulfilling the desires.

**Key Quote:** "The tenth quality of equality the lord is equally kind to everyone."
**Summary:** The speaker transitions to discussing specific qualities of the Lord, focusing on the tenth quality: equality, explaining that the Lord is equally kind to everyone, like the sun distributing its rays without discrimination.

So that is proof of his compassion. So some of the qualities of the Lord are being analyzed by Srila Prabhupada in the purport based on the commentaries by the previous acharyas. So we already discussed about the third quality mentioned among the 40 qualities, intolerance of another's happiness. So this quality, it was explained in a previous session. I'll proceed next to the tenth quality of equality. The Lord is equally kind to everyone. What does it mean? The Lord has got this quality of equality. He is equally kind to everyone, as the sun is equal in distributing its rays over everyone. The sun is shining in the sky. Is there any discrimination on the part of the sun regarding who actually will get that sunshine?

**Key Quote:** "You just surrender to him and he will guarantee all protection. But unfortunate persons are unable to accept this proposition."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that surrendering to the Lord guarantees protection, but unfortunate individuals, influenced by bad association, are unable to accept this proposition and thus suffer material miseries.

No discrimination, but there are people who are unable to take advantage of the sunshine. Similarly, Prabhupada says the Lord says that surrendering unto him is the guarantee for all protection from him. He will give protection. You just surrender to him and he will guarantee all protection. But unfortunate persons are unable to accept this proposition. There are some people who won't surrender to the Lord. In the Bhagavad Gita in the seventh chapter it is described, there are four kinds of people who surrender to Krishna and there are four other kinds of people who don't surrender to Krishna. So the ones who don't surrender to Krishna, they don't get his personal protection. And therefore, because they don't have his personal protection, such people who don't surrender to Krishna suffer from all material miseries which are there in the material world. Material world means material existence means miseries. This is also explained in the Bhagavad Gita. This material world is described as Dukkhaalayam Ashashvatam, it's a temporary place filled with miseries, Dukkhaalayam. Dukkha means miseries, alayam means filled with, full of miseries and so many miseries. So even though the Lord is equally well-wishing to everyone, he does not say some people I will not give you protection. He doesn't say if you are a non-devotee, I will not give you protection, no he doesn't say that. Neither he acts in that way. But the unfortunate living being due to bad association only, it is bad association. Such a person due to bad association is unable to accept the Lord's instructions in toto.

**Key Quote:** "We have foolishly come to this material world desiring material enjoyment."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that the desire for material enjoyment leads to suffering in the material world, contrasting it with the pure happiness of the spiritual world, and emphasizing that surrender to God can free one from this suffering.

Means they don't completely accept and for this the Lord is never to be blamed. We have foolishly come to this material world desiring material enjoyment. There is no material enjoyment in the spiritual world and we as spiritual beings, we belong to the spiritual world. But then we desire material enjoyment. Then we insist on that. We are stubborn about it. Then the Lord makes arrangement for us to come to this material world because that material enjoyment is possible only in the material world. Now the material world, the characteristic is such that it is filled with miseries. There is no pure happiness in this material world. Pure happiness is only in the spiritual world. Spiritual world there is no distress. There is no unhappiness. There is no misery. There is no old age. There is no disease. There is no death. So that is spiritual world. So having come here, now that we may realize in the human form that I am suffering even though I don't want to suffer miseries. And we are also trying to avoid suffering. You have not been able to suffer this suffering in so many ways, our own ways but when one comes in touch with Shastra scriptures one understands that if we surrender to God then God will free us from this suffering but people don't surrender then they have to blame. They have to suffer. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

So he gives a promise, Kaunteya Pratijaanihi Name Bhakta Pranashyati. He promises. And even in the 18th chapter he says, Pratijaane Priyosime. I promise you this because you are very dear to me.

#### Krishna's Protection, Devotee's Duty, Surrender

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Arjuna's life was saved by Krishna, even at the cost of Krishna breaking his promise."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Krishna protecting Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, even to the point of seemingly breaking his own promise, and connects this to the duty of a devotee to follow the instructions of the Lord or spiritual master.

All circumstances. There are many examples given. Just like Arjuna's life was in danger on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, and Krishna will protect Arjuna under all circumstances. So once it so happened that Bhishma was fighting on the side of Duryodhana, he was attacking Arjuna and Arjuna's life was in danger. Bhishma is much, much more powerful and expert in fighting than Arjuna, definitely, even though Arjuna is a great warrior. But still, Bhishma is experienced. He is very, very expert, and he has fought many battles before. He is much, much, much, much more experienced than Arjuna. So Bhishma was fighting very, very, very valiantly, and very bravely, he was attacking Arjuna, expertly shooting arrows, and it appeared like Arjuna's life was in danger. Arjuna was going to get completely destroyed. So Krishna, in order to protect Arjuna, he personally took up a weapon, a wheel of a chariot, and went to stop Bhishma from attacking Arjuna. Now, in doing so, Krishna had actually broken his promise. He had promised that he will not take any weapon. He will not fight in the battle. He will not take any weapon, though he will drive Arjuna's chariot and give Arjuna some strategic directions, how to fight and how to conquer, etc. But Krishna said he will never fight. He will not take any weapons. As long as he is in the battlefield, he will never do that. So, but when Arjuna's life was in danger, Krishna took up one wheel of a chariot and rushed towards Bhishma, got down from the chariot of Arjuna, rushed towards Bhishma to stop Bhishma from attacking Arjuna. And what happened? Bhishma said, Krishna is coming to kill me. What better death can I have? So, Bhishma simply surrendered to Krishna. He stopped attacking Arjuna. He stopped. Arjuna's life was saved. For the moment, Arjuna's life was saved. And after that, when Bhishma surrendered to Krishna, Krishna actually did not attack Bhishma at all. Krishna's purpose is served. Arjuna is saved, and Bhishma is also Krishna's devotee. So, when he surrenders, that means, he is not going to fight anymore. So, when Bhishma surrendered, seeing Krishna is coming to kill me, oh, what better opportunity for me to die than at the hands of the Supreme Lord. Bhishma is a devotee, he knows. So, Krishna never went ahead, did not go ahead to kill Bhishma. He himself also stopped, because Kshatriya code of conduct is, if somebody surrenders, they don't attack, they don't kill. So, Bhishma is surrendering. So, Krishna said, okay, I am not going to attack you, I am not going to kill you. And then, after that, Bhishma never fought again. He said, enough fighting, enough fighting I have done. Now that I have surrendered, I am not going to fight anymore. So, Arjuna's life was saved. Arjuna's life was saved by Krishna, even at the cost of Krishna breaking his promise. So, when Prabhupada says here, where Krishna will never deviate from his word of honour, he will execute his promise under all circumstances. Therefore, Prabhupada says, it is the duty of the pure devotee to be fixed in the discharge of the duty entrusted to him by the Lord or the Lord's bona fide representative, the spiritual master. Guru or Krishna, their instruction we have to follow under all circumstances.

#### Responsibility, Krishna's Energies, Upanishads
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/R6BYi1xzKfs?t=479
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna has no responsibility because all his work is done by his different appointed energies."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while everyone has responsibilities, Krishna's responsibility is unique because his energies carry out his desires, referencing the Upanishads to support this point.

And we should be assured that while we are engaged in serving the Supreme Lord or the spiritual master, we have full protection of the Supreme Lord, and we have full guarantee of safety. Now, as far as the responsibility of the Lord is concerned, Srila Prabhupada says that responsibility of the Lord is also unique. We all know what responsibility is. That means we have got certain duties and we have to carry out those duties as far as possible under all circumstances. We carry out the duties. Of course, we are tiny living beings, so sometimes it may be not possible to do our duty. Except such circumstances where we cannot do our duty, we will otherwise, a dutiful person will always, a responsible person will always do his or her duties. But when it comes to Krishna, whatever Krishna's responsibility, so Prabhupada says it is unique. What is the meaning of the uniqueness of Krishna's responsibility? Actually, Krishna has no responsibility. What does it mean? Prabhupada says, Krishna has no responsibility because all his work is done by his different appointed energies. He has many energies: parashya shaktir vividhaiva shruyate svabhaviki jnana balakriyacha, the statement in the Upanishads. So, Krishna has got many, many energies and those energies are simply carrying out whatever he desires to be done according to his will. They carry out whatever he desires that should happen. So, he has nothing to do. Therefore, the Upanishads say, natasya karyam karanam ca vidyate. He has no responsibility. He has no duty. He has no work. So, does it mean he is inactive? If he has no work to do, he has no responsibility because all his responsibilities and duties are carried out by his energies?

#### Krishna's Pastimes, Cowherding, Responsibility

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Still, he accepts voluntary responsibilities in displaying different roles in his transcendental pastimes."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that despite not needing to, Krishna voluntarily accepts responsibilities in his pastimes, giving the example of Krishna as a cowherd boy in Vrindavan, diligently caring for 108 groups of cows.

No. Still, he accepts voluntary responsibilities in displaying different roles in his transcendental pastimes. See, Krishna has nothing to do but doesn't mean he is inactive. He is active in performing his lila, his transcendental pastimes, divya lila. And those transcendental pastimes are always performed in his association with his pure devotees, and he accepts different roles in those pastimes. Prabhupada gives an example. As a boy in Vrindavan, he was playing the part of a cowboy, Gopalam. As a son of Nanda Maharaj, he discharged responsibility perfectly. He would dutifully go cowherding in the forest, take the cows for grazing, and he would go with his friends and he would bring back the cows after they finished grazing in the evening before sunset. So he would supervise the milking of the cows and he would ensure that the cows have all properly returned. He would count the groups of cows. There were 108 groups of cows Krishna was taking care of. It's very interesting, this number 108. We chant 108 times the Hare Krishna mantra in one mala, one round we say. The beads which we use for chanting japa, counting and chanting japa, there are 108 beads. So where is this number 108 coming from? One of the reasons this 108 number is fixed is because Krishna in his transcendental pastime of cowherding in Vrindavan when he appeared 5000 years back, he used to take 108 groups of cows for cowherding after he grew up. And when Krishna returns with those cows, he will count the number of groups that have come back when each group he calls and they come near Krishna and Krishna directs them to enter their particular, what do you say, cow shelter, cow pen, the particular designated area where the cows will stay. So he would count the groups, 108 groups he used to take and ensure that all the groups of cows have come back. It was a huge number. So he would count. And for that Krishna had a string of 108 pearls, a mala made of 108 pearls and he would count on them how many have come back. So when all the 108 have been counted, then yes, all the cows have come back. So he would do, my point is that he would do his duty responsibly as a son of Nanda Maharaj, who was a cowherd, a king of the cowherds.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Krishna's role as a cowherd with his role as a Kshatriya prince and king in Dwaraka, highlighting his martial skills and strong leadership, setting up the discussion for the next session.

Similarly, when he was playing the part of a Kshatriya as a son of Maharaj Vasudeva, he displayed all the skills of a martially spirited Kshatriya. The Kshatriya is the son of Vasudeva and when he grew up and he went back to Mathura from Vrindavan and later on he went to Dwaraka. He was ruling as the king. He was a very strong and powerful ruler in Dwaraka, and he displayed the skill of a martially spirited Kshatriya. So this point we will discuss in the next session in detail, but Prabhupada has explained the purpose. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** This segment focuses on the unique and unparalleled beauty of Lord Krishna, highlighting the Srivatsa mark on his chest and his ability to attract even Radharani and Madana.

5 to 30 of the 16th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is part number 6. We are discussing the various qualities of the Supreme Lord, the transcendental qualities. Now, Srila Prabhupada explains the quality of the Lord's beauty. As far as the beauty of the Lord is concerned, he has some special features that distinguish him from all other living beings. Krishna, when he appears in his original form, human-like form, Manushin Tanumashrit, it's not a human form, it's not a material form. It looks like a material form of the human being. So he still has some special features by which you can recognize him as completely different from all the other humans. So he has some special features, just like Krishna has got a mark on his chest called Srivatsa. Srivatsa. It's the hoof print of a calf. Srivatsa. Vatsa means calf. On the chest, which is the residing place of Sri, Lakshmi. Lakshmi is residing on the bosom of the Lord, the chest of the Lord. So he's also called Srinivasa. The Lord, Srivatsa is the one who, that is the place where Srinivasa resides on his chest. So that place where Lakshmi resides, that place there is one mark called Srivatsa. So that Srivatsa is only there on the chest of the Lord. Only the Lord has that marking. Nobody else can have that marking. So like this he has got some special features that distinguish him from everyone else. Over and above those special features which distinguish him from all other living beings, he has some special attractive beautiful features regarding his beauty, by which he attracts the mind of even Radharani, who is the supermost beautiful creation of the Lord. Radharani is very, very, very, very, very, very beautiful, most beautiful among everyone else other than the Lord. So she is most beautiful. And Krishna, he is so beautiful, he attracts even Radharani. So how much more beautiful Krishna should be to attract even Radharani, who is the most beautiful creation of the Lord. Therefore, he is known as Madana Mohana, one who attracts the mind of even Cupid, Madana. Madana is the most beautiful personality in this universe among the created beings of the material world. So Krishna attracts even Madana, Madana Mohana, he captivates the mind of Madana. So he is millions and billions of times more beautiful than Madana, that is described in the Brahma Samhita. So Krishna attracts even Madana, Madana Mohana, he is known as Madana Mohana.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is the one who is the master of all mystic powers Yogeshwara"
**Summary:** This segment discusses how Jiva Goswami ascertained Krishna as the Supreme Lord based on his transcendental qualities and unlimited mystic powers, emphasizing Krishna's position as Yogeshwara.

Now, Srila Jiva Goswami Prabhu, who is one of the previous Acharyas, he has scrutinizingly analyzed other transcendental qualities of the human being. He has studied the qualities of the Lord, and he says affirmatively that Lord Sri Krishna is the absolute supreme personality of God, Param Brahman. How do we ascertain somebody is God? Because he looks like another created being, but he is not. But how do we ascertain he is God? By his qualities. So, his analyzed the transcendental qualities displayed by the Lord when he incarnates, Srila Jiva Goswami Prabhu has concluded that the Lord is, Krishna is the Supreme Lord, absolute supreme personality of God. So, Srila Jiva Goswami explains that omnipotent by his inconceivable energies. Omnipotent means he has got all kinds of powers, because he has so many energies. And he is the Yogeshwara or the supreme master of all mystic powers. There are so many mystic powers. But a yogi who is practicing Ashtanga Yoga can have only Ashta Siddhi, eight major mystic powers, eight minor mystic powers, and four auxiliary mystic powers. Elsewhere, Prabhupada explains. Totally, different types of mystic powers are twenty: eight major, eight minor, and four subsidiary. So, Krishna has unlimited mystic powers. So, nobody else can have unlimited mystic powers. They can have some limited mystic powers, eight at the most, or some rare cases, ten. But Krishna has unlimited mystic powers. Not only that, he is the one who bestows mystic power on somebody who desires to have it after practicing yoga. Devotees never want any mystic powers. Devotees don't want any favor from the Lord. They don't desire for it, they don't aspire for it, they never want it. So that is Lord's greatness. So he is the one, Krishna is the one who is the master of all mystic powers, Yogeshwara in the

**Key Quote:** "When Krishna shines the divine knowledge, transcendental knowledge within our heart, he says this in the Bhagavad Gita."
**Summary:** This segment explains that Krishna's eternal form is spiritual, a combination of eternity, bliss, and knowledge, and that He dispels the darkness of ignorance through transcendental knowledge.

Bhagavad-gita it is said in the 18th chapter last words yatra Yogeshwara Krishna yatra partho dhanur dharah. Krishna is addressed as Yogeshwara by Sanjaya, Yogeshwara Krishna. So Krishna is the master of all mystic powers, unlimited powers. So because he is the Yogeshwara, Ashwada Prabhupada says his eternal form is spiritual, a combination of eternity, bliss, and knowledge. Our form is spiritual, a combination of eternity, bliss, and knowledge. Our form, our material form, however a person may be learned, however intelligent he may be, but our form is basically a form of ignorance. Material form is filled with ignorance, and this ignorance, even if we try to learn whole life, this ignorance cannot be eradicated by that acquisition of material knowledge. Material knowledge does not counteract the ignorance due to our accepting a material body. It's only by the supreme Lord's blessing that we get his mercy to eradicate the ignorance within our heart. When Krishna shines the divine knowledge, transcendental knowledge within our heart, he says this in the Bhagavad Gita: tesham eva anukampartham aham ajnanajam tamaha nashayami atmabhavastho jnana deepena bhāsvat. So, Krishna dispels the darkness of ignorance in every living entity who so desires. Krishna only will dispel the darkness by giving them the enlightenment in transcendental knowledge. So, I will continue...

**Key Quote:** "His beauty is... He looks ever fresh, and newer and newer beauties are every moment being displayed by him this is called dynamic quality of beauty dynamic ever increasing ever fresh beauty Krishna displays"
**Summary:** This segment describes Krishna's dynamic and unfathomable knowledge and ever-fresh beauty, emphasizing that devotees can never equal the Lord's qualities but possess enough to be blissful.

to explain the nature of this knowledge that Krishna possesses. Krishna's knowledge is not static. It is of dynamic nature. The knowledge of the Lord is unfathomable. Nobody can estimate how much knowledge the Lord has got. And it is dynamic means according to the situation, time, place, circumstances, he can actually apply knowledge suitably in different situations. His knowledge is dynamic. Dynamic knowledge. Now, regarding his beauty. Shri Lasuta Goswami says in the Bhagavatam that even though Krishna was observed by the citizens of Dwarka every day, they were always increasingly anxious to see him again and again. Shri Lasuta Goswami says... So, what is the nature of his beauty? His beauty is... He looks ever fresh, and newer and newer beauties are every moment being displayed by him. This is called dynamic quality of beauty, dynamic, ever increasing, ever fresh beauty Krishna displays. So the residents of Dwaraka every day they would want to see Krishna's beauty and to be attracted more and more and more, increased attraction, increased appreciation of Krishna's beauty, and they become, there's no saturation also. So this saturation in transcendental qualities of the Lord, there's no saturation. So even though those devotees who appreciate the Lord's beauty every day, you, but they cannot attain by any amount of work the equality with the Lord in his beauty, not possible. That's not possible. So none of the qualities, even though the living it is put possessed in small quantity the qualities of the Lord, they can never equal him or excel you in those qualities by their efforts, different endeavors, that's never possible. So the Lord is always the Lord, eternally is the Lord, unlimited qualities, unlimited number of qualities, and unlimited extent, unlimited quantity of those each quality, and the living entities have some of the qualities which the Lord has, and they possess in very, very, very, very, very insignificant quantity, but that insignificant quantity of whatever good qualities we have is sufficient, more than sufficient for us to be happy, to be blissful, to be situated always in transcendent etc. It's enough. We don't have to strive for more qualities or greater quantity of those qualities. We don't have to strive for any of those qualities.

**Key Quote:** "It appears from this verse that interplanetary travel by the denizens of higher planets is easy."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, focusing on the ease of interplanetary travel for demigods and their presence at sacrifices performed by influential kings.

And at these sacrifices, even the common man could see demigods. So in the purport, Shri La Prabhupada says, "It appears from this verse that interplanetary travel by the denizens of higher planets is easy. We may have difficulty, or rather, we definitely do have difficulty in travelling to other planets. But for the inhabitants of the upper planets to come to this earth planet, there is no difficulty." Further, Shri La Prabhupada says, "In many statements in Bhagavatam, we have observed that the demigods from heaven used to visit this earth to attend sacrifices performed by influential kings and emperors. Herein also we find that during the time of the horse sacrifice ceremony of Maharaj Parikshit, the demigods from other planets were visible even to the common man."

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the nature of demigods, their subtle bodies, and the exceptional circumstances under which they appear on Earth, emphasizing the respect accorded to pure devotees.

Due to the sacrificial ceremony. You should remember the devatas, they live in upper planets. They don't have gross bodies like we have, we human beings have on the earth. They have subtle bodies. And in their subtle body, they are not visible even if they come to the earth planet. First of all, they don't come to the earth planet very often. There is no reason to come here. Only under exceptional situations or circumstances like being invited by a first class devotee, Mahabhagavata Parikshit Maharaj, he invites the devatas to come for the sacrifice. Then they accept the invitation very graciously because of the stature of Parikshit Maharaj. A pure devotee, a first class devotee, is respected and honored everywhere in the whole universe by all the great sages, by all great devatas, by all great jnanis, yogis, tapasvis, everyone, by realized souls,

**Summary:** The speaker explains that demigods and Krishna are not generally visible to common people but can become visible by their own grace, similar to Krishna's avataras.

everyone honors and respects a pure devotee of Krishna. That is the position of the pure devotee. So please try to understand what is being described here, that common men could see devatas in the sacrifice that was organized by Parikshit Maharaj. So Srila Prabhupada explains that demigods are not generally visible to common men even when they come to this earth. As Lord Krishna is not visible to common men, but as the Lord, Supreme Lord Krishna, by His causeless mercy, descends to be visible to the common man, Krishna comes down from His spiritual abode, personal abode, that's called avatara, to descend, to come down, and becomes visible. Similarly, the demigods also become visible to the common man by their own grace. If they decide to be visible, they can be visible. If they decide not to be visible, they'll not be visible.

**Summary:** The speaker reinforces the idea that Krishna and demigods have spiritual bodies and are visible only by their own will, highlighting Maharaj Parikshit's influence in making the demigods visible.

Just like Krishna. He sits in our heart. But unless He gives darshan, we cannot see Him. Or even when Krishna was present on the earth, 5000 years back, only if He decided to become visible for the common man, He would be visible. Otherwise they could not see Him, because Krishna's form or body is completely spiritual. It's not material like our body. And the devatas, they don't have a gross body. So therefore, neither the devatas nor Krishna are visible to ordinary people, to common people's sight on this earth. If they decide to become visible, they can be seen by common people. All those celestial beings, means those living in heavenly planets, are not visible to naked eyes of the inhabitants of this earth. It was due to the influence of Maharaj Pariksit

that the demigods also agreed to be visible. The kings used to spend lavishly during such sacrifices as a cloud distributes rains. So this is very significant. The kings used to organize such sacrifices for the welfare of the entire citizens. Now, in such sacrifices, it was an important aspect of pleasing the devatas, the sages, the brahmanas, learned brahmanas, who direct the king how to perform the sacrifice. Their satisfaction is very, very important to get the full benefit of the sacrifice, to derive the benefit. So one of the aspects of the king performing sacrifice successfully is that the king will spend very, very liberally and the description given here by Srila Prabhupada is just like a cloud distributes rains, similarly the kings would spend during such sacrifices to give in charity

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the king's charity during sacrifices is a redistribution of taxes for the citizens' benefit, leading to prosperity through the successful performance of the sacrifice.

to all the invitees. Srila Prabhupada explains about cloud distributing rain. A cloud is nothing but another form of water. Or in other words, the waters of the earth transform into clouds. What is a cloud? After all, water evaporated by the sun forms the cloud, which has got water in the form of water vapor. Similarly, and those water vapor when they condense, then the clouds pour down rain. That's the system, arrangement of the Supreme Lord in this material world. Similarly, the charity made by the kings in such sacrifices are but another form of the taxes collected from the citizens. Where will the king spend from? From the taxes he collects from the citizens. And what will he spend for? He will spend for giving back the benefit to the citizens. How will the citizens benefit if the king spends for a sacrifice? The result of the sacrifice is all prosperity for the citizens. All types of prosperity. So the citizens benefit by the king performing sacrifices properly.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the liberal distribution of charity during sacrifices, leading to citizen satisfaction and stability in the monarchical state, emphasizing the king's responsibility for the citizens' welfare and spiritual guidance.

And the king gives sufficient charity to the deserving, qualified brahmanas, sages, like that. But, as the rains fall down very lavishly and appear to be more than necessary, the charity made by such kings also seems to be more than what the citizens need. So, they would distribute liberally to everyone present in the sacrifice. Not only to the brahmanas, not only to the sages, but to everyone. Now, this is done according to the direction of the shastra. This is not one's whimsical idea to distribute liberally to everyone. No. It is exactly according to shastra. Now, in the sacrifice, the citizens will be satisfied completely. So, Srila Prabhupada says, "Satisfied citizens will never organize agitation against the king." And thus, there was no need in changing the monarchical state. The kings would rule keeping all the citizens satisfied by providing all the necessities, by doing proper sacrifices, by guiding the citizens properly towards the ultimate goal of life. In so many ways,

the kings were very responsible. Srila Prabhupada says further, even for a king like Maharaj Pariksit, there was need of a spiritual master for guidance. Of course, Pariksit was trained and he was well-versed in the principles of bhakti. He himself was a first-class devotee. But that does not mean he does not require guidance. He still requires a spiritual master for guidance. Without such guidance, one cannot make progress in spiritual life. Spiritual life means to progress by getting guidance from the right person, from the right authority, from the right source. Whimsically, we cannot select somebody we like. Or as people say, "I believe or I think such and such a person is very good." No. It should not be based on what we like or what we whimsically choose or what we think is correct. No. It has to be guided by, again,

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Srila Prabhupada's purport on the verse, emphasizing the importance of cooperation between different personalities and the scientific system of Varna and Ashrama for achieving perfection in human life.

What about their condition, their position? So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says something like this. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says something about the cooperation that is required between different personalities forever, even our basic existence. Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "To effect the perfection of human life, there is cooperation between men and demigods, sages, denizens of Pitraloka, devotees of the Lord and sages, denizens of Pitraloka, devotees of the Lord and the sages and presentee are like a fire and a tool." So, when you are in magor and puja and you can become one with each other, muchísimas gracias, the scientific system of Varna and ashrama of life. What is Varna ashrama? Varna means the social divisions according to the occupation. So the brahmanas work in one way, they are intellectuals, then the sages, the denizens of Pitraloka, all of them, they have to cooperate for perfection of human life because they are all different controllers and have different types of control exercised over the human beings on the earth. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport further, "The distinction between human life and animal life therefore begins with the scientific system of Varna and Ashrama guided by the experience of the sages in relation with the demigods gradually rising to the summit of reestablishment our eternal relation with the supreme absolute truth, the personality of Godhead."

So the scriptures describe this that there are four activities which are common for human beings and animals: the demands of the body, ahara nidra bhaya maithunam, the demands of the body, the necessity of food, necessity of sleep or rest in the afternoon and at night also, and the necessity of the body in terms of defense, protecting oneself, and mating, the necessity of sex life for procreation. So these four are common activities between animals and human beings, but there is a fifth activity and that's called dharma, and without dharma a human being is on the level of animals, living a life on the level of animals: dharma viheen apadabha, dharma viheen apadabha, dharma viheen apadabha.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the purpose of Varna and Ashrama Dharma, explaining how it facilitates the transformation from animal consciousness to human consciousness and ultimately to godly consciousness.

This is the statement of the Shastra. So therefore, human life means there has to be the scientific system of Varna and ashrama guided by the experience of the sages in relation with the devatas gradually rising to the perfection of human life when one is able to re-establish one's Lord's lost connection with Krishna. So when God made Varna ashrama Dharma, Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, chaturvaranyam maya-srishtam guna-karma-vibhagasaham. So this God made Varna ashrama dharma which is strictly meant for developing animal consciousness into human consciousness. You can see that in the Bhagavad Gita there is a verse in the Bhagavad Gita that says, So this God made Varna ashrama Dharma which is strictly meant for developing animal consciousness into human consciousness and human consciousness into godly consciousness levels of advancement for human beings from animal consciousness to human consciousness by following the Varna ashrama Dharma and from human conscious to godly consciousness by following the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita by following the teachings of the bhagavatam like that and in this way when one makes actual factual spiritual advancement then one can very easily understand who am I who is God what is my relationship etc so this arrangement of the Bhagavad Gita which is strictly meant for developing animal consciousness into human consciousness by following the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita by following the teachings of the bhagavatam like that.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the challenges posed by Kali Yuga to the proper understanding and implementation of Varna and Ashrama Dharma, highlighting the distortion of the system and the misinterpretation of scriptures.

The ultimate of the supreme Lord for a human society of Varna ashrama Dharma is broken by advancement of foolishness. That means people don't properly understand the purpose of this varnashrama, they criticize, they give trouble, they challenge the authority, etc. So such disturbance in the human society in the name of following some varnashrama but actually not in proper spirit, the system of progressive life becomes at once disturbed. So Prabhupada says in Kali Yuga the first attack of the venomous snake strikes against God made varnashrama. This God made varnashrama is almost destroyed by the influence of the Kali Yuga and a person properly qualified as a Brahmana is treated like a shudra in Kali Yuga and a shudra by qualification such a person is passing off as a Brahmana and what is the basis? Oh, I was born in a Brahmana family or somebody else is not born in a Brahmana family. So these are all not the proper understanding of the Shastra. So proper understanding of the Shastra means by birth there is no consideration of somebody being belonging to Brahmana Kshatriya Vaishal Shudra Varanasa.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the qualities of a true Brahmana and laments the corrupting influence of Kali Yuga, which leads to a decline in these qualities and a lack of interest in transcendence.

So this has to be understood carefully that birth is not the criterion, though Srila Prabhupada says that if somebody is born in a good Brahmana family they have very good opportunity to get trained up as a Brahmana right from the early stages of your life, but they are not the criteria for their birth. So this has to be understood carefully that birth is not the criterion, though Shri their life but even if we don't consider this consideration of birth or consideration of occupational duties, we don't consider that, but simply a person develops control of the mind, control of the senses, and cultivates tolerance, simplicity, cleanliness, knowledge, truthfulness, devotion, and faith in the Supreme, then one becomes a really qualified Brahmana. And in the present age, the influence of Kali is such that people neglect the knowledge of the Supreme to follow the proper culture and they become victim of the age of Kali, they become victim of the age of Kali. So due to this age of Kali, the influence of the age, everything is topsy-turvy, especially as regards varnashrama, it's topsy-turvy. We don't have qualified Brahmanas, we don't have qualified Kshatriyas, we don't have very much qualified Vaishyas, some Vaishyas are there but not very qualified, and the influence of the Kali also makes people corrupt, they are not straightforward, they are not

In this session, we will be discussing the 32nd and 33rd verses of the 16th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. These two verses are given together. I shall read them first, the two verses, and then we will hear the translation of the two verses given together. And then we will discuss from the purport. ब्रह्माद यो बहुतितं यद अपांग मोक्षा कामास्तपस समचरन भगवत प्रपन्ना साश्री स्ववासं अरविन्द वनं विहाया यद पाद सवभगं अलं भजतेनु रक्ता This was the 32nd verse.

That Lakshmiji gave up her own abode in the forest of lotus flowers and engaged herself in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord. And now Mother Earth is telling, I was endowed with specific... specific powers to supersede the fortune of all the three planetary systems by being decorated with the impressions of the flag, thunderbolt, elephant-driving rod, and lotus flower, which are the signs of the lotus feet of the Lord. But at the end, when I felt I was so fortunate, the Lord left me.

**Key Quote:** "The beauty and opulence of the world can be enhanced by the grace of the Lord and not by any man-made planning."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing that the earth's opulence comes from the Lord's grace, not human endeavors, and that our dependence on nature is affected by our piety or sinfulness.

Now in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains something very valuable, very important for all of us to understand. He says, "The beauty and opulence of the world can be enhanced by the grace of the Lord and not by any man-made planning." We think that by our own efforts at utilizing the resources of nature and controlling material nature in such a way that... he is most favorable for our enjoyment here. We forget the actual control of the Supreme Lord over material nature and over us and over everything else that we forget. So when there is the mercy or grace of the Lord, there is no scarcity of anything for the whole... material existence and the beauty and opulence of the world can be enhanced significantly by getting the mercy of the Lord, his merciful glance. When the Lord Sri Krishna was present on this earth, the impressions of the special signs of his lotus feet were stamped on the dust. Whenever Krishna used to walk, so he would leave behind the impression of his feet. And especially in Vrindavan, the other inhabitants of Vrindavan were very conscious of Krishna's footprints, that when they are walking in Vrindavan, if there is a footprint of Krishna which is recognized by the symbols of a flag, thunderbolt, elephant-driving rod, or the lotus flower, then they will not disturb that impression. They will walk away from that. So the earth was beautified by these impressions. And as a result of this, what happened? The whole earth was made as perfect as possible. The earth became a wonderful place. The earth became a wonderful place for all its inhabitants. It is described here, in other words, the rivers, the seas, the forests, the hills, and the mines which are the supply agents for the necessities of men and animals, were fully discharging their respective duties. So this is very, very important. We depend on the supplies of nature for our success, for our subsistence, and for our civilization to flourish. But that supply is sometimes curtailed if we become sinful. And if we are pious, that supply is in abundance. So we need not have industrial enterprises to exploit this material nature and try to get more and more and more and more and more of those resources.

**Key Quote:** "One should ask that the grace of the Lord always be present on earth, so that we may be favored by His causeless mercy, and be happy, having all the necessities of life, for living comfortably and enjoying life without any scarcity."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how to maintain the Lord's presence on Earth through devotional service, particularly by chanting the Hare Krishna mantra, which is identical to the Lord.

Therefore, Prabhupada says, "One should ask that the grace of the Lord always be present on earth, so that we may be favored by His causeless mercy, and be happy, having all the necessities of life, for living comfortably and enjoying life without any scarcity." So, then one may ask, how can we detain the Supreme Lord on this earth after His mission is fulfilled and He has left this earth, for going to His own abode? When He was present, because of the footprints of the Lord, everything was in abundance, all supplies were in abundance. That's described already in a previous chapter. So, Srila Prabhupada says that there is no need to detain the Supreme Lord in this material world. Why? Because, the Lord is actually omnipresent. He is always present everywhere. But, if we want Him, He can be present in a way that we can perceive His presence. We can perceive His presence by the way He is approached by us. If we are attached to His devotional service by hearing, chanting, remembering, etc., then He can always be present with us in the form of transcendental sound. Transcendental sound. That transcendental sound is specifically taught by Caitanya Mahaprabhu as Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare, that is what is taught by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, so very easy way of having the presence of the Lord in this world by which we can get immense amount of benefits from the Lord and even without our asking the Lord will...

We are connected with him through his sound because the holy name of the Lord in the form of this Hare Krishna mantra and the Lord himself, the supreme personality, transcendental personality, they are identical. So, and this presence of the Lord in the form of the transcendental sound can be experienced by offenseless chanting. There are considerations of offenses in chanting Hare Krishna. Of course, in the beginning, we are just told to chant Hare Krishna. Simply vibrate your tongue and produce a sound and try to hear that sound. But as we advance in Krishna consciousness, we learn that chanting is fully effective if we are able to chant without any offenses. What does it mean? That means there are some activities we have to refrain from in order to please the Lord by our chanting. That means chanting Hare Krishna. Just like one of the offenses to be considered while chanting Hare Krishna in the form of japa is to commit sinful activities on the strength of chanting the holy name because by chanting we become purified. It doesn't mean we can go on committing sinful activities and go on chanting and purifying ourselves. It doesn't work like that. Similarly, all the other offenses are to be considered.

**Key Quote:** "So Krishna's appearance, one of the reasons for his appearance is to reduce the burden of the Earth which is overburdened by demoniac persons posing as Kshatriyas."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verses to be discussed (SB 1.16.34-36) and begins explaining verse 34, focusing on the Earth being burdened by atheistic kings and the Lord's incarnation to relieve this burden.

In this session we are discussing verses 3.34, 3.35, and 3.36. The last three verses are from verses 3.34, 3.35, and 3.36, the last three verses of this chapter, the 16th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavata. So these verses are all given separately, one verse at a time. The 34th verse: Yovai Mamatibharam Asura Vamsa Raghmyam Akshauhini Shatam Apanudad Atmatantraha Tvam Dustham Oonapadam Atmani Paurushena Sampadayan Yadushu Ramyam Abhibhrad Angam. The meaning of this 34th verse: Mother Earth is addressing the personality of religious principles, Dharma. Dharani is addressing Dharma. O Personality of Religion! I was greatly overburdened, burdened by the undue military phalanxes arranged by Atheistic Kings. And I was relieved by the grace of the Personality of Godhead. By the grace of the Supreme Lord, all those military phalanxes were destroyed of the Atheistic Kings. They were destroyed. Similarly, you are also in a distressed condition, weakened in your standing strength, and thus he also incarnated by his internal energy in the family of the Yadus to relieve you.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the qualities of these 'demoniac' leaders, their lack of Kshatriya qualities, and how they create suffering for ordinary people, necessitating the Lord's intervention.

So Krishna's appearance, one of the reasons for his appearance is to reduce the burden of the Earth which is overburdened by demoniac persons posing as Kshatriyas. They don't have Kshatriya qualities. To properly rule this Earth planet, or to rule some provinces or states, they don't have the Kshatriya qualities. So they simply pose as if they are independently able to do the administration without any consideration of any principles, whimsically. They take charge or control of the whole state or province or country or whatever, and they create havoc in the lives of ordinary people. So, to curtail these people's miscreant activities, the Lord incarnated as Krishna, and he incarnated by his internal energy.

**Key Quote:** "the Asuras want to enjoy life of sense gratification even at the cost of others happiness they don't care for others happiness and they also don't hesitate to give trouble to others who want to live a pious life"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the Lord's appearance through internal energy with ordinary births and quotes Srila Prabhupada on the nature of Asuras, their desire for sense gratification, and their tendency to create war.

That means his appearance is not like our appearance which is subject to so many material... Our own spiritual identity as spirit soul, we forget that, whereas internal energy means there is full enlightenment, full knowledge, full consciousness, so the two are totally different. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The Asuras want to enjoy life of sense gratification even at the cost of others' happiness." They don't care for others' happiness, and they also don't hesitate to give trouble to others who want to live a pious life. The Asuras give trouble to such people, and they want to enjoy independently. They don't care for others. And Prabhupada says further, "In order to fulfill this ambition, the Asuras, especially atheistic kings or state executive heads, try to equip themselves with all kinds of deadly weapons to bring about a war in a peaceful society unnecessarily." Some demoniac kings, they want to declare war and somehow capture power, defeat or kill some righteous kings and...

**Summary:** The speaker continues discussing the Asuras' tendency to create war and the suffering it causes, emphasizing Mother Earth's compassion and the Lord's duty to protect devotees and vanquish demons.

Capture power. So these atheistic kings, they equipped themselves with so many deadly weapons. So such people simply create a condition or situation where there will be war unnecessarily. In a peaceful society there is no need for war, but they will create a situation that there has to be war. And Mother Earth, because she considers all the living entities living in this earth planet as her own children, so she feels for their suffering when the Kings oppress the people or the unwanted asuras. They have to be vanquished by the Supreme Lord only. Nobody else can actually control them or curtail them or restrict their nefarious activities. Even the demigods, the rishis, all the different inhabitants of the upper planets, or even the powerful persons on this earth or in the lower planets, they cannot restrict these asuras. So they, and the asuras, unnecessarily give trouble to the devotees unless they give trouble. So therefore, there is an absolute necessity of the Supreme Lord's appearance, and he does his duty or his seva regardless of whether others are doing or not doing. So he appears also for delivering all...

The others, and he simultaneously protects the devotees and kills the demons. In the 35th verse it is said, the meaning of this 35th verse is that, "Who therefore can tolerate the pangs of separation from that Supreme Personality of Godhead? He could conquer the gravity and passionate wrath of his sweethearts like Satyabhama by his sweet smile of love, pleasing glance, and hearty appeals." Krishna is very, very, very kind and benevolent towards his devotees. So for those who render loving service to him, Krishna is also reciprocating with such devotees, and his reciprocation is very, very, very, very attractive. Further it is said, "When he traversed my surface, that is the earth surface, I would be immersed in the dust of his lotus feet, and thus would be sumptuously covered with grass, which appeared like hair standing on me out of pleasure." Lord was constantly in touch with the surface of this earth planet. So Mother Earth felt the touch of the Lord's lotus feet on her body.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the constant contact between the Lord's lotus feet and the Earth, contrasting it with the occasional separation felt by the Lord's queens.

And she was always very much happy and ecstatic with such contact. So it appeared like the grass that was growing whenever the Lord walked on the surface of the earth. Those grass appeared like hair standing on the body of the earth planet due to excessive joy, due to the contact of the Lord's lotus feet with the Mother, with the earth planet. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "There were chances of separation between the Lord and his thousands of queens because of the Lord's being absent from home." So in the daytime the Lord would go to the assembly house in Dwarka, and in the evening He would return and spend time with His family members in His palaces. So when he would go away, they would feel the Lord's absence from their home. Thousands of queens, sixteen thousand one hundred and eight queens. But as far as this connection with the earth was concerned, it is different. What is the difference? The Lord would traverse the earth with his lotus feet, and therefore there was no chance of separation. He would always travel on the earth surface. So no chance of separation for Mother Earth from the contact with the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord Krishna when he was present on the earth.

**Key Quote:** "While the earth and the personality of religion were thus engaged in conversation, the saintly king Pariksit reached the shore of the Saraswati river which flowed towards the east."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the intense feeling of separation Mother Earth experienced when the Lord departed and introduces verse 36, describing King Pariksit's arrival at the scene where Kali was mistreating a cow and bull, setting the stage for the next chapter.

So therefore, when the Lord left this earth planet and went back to his personal abode in the spiritual world, Mother Earth's feelings of separation were therefore very, very, very acute, very intense. She felt the separation so much, because for 125 years the Lord was there constantly. His lotus feet was in touch with the surface of the earth. So she felt the most, the separation from the Lord after he left for his personal abode. The 36th verse, the last verse: tayor evam kathayato prithvi dharmayostada parikshin nama rajarshi praptaprachim sarasvatim. The meaning of this last verse: "While the earth and the personality of religion were thus engaged in conversation, the saintly king Pariksit reached the shore of the Saraswati river which flowed towards the east." So the description is continuing that Pariksit has reached that spot where the personality of Kali was trying to beat a cow and a bull. So Pariksit has reached there. And then now there will be, the personality of Dharma and the personality of Mother Earth were conversing with each other, and Pariksit reached there at that time. Now Pariksit is going to enquire and is going to take action, suitable action against the personality of Kali. We will hear that in the next chapter.

**Summary:** This segment introduces the context of the lecture, focusing on Pariksit Maharaj's encounter with Kali Yuga and its connection to the Srimad Bhagavatam.

In this session, we will be discussing from the fourth verse of the sixteenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This chapter relates how Pariksit received the age of Kali, the beginning of the age of Kali. The fourth verse is as follows, निजग्राह ओजसा वीरह कलिम् दिग्विजये क्वचित् नृपलिंगधरं शूद्रं नन्तं गोमिथुनं पदाः The meaning of this verse is, once when Maharaj Pariksit was on his way to conquer the world, he saw the master of Kali Yuga, who is lower than a Shudra, disguised as a king and hurting the legs of a cow and bull. The king at once caught hold of him to deal sufficient punishment. So, the description continues by Suta Goswami to the sage Naimisharanya.

**Summary:** This segment describes Pariksit Maharaj's extraordinary qualities and his encounter with Kali Yuga, emphasizing the latter's low character and disguised appearance.

So, that is the reason why the descriptions are being given about Pariksit and earlier about Shukadeva Goswami also the description was given. So, Maharaj Pariksit is a Mahabhagavata, his birth is extraordinary, his activities are extraordinary and his passing away from this world is also extraordinary. Everything about him is very special. So, to hear about Pariksit's life is in itself auspicious and it leads to awakening our own devotional service within our own heart. Therefore, that is included in the Bhagavatam. So, the description here is, when Pariksit Maharaj was on his way to conquer the world, he saw the master of Kali Yuga, disguised as a king and hurting the legs of a cow and bull. The divine powers carried on his way to conquer the world. After he took charge, he has to establish himself as the worthy emperor descendant of the Pandavas, competent to rule the people. So, he was on a world tour as it is understood nowadays. He saw the master of Kaliyuga, kalipurusha, a killing through no ability to do anything. Yes, so we mean to say, a gunner of this world, who does not know DNS permission, can't climb to ensure that a slave with a pole and salute the boss can kill himself. So, he is a friend of 인들사 stressors. Pull out a book of callig между 라는華 Mits and garments him his place of worship.

And this Kalipurusha's characteristic is that he is very, very low in his character, lower than a Shudra. And he is disguising himself as a king, Nripalingadhara. He is dressed as a Kshatriya, externally, as a king. But his activities are low class. What was he doing? He was hurting the legs of a cow and bull. And Pariksit could not tolerate this. Immediately, Pariksit caught hold of this Kalipurusha and decided to give him sufficient punishment to stop him completely

**Summary:** This segment explains the true purpose of a king's tour, which is to ensure the kingdom is aligned with the godly state and Krishna's will, not for self-aggrandizement.

from hurting a cow and bull. So, Srila Prabhupada explains, in the purport, the purpose of a king's going out to conquer the world is not for self-aggrandizement. What is the meaning of self-aggrandizement? He doesn't want to accumulate power, wealth. And it is not for self-aggrandizement. He is not interested in people glorifying him. It is explained here. Maharaj Pariksit went out to conquer the world after his ascendance to the throne. But this was not for the purpose of aggression on other states. It was not for conquering some other places. Because it is said here, he was the emperor of the world and all small states were already under his regime. So what is the purpose for his going out on a world tour? His purpose in going out was to see how things were going on in terms of the godly state. This is the real purpose of the king touring his kingdom: to see how things are going on in terms of the godly state. Srila Prabhupada further says, The king being the representative of the Lord, Supreme Lord Krishna, has to execute the will of the Lord Krishna. This is the Lord's duty. Ultimately, who is the supreme controller of all controllers? It is Krishna. And Krishna has got a certain plan: how this world should be run. There is a purpose for this creation. So whether the purpose of the creation is being met, that is what should be the concern of the king

as the representative of Krishna. There is no question of self-aggrandizement. Means, the king knows very well that this entire world belongs to Krishna. Isha vasya midam sarvam. Or as the Bhagavad Gita says, Karvaloka Maheshwaram. Krishna is the supreme controller, supreme lord of all planets, all universes. And in the Isha Upanishad, the supreme lord is the supreme proprietor of every place. So, Pariksit is not under illusion that, I am the enjoyer, I am the controller, I am the master, I am powerful. He is not under such an illusion. So he wanted to see that things are going on exactly according to the codes of dharma as given by Krishna, whether people are following the code of dharma. The king has to enforce that. That's the duty of the king. Thus, as soon as Maharaj Pariksit saw that a lower class man in the dress of a king was hurting the legs of a common bull, he at once arrested and punished him. So this is the duty of the king. This is the characteristic of a God conscious king who is ruling exactly according to the plan of the supreme lord.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the importance of cow protection and brahmanical culture for spiritual progress and the advancement of human civilization.

So Srila Prabhupada says, the king cannot tolerate insults to the most important animal, the cow. Nor can he tolerate disrespect for the most important man, the brahmana. So, Krishna as the supreme lord is offered prayer: Namo brahmanya devaya go brahmana hitaya jaya. Krishna wants to see that these two personalities or these two factors are always taken care of: Go brahmana. The cows are protected and the brahmanas are protected. This is brahmanical culture which is ultimately meant for the spiritual progress of everyone in the whole world so that they utilize the human form of life for preparing themselves to go back to Godhead. Human civilization means to advance the cause of brahmanical culture. And to maintain it, cow protection is essential. Brahmanical culture is centered around the understanding that every living being is the soul not the body and Krishna is the supreme soul and we are all part and parcel of Krishna. We belong to Krishna and we are meant to return to Krishna in his personal abode in the spiritual kingdom of God. So that is the brahmanical culture. And this brahmanical culture is maintained by cow protection. What is the connection between brahmanical culture

**Summary:** This segment explains the connection between cow protection and brahmanical culture, highlighting the benefits of cow's milk for developing sattva guna and advancing spiritual understanding.

and cow protection? Prabhupada says in the next sentence in this purport, there is a miracle in milk, cow's milk. Prabhupada is talking about cow's milk, for it contains all the necessary vitamins to sustain human physiological conditions for higher achievements. A human being, especially, who is meant for God realization, has to derive the necessary nutrition by taking cow's milk. Brahmanical culture can advance only when man is educated to develop the quality of goodness, sattva guna. Brahmana means sattva guna. Brahmanical culture means sattva guna. And for this, for developing sattva guna, there is a prime necessity of food prepared with milk, fruits and grains: sattvic ahara. Sattvic ahara. If people take sattvic ahara, then they develop sattvic qualities: milk, fruits and grains. Maharaj Pariksit was astonished to see that a black shudra dressed like a ruler was mistreating a cow, the most important animal in human society. So, cow should always be protected. Specially in the Bhagavad Gita, it is said, go raksha. No other animal is mentioned as deserving special protection. Only the cow deserves special protection. Of course, the scriptures say, don't harm any other creature: Ahimsa. But, the cow is to be given special protection in addition to the injunction, Vedic injunction, don't harm any other creature. Don't harm others. There is also the injunction that the cow has to be given extra care of special protection, because it is the most important animal

**Summary:** This segment describes the characteristics of Kali Yuga, including mismanagement and the lack of cow protection due to unqualified leaders, and Pariksit Maharaj's intention to stop this decline.

in human society. So, the characteristic of this age of Kali, the present age we are living in, is being described here by Srila Prabhupada. The age of Kali means mismanagement and quarrel. And the root cause of all mismanagement and quarrel is that worthless men with the lower modes, who are situated in lower modes, who have no higher ambition in life, come to the helm of this state management. And, such people, they don't know the importance of cow protection. Instead of taking the milk of the cow, they want to drink the blood of the cow. So, this is because they are situated in lower modes, and they are very sinful, and they are very, very unqualified. So, therefore, Pariksit Maharaj wanted to stop this. And, therefore, we will see what steps he took. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the fifth verse of the sixteenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining Shaunaka Rishi's inquiry about Pariksit Maharaja's actions and emphasizing the importance of discussing topics related to Krishna.

In this session we will be discussing from the 5th and 6th verses of the 16th chapter of the 1st canto of Shri Madbhagavata. The 5th verse is as follows: Shaunaka Vacha Kasyahetor Nijagraha Kalim Digvijayendrapaha Nrudeva Chinha Drakshudra Kosav Gamya Padahanat Tatkathyata Mahabhaga Yadi Krishna Kathashrayam? So the meaning of this 5th verse is as follows: Shaunaka Rishi inquired. Suta Goswami is describing to the sages of Naimisharan. He did by Shaunaka Rishi vary hundred Shana because she is inquiring after you heard that Parachit Maharaja came across a low class person meeting a cow and a bull. So he came after wrote on all of this. Savanaka Rishi's inquiry is very pertinent here. Savanaka Rishi inquired, why did Maharaj Pariksit simply punish him since he was the lowest of the Shudras, having dressed as a king and having struck a cow on the leg? Please describe all these incidents if they relate to the topics of Lord Krishna. So, the sages of Naimisharanya, they are very eager to hear topics connected with Krishna. In the beginning itself, they ask six questions related to Krishna. So, these questions pertaining to Krishna are completely satisfying to the soul, to the real self. Therefore, such questions are very, very important, and answers to such questions can solve all problems, can bring about peace and prosperity in the entire world. It can purify the heart of the conditioned souls. It brings in all auspiciousness. It brings in enlightenment.

**Key Quote:** "This suggests that a pious king like Maharaj Pariksit should have at once killed an offender who wanted to cheat the public by dressing like a king and at the same time daring to insult the purest of animals, a cow."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Srila Prabhupada's perspective on Pariksit Maharaja's punishment of the Shudra, highlighting the importance of protecting cows and the expected severity of justice in a pious kingdom, contrasting it with the degraded state of Kali Yuga.

So, therefore, it's so important to discuss these topics. Now, in the Purport of the Lord Krishna, there is a very important topic. What Srila Prabhupada says, Savanaka and the rishis were astonished to hear that the pious Maharaj Pariksit simply punished the culprit and did not kill him. See, the sages of Naimisharanya, they were expecting Pariksit as the Mahabhagavata, as the ideal king, ideal emperor, ideal ruler, that he will never... that he will never tolerate even a little harm done to a cow. So, why did Pariksit not kill the fellow immediately? Instead, you are describing Pariksit Maharaj just punished him, spared his life. So, they were completely astonished to hear. Why did Pariksit not kill him? So, Srila Prabhupada further says, This suggests that a pious king like Maharaj Pariksit should have at once killed an offender who wanted to cheat the public by dressing like a king and at the same time daring to insult the purest of animals, a cow. In general, a conditioned soul is inclined to cheat, but this kind of cheating, dressing like a king while actually behaving as the lowest class person, is real, real big cheating. Big cheating. His actions suggest that he is a very low class fellow, but externally he appears to be dressed like a king. So, this cheating has to be at once stopped. And how can it be stopped? Simply kill the fellow on the spot. No mercy. No relief for him. No pardon. No excuse. Not at all. So, Srila Prabhupada says, The rishis in those days, headed by Saunaka, however, could not even imagine that in the advanced days of the age of Kali, the lowest of the shudras will be elected as administrators.

**Key Quote:** "So, this cow killing is the greatest sin. Greatest sin."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the degradation of Kali Yuga, focusing on the prevalence of unqualified leaders and the sin of cow killing, emphasizing the severe karmic consequences described in the scriptures.

Then there was one person, Parikshit's time. But now there are so many of, so many people like that Kali Purusha. And they are the lowest among men in the society, but they are elected as administrators, playing the role of the king. And such people will open organized slaughterhouses for killing cows. Mass killing. They could not even imagine that Kali Yuga, as time progresses, will become so degraded. Then one person was just beating a cow and a bull. Just beating, mind you. That itself, the rishi's reaction was, He should have immediately killed. Then what is the punishment for somebody opens a slaughterhouse and mass killing of cows? Helplessly, these innocent, pure animals are being killed by the thousands, tens of thousands, lakhs, millions, especially in America. So, because the scriptures say, a cow killer is punished by Yamaraj to be sent to hell for punishment for as many years as there are hair on the body of the cow. You can imagine how severe the punishment is if he escapes punishment before he dies. After death, punishment is abating those who escape punishment before they die. Suitable punishment. So, this cow killing is the greatest sin. Greatest sin.

**Key Quote:** "Everything in this material world in relationship with the three gunas is actually impure. But when dovetailed with Krishna everything becomes purified."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that even seemingly mundane topics become valuable when connected to Krishna, emphasizing Krishna as the purifying agent and the principle of dovetailing everything with devotional service.

There can't be any greater sin than cow killing. So, further Srila Prabhupada says, Anyway, although hearing about a Shudraka who was a cheat and an insulter of a cow was not very interesting to the great rishis, they nevertheless wanted to hear about it to see if the event had any connection with Lord Krishna. See, they are interested in hearing all topics connected with Krishna. It doesn't matter what the topic is. It should be in relationship with Krishna. That's all they want to hear. So, Prabhupada says the characteristic of Bhagavatam is there are so many topics about sociology, politics, economics, cultural affairs, but all of them are in relation with Krishna. Therefore, all of them are worth hearing, because Krishna is the purifying agent in all these matters. Everything in this material world in relationship with the three gunas is actually impure, but when dovetailed with Krishna everything becomes purified. That's the principle of the Bhagavatam.

**Key Quote:** "The devotees of the Lord are accustomed to licking up the honey available from the lotus feet of the Lord. What is the use of topics which simply waste one's valuable life?"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the sixth verse, explaining that devotees are only interested in topics related to Krishna and that Lord Krishna and his devotees are both on the transcendental plane above the three gunas.

The sixth verse: athavasya padam bhoja makaranda liham satam kim manyair asad alaapair ayusho yad asad vyayaha. The meaning of the sixth verse is: The devotees of the Lord are accustomed to licking up the honey available from the lotus feet of the Lord. What is the use of topics which simply waste one's valuable life? Characteristic of a devotee of Krishna is the devotee only wants to hear topics connected with Krishna. All other topics are waste of time. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport: Lord Krishna and his devotees are both on the transcendental plane above the three gunas. Therefore the topics of Lord Krishna and of his pure devotees are equally good. Prabhupada gives an example: The battle of Kurukshetra is full of politics and diplomacy, but because the topics are related with Lord Krishna, the Bhagavad Gita is therefore adored all over the world. There is no need to eradicate politics, economics, sociology etc.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the mundane perspective with the devotee's vision, who sees everything in relation to Krishna, emphasizing the importance of pure devotional service and the transcendental nature of topics related to Krishna's pure devotees.

which are mundane to the mundane-ers. Some class of philosophers, they consider topics like economics, politics, sociology connected with this world, the world we live in, as material subject matter and they don't want to hear at all. But for a pure devotee he actually sees everything in relationship with Krishna, and therefore he is able to relate everything with Krishna. So that relationship of everything with Krishna is possible when everything is dovetailed with the Lord's service, with pure devotional service. So Prabhupada is explaining: We have heard and talked about the activities of the Pandavas and we are now dealing with topics of Maharaj Paricharan. But because all these topics are related to the Supreme Lord Krishna they are all transcendental and pure devotees have great interest in hearing them. You see. How? Even the fighting on the battlefield of Kurukshetra or Paricharan Maharaj dealing with a low class person who was hurting a cow, these are important for us because they are in relationship with Krishna. Because the Pandavas are pure devotees of Krishna, Paricharan Maharaj is a pure devotee of Krishna, therefore those topics are of interest to us

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the limited duration of life and the importance of utilizing every moment for Krishna-related topics, urging listeners to avoid wasting time on matters disconnected from self-realization and going back to Godhead.

as devotees. We have already discussed this matter in connection with the prayers of Bhishma and Deva. In the ninth chapter of the first canto this is discussed in detail. Our duration of life is not very long and there is no certainty of when we shall be ordered to leave everything for the next stage. Of course we don't die a spirit soul, but we have to quit this body at a certain time when ordered to do so. There is a certain life span we can live in this body and we exactly do not know how many years we are going to live. It is our duty to see that not a moment of our life is wasted in topics which are not related with Krishna. Somebody who is serious about self-realization or going back to Godhead should not waste a valuable time in this human form of life in topics which are disconnected from Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "devotees are accustomed to licking up the honey available from the lotus feet of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of taking shelter of Krishna's lotus feet, describing the spiritual planet Goloka Vrindavana and the honey available in the lotus flower, symbolizing the relishable nectar of devotional service and the constant desire of devotees to be sheltered by Krishna.

Now, Srila Prabhupada explains what is this licking up the honey available at the lotus feet of the Lord. Prabhupada says the spiritual planet Goloka Vrindavana, the eternal abode of Krishna, is shaped like the wall of a lotus flower. Even when the Lord descends to any of the mundane planets, any of the planets in this material world, He does so by manifesting His own abode as it is. Krishna's abode comes down with Him. When He comes His feet remain always on the same big wall of the lotus flower. And His feet are also as beautiful as the lotus flower. Therefore it is said Lord Krishna has lotus feet. You would have heard this many times. Krishna's feet are described as lotus feet because His feet are always resting on the lotus flower. So there is a certain honey available in the lotus flower, and that honey is what the devotees are accustomed to tasting when they take shelter of Krishna's lotus feet. That's why devotees are attached to Krishna's lotus feet, and that honey is as relishable as nectar. Therefore constantly the devotees want to be sheltered by Krishna's lotus feet. And that's why it is said devotees are accustomed to licking up the honey available from the lotus feet of the Lord. So to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord means to be engaged always in a relationship with topics of devotional service to Krishna. That is the meaning of taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "All of us desire freedom from death, especially those who are devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 7th verse of the 16th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining the desire for freedom from death and attaining eternal life through devotion.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session we will be discussing from the 7th and 8th verses of the 16th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. 7th verse: Shudra Ayusham Dranam Anga Martyanaam Rutaam Ichchatam Ihopahuto Bhagavan Mrutyu Shamitra Karmani. The meaning of this verse is, O Suta Goswami, there are those amongst men who desire freedom from death and get eternal life. They escape the slaughtering process by calling the controller of death, Yamaraja. A very important verse. All of us desire freedom from death, especially those who are devotees. And freedom from death means getting eternal life in Krishna's abode, eternal life full of bliss and knowledge. Now what is the way to get this freedom from death and get eternal life? It is to escape the slaughtering process by calling the controller of death, Yamaraja.

**Key Quote:** "Modern scientists, they do not know the real self, the spirit. They think only in terms of the body."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's purport, criticizing modern science's attempts to avoid death through physical means, emphasizing the importance of the spirit soul over the perishable body.

So what is the meaning of this? Shudra Prabhupada explains in the purport: The living entity as he develops from lower animal life to a higher human being and gradually to higher intelligence becomes anxious to get free from death. It is to get free from the clutches of death. We know nobody wants to die. We all know that. But then death is forced upon us. So in the human form of life, we have developed intelligence to understand how can we become deathless. That is the prerogative of the human being because of developed intelligence. Modern scientists try to avoid death by physiochemical advancement of knowledge. Modern scientists, they do not know the real self, the spirit. They think only in terms of the body. But this body is always a dead body. It appears living because of the presence of the spirit soul. Otherwise this body is always a dead body because it is made of matter. It doesn't have life by itself. It doesn't have life. So any attempt to avoid death by analyzing the chemicals, by manipulating the chemicals or the physical body, this is never going to work. So Srila Prabhupada says, even though they try to avoid death, the controller of death, Yamaraj, is so cruel that he does not spare even the very life of the scientist himself. The scientist who is trying to do research, how to avoid death by some chemical manipulation, even that scientist himself has to die. So nobody is spared by Yamaraj. The scientist who put forward the theory of stopping death by advancement of scientific knowledge becomes himself a victim of death when he is called by Yamaraj.

**Key Quote:** "The only hope of suspending the cruel slaughtering process of Yamaraj is to call him to hear and chant the holy name of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that chanting the holy name of the Lord and engaging in devotional service is the only way to avoid death and transcend material existence.

Yamaraj, exactly when the span of life is over, he sends the Yamadutas to take the soul out of the body, to drag the soul. Now we will be forced to leave the body. Not that we have a choice whether you want to leave the body or you want to continue to live in the body. No. What to speak of stopping death? No one can enhance the short period of life even by a fraction of a moment. So what is the way out then? The only hope of suspending the cruel slaughtering process of Yamaraj is to call him to hear and chant the holy name of the Lord. This is the process. Invite Yamaraj for Sankirtana involving the chanting and hearing of the Hare Krishna mantra, the holy name of the Supreme Lord. Yamaraj is a great devotee of the Lord and he likes to be invited to kirtanas and sacrifices by pure devotees who are constantly engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. Thus the great sages headed by Saunaka and others, invited Yamaraj to attend the sacrifice performed at Naimisharanya. This was good for those who did not want to die. It is described in the beginning of the Bhagavatam, the first canto beginning, that the sages of Naimisharanya undertook to perform a thousand year sacrifice. And what was this thousand year sacrifice? It was all about chanting and hearing the glory of the Lord, the stories of the Supreme Lord. So they began inquiry about Krishna and they wanted to hear the glorification of Krishna. So that is the way to stop death, to avoid death. Those who are engaged in devotional activities transcend the conditions of material life, birth, disease, old age, death, three-fold miseries,

everything they are able to transcend. The eighth verse, na kaścin mriyate tāvad yāvad āsta īhāntakaḥ etad arthaṁ hi bhagavān āhūtaḥ paramarṣivihi aho nṛloke pīyeta hari-līlāmṛtaṁ va caḥ. The meaning of this eighth verse is as follows: As long as Yamarāja, who causes everyone's death, is present here, no one shall meet with death. The great sages have invited the controller of death, Yamarāja, who is the representative of the Lord. Living beings who are under his grip should take advantage by hearing the deathless nectar in the form of this narration of the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. So the method is how to escape death? To be engaged in hearing the transcendental pastimes of the Lord as described in this Bhagavatam. Then Yamarāja will not touch us. Then what happens? Yamarāja will not touch us. Yamarāja will not drag us out of this body for another term of material existence in another body. No. Then what happens? Actually, when the time comes for quitting the body, Kṛṣṇa will take us to His personal abode for eternal life, full of bliss and knowledge. Not that we are going to continue in this body beyond the lifespan. No. That is not the program. That's not the spiritual program.

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "The surest remedy for avoiding death is to accustom oneself to hearing the nectarean pastimes of the Lord as they are systematically narrated in the text of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of hearing Srimad Bhagavatam daily to conquer death, highlighting the distinction between the perishable body and the eternal soul.

Don't mistake. Don't mistakenly think that I'm going to live in this body forever. This body is perishable. antavanta ime deha nityasyokta śarīrinaha. The soul inside the body is eternal. This body is perishable. So in the Purport Śrīla Prabhupāda says, Every human being dislikes meeting death, but he does not know how to get rid of death. The surest remedy for avoiding death is to accustom oneself to hearing the nectarean pastimes of the Lord as they are systematically narrated in the text of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. So we have begun everyday Bhāgavatam, little, little, little. You keep hearing. In this way you can conquer death. That's what is being said here. It is advised herein, therefore, that any human being who desires freedom from death should take to this course of life as recommended by the rishis headed by Saunaka. Every day hear Bhāgavatam. Therefore we have entitled this series as Daily Evening Bhāgavatam Discourse. Of course, in every ISKCON center, there is a program of daily morning Bhāgavatam class. That's also available. But those who cannot attend that daily morning Bhāgavatam class, either in the temple or online, we have this Daily Evening Bhāgavatam class. So at least evening you can attend. So this is the way to conquer death.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "When he sees that we are eager to hear Kṛṣṇa kathā in the Bhāgavatam, then he cleanses our desire for material enjoyment."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how hearing Bhagavatam purifies the heart and removes desires for material enjoyment through Krishna's mercy, mentioning the three important incarnations in Kali Yuga: Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Srimad Bhagavatam, and the Hare Krishna mantra.

Now how does it work? Simply if I hear Bhāgavatam, how do I become deathless? What does this hearing Bhāgavatam do? We have already discussed this in the first canto, second chapter. śṛṇvatāṁ śukathāḥ kṛṣṇahaḥ puṇyaḥ śravaṇaḥ kīrtanaḥ hṛdyantastohi abhadrāṇi vidhunoti surucatām. Krishna is seated in our heart. When he sees that we are eager to hear Kṛṣṇa kathā in the Bhāgavatam, then he cleanses our desire for material enjoyment. It is Kṛṣṇa's blessing, Kṛṣṇa's mercy for those who hear Bhāgavatam, because Bhāgavatam is another incarnation of Kṛṣṇa in this Kali Yuga. Kali Yuga three incarnations are very important. The first incarnation which is important in Kali Yuga is the incarnation of Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. He teaches us simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and hear Bhāgavatam and take prasādam and thereby prepare yourself to go back to Godhead. Then the second incarnation of the Supreme Lord in Kali Yuga is this Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. It contains narrations about Kṛṣṇa and His pure devotees. Simply hearing this every day will purify you and make you eligible to go back to Godhead at the end of this life. And the third incarnation is the incarnation of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, the holy name of the Supreme Lord in the form of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra. So these three incarnations are very, very important. So here, specific recommendation is hear the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam every day.

**Key Quote:** "The purpose of this body is simply to engage in devotional service to Kṛṣṇa and thereby become free from all desires for extending our material existence into another material body after quitting this body."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating the importance of hearing Bhagavatam, chanting Hare Krishna, and accepting Prasadam to purify oneself, realize one's spiritual identity, and ultimately return to Godhead.

At your convenience you can hear. If you can't hear live, then later on you can always hear. But hear every day little, little, little, little, little. This is important. And then you become purified. Your heart becomes cleansed of all misgivings. And then you understand that you are not the body. You realize that. And then when you realize you are not the body, you understand what is the purpose of this body. The purpose of this body is simply to engage in devotional service to Kṛṣṇa and thereby become free from all desires for extending our material existence into another material body after quitting this body. Don't extend. After life in this body is completed, straight go to Kṛṣṇa's abode in your spiritual body. So to uncover the spiritual body before death comes, it is possible by this practice of hearing Bhāgavatam every day. It is possible by daily chanting and hearing Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra. It is possible by daily accepting Prasādam. In this way you can prepare yourself. And you'll be guaranteed if you do this every day little, little, little, little, little, you're guaranteed to go back to Godhead at the end of this life. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and contrasts intelligent people who hear Bhagavatam with lazy, less intelligent people who waste the opportunity of human life.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 9th verse of the 16th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Mandasya Mandasya Prajnasya Vayo Mandayushas Chavai Nidrayahriyate Enaktam Divacha Vyartakarmabhihi. The meaning of this verse is: Lazy human beings with paltry intelligence and a short duration of life pass the night sleeping and the day performing activities that are for naught. So here, the description is being given by Shounaka Rishi. There are the intelligent people who engage in hearing Bhagavatam and escape the slaughtering process of Yamaraj, they escape death, they pass on from this body to Krishna's abode for eternal life, and then there are lazy, less intelligent, foolish human beings also who miss out the rare opportunity in the human form of life to put an end to this suffering of death and disease and

old age. They are described here. First of all, their characteristic is such unfortunate people are lazy. They are lazy, especially they are lazy when it comes to exerting oneself to hear Bhagavatam, lazy when it comes to chanting Hare Krishna, lazy when it comes to avoiding sinful activities, they're lazy. And another characteristic is paltry inclinations, paltry intelligence, very, very little brain substance, they're less intelligent. They're less intelligent. Now, less intelligent, does it mean that some people are born less intelligent, so what can they do? No, this is not what is meant by less intelligent. Less intelligent means they misuse their intelligence for material sense enjoyment. They don't utilize their intelligence for spiritual activities, for spiritual knowledge. They don't use their intelligence properly. That's the meaning here. Please don't misunderstand this. And the third characteristic is that life in Kali Yuga is characterized by short duration, and even that short duration of life they are wasting, completely losing out all the time available in this human body. In what way? At night they are simply engaged in sleeping, and in the daytime they are engaged in useless activities which are not at all helpful for their conquering death, that are not meant for conquering death, that are not meant for gaining eternal life. They are simply a waste of time. So Prabhupada describes about this

repeated birth and death. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita also: jaatas yahi dhruva mrtyur dhruvam janmam ritasya cha. One has taken birth in this material world, in a material body, sure to die. That means has to quit the body. Now, after taking birth one has to live for certain number of years and quit the body, that's called death. Now, after quitting the body, if one is not prepared to go back to Godhead, one has to again take birth: dhruvam janmam ritasya cha. Birth is certain, another body, another term of suffering and misery. So this is called entanglement in the repetition of birth and death. So to get out of this is possible in the human form of life, and how do you take benefit of this human form of life to get out of the cycle of birth and death?

**Summary:** The speaker criticizes the pursuit of economic development and sense enjoyment, highlighting the temporary nature of material happiness.

So such people, they become more interested in so-called economic development, work very hard throughout life simply for sense enjoyment of the temporary body. This body anyway is going to perish, it is simply meant for suffering, suffering something, but though they don't like suffering, they think I can overcome this suffering by replacing suffering with some material pleasure, and they have devised so many ways of trying to get some material pleasure by sense enjoyment. So we have senses, the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, and the skin, and we also have the genitals, we have the belly, we have the voice, we have hands, we have legs, all this, all these senses for the materialistic persons, for the less intelligent persons, for the foolish persons, for the lazy persons, for the unfortunate persons, simply they want to use these for enjoying, enjoying, enjoying, enjoying material happiness, material, material, and what they don't realize is by the laws of nature every creature including the lower animals, birds, worms, insects, the aquatics, the plants, every living being is allowed by nature to enjoy certain type of sense pleasure. Don't think human beings are the only one who are enjoying life and materially, even the hogs and dogs are enjoying this, this particularly pointed out by bhagavata,

**Key Quote:** "even the hogs and dogs are enjoying this particularly pointed out by bhagavata"
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of a hog enjoying stool to illustrate that sense pleasure is available in all forms of life, not just human life.

the stool eating hog, wit varaha, so stool eating hog, it eats rubbish, but it relishes that, it becomes fat, it takes lot pleasure in that, and we as human beings will look at the hog and say what a an abominable creature, dirty, filthy, how can it enjoy eating some filly stool, rubbish, rejected stuff, but the hog doesn't think like we think, so it is enjoying in its own way, every creature is enjoying it's own way, but that doesn't mean they're only enjoying all the time, know suffering by miseries inflicted upon them by material nature. So therefore, Prabhupada says, one should definitely try to understand that sense enjoyment is not the ultimate goal of human life.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the momentary and unsatisfying nature of sense enjoyment with the eternal and natural pleasure of the soul.

It is available anyway in all forms of creature. Herein it is said that during the daytime one works for nothing. When it is said one works for nothing means there is only one goal ultimately of all materialistic persons. They work simply for sense enjoyment, that's all. But that sense enjoyment is not at all giving us happiness or real pleasure. That's all. It doesn't give us happiness or pleasure, because it is a sensation by sense contact which is momentary, which is just for the short moment that there is contact. Just like you place one piece of sweet on your tongue, that contact, supposing you like that sweet, that sweet taste. Moment the contact there is some sensation of sweet taste, ah, so nice. But can you keep on telling, oh very nice, sweet taste, very nice, sweet taste, very nice, sweet taste, very nice, sweet taste, very nice. Can you keep on telling like that? No. That sweet taste, the sensation will last only for a moment. And then after that you have to place one more piece of sweet for one more sensation by contact. samsparishvaja bhoga. This is described in Bhagavad Gita. This material pleasure is nothing but the sense contact producing a sensation for a moment which we think is oh so nice, so enjoyable, so pleasure. But this is waste of time. There is spiritual happiness which is not momentary, which is not by sense contact, which is the natural pleasure of the soul,

**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of the verse, highlighting the mistreatment of cows and bulls by an unqualified ruler.

The meaning of this verse is, Suta Goswami said, after reaching that place, Maharaja Pariksit observes that, Maharaj Pariksit observes that, that a lower caste Shudra dressed like a king was beating a cow and a bull with a club as if they had no owner. So the previous chapter ended with the description that while the, while Mother Earth and the personality of religious principles Dharma, Dharini and Dharma were engaged in conversation, the saintly king Pariksit reached that place and now the description continues. What did Pariksit observe when he reached that place? He saw that this Kali Purusha, that this Kali Purusha, he is dressed like a king, but actually he doesn't have the qualification of a king. He is not a qualified Kshatriya according to the Vedic understanding. He is actually unqualified person, but he is dressed like a king, means he is trying to occupy the post of the ruler or the, or the King without qualification. And it was also very clear that the Kshatriyas are meant for protecting the citizens and the domestic animals, but here we see this person, he is dressed like a king and then he is dressed like a king, dressed like a king, but he is beating a cow and a bull as if they had no owner.

**Key Quote:** "The principal sign of the age of Kali is that lower caste's shudras, men without personal culture and men without spiritual initiation would be dressed like administrators or Kings"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the verse, defining 'shudra' not by birth but by lack of culture and spiritual initiation, and connecting it to unqualified leaders in Kali Yuga.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, what does this mean for us who are living in Kali Yuga? It has got a lot of significance this description here. The principal sign, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, the principal sign of the age of Kali is that lower caste's shudras, what does it mean lower caste shudras, men without aristocratical culture and men without spiritual initiation would be dressed like administrators or Kings and the principal business of such non-Ksatria rulers would be to kill the investors. Innocent animals, especially the cows and bulls, who shall be unprotected by their masters, the bona fide vices, the mercantile community. Sushila Prabhupada clearly explains a often misunderstood terminology. In the Vedic scriptures, in the description of the varana and ashrama system of dharma, it is described that the society should be divided according to occupational duties and according to spiritual development into four varanas and four ashramas, four social orders and four spiritual orders. Now, this varana classification has become completely topsy-turvy in this Kali Yuga because of the misunderstanding that one belongs to a varana according to birth in a certain family, which is not. What is explained in the scriptures, clearly in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says, the quality based on qualifications, based on the qualities possessed by a person, that person should be classified according to the qualities and according to the occupational duties. The one who performs the same occupation according to the work he performs, according to the natural inclination to work in a certain way, a person should actually be classified as a brahmana, kshatriya, vaishya or shudra. So very clearly who are to be classified as shudras, those who do not have brahmanical culture and they do not have spiritual initiation. Sushila Prabhupada explains. That means they are more or less godless people and they are bereft of the brahmanical culture. They are uncultured. According to Vedic description, they are uncultured. So, uncultured, godless people are to be classified as Shudras. Not according to birth. Regardless of which type of family they take birth in, it doesn't matter. If they are uncultured, if they are godless, then they are to be classified as Shudras. Such people will be considered as Shudras. They will be dressed like administrators or kings. This is the sign of Kalyuga.

**Key Quote:** "These animals will be unprotected. So, therefore these administrators can freely kill without anybody questioning them."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the role of Vaishyas in protecting cows and bulls, and the consequences of their absence in Kali Yuga.

And these administrators who are unqualified, but somehow they have managed to occupy the post of the administrator. They will simply indulge in killing innocent animals, especially the cow and the bull. And these cows and bulls will be killed by such unqualified administrators because such cows and bulls which are meant to be protected by the Vaishya class, the mercantile community in the Vedic culture. These animals will be unprotected. They will be unprotected. So, therefore these administrators can freely kill without anybody questioning them. Without the animals, innocent animals who give lot of service to the human society, not getting any protection. They are helpless. They are innocent. They are helpless. So, this is the situation. Even in this age of Kali, that we are finding it right now in our present times. Exact description given in the Srimad Bhagavatam. So, Srila Prabhupada further says, In the Bhagavad Gita, in the 18th chapter, in the 44th verse, it is said, that the Vaishyas are meant to deal in agriculture, cow protection and trade. Krishi, Goraksha, Vaanijjam, Vaishya, Karma, Swabhavajam. By their acquired nature. There are certain class of people in the civilized human society who are meant to deal in three things. Krishi or agriculture. Goraksha, cow protection. Goraksha. And Vaanijja, trade, commerce.

**Summary:** The speaker criticizes the modern Vaishyas who exploit cows for milk and then send them to slaughterhouses, neglecting their duty of protection.

So, the cow protection was specifically entrusted to the Vaishyas in the Vedic culture. Now, there are no qualified Vaishyas. So, therefore, the cows are not getting the protection that they deserve. And in this age of Kali, the degraded Vaishyas, the mercantile men, are engaged in supplying cows to slaughterhouses. As long as the cow gives milk, they keep the cow and take the milk and do business with milk and milk products. And when the cow stops giving milk, send it to the slaughterhouse. This is their business. Not that the cow has given so much service and it should be given protection. No such consideration at all. Merciless, heartless, cruel people. Very, very mean-minded. Right? Yes. And it is said in the scriptures that the Kshatriyas, the qualified Kshatriyas, are meant to protect the citizens of the state. Whereas the Vaishyas are meant to protect the cows and bulls and utilize them to produce grains and milk. So, both the humans and the cows and bulls require protection because human form of life is very, very important for it affords the opportunity for self-realization. And cows and bulls are especially meant for producing grains and milk. And the cow gives a lot of service.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the immense value of cows, highlighting the usefulness of their milk, urine, dung, and even their horns and skin after death, and condemns cow killing as a grave sin leading to suffering.

Every part of the cow is very, very useful. Even the cow, the urine and stool of the cow is very useful for human society. Goarka. Cow urine is called Goarka. It has got a lot of medicinal properties. It can be used in so many ways. So many useful ways for human beings. And the cow dung is first-class medicine. It is first-class manure. It is the best fuel for dried cow dung cakes. And it helps in so many ways. So many ways the cow dung can be used. It has got antiseptic properties. When cow dung cake, dried cake is burnt, it drives away mosquitoes. That smoke drives away mosquitoes. So like that, there are innumerable benefits of cow dung and cow urine. Such an animal is very, very, very useful. After the cow dies a natural death, the horn of the cow, the horns of the cow are very useful. The skin of the cow is very useful, very useful also. So cow is so valuable. The cow tail, the tail of the cow is also very useful. So like this, the cow is such a useful animal. And most importantly, the cow gives us milk, which is the most precious food substance for human beings, especially for human beings. So such animals should never be killed. Should never be killed. So that is the Vedic injunction. And it is the greatest sin to kill the cow. Gohatya is the greatest sin. And people have to suffer in very horrible ways by the laws of nature imposed on such foolish people, ignorant people, merciless people, cruel people. By nature, by God, through the material nature, this punishment will be enforced. People have to suffer. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "The next symptom of the age of Kali is that principles of religion which are all spotlessly white like the white lotus flower will be attacked by the uncultured Shudra population of the age."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the bull represents religious principles and the Shudra represents the uncultured population of Kali Yuga who attack these principles.

So further descriptions of the age of Kali is being given here by Suta Goswami, Srila Suta Goswami. The bull is actually the personality of religious principles, Dharma, in the shape, in the formality, in the form of a bull. The personality of religious principles has appeared in order to give us a message. Now Srila Prabhupada explains what is the significance of this bull being described as as white as a white lotus flower. The purpose, Srila Prabhupada says, the next symptom of the age of Kali is that principles of religion, which are all spotlessly white, like the white lotus flower, will be attacked by the uncultured Shudra population of the age. In the scriptures it is said, Kalau Shudra Sambhavaha, in Kali Yuga majority of the population will be of the Shudra category. Shudra category means uncultured, uncultured. They don't follow the cultural principles.

**Key Quote:** "Without such a purificatory process, the children born will be uncultured, will have criminal mentality."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of cultural purification rituals like Garbha Dhana for conceiving good children, contrasting it with the lack of such practices in Kali Yuga, leading to an uncultured population.

They don't have a system for purification of the contamination due to this age. Just like to beget a child according to scriptural directions or injunctions, one should follow what is called as a Garbha Dhana. Garbha Dhana is a ritual where the parents, before they combine to conceive a child, they undergo cultural purification. They prepare their consciousness to attract a good soul to take shelter of good parents. Without such a purificatory process, the children born will be uncultured, will have criminal mentality. So this is very, very important that the parents should prepare themselves to beget good class of population, to beget good children. Now because in Kalyuga these principles are not followed, so the majority of the population is of the Shudra quality, means uncultured, contaminated by bad qualities like that.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that in Kali Yuga, the uncultured Shudra population defies religious principles due to a lack of education and Vedic wisdom.

So I think this is very important that the parents should prepare themselves to beget good class of population, to beget good children. Now because in Kalyuga these principles are not followed, so the majority of the population is of the Shudra quality, means uncultured, contaminated by bad qualities like that. So the principles of religion are compared to a white lotus flower, means they are spotless, they are perfect. But in Kalyuga, the Shudra class of people who are uncultured, they will not follow the religious principles as it is. So Prabhupada says how they actually spoil the religious principles. Prabhupada says in the purport, they may be descendants of Brahmana or Kshatriya forefathers, but in this age of Kali, for want of sufficient education and culture of Vedic wisdom, such a Shudra like population will defy the principles of religion. They will not follow the principles of religion. They will go against it, or they won't care for it. Or they will say, we don't believe in such and such religious principles. Religious principles are not a question of belief. That is what people should understand. Just like when we live in a civilized state, the state

**Key Quote:** "This sort of attitude is killing the whole vitality of the human population in this age of Kali."
**Summary:** The speaker compares following religious principles to obeying state laws, highlighting how defiance and lack of Vedic knowledge contribute to the decline of society in Kali Yuga.

laws are to be followed by all civilized people, all cultured people. Good citizens means they are law-abiding. It is not that I don't believe in some rules and regulations which are given by the state, or I don't like to follow, or I don't think I should care about them, or I just don't bother about them. I do whatever I like to do. This sort of attitude is killing the whole vitality of the human population in this age of Kali. So these are, these kind of people are actually upstarts. They actually are less intelligent, though they pose themselves as very, very intelligent. They may claim like that, that they are very intelligent, because they put forward all kinds of arguments against following religious principles. But they are actually uneducated, uncultured, they are less intelligent, they are foolish, and they suffer the consequences of not taking the Vedic wisdom. They don't have sufficient education in the proper way. They don't have proper system of Vedic knowledge. Neither they have the culture of the Vedic wisdom. They don't have good habits, good practices, good traditions. They don't have any of those. So they will defy the principles of religion. And persons who are religiously endowed will be terrified by such things.

They also harass others who want to follow the religious principles. They will decry them. They will put them down. They will harass them. They will trouble them. They will give all sorts of lame excuses for not following the religious principles. And such people, the uncultured, uneducated, less intelligent people, will declare themselves as adherents of no religious principles, and many isms and cults will spring up in Kali Yuga only to kill this spotless bull of religion. That means real religious principles nobody will follow, most people will not follow, but they will declare that they have their own religious beliefs, they are their own religious system that they want to follow because state also gives freedom. Freedom means you can do whatever you like in the name of

**Summary:** The speaker criticizes the proliferation of unfounded religious systems in Kali Yuga, using the example of animal killing to illustrate the lack of a proper basis for these systems and the secular nature of the state.

religion, so why one religious system says you should not kill innocent animals, another system will say, oh, as far as eating habits are concerned, that's the person's choice. Some people like to eat vegetables, some people like to eat meat, so they will kill animals for eating the flesh of the animal. They say our religious system does not prohibit, your religious system may prohibit, but we don't think it is sinful to kill innocent animals, helpless animals, even though there is plenty of fruits and vegetables and grains without harming any animal you can eat. But no, they don't want, they don't want to restrict themselves, though they also eat fruits, vegetables. If they want to eat vegetables, they don't want to restrict themselves, though they also eat fruits, vegetables. If they like this is our choice, we eat what we like to eat. So this is the nature of the people in Kali Yuga and these different so-called religious systems will be so many curbs without any foundation, without any proper understanding, without any proper basis, irrational, unreasonable sort of arguments or basis, whimsical. They will have their own so-called religious system. The state will be declared to be

secular or without any particular principle of religion. See, the religious principles are not to be based on some people's whims and fancies. That can never be the proper system within a state. But in Kali Yuga, in the name of secularism there will be no religious principles which are proper principles which will be followed by people. As a result there will be total indifference to the real principles of religion. Nobody cares. Like the real religious principle is to tell the truth, but now they don't care whether they are telling the truth or not. They don't care, lies. As it suits them, if they want to tell truth, they want to be truthful, they are truthful. If they don't want to be truthful, they are not truthful. That's all. They don't care. So like this, the indifference to the actual religious principles. The citizens will be free to act as they like without respect for sadhu, shastra and guru. There are three standards according to our Vedic tradition. Sadhu means the saintly persons who are completely well established in following the religious principles and teaching them to the others because they are solidly well established in understanding, getting trained, getting educated, having knowledge, having certain good practices and having a sober mind, such saintly people, sadhu, no regard for them, no respect for them in this Kali Yuga. Shastra is the authentic bona fide scriptures, especially the Vedic literature. People don't care for the Vedic literature, what is explained in the Vedas. The truth, the actual facts of life, of this material world, of material existence, that they don't care. And guru, the bona fide spiritual master, though there are many gurus, but the bona fide spiritual masters are ignored, neglected, they are not given respect. So, the bulls

Then they say, don't bring in that, because they have no understanding as to how God consciousness is directly linked up with the peace and prosperity of this human society. That they do not know.

**Summary:** This segment introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains how the cow represents mother earth and the exploitation of resources in Kali Yuga.

In this session, we are discussing from the third verse of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Gaamcha Dharma Dughaam Deenam Prasham Shudra Padahatam Vivatsam Ashruvadanam Ksham Maam Yavasam Ichchateem. The meaning of this verse is, although the cow is beneficial because one can draw religious principles from her, she was now rendered poor and calfless. Her legs were being beaten by a shudra. There were tears in her eyes, and she was distressed and weak. She was hankering after some grass in the field. Earlier, the condition of the bull was described. Now the condition of the cow is being described. Cow is representing mother earth, and how people in Kali Yugaam exploit the resources of material.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the importance of cow protection, drawing religious principles from the cow, and the nutritional value of cow's milk as a complete food.

The next part is a lot more interesting. The nature of the earth, and because of that, there are so many anomalies in this age. So the cow, particularly as an animal in human society, it is very, very important to protect the cow because one can draw religious principles from her. How is that? Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "The next symptom of the age of Kali is the distressed condition of the cow. Milking the cow means drawing the principles of religion in a liquid form." What is the meaning of this? Prabhupada explains further, "The great rishis and moneys would live only on milk. Milk is the only food which is complete, which provides complete nutrition for a human being. There is no other food item which gives natural food item which gives complete nutrition for

a human being except the cow's milk and of course the mother's milk. So the saintly persons would generally live only on milk, and particularly in the Bhagavatam, this is particularly described. Srila Shukadeva Goswami would go to a householder while he was milking a cow, and he would simply take a little quantity of that milk for his subsistence. And Srila Prabhupada particularly says here, even 50 years ago, Prabhupada was writing this purport sometime in the 60s, that means in the beginning of the 20th century, Prabhupada says, "No one would deprive a sadhu of a quart or two of milk." This quart is a volume measure. Quart means about a liter. So no one would deprive a sadhu of 1 liter of milk, and every householder would give milk like water. They would freely supply that milk to the householder and then the milk would be given to the

So Srila Prabhupada says, "For a Sanatanist, a follower of Vedic principles, it is the duty of every householder to have cows and bulls as household paraphernalia, not only for drinking milk but also for deriving religious principles." The milk is complete nutrition. It is very, very nutritious food, but beyond just that, from the cow you can derive religious principles. How's that? Srila Prabhupada says, "The Sanatanist worships cows on religious principles and respects Brahmanas." The prayer we offer to Krishna: namo brahmanya devaya go Brahmana hita ayutya. Krishna wants to see that the cows and the Brahmanas are given special protection, special protection. In general, the animals and the humans have to be protected by the king, but among the animals, the cows should be given special protection, and among the human beings, the Brahmanas should be given special protection because both the cow and the Brahmanas actually ensure peace and prosperity in

So the human society is totally dependent for its prosperity and subsistence on the cows and the Brahmanas.

Now, further Srila Prabhupada says, the cow's calf, the young one of the cow, not only is beautiful to look at but also gives satisfaction to the cow, and the cow delivers as much milk as possible when the calf is properly protected and the cow is able to have the calf with her. But in Kali Yuga, the calves are separated from the cows as early as possible for purposes which cannot be mentioned in these pages of the Srimad Bhagavatam. They don't want to allow especially the male calves to remain and to survive because a cow may give birth to a male calf or a female calf. But they want only the female calf because they can milk it. Whereas the male calf, they don't know how to utilize the bull, the male calf. When it grows, it can actually produce grains. It can do so many things, so many things. But because they do not know how to engage the bulls, they provide milk to the cow. They give them milk but they don't want to do that. They allow the cow to get the milk of the cow and give them protection and utilize them in a proper way.

**Summary:** This segment details the sinful acts of separating calves from cows, artificially milking cows, and sending them to slaughterhouses, linking these actions to societal problems.

Therefore, they don't allow these calves to survive, to remain, especially male calves. The cow stands with tears in her eyes and the shuttle milkman draws milk from the cow artificially. The cow will give milk only after the calf has taken its share. The cow will be satisfied to give plenty of milk. But now the calf is not allowed to drink the cow's milk at all, and the calf is separated from the cow very, very early. And how do they make the cow give milk? They force the cow to give milk. They will use a pump, artificial pump to suck out the milk from the cow. The cow is unwilling to give when the calf is not there. And when there is no milk, the cow is sent to be slaughtered. The cow will give milk for some number of years. After it becomes old, it stops giving milk and immediately send it to the slaughterhouse for being slaughtered. The cow is then butchered for cow flesh.

These greatly sinful acts are responsible for all the troubles in the present society. Very, very sinful. To kill the cow, to kill the male calf, doesn't even have a chance of surviving, living its normal lifespan. And people do not understand that this is very, very sinful. It means the laws of nature will work regardless of whether people have belief or people are educated or uneducated. And people have to suffer in so many ways. People do not know what they are doing in the name of economic development. They are just concerned with somehow making money, but they do not realize that while it is not entirely wrong to strive for economic development or earning money, but the way it is done is if it is not in accordance with the laws of nature, the laws of God, then people have to suffer so much.

**Summary:** This segment concludes by emphasizing the importance of cow and bull protection for peace, prosperity, and happiness in society, advocating for a Brahmanical culture where cows and Brahmanas are protected.

The consequences of violating God's laws. The influence of Kali will keep the people in this age in the darkness of ignorance. Despite all endeavors for peace and prosperity, they must try to see the cows and the bulls happy in all respects. If you want to be happy as a human being, you should ensure that cows and bulls are protected and they are happy in all respects. Otherwise, if the cows and bulls are not happy, they are not given proper protection, human beings have to suffer and there will be no peace and prosperity in human society where cows and bulls are particularly not properly protected. Foolish people do not know how one can earn happiness by making the cows and bulls happy, but it is a fact by laws of nature. The laws of nature people do not know. They are doing some research to find out. Some research to find out how things are working in nature, but they do not have the authoritative knowledge from the perfect source, from God to the Vedas. Let us take it from the authority of Srimad Bhagavatam and adopt the principles for the total happiness of human society. So Bhagavatam teaches us that we should have this Brahmanical culture, whereby Brahmanas are protected, Brahmanas direct the society and the cows are protected and the cows are giving us wonderful milk and they are happy in every respect, so that there is peace and prosperity in human society.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verses from Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on Maharaj Pariksit's role as a qualified Kshatriya challenging the influence of Kali.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudhirayet. In this session we are discussing from two verses, the fourth and fifth verses of the 17 Chakras, the first chapter of the first canto of Sriman Bhagavatam. The fourth verse is as follows: Paprachya Ratham Aarudhaha Kartasvara Paricchadam Megha Gambhir Raya Vacha Samaropita Karmukaha. The meaning of this verse is, Maharaj Pariksit, well equipped with arrows and bow and seated on a gold embossed chariot, spoke to him, the shudra, with a deep voice sounding like thunder. Pariksit Maharaj came to that spot, he noticed that Kali Purusha was actually beating an innocent carbon bull, and he immediately, with a deep voice sounding like thunder, he questioned this low class, unqualified person, and Pariksit's words will be described in the next two verses. So in the Parpochila, Prabhupada says an administrative head or king like Maharaj Pariksit with full majestic authority, well equipped with weapons to chastise miscreants, can challenge the agents of the age of Kali. Pariksit is a qualified Kshatriya. He has got the courage to face such upstarts. He is well equipped to deal sufficient punishment to the miscreants and he has got his authority to enforce law and order. So he is competent to challenge the agents of the age of Kali.

**Key Quote:** "Unfortunately we don't have qualified Kshatriyas like Pariksit Maharaj in our present time."
**Summary:** The speaker laments the absence of qualified Kshatriyas in the present age and criticizes the ineffectiveness of modern leaders elected through degraded public votes.

And as opposed to this, in the absence of such strong executive heads, there is always disruption of tranquility. Unfortunately, we don't have qualified Kshatriyas like Pariksit Maharaj in our present time. If there is no qualified Kshatriya, then it is not possible to counteract the influence, evil influence of this degraded Kali Yuga. What is that evil influence of Kali Yuga? People are exposed to too much sinful activities. The atmosphere is surcharged with tendency to commit sins more and more without any restriction. So this sinful age, the sinful age Kali Yuga. So the absence of strong executive heads means people become more and more sinful. They are already sinful but they become more sinful without caring for any adverse effect by their sinful activities. They don't realise that. The elected show bottle executive head... Show bottle means he appears like an executive but he doesn't have qualification. He doesn't have strength, he doesn't have courage, he doesn't have knowledge, he doesn't have training, he doesn't have skills. How much he will have, etc, is beyond his level of application. Thus he is a not Ryan Pes politically nominated Kanna Akram started in May protests against the Indian Congress in 2016 before solidifying Akram on份 DNA. Such a person is called show-bottling skater. He is a representative of a degraded public because by votes a person becomes a ruler or a legislator or a governor by votes. And who is voting this person? He gets but he is supposed to get majority votes from people who are degraded themselves. They do not know what should be the qualification of a proper Chhatriya who can rule properly, they do not know. Neither the representative is actually qualified. And Prabhupada says such show bottle executive heads cannot be equal to the strong king like

#### Importance of Actions, Pariksit's Questioning, Kali Purusha, Twice-Born

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "It is one's actions which are counted. It is very important. The actions are important."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of actions over mere appearance, explaining Pariksit Maharaj's questioning of Kali Purusha and introducing the concept of 'twice-born' for Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas.

Maharaj Pariksit. You can never expect the situation now to be like what it was when Pariksit was ruling or Yudhishthira Maharaj was ruling. The dress or style of royal order does not count. It is one's actions which are counted. It is very important. The actions are important. According to the proper understanding a person will perform different activities. So those activities should be backed up by proper knowledge, by good culture. Then only those actions will be good for the welfare of the entire human society. The meaning of this verse is, O who are you? You appear to be strong and yet you dare kill within my protection those who are helpless. By your grace, you pose yourself to be a godly man, that means a king, Naradeva. But by your deeds, you are opposing the principles of the twice-born Kshatriyas. So Pariksit Maharaj is questioning this Kali Purusha, this personality of this age of Kali, that who are you? Because how dare you actually try to kill such helpless, innocent animals like the cow and the bull. Even though you appear like a godly person, a Kshatriya is supposed to be qualified and a god-conscious person. But you are not a godly person. You are a Kshatriya. Your dress is externally appealing like a Kshatriya, but your actions are totally opposed to those activities which are performed by a qualified Kshatriya. So in the Parpotsha Prabhupada says, the Brahmanas, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas are called twice-born, dvija. Dvija means they have two kinds of birth. For the two-born Kshatriyas, they are called the two-born Kshatriyas.

**Key Quote:** "Second birth is a cultural rejuvenation, reviving the spiritual culture. And how does it happen? It happens by spiritual initiation obtained from the bona fide Acharya, by spiritual initiation."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of second birth through spiritual initiation and discusses the Kshatriya's duty to protect the helpless, connecting it to the incarnation of the Lord to re-establish religious principles.

These classes of men, that is, Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, there is one birth by parental conjugation. Parents combine to conceive a child. That is the first birth. And there is another birth of cultural rejuvenation by spiritual initiation from the bona fide Acharya or spiritual master. So there is always second birth for those who are Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Vedic culture. What is second birth? Second birth is a cultural rejuvenation, reviving the spiritual culture. And how does it happen? It happens by spiritual initiation obtained from the bona fide Acharya, by spiritual initiation. So a Kshatriya is also twice born like a Brahmana. It is not only the Brahmanas who are having this second birth. It is also the Kshatriyas and the Vaishyas. The Kshatriya's duty is to give protection to the helpless humans. The Kshatriya king is considered to be representative of God to give protection to the helpless and chastise the miscreants. It is called Naradeva, because Deva because is the representative of God in human society. He is the representative of God in human society. He himself is a human being but he is meant to give protection to the human society by following the rules and regulations of the authoritative scriptures to administer properly to the human beings. Whereas in Kali Yuga there is no qualified Kshatriya. Whenever there are anomalies in the routine work by administrators there is an incarnation of the Lord to re-establish the principles of the Godly Kingdom. Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, I incarnate whenever there is neglect of religious principles and there is rise of irreligion.

**Key Quote:** "In the age of Kali, the poor helpless animals, especially the cows, which are meant to receive all sorts of protection from the administrative age, are killed without restriction."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the Lord's incarnations to protect the saintly and destroy miscreants, highlighting the lack of cow protection in Kali Yuga and criticizing administrators who are representatives of God in name only.

I incarnate. And when Krishna incarnates, whenever, wherever he incarnates, paritranaya sadhuna, he actually protects, saves the saintly persons, the law-abiding citizens or those following strict religious principles. And Vinashayaji Dushkrutami, he destroys these miscreants, these upstarts. In the age of Kali, the poor helpless animals, especially the cows, which are meant to receive all sorts of protection from the administrative age, are killed without restriction. Nobody is there to voice the concern for the cows. They are helpless. They are innocent, and they are being killed without any restriction. There is no one to protect them, no one to raise their voice against the cows being killed. Thus the administrative heads under whose noses such things happen are representatives of God in names only. The king is supposed to be a representative of God. But such kings or administrators who are not God-conscious, who have not undergone spiritual initiation, they are actually representatives of God in name only.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore in the age of Kali everyone is unhappy due to the maladministration of the state."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the worthlessness of unqualified leaders, the resulting maladministration, and the general unhappiness in Kali Yuga due to the lack of proper, trained Kshatriya rulers.

That means they are namesake administrators. They are not real administrators. Such powerful administrators are rulers of the poor citizens by dress or office. Simply they dress as if they are kings or administrators, but they don't have the proper knowledge, the proper authority to actually properly enforce the laws and the rules for ruling citizens. Factually they are worthless lower class men without cultural assets of the twice born. They don't have the culture to properly rule over the citizens. No one can expect justice or equality of treatment from once born spiritually uncultured lower class men. We can't expect when by votes some unqualified person comes and tries to carry out the administration, we cannot expect any real benefit. Therefore in the age of Kali everyone is unhappy due to the maladministration of the state. People in general are very unhappy in Kali. Therefore the people's government by the people who are not twice born must be a government of Kali in which everyone is unhappy. You see, people should be unhappy if they don't have a proper leader, proper trained Kshatriya to rule them. People must be unhappy, and there will be no peace and prosperity in such a state.

**Key Quote:** "As soon as one understands scientifically, factually, what is God, all his problems are solved."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the verse, emphasizing the difficulty in understanding God due to material attachment and highlighting the importance of describing Krishna's transcendental activities to help people understand.

What's the meaning of this verse? The transcendentalists are very compassionate upon the fallen souls of this world. In this world there are two kinds of people: people who are materially attached and people who are materially detached. Now, the Supreme Lord is unlimited; he is not a limited person like any of us. So that is where the difficulty lies in understanding properly who is God as a person. So Narada Muni is telling, even though God or Krishna appears like one of us, he is not at all limited like us. He is unlimited personality. Therefore, Narada Muni says only a very expert person who is limited is the one who is not limited, and who is not limited is the one who is limited, retired from the activities of material happiness, deserves to understand this knowledge of spiritual values. Knowledge about the Supreme Lord Krishna is completely spiritual; it has nothing to do with any material knowledge or material happiness or material things. It has nothing to do with material. So there are people who are materially attached and they can't easily understand who is Krishna, what is God, because as soon as one understands scientifically, factually, what is God, all his problems are solved, all his problems are solved. So therefore, how to understand God? So the transcendentalists like Narad Muni, Vyasa Deva, they are all thinking how to actually make people understand. So Narad Muni is telling here, those who are having material attachment, they should be shown the way of transcendentalism, transcendental realization by Vyasa Deva, and what is the method he is telling? Through descriptions of the transcendental activities of the Supreme Lord, exclusively describe Krishna's transcendental activities.

**Key Quote:** "Materially attached people cannot understand the nature of God. They have to become detached somehow or the other."
**Summary:** The speaker refers to Srila Prabhupada's explanation, stating that theological science is difficult, especially concerning God's transcendental nature, and that material attachment hinders understanding God.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, theological science is a difficult subject matter, especially when it deals with transcendental nature of God. Theological science means the science dealing with the subject matter of God. So the transcendental nature of God, God is the supreme person, is the original person, but he is a transcendental personality. So the transcendental nature of God is the original person, but he is a transcendental personality. What does he mean? Transcendental personality means he is not having a material body like we have. He is not under the clutches of the material nature. He is the master, he is the lord, he is the controller, he is above and is eternally so. Therefore, this subject matter of God as this transcendental person is not to be understood by persons who are too much attached to material activities, which is the nature of most common people. Majority of the people in this world, they are attached to material activities, that's their life. So materially attached people cannot understand the nature of God. They have to become detached somehow or the other. Now, if they have to become detached to understand who is God, then what is the way? Any of the traditional ways are very slow, very difficult, very tedious. So is there a quick way of becoming materially detached?

What is the way? So here it is said that first of all understand the point Prabhupada is telling, understand this point that expert people who are retired from materialistic activities by culture of spiritual knowledge, those who cultivate spiritual knowledge, they understand the worthlessness of all these materialistic activities. They are useless, they really don't give us any happiness, they have no eternal benefit, they are no benefit for the soul, they are simply some illusory activities which give some illusory happiness, feeling of happiness, no real happiness. So give those activities, retire from those activities, then they may be admitted to study this great science of the personality of God Krishna science.

#### perfection of life, material bondage, transcendental activities of Krishna

**Key Quote:** "Even such people, some or the other, if they hear this subject matter, describing exclusively the transcendental activities of Krishna, then that sound vibration enters their ears, penetrates the heart, and cleanses the heart of desire for material enjoyment."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Bhagavad Gita to emphasize the rarity of those seeking spiritual perfection and highlights how describing Krishna's transcendental activities can purify the hearts of even the materially attached.

Now, Bhagavad Gita clearly states, Manushyanam sahasreshu kashchit yatati siddhaye yatatam api siddhanam kashchinmam vetti tattvatah. What is the meaning of this verse? Although many hundreds and thousands of people, hardly there may be one or two people who are not in the spiritual world, one rare person who actually is interested in the perfection of life, human life. What is siddhi? What is the meaning of liberation from material bondage? Most people don't even know we are bound up in this material world, they don't know. So one who knows and also takes interest in how to get out of this material bondage, to put an end to all our material problems, such a person is a rare person. And among many thousands of transcendently realized persons, very, very, very, very few people can understand the theological science dealing with God as person. So this being the case, Vyasadeva is advised by Narada, describe the science of God by directly relating his transcendental activities. They are very attractive, they are wonderful, they work within the depths of the heart of conditioned souls. Even those who have no understanding, no interest, they are materially attached, even such people, some or the other, if they hear this subject matter describing exclusively the transcendental activities of Krishna, then that sound vibration enters their ears, penetrates the heart, and cleanses the heart of desire for material enjoyment. This is already described in the second chapter.

**Key Quote:** "Simply give oral reception, give your ears somehow to descriptions of the transcendental activities of Krishna, then it is going to bring about a change of heart, it is going to cleanse the heart."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that listening to descriptions of Krishna's activities purifies the heart and that Srimad Bhagavatam is the literary incarnation of Krishna.

Apadrani vidunoti, simply give oral reception, give your ears somehow to descriptions of the transcendental activities of Krishna, then it is going to bring about a change of heart, it is going to cleanse the heart, automatically you become purified of all material contamination. And it is also told here, Vyasadeva is the right person because he is expert in this science and he is also detached completely from material enjoyment. So he is the right person to describe this subject matter of the transcendental activities of Krishna, and Shukadeva Goswami, his son, is the right person to receive this knowledge, he is the right person to receive this knowledge. Therefore, Srimad Bhagavatam is the topmost theological science and it can act on the common people as a medicine. In the beginning, medicine, medicine means it may not be very palatable in the beginning, but the moment that medicine works, then people awaken their real interest in Krishna consciousness, in hearing about Krishna, Krishna's transcendental activities. And another important point Prabhupada says is this, transcendental activities of the Lord and the Lord himself, there is no difference because both are absolute, so.

**Key Quote:** "If the common people, they simply hear the Bhagavatam, they are able to associate directly with Krishna and they become gradually purified from all kinds of material contamination."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of hearing Srimad Bhagavatam for purification and association with Krishna, highlighting the various ways to broadcast Krishna's transcendental activities, as exemplified by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.

This literature, this Srimad Bhagavatam, is the literary incarnation of Krishna. Krishna is incarnated in the form of Bhagavatam in this Kali Yuga. Krishnae Swadhaamopagate Dharma Gyanadi Visaha, in the third chapter it was described that when Krishna went back after performing his pastimes, then this Bhagavatam has arisen as the brilliant sun which can dispel the dense darkness of Kali. So Bhagavatam is a very special literature, among all the Vedic literatures Bhagavatam is very special. So if the common people they simply hear the Bhagavatam, they are able to associate directly with Krishna and they become gradually purified from all kinds of material contamination. And those who are expert devotees, they should find ways and means to inject this transcendental descriptions of Krishna's activities into the ears of the common people. And there are so many intelligent ways in which this can be broadcast, not just one way, not just the standard way that there is a discourse and people sit in the discourse and try to hear when a learned person is speaking on the subject matter, not just that, there are so many ways, so many ways. And Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and his followers exhibited expert dexterity in doing this. And Narada Muni is telling that to Vyasadeva, kindly describe these activities and that way people can be actually benefited, they can get out of this material existence and suffering and be promoted to the highest perfection very easily. Hare Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 17th verse of the 5th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, emphasizing Narada Muni's strong statement about devotional service versus material duties.

Yet there is no danger of his being unsuccessful. On the other hand, a non-devotee, though fully engaged in occupational duties, does not gain anything." This is a very, very strong statement by Narada Muni, and we have to carefully understand this in order to really become serious about devotional service.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the two types of duties, material and spiritual, explaining how material duties create debt and karma, leading to repeated birth and death.

Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport. Before we go to the purport, just a point about this verse itself, that everybody as a human being has got two kinds of duties: material duties and spiritual duties. Material duties are connected with the body and the mind, the material body and the material mind, and they are based on the obligations that we have because of taking birth in a certain family, because of the facilities that we have to take birth there, are provided by the Devatas for our material existence in this body that we take. Because of the knowledge that we receive, Deva, Rishi, Bhuta, Aapta, Niranam, Pitranam, as soon as one takes birth as a human being, there are six different personalities to whom we are obligated. And if we do not perform our duties in relationship with our mind and body because we are taking so many benefits for our existence, we become debtors. We accrue some karma, and that karma forces us to again and again take birth, repetition of birth and death. So, materially we are obligated, and we have to discharge duties in order to liquidate our debt.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts material obligations with the liberation offered by surrendering to Krishna through pure devotional service, emphasizing the eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

But, the Srimad Bhagavatam declares that if anybody takes to devotional service, pure devotional service by completely surrendering to Krishna, such a person is completely freed from all material obligations simply because the person has surrendered to the lotus feet of Krishna and is engaged in pure devotional service. So, spiritual duties are meant for the liberation of the soul from material bondage. Nobody wants miseries. Nobody wants to suffer in this material world, but then they are forced to suffer. Miseries are forced upon a person. Now, what is the way out of these miseries? What is the way out of these fundamental problems of material existence? That is, doing our spiritual duties. Spiritual duties, ultimately the understanding is, as spirit soul, each one of us, irrespective of our karma, irrespective of the type of family we are born, irrespective of the type of past activities we might have done, good or bad, whatever, we are actually receiving all maintenance from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is our eternal well-wisher, with whom we have an eternal relationship.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "But here, Narad Muni is telling something very, very revolutionary, that if somebody is giving up the material duties, in order to engage in pure devotional service, as instructed in the Bhagavatam, that when you engage in pure devotional service by surrendering to Krishna, then you have no obligation, no material obligations at all."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the revolutionary idea that giving up material duties for pure devotional service can free one from obligations, and addresses the question of what happens if someone falls down from devotional service.

Under all circumstances, in all times, in all situations. So, spiritual duties are definitely very, very important. So, generally, people who are aware of these material duties and spiritual duties, they try to discharge both of them. Any civilized person will have some sense of responsibility for discharging material duties, and also will be doing some kind of worship of the Supreme, some kind of spiritual duties one will be discharging. But here, Narad Muni is telling something very, very revolutionary, that if somebody is giving up the material duties in order to engage in pure devotional service, as instructed in the Bhagavatam, that when you engage in pure devotional service by surrendering to Krishna, then you have no obligation, no material obligations at all. Then such a person, if such a person performs pure devotional service and becomes completely successful in getting ultimate liberation, then very good. The person is liberated, freed from all material contamination, purified, no more material obligations, and has attained the success in pure devotional service of getting ultimate liberation, going back home, back to Godhead. But what if they fall down after taking to pure devotional service? That happens when somebody is still in an immature stage. bhajan apapvo atha patetato yadi. Then they fall down means they give up devotional, pure devotional service, and they take to material life once again, which they had given up in order to do pure devotional service. Then what about this person's situation? Neither has he gained anything materially by engaging in pure devotional service, nor has that person been successful in doing his pure devotional service. So he is a loser both ways. So Narada Muni is telling, there is no loss for such a person who in an immature stage, after having taken to pure devotional service, gives up pure devotional service and goes back to material way of life. There is no loss at all. There is no loss. Why?

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "One is that whatever pure devotional service somebody performs, the credit, for having done that pure devotional service, is eternally attached to the soul."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that even if someone falls down from devotional service, the spiritual advancement made is permanent and attached to the soul, unlike the temporary benefits of material duties.

One is that whatever pure devotional service somebody performs, the credit for having done that pure devotional service is eternally attached to the soul. It is not connected to the body. The spiritual advancement that a person makes by rendering pure devotional service is attached to the soul. It is permanent. It is forever that credit is available. So such a person resumes pure devotional service any time in the future, will resume from the point where he or she has stopped pure devotional service. Supposing they make 2% advancement and then they give up pure devotional service. So next time they take up pure devotional service, whenever that is in the future, then they'll begin from 3%. It is never lost. Whereas, Narada Muni is telling, even if a person is a non-devotee and fully engages in occupational duties, whatever occupational duties the person does, all such occupational duties do not have any spiritual benefit for a non-devotee engaged in occupational duties. According to the Shastras we are talking, there is no spiritual benefit at all. And what about the material benefit one gets by doing some occupational duty? That is all temporary. It is all temporary. Just like with this body, whatever we may gain while working with this body, all that is just as long as this body is there, my wealth, my possessions, my relationships based on the body, my material knowledge, material power, material position, everything is finished the moment this body is, life on this body is over. When I quit the body, I cannot take my money with me, I cannot take my degrees with me, I cannot take my power with me, my position with me, my influence with me, nothing I can take. So what is the gain? Oh, in this life, because he worked very hard, he could enjoy some nice power, nice position. Oh, that enjoyment is illusory happiness. Illusory happiness. It's not real happiness. It is not real satisfaction.

**Key Quote:** "There is an instance of one Bharat Maharaj. He performed, he gave up his kingdom and went to a holy place and he was practicing pure devotional service. And then, towards the end of his life, he became attached to a deer and he died thinking of the deer."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the lack of lasting satisfaction in material pursuits and provides examples of Bharat Maharaj and Chitraketu to illustrate that even those who fall down from devotional service are not lost.

It has nothing to do with soul happiness, soul satisfaction. Deep within, there is no satisfaction. Even if one is getting some material pleasure or material enjoyment or material happiness, deep within there is nothing that is worthwhile that one can experience. So, here it is said that there are instances in history of somebody who performed pure devotional service and fell down. There is an instance of one Bharat Maharaj. He performed, he gave up his kingdom and went to a holy place, and he was practicing pure devotional service. And then, towards the end of his life, he became attached to a deer, and he died thinking of the deer. So, he took birth, next birth, as a deer. But, because he had done pure devotional service, the Lord was kind enough to give him memory of what he did in his previous life. In the body of a deer, he was able to remember. And in that body of a deer, he was associating with saintly persons and hearing their discourses. He was not interested in eating or sleeping or nothing, even in the body of a deer. Similarly, there is an instance of Chitraketu who actually committed some offense at the feet of Shiva, and he fell down. But, next life, he was delivered. He realized his mistake, and he was delivered. Next life, even though he took birth as a demon, in the body of a demon, not as a demon, in the body of a demon, he was delivered, completely delivered. He got ultimate liberation. He was given memory by the Supreme Lord. So, there is no loss if one falls down. But, if one does occupational duties without doing pure devotional service, there is no gain at all. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

In this session, we will be discussing the 18th verse of the 5th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The translation of this verse, as given by Srila Prabhupada: "Persons who are actually intelligent and philosophically inclined should endeavor only for that purposeful end which is not obtainable, even by wandering from the topmost planet, Brahmaloka, down to the lowest planet, Patala. As far as happiness derived from sense enjoyment is concerned, it can be obtained automatically in course of time, just as in course of time we obtain miseries even though we do not desire them."

**Key Quote:** "It is pure devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that pure devotional service is the ultimate goal, unattainable through material pursuits in any part of the universe, from Brahmaloka to Patala.

So, the previous verse was, we were discussing, that there is no loss in pure devotional service even if one does not complete it in one lifetime, achieve the 100% success of perfection. But, another point that is being made now is that those who are intelligent human beings, intelligent human beings who are philosophically inclined, they question, "Who am I? What is this world?" Such fundamental questions they are able to raise. Such people, Narada Muni is telling, should endeavor only for one purposeful end. What is that? That which is not obtainable in any place, in any place within the whole universe, from the topmost planet, Brahmaloka, up to the bottom most, Patala. By wandering anywhere, you cannot get that which you cannot get. What is that which is not available from the topmost planet, up to the bottom most, Patala, Brahmaloka to Patala?

**Key Quote:** "It is miseries and mixed material happiness."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how material happiness and distress are available everywhere, varying based on past karma and circumstances, but ultimately limited and mixed with suffering.

By dint of one's past karma, whatever happiness one can get, whatever material facilities one can get in different planets, in different circumstances, in different types of good work, now that is available differently in different places. Even people who do different kinds of activities, they enjoy different kinds of facilities. So just like even in this life we can see in our own situation, when we see other people in our own neighborhood, there are some people who are born with not so much of facilities or benefits. Somebody is born in a very poor family, or somebody is born in a very rich family. Somebody is born with good material intelligence. Somebody is born with not so good material intelligence, not so much of material intelligence. So we see variations. But in any case, whatever benefits they may have by birth, or they may acquire knowledge in this life by working very hard, or they may acquire wealth, or they may acquire a nice position, power, influence, whatever they may get, or whatever they already have, it can only give them some material happiness. It is miseries and mixed material happiness.

**Key Quote:** "Two features of existence in this material world is miseries and mixed happiness."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the inevitability of suffering in material existence, even in higher planets, due to the influence of the three gunas and the inherent miseries of birth, death, disease, and old age.

Miseries you cannot avoid. Even in Brahmaloka, the four fundamental problems, janma-mṛtyu-jarāvyādhi-dukkha-doṣānudarśanam, birth, death, disease, old age, associated with birth in the material world, anywhere, any planet, with however much good karma, one cannot avoid these four fundamental problems. And, the three-fold miseries are always there everywhere. Material existence means the three gunas are acting, and the three-fold miseries are always there: Adi-bhautika, adhyatmika, adidaivika klesha. Misery is due to one's own body and mind, misery is due to other living beings, and misery is due to supernatural forces of nature. So, the Bhagavata is telling, this verse is telling, don't endeavor for material happiness, or material facilities, or material enjoyment, which is available even for the dogs and hogs. Of course, according to their standard, according to the body and mentality they have, they have their own enjoyment. And, many gods are enjoying on a different scale, or different level. In their own heavenly planets, they have their own long span of life, they have beautiful body, they have material power, they have influence, and they have facilities. But, two features of existence in this material world is miseries and mixed happiness. It's available everywhere, for every living being.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts material pursuits with pure devotional service, which offers eternal life, bliss, and knowledge, emphasizing that sense enjoyment comes automatically according to destiny.

But, this pure devotional service, by which one can get eternal life, one can get eternal bliss, one can get eternal spiritual knowledge, that is not available by any amount of material activities, by any good karma, by birth in any planet within this whole universe, it's not available. And, one more point, Narad Muni is telling here, as far as happiness derived from sense enjoyment is concerned, it can be obtained automatically in course of time, even without your separate endeavor, just as miseries come even without your endeavoring for them.

**Key Quote:** "You cannot increase material happiness, you cannot reduce material distress."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of destiny, stating that material endeavors cannot ultimately increase happiness or decrease distress beyond what is already destined, and that even good karma only leads to temporary enjoyment.

Destiny. Deha Yogena Dehina. Another place in the Bhagavatam it is said, Sukham Aindriyakam Daitya Deha Yogena Dehina. Deha Yoga. The moment we get a certain type of material body, along with that body, there is a certain amount of material happiness and material distress, which is destined in this body, in this life. It is destined. You cannot reduce, by material endeavor, you cannot reduce the material miseries or material distress that you are destined to suffer. And, by any material endeavor, you cannot increase the material happiness, the material happiness that is due to you. That is destined. You cannot increase material happiness, you cannot reduce material distress. Then, why are you endeavoring? This is foolishness, to think that I can increase my material happiness by gaining more wealth, by having more possessions, by having nice family relationships, by getting some material power, by transferring myself to heavenly planets. In the next life, either in this life or next life, you cannot increase more than what is destined. You cannot. So, and even if somebody thinks that in this life I will work hard and gain good karma, by which in my next life, in my next life I can enjoy, that is also temporary. It is temporary. It will be finished with passage of time.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the eternal benefits of pure devotional service, contrasting it with the anxiety-ridden nature of material existence, even for elevated beings like Lord Brahma.

eternal happiness, eternal life, eternal knowledge. So, please think over what is the value of pure devotional service: freedom from anxiety, complete freedom from anxiety. In fact, the word, the term that is used for the spiritual planets is called Vaikuntha Loka. Vaikuntha means Vigatakuntha, without any anxiety. Life, in the eternal life, in the spiritual planets of the Supreme Lord, personal abode of the Supreme Lord, is life without any anxiety, zero anxiety. Whereas, material world is characterized by anxiety. Even Lord Brahma, when Hiranyakashipu was terrorizing the whole universe, Brahma was in so much anxiety what to do for cutting down the terrorist activities of Hiranyakashipu, and giving some protection and relief for the people who are thus suffering under his torture. So, Brahma also is in anxiety. So, nobody is free from anxiety in the material existence. Nobody, none of the Devatas, none of the Yogis, Karmis, Jnanis, Tapasvis, nobody, only pure devotees are completely free.

And such endeavor is worthwhile because simply because of some past karma, you are not going to get any spiritual happiness. No. Spiritual happiness is entirely dependent on our executing pure devotional service. And the benefit of pure devotional service is eternal benefit, eternal benefit. The advancement made is never lost, even after we quit the body. It is eternally to our credit, whatever advancement we make in pure devotional service, it's never lost.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, Narada Muni is telling, describe the transcendental pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Sri Krishna more vividly."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami discusses Narada Muni's instruction to Vyasadeva to vividly describe Krishna's pastimes in the Srimad Bhagavatam, emphasizing the detailed descriptions in the 10th canto and the establishment of Krishna's nature and relationships in other cantos.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devim Saraswathim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet In this session we will be discussing from the 21st verse of the 5th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Tvam Atmana Atmanam Avehi Amoghadrik Parasya Pumsah Paramatmanah Kalam Ajam Prajatam Jagatashivayatat Mahanubhavabhyudayo Adhiganyatam The meaning of this verse is, your goodness has perfect vision. You yourself can know the supreme personality of Godhead. I am sorry. You yourself can know the Supersoul personality of Godhead because you are present as the plenary portion of the Lord. Although you are birthless, you have appeared on this earth for the well-being of all people. Please therefore describe the transcendental pastimes of the supreme personality of Godhead Shri Krishna more vividly. This is yet another verse spoken by Shri Narada to Vyasadeva. He is instructing Vyasadeva on compiling Bhagavatam. And Bhagavatam is specifically describing, very vividly, supposed to describe very detailed way, the various transcendental pastimes of the supreme personality of Godhead Krishna. Krishna means Krishna and his various transcendental forms of expansion, various incarnations. So all of them are included. So here Vyasadeva is essentially being told that Vyasa is actually the incarnation of the Supreme Lord for the sake of compiling the Vedic literature. So he has perfect vision. He is himself the plenary portion. Plenary portion means the portion of the Supreme Lord who has got the power of the Supreme Lord. So he himself knows the Supersoul personality of Godhead by his perfect vision. And even though he is birthless, Ajam Prajatam, Ajam means he is birthless, Prajatam means he has taken birth for the well-being of all people. Shivaya for the well-being of all people. Therefore, Narada Muni is telling, describe the transcendental pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Sri Krishna more vividly. In the earlier work of Vyasa Deva, the different Puranas and the Mahabharata, he has described the pastimes of the Supreme Lord, but not as detailed as it will be described by him in the Bhagavatam under the instruction of Narada. Just like the 10th canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam is fully dedicated for describing the pastimes of Krishna very, very, very detailed way. It is the biggest canto in the entire Srimad Bhagavatam. And it is also describing the pastimes of Krishna's birth, then the childhood pastimes in Vrindavan. Then the pastimes of Krishna as youth in the Mathura Dham, then his pastimes as the king of Dwaraka in Dwaraka. All the pastimes are very nicely, vividly, detailed way described in the Bhagavatam 10th canto. And the other cantos are establishing the pastimes of Krishna. Who is this personality of Godhead Krishna? What is his transcendental nature? What is his relationship with this material world, with the spiritual world, with the living beings, with the liberated souls, with the jnanis, tapasvis, karmis, yogis, devotees, everybody? All that is very scientifically described in connection with his pastimes. This is the special thing. Everything is connected with Krishna's pastimes.

#### Incarnations, Fallen souls, Spiritual master, Vyasadeva, Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "He is teaching by his own example that one must accept a spiritual master even though he is God himself."
**Summary:** This segment explains the purpose of incarnations delivering fallen souls, the importance of Vedic literature, and the role of a spiritual master, even for incarnations like Vyasadeva and Krishna, emphasizing the need to take shelter of Krishna's lotus feet.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, Vyasa Deva has descended by his costless mercy to deliver the fallen souls in this material world. That's the purpose of all incarnations. Every incarnation is descending, coming from the spiritual world, from the spiritual world to the material world, for the sake of delivering the fallen souls, those who are lost in this material world. Now the people in this world are mostly forgetful of who they are, who is Krishna, what is their relationship. So they are detached from the transcendental loving service of Krishna, which is the natural condition, healthy condition, the spiritual state of our existence. Eternally we are meant simply for rendering pure devotional service, loving devotional service to Krishna. The Vedic literatures are compiled for the benefit of such fallen souls. And the duty of the fallen souls is to take care of them, especially in the human form of life. Take advantage of such literature to be freed from the bondage of material existence. Now Narada Muni is formally accepted as the spiritual master of Vyasa Deva. But Vyasa Deva being the incarnation of the Lord is not dependent at all on anyone. He is completely enlightened always. And he is the spiritual master of everyone else. But as doing the work of an Acharya, he is teaching by his own example that one must accept a spiritual master even though he is God himself. For example Lord Krishna, Lord Rama, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. All are incarnations of the Supreme Lord. But they accepted formally a spiritual master. They were already enlightened in all transcendental knowledge. They are the source of all knowledge. But still to direct people they actually accept a spiritual master, teach by their example. Similarly Vyasa Deva is directed by Narada Rishi as his spiritual master to describe the transcendental pastimes of Krishna in order to direct people to take shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna. That is the only shelter we actually have.

#### Krishna's lotus feet, Material existence, Liberation, Murari, Vamanadev

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's lotus feet are the most suitable boat for crossing over this ocean of material existence."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Krishna's lotus feet as the boat to cross the ocean of material existence, referencing Krishna as Murari and Vamanadev, and explaining how taking shelter of Krishna shrinks the material world, leading to the supreme abode.

We don't have any other shelter. In the Bhagavatam it is described in a later portion, Samashrita ye pada pallava plavam. Krishna's lotus feet are the most suitable boat for crossing over this ocean of material existence. Plavam means boat. Pada pallava means it is like lotus feet. Krishna's lotus feet is like a boat, the most suitable boat for crossing over the ocean of material existence. Mahapadampunya Yesho Murari. And Krishna is famous as Murari, the killer of the Mura demon, whose pain as the deliverer of all the fallen souls, all the fallen souls in this material world. Whenever he incarnates he delivers them. His fame as the deliverer is spotless. Punya Yesho. It's pure fame, spotless fame. Mahapadam. Now he became famous as keeping that giant step when he appeared as Vaman Dev, Trivikrama. In one step he covered the earth and all the lower planets. And he stretched his other foot to pierce the covering of the top portion of the universe beyond Brahma Loka. So he covered all the upper planets with the second step. And there was no place left for covering the third step, for keeping the third step and covering some land. There was no land left. All the middle, lower, upper, all three planetary systems were covered in two steps. So Mahapadampunya Yesho Murari, Bhavambudhir Vatsapadam. What happens when you take shelter of Krishna's lotus feet? How do you cross over this material existence? So in this verse it is described, the whole material existence becomes shrunk to the quantity of water contained in the footprint of a calf. Vatsapadam. Vatsa means calf. So a huge ocean shrinks into water contained in the footprint of a calf. Bhavambudhir. Bhava means this material existence is compared to a huge ocean that compresses or condenses or shrinks into a very very small quantity of water so that you can easily cross over, just as easily as one can put his foot across a small puddle of water. Parampadam. And you cross over material existence to reach the supreme abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

#### Surrender, Krishna's lotus feet, Liberation, Bhagavad Gita

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, Surrender to me alone."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the ease and effectiveness of taking shelter of Krishna's lotus feet for liberation, contrasting it with other difficult methods, and quoting Krishna's instruction in the Bhagavad Gita to surrender to Him alone, assuring protection from sinful reactions.

That is the result of taking shelter of Krishna's lotus feet. This is the glorification of the incarnation of Krishna and all the other incarnations. Taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, Personality of Godhead is the easiest and the most effective way of crossing over this ocean of material existence. Otherwise the other methods are very very very difficult, very slow, and very very tedious. This is very very easy, the method of taking shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna. So everywhere it is described in the Bhagavatam, this very literature is directing us, take shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna. Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, surrender to me alone, giving up all other processes of religion. Simply surrender and don't worry about the consequences of such surrender. Don't worry about it. Mahashu Chaha. Because Krishna says, I will take charge of all your sinful reactions. Even if there are any sinful reactions, don't worry. I will nullify them. Aham Tvam Sarva Pape Bhya Moksha Isha. So Krishna specially gives the assurance. So this transcendental literature, Vedic literature, are directing the fallen souls how they can come to the point of taking shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna. That's the direction that is ultimately given and that's the perfection. I'll stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "All the scriptures, ultimately it is a supreme personality of Godhead Lord Hari who is glorified."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that all scriptures ultimately glorify Lord Hari (Krishna) and that Vyasadeva should describe the transcendental activities of Krishna in detail.

So this verse, spoken again by Narada Muni to Vyasadeva, describes ultimately what is the purpose of advancement of knowledge through various methods. The methods are listed here. There are many methods of advancement of transcendental knowledge. One can perform austerities, one can study the Vedas, one can perform various sacrifices, or somebody may chant the Vedic hymns, or one may give in charity. Yajna, dana, tapa, swadhyaya, and then chanting the hymns... So all these, ultimately, ends in what? According to the Vedic Scriptures, it ends in transcendental descriptions of the Lord! Everything is meant for transcendental description of the Lord! Every pious activity is ultimately meant for glorifying Krishna. Hari Sarvatra Giyate, this is what Vilamadvacharya says. All the scriptures, ultimately it is a supreme personality of Godhead Lord Hari who is glorified. So that's why Narada is telling Vyasa Deva you must describe

**Key Quote:** "perfection of self-realization depends on Vishnu, the personality of Godhead, that they do not understand, they do not know."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that human intellect should be used to understand the transcendental activities of the Lord, leading to self-realization, and warns against being enamored by Vishnu Maya (material energy) and sense enjoyment.

in detail the transcendental activities of the supreme personality of Godhead Krishna. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport here, human intellect is developed for advancement of learning in art, science, philosophy, physics, chemistry, psychology, economics, politics, etc. So many subjects human beings have, they have developed that. Now it is expected that you will be able to understand the transcendental activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that by culture of such knowledge, the human society can attain perfection of life. That is the purpose. Now this perfection of life itself, what is the perfection of life? It is self-realization. Now that self-realization, therefore the Shruti or the original Vedas directs those who are actually advanced in learning, they should aspire for service of Lord Vishnu, devotional service to Vishnu. Now there are persons who are enamored by the external beauty of Vishnu Maya, the external enamelling, the external energy of the Supreme Lord Vishnu. He has many energies of which this material energy is very prominent in this material world. So those who are enamored by this material energy, they do not understand that perfection of self-realization depends on Vishnu, the personality of Godhead, that they do not understand, they do not know.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "only when advancement of knowledge is applied in devotion and service of the Supreme Lord, the whole process becomes absolute."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the transient and miserable nature of sense gratification, contrasting it with the absolute nature of knowledge applied in devotion and service to the Lord.

Now, Vishnu maya means sense enjoyment. The effect of maya, the influence of maya is such that one is inclined simply to try to enjoy sense gratification. Now, what is the nature of the sense gratification? Everywhere in the scriptures it is described. It is transient, means it is flickering. Just for a very short time it is there. That enjoyment is there for a very short time. And also, it is actually miserable. Now, those who are in the trap of this Vishnu maya, they utilize advancement of knowledge for sense enjoyment. And that is very, very prominent in the material world, Kali Yuga. Everywhere you see people engaging in sense gratification in various ways, even those who are cultivating knowledge, even those who are cultivating spiritual knowledge, they desire a subtle type of sense gratification. Now, already Narad Muni has explained that all this paraphernalia, all this knowledge of the cosmic universe is an emanation of the Supreme Lord through his different energies. He has created this world, he maintains and he destroys. And the Lord has set in motion the actions and reactions of this material world by his inconceivable energy. So, in effect, ultimately, everything is non-different from this Lord because it is a manifestation of his own energy. At the same time, the Lord is always different from his energies. Therefore, only when advancement of knowledge is applied in devotion and service of the Supreme Lord,

#### devotional service, application of knowledge in service of the Lord, examples of Valmiki and Vyasa

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "whatever be the subject matter of advancement of knowledge, whether it be art or science or philosophy or physics or chemistry or psychology, they should simply be applied in service of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that all branches of knowledge should be used in the service of the Lord, giving examples of Valmiki and Vyasa who achieved immortality by glorifying the Lord through their writings.

the whole process becomes absolute because the personality of Godhead is non-different from his name, his form, his qualities, his activities, his paraphernalia, is non-different. So, all the sages and devotees of the Lord have therefore recommended that whatever be the subject matter of advancement of knowledge, whether it be art or science or philosophy or physics or chemistry or psychology, they should simply be applied in service of the Lord. How can they be applied in the service of the Lord? So, literature, poetry may be used in glorifying the Lord. The fiction writers and poets generally are writing some subject matter of self-gratification. But if they turn towards the service of the Lord, they can beautifully describe the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. For example, Valviki Muni, he was a great poet, but he has composed Ramayana, the transcendental pastimes of the personality of Godhead, Lord Rama. And it is such a wonderful composition, but it is completely transcendental because it is glorifying the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Rama. Vyasa Deva is a great writer, but he has simply engaged all his talent in composing nice poetry, simply in glorifying the Supreme Lord in his various incarnations. So, they have become immortal, Valviki and Vyasa, simply by glorifying the Supreme Lord through poetry, Sanskrit poetry. Similarly, Shila Prabhupada says, science and philosophy also should be used in the service of the Lord. Simply, some people are busy presenting some dry speculative theories for self-gratification. That is useless. That cannot satisfy them, that cannot satisfy any of their readers. Ultimately, people become frustrated.

#### establishing the glory of the Lord, science and philosophy in service of the Lord, knowledge not engaged in service is nescience

**Verse References:** BG 9.11
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "knowledge not engaged in the service of the Lord is nescience."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that philosophy and science should be used to establish the glory of the Lord, and that knowledge not engaged in the service of the Lord is considered ignorance.

So, Prabhupada is telling that philosophy and science should be engaged to establish the glory of the Supreme Lord. Because those who are advanced in intellect, they want to understand what is the ultimate reality through the medium of science or through the medium of philosophy. Therefore, a great scientist should endeavor to prove the existence of the Lord on a scientific basis. Similarly, philosophical speculation should be used to establish the supreme absolute truth as sentient, conscious person and all-powerful, absolutely powerful. All branches of knowledge should always be engaged in the service of the Lord. Bhagavad Gita also confirms the same fact. Apply all knowledge in the service of the Lord. Bhagavanam janmanamante jnanavan mam prapadyate vasudeva sarvamiti vedaisya sarvair ahameva vedhyam Neyam, the object of knowledge, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The goal of all knowledge is to know the Supreme Person, Krishna. Like this, knowledge ultimately should be aimed at knowing Krishna, at realizing Krishna. Knowledge should be aimed at engaging in devotional service to Krishna. And Prabhupada further says, knowledge not engaged in the service of the Lord is nescience. Nescience means darkness of ignorance.

**Key Quote:** "everything should be utilized for glorification of Krishna, especially knowledge."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that all activities, including scientific knowledge, can be used as harikirtana (glorification of the Lord), and that everyone can utilize their talents and intelligence for glorifying Krishna.

Therefore, the real import of this verse in the Bhagavatam is that advanced knowledge is simply meant for establishing the glories of the Supreme Lord. Now further, Prabhupada says, all such activities, including employing scientific knowledge in service of the Lord, is factual harikirtana or glorification of the Lord. This can be done by anybody in their own field, whether somebody is a scientist or an artist or a philosopher or a teacher, anybody can utilize their talent, their learning, their advanced intelligence simply for glorifying the Supreme Lord. Even the creation, entire creation is nothing but the creation of the Supreme Lord. So therefore, the ultimate goal is Krishna only and nothing else or no one else. Therefore, this verse is stressing, everything should be utilized for glorification of Krishna, especially knowledge. So I'll stop here.

**Key Quote:** "Although they were impartial by nature, those followers of the Vedanta blessed me with their causeless mercy."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of the verse, highlighting Narada Muni's description of his previous life as the son of a maidservant and his association with pure devotees, emphasizing his self-control, detachment from sports, and lack of naughtiness even as a young boy.

Now this is the section where Narad Muni describes his previous life to Vyasa Deva. In the previous session we have seen how Narad Muni begins the description by telling about his previous birth, that he was born as a son of a maidservant, but then he happened to get the association of pure devotees and in their association he engaged in their service and a big transformation took place that is being described. So this 24th verse is Temai Apeta Akhila Chaapale Arbake Dante Adratha Kriyada. The meaning of this verse is, although they were impartial by nature, those followers of the Vedanta blessed me with their causeless mercy. As far as I was concerned, I was self-controlled and had no attachment for sports, even though I was a boy. In addition, I was not naughty and I did not speak more than required.

**Key Quote:** "Their nature is they are impartial."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the qualities of the sages who showed causeless mercy to Narada Muni, emphasizing their impartiality and the boy's unusual self-control and detachment from childish activities.

So, Narada Muni is describing, he was a small boy. He was not very old, when the sages were camping due to Chaturmasya in the place where Narada Muni's mother was engaged in such menial service. Their nature is they are impartial. They are impartial by nature. They have no special liking for somebody or hatred towards anybody else. No. They are completely impartial. But still, when they see somebody is inclined to actually take up devotional service, then they immediately, out of their causeless mercy, they actually bless such a soul with transcendental enlightenment. So, Narada Muni says, those sages, they blessed him, with their causeless mercy. Now, what was this boy's behavior? He was self-controlled and he had no attachment for sports, even though he was a boy. Normally, boys will always be playing, young boys, small boys. Till they come of certain maturity, they generally be engaged in playing, playing, playing. But, Narada Muni, this boy was an unusual boy. He was not interested in sports, childish sports. And, he was controlled, self-controlled. He was not naughty and he did not speak more than required.

**Key Quote:** "Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu describes that in the Vedas, there are three subjects."
**Summary:** The speaker references Srila Prabhupada and Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to explain the three subjects of the Vedas: establishing the relationship of living entities with God (Sambandha), performing devotional service (Abhideya), and achieving the ultimate goal of going back to Godhead (Prayojana).

So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, in the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord says, all the Vedas are searching after me. All the Vedic literature are directing one towards Krishna. Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu describes that in the Vedas, there are three subjects. What are the three subjects? To establish the relation of the living entities with the personality of Godhead, to perform the relative duties in devotional service, and thus achieve the ultimate goal of going back home, back to Godhead. It's called Sambandha Abhideya Prayojana. Sambandha is, each one of us have got a relationship with the Supreme Lord. Every living being, without exception, because we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Mamey Vamsho Jeeva Loke Jeeva Bhuta Sanatana. And, in that relationship, there are certain activities. Relationship means activities. So, such activities performed in the relationship with the Supreme Lord are called Abhideya. And, the result is Prayojana. It results in developing our love for the Supreme Lord, or going back home, back to Godhead, where we belong.

**Key Quote:** "Because, sometimes Vedantavadis are mistaken to be those who are impersonalists."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that the Vedantavadis mentioned in the verse are pure devotees, distinguishing them from impersonalists who have an incomplete understanding of Vedanta philosophy, and emphasizing the impartiality of Bhaktivedantas in distributing transcendental knowledge.

The Vedantavadis, or the followers of Vedanta, as described in this verse by Narad Muni, indicates pure devotees of the Supreme Lord, because sometimes Vedantavadis are mistaken to be those who are impersonalists. Impersonalists actually have no proper understanding of Vedanta philosophy, because they start with an assumption, even though unjustified, that ultimately, the Absolute Truth is impersonal. But, actually, the Absolute Truth has got three features. Impersonal feature is just one of the preliminary understanding of the Absolute Truth. There are two other features, the Paramatma feature and the Bhagavan feature. So, this Paramatma feature and the Bhagavan feature are completely mis-doubted by the impersonalists. Therefore, their understanding of Vedanta, is not complete. It is imperfect. It is incomplete, and it is misleading also, that ultimately, the Absolute Truth is impersonal. No. The Absolute Truth is the personality of Godhead. Therefore, Vedantavadis, refers to the pure devotees of the Supreme Lord, who have full understanding of all the three features of the Absolute Truth. Such Vedantavadis are also called as Bhaktivedantas. They are impartial in distributing the transcendental knowledge of devotional service. To them, nobody is enemy, nobody is friend. Nobody is educated, nobody is uneducated. They don't make distinctions based on all these type of characteristics. Nobody is favorable, nobody is unfavorable.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the general state of people as being born into ignorance and engaged in self-gratification, highlighting the role of Bhaktivedantas in awakening them to spiritual life and re-establishing their relationship with Krishna.

So, they see, their vision is, people in general are engaged in wasting time in self-gratification, because they do not know the goal of life. By birth, it is described, every conditioned soul is born into ignorance. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains this. Everyone is born into ignorance. So, they have to be awakened by such Bhaktivedantas. So, such Bhaktivedantas, they want to get this ignorant mass of people to get out of ignorance, to re-establish their lost relationship with the Supreme Personality of God, Krishna. Now, by the endeavor of such Bhaktivedantas, even the most forgetful souls, most ignorant person, is awakened to a sense of spiritual life. And, the people, in general,

begin to make progress on the path of self-realization. Now, this boy, Narada in his previous life, when he was the son of a maid servant, this boy, actually, before being initiated even, he was very self-controlled. He was detached from childish sporting, and he was more or less very disciplined. But, the Vedantavadis, the Bhaktivedantas, they were compassionate upon the boy and they did not consider this boy is too small or he is still of an age where he is meant to engage in childish sports. They did not consider that. In spite of his being a small boy, they did initiate him and they blessed him to actually begin to render devotional service. So, this is their causeless mercy upon this boy. But, this boy also happened to be a disciplined, self-controlled boy who is not naughty, who would not speak more than required like that. So, in his case, we can understand his advancement was very, very fast. But, we should always remember the effect of the blessing of such Vedantavadis is very, very powerful.

**Key Quote:** "Without being self-controlled, nobody can make proper progress in self-realization."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the Vedic system of sending young boys to Gurukul for Brahmacharya training, emphasizing the importance of self-control and spiritual acumen injected even before birth through Garbhadana Samskar for self-realization and creating responsible citizens.

by such powerful association. So, therefore, Srila Prabhupada says in the Vedic system, small boys who are about five years of age, between five and eight years, they are sent to the Gurukul or the Guru's ashram and they are systematically trained in Brahmacharya, celibacy, because then their mind can be focused on learning the essential knowledge that is required for self-realization. This training is also compulsory to create good citizens of the state. Without such basic training at an early age, it is difficult to prepare somebody for a good future life as a responsible citizen of the society. Now, the present day situation is such that people have become irresponsible. They are simply engaged in sense enjoyment. Neither they have such Brahmacharya training nor are they serious about the real goal of self-realization. But, the Vedic system is the spiritual acumen is injected into the child even before the birth of the child by what is called as Garbhadana Samskar. The parents actually conceive a child with spiritual consciousness. So, the child is injected with the spiritual acumen at the time of conceiving the child in the mother's womb. So, this is extraordinary chance given to a soul who is taking birth as a human being to prepare for self-realization even before the birth itself. So, this is the way to beget children in complete perfection. So, Srila Prabhupada says without being self-controlled, nobody can make proper progress in self-realization. That's impossible. It's not merely a matter of reading some books or hearing some discourses or studying some literature. No. It is much more than that. It is the systematic training specially in self-control by Brahmacharya. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

#### purification of the heart, realization of self and the Lord, transcendental nature of the Lord
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/Fs-xIBfUWw4?t=68

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Such Krishna Katha purifies the heart and in the purified state one can understand what I am and what is the Lord."
**Summary:** This segment explains that hearing Krishna Katha purifies the heart, leading to the realization of the transcendental nature of both the self and the Lord, distinguishing them from matter.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 27th verse of the 5th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. तस्मिम्स्तदा लब्धरुचेर महामते प्रियश्रवस्य अस्खलिता मतिर्ममा ययाहं एतत सदसत स्वमायया पशेमई ब्रह्मणि कल्पितं परे। The meaning of this verse is, O great sage, this is Narada Muni addressing Vedavyasa, as soon as I got a taste for the personality of Godhead, my attention to hear of the Lord was unflinching, and as my taste developed, I could realize that it was only in my ignorance that I had accepted gross and subtle coverings, for both the Lord and I are transcendental. So this is a very important realization that has come about by hearing about the glories of the Lord and developing a taste for such Krishna Katha. Such Krishna Katha purifies the heart, and in the purified state, one can understand what I am and what is the Lord. Neither I am a product of matter, nor is the Lord anything to do with matter in terms of his spiritual form, spiritual existence, spiritual attributes. So this becomes very, very clear as the heart becomes clean.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Similarly, as soon as the Krishna sun rises in the heart, immediately the darkness of material ignorance is dissipated, completely dissipated."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of darkness and the sun, this segment explains how ignorance is like darkness and Krishna is like the sun, whose presence dispels ignorance from the heart.

This is the whole point. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, ignorance in material existence is compared to darkness. Just like, very easy to understand, when we are in darkness, we cannot see anything around us, and therefore we cannot act properly. Similarly, our existence in this material world, or material existence, is compared to darkness because in ignorance of who we are, we are acting on the material platform. And on the material platform, we are only aware of matter. We are not aware of spirit. We are totally ignorant about spirit on the material platform. So therefore, here it is said, in all Vedic literatures, the personality of Godhead is compared to the sun. Krishna Surya Sama. Maya Hoi Andhakar. Krishna is compared to the sun to help us understand what is the position of Krishna, and Maya is like darkness. Wherever there is light, there cannot be darkness. As soon as there is light, just like in the morning when the sun rises, immediately the darkness is dispelled. Similarly, as soon as the Krishna sun rises in the heart, immediately the darkness of material ignorance is dissipated, completely dissipated.

#### hearing from a bona fide source, spiritual association with Krishna, absolute nature of Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Hearing of the Lord's pastimes is itself transcendental association with the Lord."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of hearing Krishna's pastimes from a bona fide source, which is equivalent to direct spiritual association with Krishna due to His absolute nature.

Now, how does the Krishna sun rise in the heart? So, Srila Prabhupada says, hearing of the Lord's pastimes is itself transcendental association with the Lord. When you hear attentively Krishna's pastimes, and you have to hear from a proper source. We have been discussing this many, many times. We have already discussed earlier, from a bona fide source, from an authorized source, from a proper source. Not from a professional reciter, not from a non-devotee, not from a speculator, but from a pure devotee or a representative of a pure devotee who repeats the words of the pure devotee. You hear the Lord's pastimes. That is same as spiritual association with Krishna directly. It's direct association with Krishna on the transcendental platform. It is not material at all. Even though right now we are situated in the material body, we are in the material world, but such hearing immediately elevates the hearer to the spiritual world, to the spiritual platform. Why? Why does it happen? How does it happen like that? It is because there is no difference between the Lord and His transcendental pastimes. Identical. In a previous session, I had described Lord is absolute. Absolute means Krishna, His name, His form, His qualities, His pastimes, His paraphernalia, His pure devotees are all identical.

**Key Quote:** "Whereas Krishna, when you hear about Krishna, because Krishna is fully present in his descriptions, you directly associate with Krishna."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of a phone call, this segment contrasts relative experiences with the absolute presence of Krishna in His descriptions, leading to a change of heart.

There is no relativity. To give another example to help you understand the difference between relative and absolute. Now when you receive a phone call from a person who is far distant, physically the person is situated, present in a very distant place. Let's say you are in Bangalore and the person is in Delhi. So when you receive the phone call, then you speak with the person. But then on speaking, you have to recollect about the person's appearance, about the person's qualities, about the person's background, everything. Based on a past experience, you are having some idea. The voice itself of the person is very soothing to hear, particularly if you have a relationship. But still the person is not present in the voice. All the other attributes of the person are not experienced. For example, you cannot, supposing you are talking to your own child, you cannot pat the back of the child. You cannot embrace the child, just when you hear the voice. Whereas Krishna, when you hear about Krishna, because Krishna is fully present in his descriptions, you directly associate with Krishna. Krishna is fully present. So you are coming face to face with Krishna, though you don't realize immediately. But the fact is Krishna is there. Krishna is present, fully present in the descriptions. Therefore the change of heart takes place.

**Key Quote:** "Material existence means we don't know who is Krishna. I don't know who I am. In terms of our spiritual nature."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how ignorance leads to a conditioned state where one identifies with the material body, and emphasizes the importance of realizing one's spiritual identity and Krishna's transcendental nature.

Ignorance is dissipated. So, Prabhupada says further, to become associated with the supreme light is to dissipate all ignorance. All ignorance is gone. Material existence means we don't know who is Krishna. I don't know who I am in terms of our spiritual nature. We don't know spiritual nature. So, Prabhupada says, particularly here, by ignorance only, the conditioned soul, conditioned soul means one who is habituated to this material world, material existence, three gunas, and material body, and material surroundings, material possessions, material relationships, everything material. We are not matter. No person is the material body. So, it is only because of spiritual ignorance, ignorance of the spiritual fact, that every person thinks in terms of I am the body, I am a product of material nature. I came into existence when I took birth in this world. This is wrong understanding. No, I exist eternally because I am spirit soul. I am not this body. My body was fabricated by Maya in the mother's womb, and this body was prepared and wrongly I associate myself with the body, think I am the body. Even the Supreme Lord, he may take birth as son of Vasudeva and Devaki, but he is not the product of material nature. Neither he is actually the son of Vasudeva. He is actually the supreme father of everyone in this world. He is the supreme father. So, where is the question of he taking birth? He appears to take birth. He actually does not take birth. So, the fact is, the personality of Godhead and the living beings are transcendental and have nothing to do with materiality.

**Summary:** This segment explains that after realizing our spiritual nature, we should engage both the gross body and the subtle mind in the service of the Lord through physical actions and devotional practices like hearing and chanting.

Nothing to do with material nature. So, when ignorance is removed, it is perfectly realized that there is nothing existing other than Krishna. Whole existence, only Krishna is there. Krishna is there means Krishna and his energies, especially which energy? His spiritual energy. Krishna is a spiritual personality and his spiritual energy is important. Now, while we are in this body, after having learnt about Krishna's spiritual nature and our own spiritual nature, what do we do with this body? So, that Prabhupada explains, both this gross body and the subtle mind, they have got two coverings. The soul, I, you, any person, spirit soul, is covered by a subtle body. That is the inner body. And then over that there is a gross body covering. So, two coverings. Both of them can be engaged in the service of the Lord while we are in this material world, because both are belonging to the material energy of the Supreme Lord. So, the gross body should be engaged in acts of rendering physical service to the Lord, like bringing water for cleansing the temple, paying obeisances by bowing down, etc. And, the subtle mind should be engaged in hearing attentively about the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, thinking about the Lord, chanting His name. So, all such activities are completely spiritual.

So, simply by hearing from a pure devotee, all this transformation inside can take place very quickly. Otherwise, gradually the change happens through the regular methods. Gradual change happens. Otherwise, quickly the change can take place. And that is being illustrated in the life of Narada Muni when he was a small boy, and he was fortunate to get the association of pure devotees, bhaktivedantas.

In this session we will be discussing from the 32nd verse of the 5th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. एतज सम्सूचितं ब्रह्मन् तापत्रयचिकित्सितं यदीश्वरे भगवती कर्मब्रह्मणि भावितं The meaning of this verse is, O Brahmana Vyasa Deva, it is decided by the learned that the best remedial measure for removing all troubles and miseries is to dedicate one's activities to the service of the Supreme Lord Personality of God. ओऽडेड श्री कृष्णा

**Key Quote:** "But please understand that happiness experienced in material existence, which is called as material happiness, is described in the scriptures as simply another form of misery only."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that material happiness is ultimately another form of misery, arising from the contact of senses with sense objects.

So here is the conclusion of the instruction by the Bhaktivedantas to Narada. Narada is addressing Vyasa Deva, telling about his previous life and he is telling it is decided by the learned ओडेड श्री कृष्णा This is a remedial measure for removing all troubles and miseries. This is because, from the scriptures we understand, and by our personal experience also, we have knowledge about the miseries of this material existence. Now, people may not disagree that there are miseries, but they will say there are also good things. There is happiness and there is distress, both are there. But please understand that happiness experienced in material existence, which is called as material happiness, is described in the scriptures as simply another form of misery only. This is a very, very shocking revelation, but it's a fact. What is the nature of this happiness which we experience in this material world? It is called samsparsha-bhoga. Samsparsha means contact. Contact of the senses with the sense object. For the eyes it is form, for the ears it is sound, for the nose it is smell or fragrance, for the tongue it is taste, and for the sense of touch it is the touch sensation itself, for the perception of the sense of touch. So, this contact produces a kind of feeling in the mind, and that is interpreted as happiness or distress according to one's conditioning. Anyway, it's a very detailed subject, which I don't want to go into details now.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that dedicating all activities to Krishna is the best remedial measure for removing miseries.

But please understand, the essence of material existence is miseries. And generally, for most people, when there is absence of misery, or they get relief from some misery, immediate misery, then they consider that as happiness. Real happiness is something else, different from what we expect. So, therefore, the best remedial measure for removing all troubles and miseries, that is being told here. And this is a very, very important point for everyone to note. It is a very practical utility for everyone in this world. What is it? To dedicate one's activities to the service of the Supreme Lord Personality of God.

**Key Quote:** "But they do not know that without the sanction of the Supreme Lord, nobody can become free from miseries."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that freedom from misery requires the sanction of the Supreme Lord, drawing from Narada Muni's personal experience.

Dedicate all your activities to Krishna, and thereby you become free from all miseries. How does it work? Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport that Narada Muni, from his personal experience, he is telling that simply sit and hear the transcendental activities of the Lord, and thereby you become from the right source, from the bona fide source, and thereby you become completely free from all miseries. Now, what if somebody is not able to do that? For that, Narada Muni is giving another solution. People may say, I am very busy working for maintaining my family, for my own maintenance. So, I don't have time to sit and hear. Even if I am able to hear, I can hear a little. I can't hear all the time. So, for such people whose time is mainly engaged in some work for the sake of maintenance, bodily maintenance, or for some responsibility, or duty, for such people, Narada Muni is telling that you have to learn from devotees how to dedicate your activities in the service of Krishna. How to do that? So, Prabhupada explains in the purport that generally people in this world are struggling very hard to get rid of miseries. Nobody wants miseries. Nobody wants suffering. But they do not know that without the sanction of the Supreme Lord, nobody can become free from miseries.

**Key Quote:** "So, the point is that sanction of the Supreme Lord is very much necessary for the treatment to be effective."
**Summary:** The speaker provides examples of medical treatment and crossing a river to illustrate that the sanction of the Supreme Lord is necessary for success.

So, three examples are given specifically to illustrate this point: that to cure a patient by medical treatment is useless if it is not sanctioned by the Lord. So, we know that doctors do help by giving some treatment to a patient who has got an infection or a disease. But doctor also is helpless if the patient does not survive the treatment. If the patient doesn't survive the treatment, then the doctor is helpless. Or the particular remedy doesn't work, then the doctor is helpless. So, the point is that sanction of the Supreme Lord is very much necessary for the treatment to be effective. Similarly, another example that is given, to cross the river or the ocean by a suitable boat is no remedial measure if the remedy is not sanctioned by the Lord. So, therefore, the ultimate sanctioning officer is the Supreme Lord

**Key Quote:** "So, therefore, we should learn how to dedicate whatever activities we may do to the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding the Lord's presence and power, and learning to dedicate all activities to Him, especially through studying how His energies work.

and we must therefore dedicate our activities to the Supreme Lord for ultimate success. Now, how to do that? First of all, we should understand the Lord is present everywhere and He is all-knowing and He is all-powerful. Omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent. Present everywhere, He is all-knowing and He is all-powerful. So, therefore, we should learn how to dedicate whatever activities we may do to the Supreme Lord. Whatever one may be, how should one dedicate whatever activity one is doing? So, Prabhupada gives specific examples here. If one is a learned scholar or a learned scientist or a philosopher or poet, he should employ his learning to establish the supremacy of the Lord. This is the purpose of all knowledge, all learning, especially by those who are scholars or scientists or philosophers or poets. They should try to study how the energy of the Lord is working in every sphere of life. The Lord is there, Krishna is there and His energies are there. So, in every sphere of life, the Lord's energies are working. So, try to study that. That is what is presented in the Bhagavad Gita. Especially in the Bhagavad Gita, how the Lord's energies are working in every sphere of life.

**Key Quote:** "They should try to study how the energy of the Lord is working in every sphere of life."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how different individuals, such as scholars, scientists, and warriors, can dedicate their activities to the Lord, using Arjuna as an example.

Srila Prabhupada further says, do not decry Him. Do not try to become like Him. Do not try to take His position simply by some little knowledge. No. So, one should actually understand the glories of the Lord in terms of how His energies are working in every sphere of life. And establish the supremacy of the Lord through one's writings, through one's knowledge, through one's descriptions, through enlightening others who are ignorant, etc. Next, Prabhupada says, if one is an administrator or a statesman or a warrior or a politician, that is a Kshatriya, then one should try to establish the Lord's supremacy in statesmanship. Fight for the cause of the Lord as Sri Arjuna did. A warrior should fight for the cause of the Lord. So, regarding Arjuna, it is particularly mentioned here that in the beginning, Arjuna declined to fight. But when he was convinced by the Lord that the fighting was necessary, then Arjuna changed his decision and fought for the cause of the Lord. Karishye Vachanam Tava, I'll simply follow your instructions, your directions.

**Key Quote:** "Think always that the money which is accumulated is the wealth of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how businessmen and even those engaged in menial work can dedicate their activities to the Lord, emphasizing the importance of chanting Hare Krishna.

So, similarly, if one is a businessman or an industrialist, an agriculturist, then one should spend his hard-earned money for the cause of the Lord. How can one do this? Think always that the money which is accumulated is the wealth of the Lord. Because wealth is considered Lakshmi or goddess of fortune. And Lord of Lakshmi is Narayana, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, husband of Lakshmi. So, try to engage the wealth in the service of Lord Narayana and be happy. That is the way to realize the Lord in every sphere of life. Either one works like a Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya or even a Shudra. Shudra is one who does some menial work for getting some maintenance. So, even whatever menial activities one may do, one should try to do it as a service to the Lord. One should think that I am engaged in this particular activity. Of course, the activity should not be a sinful activity. It should be a pious activity. So, engaged in any pious activity, one should think, Krishna is engaging me in this activity. So, think of Krishna. Now, how to think of Krishna? By chanting Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. This can be done by everyone. This should be done by everyone. That is the scriptural direction. Hare Nama, Hare Nama, Hare Namaiva Kevalam.

**Key Quote:** "Perfectly able to acquire a transcendental knowledge for spiritual realization."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains the common notion that performing fruitive work according to scriptures leads to transcendental knowledge and spiritual realization.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 35th verse of the 5th chapter of the 1st canto, Srimad Bhagavatam. Yaratra Kriyate Karma Bhagavat Paritoshanam Jnanam Yattad Atheenam Hi Bhakti Yoga Samanvitam. The meaning of this verse is, whatever work is done here in this life for the satisfaction of the mission of the Lord is called Bhakti Yoga or Transcendental Loving Service to the Lord. And what is called knowledge becomes a concomitant factor. So this verse is explained by Srila Prabhupada very nicely in the purport. I will directly go to the purport. From the purport, we can understand what is being said in this verse by Narada. The general and popular notion is that by discharging fruity work in terms of the directions of the scriptures, one becomes perfect, perfectly able to acquire a transcendental knowledge for spiritual realization.

**Key Quote:** "People think that if we do the particular activities mentioned in the scriptures for getting some material benefit...we will develop this spiritual understanding."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the general inclination to perform activities for material benefits, believing it will lead to spiritual knowledge and realization, and how this perspective often equates Bhakti Yoga with Karma.

Most people are generally inclined to work or do some activity. That is the nature of the soul, to be always active. So people think that according to the directions of the Shastra, they should perform certain types of pious activities or those activities recommended in the scriptures for some material benefit, and that will lead to getting transcendental knowledge, spiritual knowledge for spiritual realization. Ultimately, the Shastra say we have to realize we are spirit, so we have to realize the spiritual truth, and for that spiritual knowledge is required. And how do you get that knowledge? Of course, you can get knowledge by studying the scriptures, but to realize that knowledge, merely studying, will it help? No, that is not enough. So therefore, people think that if we do the particular activities mentioned in the scriptures for getting some material benefit, not necessarily in terms of just some gross benefits in this life, but something for the future, could be for the future, could be for some next life, like that, so they think that we will develop this spiritual understanding by which we can develop the spiritual knowledge, and the spiritual knowledge which we can actually become realized, and therefore they

**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that Bhakti Yoga is superior to both Karma and Jnana, a confidential truth revealed in the Srimad Bhagavatam, and that Bhakti Yoga is independent.

realize, and therefore they consider such people, they consider Bhakti Yoga as another form of Karma only, because Bhakti Yoga involves activities, and Karma means doing pious activities recommended in the scriptures, so both are same. And Shastra gives an explanation how they areradas can not be followed is it evenkul sat Cal relieved a due exhibition by the Shastra. And therefore, they give a higher position to Jnana or spiritual knowledge. But the real fact is that Bhakti Yoga is above both Karma and Jnana. This is not known to many people. And this confidential truth is revealed in the Srimad Bhagavatam. So Bhakti Yoga is independent of Jnana, Bhakti Yoga is independent of Karma. On the other hand, if you really study carefully Karma, Jnana, and Bhakti, then both Karma and Jnana are different. They are dependent on Bhakti Yoga.

**Key Quote:** "The success in performing Karma is dependent on pleasing the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Karma and Jnana are dependent on Bhakti Yoga, emphasizing that the success of activities and the transformation of knowledge into realization depend on pleasing the Supreme Lord, referencing the Bhagavad Gita on Karma Yoga and Yajna.

How are they dependent? Because, whatever activities we may perform, unless those, even pious activities, unless the results of such activities are sanctioned by the Supreme Lord, one will not get the results. So one has to perform such pious activities which are recommended in the scriptures in order to please the Supreme Lord, either directly or indirectly. So the success in performing Karma is dependent on pleasing the Supreme Lord. And pleasing the Supreme Lord means Bhakti or Bhakti Yoga. And as regards knowledge, if somebody is cultivating spiritual knowledge, that spiritual knowledge will turn into realization only when such knowledge is employed in pleasing the Supreme Lord. In the Bhagavad Gita, very clearly it is said that Karma becomes Karma Yoga only when Karma is performed as Yajna. Yajna arthat karmanah anyatra lo koyam karma bandhanah. If you want freedom from karma bandhana, then Karma should be done as Yajna. Yajna means to do some work for pleasing the Supreme Lord,

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Karma and Jnana, when independent of Bhakti, do not yield true results, and that only through Bhakti can one achieve spiritual realization, referencing the Bhagavad Gita on surrendering to Krishna after many lifetimes of knowledge.

which is nothing but Bhakti. So Karma independent of Bhakti is not going to give the real result. Jnana independent of Bhakti will not give the real result of realization, spiritual realization. That is also explained in the Bhagavad Gita. Bahunam janmanam ante jnanavan mam prapadyate. Those who are jnanavan, those who have really come to the stage of mature knowledge, they surrender to Krishna. Only then they become realized. Otherwise, any amount of knowledge, which is simply some theoretical information, remains as theory. It doesn't become realized knowledge. It doesn't lead to enlightenment. So enlightenment is possible only by Bhakti. And real results of Karma, sorry, results of Karma is possible only by dedicating those activities in service of the Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "Kriya Yoga is specifically the principle to satisfy the Supreme Lord by one's activities."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Kriya Yoga as the principle of satisfying the Supreme Lord through one's activities, even those performed as duties or within the varnashrama system, and quotes Bhagavad Gita on Krishna being the enjoyer, proprietor, and well-wisher.

That's why Narad Muni is telling here that this Kriya Yoga, as he says here, yaratra kriyate karma bhagavad paritoshanam Kriya Yoga. Kriya Yoga is specifically the principle to satisfy the Supreme Lord by one's activities. Whatever activities one performs, even as duties or as one's own work in terms of one's position in the varnashrama system, whatever work one does, even spiritual activities, what may be called spiritual activities, activities of self-realization, all such activities have to be done to satisfy the Supreme Lord. Because in the fifth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna says, bhoktaram yajna tapasam sarva loka maheshwaram surdam sarva bhutana. Three principles he explains which are very, very important to understand. For ultimate peace, gyatvamam shanti mrcchati. What are the three principles? That Krishna is the supreme enjoyer of all sacrifices and penances. Ultimately, every sacrifice culminates in pleasing the Supreme Lord. Bhoktaram means he is the real enjoyer, ultimate enjoyer, of all, yajna tapasam, yajna and tapasya. And sarva loka maheshwaram, he is the supreme proprietor of all planets, all devatas, the entire creation, the entire existence. He is the Lord, he is the master, he is the proprietor. And the third point is surdam sarva maheshwaram, surdam sarva bhutanam, he is the topmost well-wisher

**Key Quote:** "When you please Krishna, everyone is satisfied."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of watering the root of a tree or feeding the stomach to illustrate that pleasing Krishna satisfies everyone, as all are parts and parcels of Him, and that transcendental knowledge is automatically achieved without separate endeavor.

of every living being, which means that if he is pleased, everyone is satisfied. You can easily understand it is very difficult to separately, individually satisfy every person. We are obligated to so many people. But if we simply satisfy Krishna, that is like watering the root of a tree. Then you are supplying water to the root of the tree is the best way to nourish all the parts of the tree, or supplying food to the stomach. All the parts of the body are nourished. There is an arrangement. So similarly, when you please Krishna, everyone is satisfied. All the parts and parcels, because everyone is a part and parcel of Krishna. So therefore, the recommendation here is that simply do all activities for pleasing the Supreme Lord. Transcendental knowledge or spiritual knowledge or enlightenment is automatically achieved without separate endeavour.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that Krishna gives knowledge to those engaged in loving devotional service, destroying the darkness of ignorance with the lamp of knowledge from within, emphasizing that devotional service works without separate endeavor.

This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita also. Krishna says, I give the knowledge to those who are engaged in my loving, devotional service. The principle is to please Krishna, out of love, for pleasing Krishna. And how does it work? Tesham eva anukampartham aham ajnana-jamta-maha-nashayami Atma bhavastho jnana-dipena-bhasuta. Because Krishna is seated in everyone's heart, so he destroys with the shining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance. All darkness is dispelled by Krishna. So therefore, that's how it works. Devotional service works without separate endeavour. And Krishna enlightens the devotee from within. Of this, there need be no doubt at all. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "The principle of always remembering Krishna through remembering his names, his qualities, his pastimes, his forms, etc."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam 1.5.36, explaining that it emphasizes remembering Krishna's names, qualities, and pastimes while performing one's duties according to Krishna's instructions.

This session we will be discussing from the 36th verse of the 5th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Kurvana Yatra Karmaani Bhagavachikshaya Asakrit Grnanthi Gunanamani Krishnasya Anusmaranticha. The meaning of this verse is: While performing duties according to the order of Sri Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one constantly remembers Him, His names, and His qualities. So, Srila Prabhupada has written a very elaborate purport for this verse. This is spoken by Narada Muni to Vyasa Deva. The principle of always remembering Krishna through remembering his names, his qualities, his pastimes, his forms, etc. This is what is being described here, and that also while performing duties accordingly.

**Key Quote:** "One should work only for Lord Krishna in all spheres of life."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on how to remember Krishna in all aspects of life, stating that Krishna should be considered the proprietor in every sphere, even in Vedic rites involving demigods.

So how does it actually work? Srila Prabhupada elaborates this in the purport. He says, an expert devotee of the Lord can mold his life in such a way that while performing all kinds of duties, either for this or the next life, he can constantly remember the Lord's name, fame, qualities, etc. So it is a question of molding one's life in a particular way that is enabling one to remember the Lord's name, qualities, pastimes, etc. The order of the Lord is distinctly there in the Bhagavad Gita. What is that order? One should work only for Lord Krishna in all spheres of life. In every sphere of life the Lord should be situated as the proprietor. According to Vedic rites, even in the worship of some demigods like Indra, Brahma, Saraswatthi, Ganesha, the system is that in all circumstances the representation of Vishnu must be there as Yajneshwara or the controlling power of such sacrifices.

#### supreme enjoyer, proprietorship, association with Krishna
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/oKbQ-2nrDPw?t=245
**Verse References:** BG 5.29
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Vishnu is the supreme lord of all the demigods."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Vishnu is the supreme lord and that all activities should be offered to Krishna, the supreme enjoyer, referencing Bhagavad Gita 5.29 and explaining that associating with Krishna's name and fame is associating with Krishna himself.

So, sacrifice to demigods also involves the representation of Vishnu as Yajneshwara. He is the supreme lord of all sacrifices. It is recommended that a particular demigod be worshipped for a particular purpose, as far as Karmakanda section of the Vedas is concerned. But still, the presence of Vishnu is compulsory in order to make the function proper, because the fact is, Vishnu is the supreme lord of all the demigods. Apart from such demigods, there are other demigods as well. Apart from such Vedic duties, even in our ordinary dealings, for example, in our business or profession or in our household affairs, we must consider that the result of all activities must be given over to the supreme enjoyer Lord Krishna. In the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna has declared himself to be the supreme enjoyer of everything, the supreme proprietor of every planet and the supreme friend of all beings. This is a famous verse in the 5th chapter, 29th verse: bhoktaram yajnatapasam sarva-loka-maheshwaram suradam sarva-bhutanam jnatvamam shanti-mrcchati. So therefore, no one else but Lord Shri Krishna can claim to be the proprietor of everything within his creation. A pure devotee remembers this constantly and in doing so, he repeats the transcendental name, fame and qualities of the Lord, which means that he is constantly in touch with Lord Krishna. Now the Lord is identical with his name, fame, etc.

**Key Quote:** "No one is more dear to him than one who is always engaged in preaching work, of the Lord's name and fame all over the world."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that chanting Hare Krishna constantly connects one with the Lord and that a significant portion of one's income should be used to spread Krishna consciousness, as preaching is very dear to the Lord.

So in simple words, while doing any work, if I keep chanting Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, then I am constantly in touch with the Lord himself. I am constantly performing all kinds of duties which are according to scriptural direction, not concocted duties. Then Srila Prabhupada talks about results of the activity. What about that? The major portion of our monetary income, not less than 50%, must be spent to carry out the order of Lord Krishna. Not only should we give the profit of our earning to this cause, but we must also arrange to preach this cult of devotion to others, because that is also one of the orders of the Lord. In the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord definitely says, no one is more dear to him than one who is always engaged in preaching work of the Lord's name and fame all over the world.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the scope of preaching, stating that while the Lord prefers preaching among devotees, Srila Prabhupada went to America to preach among non-devotees, following his guru's order.

The scientific discoveries of the material world can also be equally engaged in carrying out his order. The scope of what Narada Muni is telling Vyasa Deva here, is very, very broad application of the instruction here. So the Lord wants the message of the Bhagavad Gita to be preached amongst his devotees. It may not be so done amongst those who have no credit of austerities, charity, education etc. So how to apply this? The Lord says, you preach my message amongst the devotees, but not amongst those who are without any austerity, those who are without education, spiritual knowledge, not among those people, among non-devotees. So, Srila Prabhupada says, when it's a fact that in Kali Yuga majority of the people are non-devotees, what should we do? The attempt must go on to convert unwilling men to become his devotees. This is a secret that Prabhupada is revealing here, and this is exactly what Prabhupada did. He went to America on the order of his Guru, and he preached my message.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Krishna consciousness is eternally established in the heart of every living being."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna consciousness is dormant in everyone's heart and can be awakened through simple methods taught by Lord Chaitanya, such as singing, dancing, and offering Prasadam (sanctified food).

He preached amongst non-devotees. Non-devotees means those who are not conversant with devotional service, those who are not from the background of Vedic culture or Sanatana Dharma, culture of Sanatana Dharma, such people, hippies, common people who are materialists, all kinds of people. He did not discriminate. Prabhupada did not discriminate. He preached among all sections of people, and the attempt is how to make them devotees. Why? Why is this suggested by Srila Prabhupada here? Because the Chaitanya Charitamrita says, Krishna Bhakti Nitya Siddha Sadhya Kabunaya. Krishna consciousness is eternally established in the heart of every living being. So it is not some artificial imposition on a non-devotee. No. In that sense, if you see, because every living being is part and parcel of Krishna, every living being has got dormant Krishna consciousness within the heart. It is just covered by the material coverings. It has to be uncovered. So Srila Prabhupada further says, Lord Chaitanya has taught a very simple method in this connection. How is this done? To convert unwilling people to become devotees. He has taught the lesson for preaching the transcendental message through singing, dancing and refreshment. As such, 50% of our income may be spent for this purpose. This is what exactly Prabhupada did.

**Key Quote:** "He becomes present when anybody sings His holy name, irrespective of who the person is."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the power of Kirtan and Prasadam to purify the heart and bring about spiritual realization, stating that the Lord becomes present when His holy name is sung.

In the beginning, he introduced the non-devotees to Kirtan and singing and dancing and refreshment, Prasadam. Kirtan and Prasadam, two things he introduced in the beginning. And in this fallen age of quarrel and dissension, if only the leading and wealthy persons of society agree to spend 50% of their income in the service of the Lord, as it is taught by Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, there is absolute certainty of converting this hell of pandemonium to the transcendental abode of the Lord. And Prabhupada showed it actually, how it works. He practically demonstrated it in many parts of the world. So, further he says, no one will disagree to partake in a function where good singing, dancing and refreshment are administered. Kirtan and Prasadam. Generally, nobody will disagree. Everyone will attend such a function and everyone is sure to feel individually the transcendental presence of the Lord. See, this is the Lord's mercy. He becomes present when anybody sings His holy name, irrespective of who the person is. The Lord becomes present with all His potencies. He is incarnated that way in this Kali Yuga. This alone will help the attendant associate with the Lord and thereby purify himself in spiritual realization. The dirty things in the heart are all cleansed, cleansed away. No matter how much the dirt that is covering the holy name, the transcendental potency of Prasadam will work in a very, very, very powerful way, as powerful as the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that the effectiveness of Kirtan and Prasadam depends on conducting these activities under the guidance of a pure devotee, who can help even unwilling people become Krishna conscious and achieve success in life.

Now, the only condition for successfully executing such spiritual activities is that they must be conducted under the guidance of a pure devotee who is completely free from all mundane desires, fruitive activities and dry speculations about the nature of the Lord. The administering of this whole program of Kirtan and Prasadam among the non-devotees should be done under the guidance of a pure devotee, sent person, pure devotee of the Lord. Then it is effective. Because a pure devotee, when he sings or when he directs somebody else to sing, in that direction or in the singing, there is full potency, sent person potency. And that will cleanse away the heart and make even unwilling people to become devotees. And such devotees can actually become Krishna conscious and thereby make their life successful.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of Narayana as the primal cause of all expansions of Godhead according to the Pancharatra, and introduces the Chaturvyuha (Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha).

Sankarsana Pradyumna Aniruddha. So in the Purport, Srila Prabhupada says, according to the Pancharatra, this is one of the scriptures specifically connected with Bhakti or devotional service. So according to Pancharatra, Narayana is the primal cause of all expansions of Godhead. Now Krishna is there, the original personality, supreme personality of Godhead. He has got many expansions. Balarama is His expansion. Rama is His expansion. Parashurama is His expansion. Varaha is His expansion. Sankarsana is His expansion. Mahavishnu is His expansion, like that. So there are many, many expansions, actually unlimited expansions. But the Pancharatra describes Narayana, the form of the Lord, is the primeval cause of all expansions of Godhead. Now these are Vasudeva Sankarsana Pradyumna Aniruddha. The four expansions are specifically mentioned in the Pancharatra: Vasudeva Sankarsana Pradyumna Aniruddha. Now these four expansions are described as Vasudeva and Sankarsana are on the middle left and right. Pradyumna is on the right of Sankarsana and Aniruddha is on the left of Vasudeva. And thus the four deities are described.

**Summary:** The speaker continues explaining the Chaturvyuha and then discusses the significance of 'Om' in Vedic mantras, identifying it as a representation of Krishna.

The four deities are situated. They are known as the four HD camp of Lord Sri Krishna. The Sanskrit term is Chaturvyuha Rupa. Chaturvyuha. They are the four fold forms, expansions of the Supreme Lord. So this, whatever Narada Muni has told here, Om Namo Bhagavate Dubhyam. So this is a Vedic hymn or mantra beginning with Omkara Pranava. All Vedic mantras begin with Om. All Vedic mantras. So that Om is actually the Supreme Lord Krishna himself. That is explained in the Bhagavad Gita and all of the scriptures. Omkara is actually another form of Krishna Omni. The sound representation of Krishna. Thus the mantra is established by the transcendental chanting process namely Om, Namo, Dhimahi, etc.

**Key Quote:** "Any transaction either in the field of fruity work or in emperic philosophy, which is not ultimately aimed at transcendental realization of the Supreme Lord is considered to be useless."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that activities aimed at material gain or self-realization are useless if they don't lead to transcendental realization of the Supreme Lord.

Any Vedic mantra begins with Om and it has got these words in the mantra in order to invoke the presence of the Lord through such chanting. The purport is, now what is the meaning of this whole thing that has been described in this particular verse? Any transaction either in the field of fruity work or in emperic philosophy, which is not ultimately aimed at transcendental realization of the Supreme Lord is considered to be useless. In the Vedas, there are so many recommendations in terms of doing fruity work. What is fruity work? Any work done which will give a result of some material benefit. And emperic philosophy is knowledge which will lead to realization of the Self. So whether in the field of karma or jnana, which is something which is not aimed at transcendental realization of the Supreme Lord, ultimately the goal should always be in every activity, even what is recommended in the scriptures or otherwise. The aim should be transcendental realization of the Supreme Lord. Only that is having a permanent benefit for the soul. Otherwise, any sort of material gain, it is simply a temporary benefit. It is not going to save us ultimately when we have to face the cataclysms of material nature, when we have to face death, or when we have to face pralaya, when we have to face some natural calamities, or when we have to face material miseries which are forced upon us, then all the material benefits are useless.

**Key Quote:** "each one of us as spirit-soul, we have an intimate, loving relationship with Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of transcendental realization and developing intimacy with Krishna through devotional service, culminating in Krishna Prema.

So anything that we do should be aimed at transcendental realization of the Supreme Lord. Because by realizing the Supreme Lord, immediately we are elevated beyond the three gunas to the spiritual platform where there are no miseries, there are no natural calamities, there is no illusion, there is no effect of the illusory energy. So that is very, very important. It is very important to be noted. So Srila Prabhupada is further explaining here in the purport, Naradji has therefore explained the nature of unalloyed devotional service by his personal experience in the development of intimacy between the Lord and living entity. We should not forget, each one of us as spirit-soul, we have an intimate, loving relationship with Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is already there. It is eternally there. It is not some new relationship we have to discover or establish. No. It is eternally there. It always exists. And therefore this is so important to understand that the nature of pure devotional service is that one can develop this intimacy of one's relationship with Krishna by a gradual process of progressive devotional activities. This is what Narad Muni has been explaining in the several verses which he is instructing to Vyasa Deva. Such a progressive march of transcendental devotion for the Lord culminates in the attainment of loving service of the Lord which is called Prema. That is what Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is teaching us: Krishna Prema.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna Prema and the different rasas, distinguishing between pure and mixed devotional service and advocating for the pursuit of pure devotion.

as the ultimate goal of all processes. Ultimate goal of all processes is Krishna Prema. And this Krishna Prema is to be experienced in different transcendental variegatedness called rasas or tastes. It is not something which is stereotyped, hackneyed, boring, dull kind of experience. No. It is full of variegatedness. Rich variegated experience of different rasas. It is a very elaborate subject, a subject matter of transcendental taste, mellow taste of devotional service. Such devotional service is also executed in mixed forms, namely mixed with fruity work or empirical philosophical speculation. So there is pure devotional service and there is mixed devotional service. What is the difference? So Srila Prabhupada says that we should aim for pure devotional service, and we should not be settled down for mixed devotional service.

**Key Quote:** "What can satisfy the soul completely? Only if devotional service is pure, unmixed with karma and jnana."
**Summary:** The speaker provides examples of mixed devotional service (karma mishrita bhakti and jnana mishrita bhakti) and reiterates the importance of striving for pure, unmotivated devotional service to achieve lasting satisfaction.

For example, it has been explained already earlier in the second chapter of this first canto, but I will just briefly mention. Just like somebody performs devotional service with the aim of getting some material gain. That material gain could be something very, very pious. It may not be something sinful. But still such material gain being the aim of performing devotional service, as recommended in the Bhagavatam, that will make it mixed devotional service. Or somebody performs devotional service with the aim of merging into the existence of the Supreme. These are called karma mishrita bhakti and jnana mishrita bhakti. These will never satisfy the soul. These will never be permanent. They are all temporary results. They may give some temporary satisfaction, some temporary happiness, some temporary effects may be there, but they will not be eternally lasting. We should always remember that as spirit souls, we are always looking for eternal happiness, full of knowledge and transcendental bliss. That's what we are looking for. We are hankering for that. That is our constitutional position. That's our natural position. But anything short of that is never going to be satisfying ultimately. So, Suta Goswami has already explained, savai pumsam paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokshaje ahaituki apratihata yayatma supraseedati. What can satisfy the soul completely? Only if devotional service is pure, unmixed with karma and jnana. Even Rupa Goswami's definition, Acharya's definition of pure devotional service is, jnana karmadi anavratam, devotional service which is free from the mixture of jnana and karma. So, such pure devotional service is being explained here. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between knowledge of Brahman, Paramatma, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, emphasizing the confidential nature of the latter, and reiterates the three gifts bestowed upon Narada: knowledge, opulences, and loving service.

Because a lot has been said about this material world, and also regarding the spiritual information, knowledge of Brahman is there, and knowledge of Paramatma is also there. But very, very confidential knowledge is knowledge of the Supreme Personality of God. That too, the spiritual, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in his spiritual abode, personal abode in the spiritual sky. That is highly confidential. And after the Lord bestowed this transcendental knowledge of the Supreme Lord himself, then he bestowed spiritual opulences on Narada. Then after that, he bestowed Narada with the Lord's intimate loving service. So three things: confidential knowledge about the Supreme Lord revealed in the Vedas, then the spiritual opulences, and intimate loving service. Three things the Lord bestowed upon Narada when Narada worshipped the Lord

**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada on communion with the Lord through transcendental sound, explaining that each soul has a loving relationship with the Supreme Lord covered by material elements, which can be revived through bhakti, especially chanting the holy name.

through his transcendental sound representation. This is explained by Srila Prabhupada in the purport. Prabhupada says, "Communion with the Lord by transmission of the transcendental sound is non-different from the whole spirit Lord Sri Krishna." What is the meaning of communion? Communion means a close relationship with someone in which thoughts and feelings are exchanged. Now, this is the special thing about a personal loving relationship. You would have heard many times that actually in the scriptures it is revealed that each one of us, we are spirit soul, the Supreme Lord is the Supreme Spirit, and each one of us has got a specific loving relationship with the Supreme Lord. Every one of us, and that relationship is now covered by this material body, material mind, material intelligence, material ego. When the coverings are removed, then gradually by the process of bhakti, especially through approaching the Supreme Lord through his transcendental sound representation, which is the holy name

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the relationship with Krishna is always present but forgotten, and it can be revived through devotional service, emphasizing that Krishna's name, form, and qualities cannot be understood through material senses.

of the Supreme Lord, then we are able to revive that relationship. The relationship is always there. It is just forgotten. It is just covered. So when it is uncovered, then we are able to actually revive the relationship. What kind of relationship is it? It is a relationship of love. So because we in the material world have been away from the Lord for many, many, many births, we cannot count and go back in this regard. So without trying to trace the beginning of forgetfulness, Shastras say accept now your condition is you are forgetful of Krishna, and through the process of bhakti revive this relationship, and when it is revived, then the Lord reveals himself. Svayam evas puratyada. In the Puranas it is said, Atha Shri Krishna Nama adi na bhaved grahyam indriyaihi. Krishna's name, form, personality, personal qualities, personal activities are not to be understood through our blunt material senses.

**Key Quote:** "But if we begin devotional service with the tongue then the Lord reveals himself to such a devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of beginning devotional service with the tongue, specifically through chanting and hearing, which leads to the Lord revealing Himself to the devotee.

But if we begin devotional service with the tongue, sevon mukhe hi jivadau, then what is the tongue used for? Especially for vibrating and chanting, and hearing that transcendental sound attentively. Then Svayam evas puratyadaha, the Lord reveals himself to such a devotee. So the revelation by the Lord results in that close relationship of love being revived. It is there. It just has to be revived. And Srila Prabhupada says that the sound form of the Lord is completely the Lord himself. It is not just a reference, just like when I say table, I have a table in front of me.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is fully present and it is Krishna the Supreme Personality of Godhead with all his features. He is fully present in the sound."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the material experience of a name being separate from an object with the spiritual reality that Krishna is fully present in His name.

I say table. The sound table communicates to you some object called table. But actually the sound doesn't completely represent the table, you see. Simply by hearing you don't experience what is table. You may ask questions. What is the table made of? How big is the table? Or is it an old table or a new table? So many questions can be asked. Is it your table or somebody else's table? So many questions can be asked. But when we say Hare Krishna, Krishna is fully present and it is Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead with all his features. He is fully present in the sound. So this is a completely different concept for us who are only having material experience of an object or a person and his name

**Key Quote:** "Krishna means the entire personality. Unlimited personality is there in that sound Krishna two syllables."
**Summary:** The speaker uses analogies of a rose and water in different languages to illustrate that unlike material objects, Krishna's name embodies His entire unlimited personality.

being two different things. Just like the great poet Shakespeare. He said something like, "The rose called by any other name would smell as sweet." Of course when we say rose, we understand it's that fragrant, beautiful, particular flower. But he says, "What's in a name?" That is true in this material because even take the example of the same substance water referred to in different languages by different words. In Hindi they say Paani. In Sanskrit they say Jalam. In Kannada we say Neeru. So the same thing, same object water is referred to by different names. Now it is not like that with the Supreme Lord that it's simply a reference. Krishna is not just a reference. Krishna means the entire personality. Unlimited personality is there in that sound Krishna, two syllables. Krish na, two syllables. In that unlimited personality of Krishna is there. Krishna with his names, with his forms, with his qualities, with his activities, with his devotees, pure devotees, with his associates, with his abode, with his paraphernalia, with his energies, everything is just two syllables within this two syllables Krishna. So this sound is very, very powerful, as powerful as Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "This method is a completely perfect method for approaching the Lord by vibrating the tongue to produce the name holy name of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that chanting the holy name is a perfect method for approaching the Lord, but purity is essential, requiring avoidance of offenses and material misconceptions to understand the Vedic literatures and the Lord's desire for us to return to His spiritual abode.

So therefore Srila Prabhupada says here this method is a completely perfect method for approaching the Lord by vibrating the tongue to produce the name, holy name of the Supreme Lord. And by such pure contact with the Lord, see the purity of our uttering the holy name is possible only when we avoid this against the holy name, that is these are all offense means material misconceptions about the Lord. What these material misconceptions are I will explain in another different session. I want to have a separate session on that. Now I don't have time. So when the contact with the Lord through this material platform is completely pure, no material misconceptions, then the devotee can rise above the material platform and understand the inner meaning of the Vedic literatures including the Lord's existence of the material world. He is the controller of the material world. It is his but he has no other personal interest. He rather wants us to get out of this material existence and go to him in his personal abode in his spiritual holy name. That is the essence of what is explained

here. So we become enriched with the Lord's knowledge about the Lord, then the spiritual opulences. What are the spiritual opulences of the Lord? It is nothing but His form, His spiritual qualities, spiritual opulences. Everything is the spiritual opulence of the Lord, and the intimate loving service. There is exchange of love through service which is loving devotional service. This is the spiritual love that we have for our Lord. So we are the spiritual opulences of the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of the verse, highlighting Narada Muni's instruction to Vyasadeva to describe the Lord's activities to alleviate suffering and satisfy learned men.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 40th verse of the 5th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is the last verse in this chapter: Tvam Apya Tvam Api Adabhra Shruta Vishrutam Vibho Samapyate Yena Vidam Bubutsitam Prachyahi Dukhayar Muhur Ardhitaatmanam Sanklesh Nirvanam Ushantinanyatha. The meaning of this verse is: Please listen.

**Key Quote:** "exclusive literature describing the glories of Krishna, especially Krishna's activities."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding the Absolute Truth as the Supreme Person, highlighting the significance of Krishna's activities and glories as described in the Srimad Bhagavatam.

So this verse, spoken by Narada Muni to Vyasadeva, is the conclusion of this chapter. The chapter title is Narada's Instructions on Srimad Bhagavatam. Narada Muni has sufficiently justified why Vyasadeva should compile Srimad Bhagavatam. Why? It is clear. He has revealed exclusive literature describing the glories of Krishna, especially Krishna's activities. The conception of the Absolute Truth as the Supreme Person is important to understand. That person means activities; impersonal, there is no activity; impersonal, there are no qualities; impersonal, there are no names, forms, there is no paraphernalia, there is no variety, there is no variegatedness. All this variety—names, forms, qualities, pastimes, activities, everything, paraphernalia, devotees, relationships, everything—is possible only if we try to understand the Absolute Truth's feature as the Supreme Person, Bhagavan. That's why Bhagavata. So here, Narada Muni's conclusion is that for helping people identify suffering of material existence, the easiest way is to provide the transcendental glories of the Supreme Lord's activities. His activities are extraordinary.

**Key Quote:** "The four classes of good men acknowledge the authority of the Almighty God, of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the four classes of good men who acknowledge the Supreme Lord and intuitively take shelter of Him.

Extraordinary. None of his activities are ordinary. So, that is Narada Muni's instruction to Vyasa Deva. Now, Srila Prabhupada very nicely explains in the purport that Narada Muni is instructing Vyasa Deva to compile the Bhagavatam for the good of all classes of people of the entire world. So, Srila Prabhupada says, according to the Bhagavad Gita analysis, there are four classes of good men and four classes of bad men also in this world. Who are the four classes of good men? First of all, the description of the four classes of good men. The four classes of good men acknowledge the authority of the Almighty God, of the Supreme Lord. And therefore, such good men fall under four classes. The first class of good men are those who are in difficulty. The second class of good men are those who are in need of money. The third class of good men are those who are advanced in knowledge. And the fourth class of good men are those who are inquisitive to know more and more about God. All these four classes of men intuitively take shelter of the Lord because they acknowledge the Lord. They acknowledge the authority of the Almighty Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "But even that vast learning, if it is not utilized for specifically describing the transcendental activities of the personality of Godhead, until then, he can have full satisfaction in the heart"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that even with vast Vedic knowledge, Vyasadeva felt a vacuum until he described the transcendental activities of the Supreme Lord, emphasizing the importance of focusing on Krishna's glories.

Now, Narada is instructing Vyasa Deva to broadcast the transcendental knowledge of God in terms of the vast Vedic knowledge which he has already attained. If you remember, at the beginning of the fourth chapter, it was described Vyasa Deva, he first of all put the Vedas in writing and he divided the Vedas into four. And then he further summarized the Vedas. He explained the Vedas for less intelligent class of people in an easily understandable way by presenting the Mahabharata. Like that, so much work he did, but he is still feeling a vacuum in his heart. So, he is vastly learned. But even that vast learning, if it is not utilized for specifically describing the transcendental activities of the personality of Godhead, until then, he can have full satisfaction in the heart, including those who are learned in the Vedas, just like Vyasa Deva himself. He is not feeling satisfaction in his heart. He is fully learned in the Vedas because he has not described the transcendental glories of the activities of the Supreme Lord.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "The first category of bad men that are described, those who are simply addicted to the mode of progressive fruity work."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the four classes of bad men: those addicted to fruitive work, those engaged in sinful activities, those materially advanced in knowledge but lacking devotion, and atheists who hate God.

Now, as far as the four classes of bad men are concerned, they are also described in the Bhagavad Gita. The first category of bad men that are described, those who are simply addicted to the mode of progressive fruity work. Fruity work means they have to do some work in which they get some results for their material enjoyment, material pleasure, material gain. That is called fruity work. So, there are people who are addicted to progressive fruity work and they keep on doing this, and as a result, they are subjected to the accompanying miseries. Nothing in this material world, any material work done, is always accompanied by miseries. You cannot say, I will do something and I want only pleasure. No, not possible. Always there is pleasure and pain, or enjoyment and suffering. Sukha and dukkha are two sides of the same coin. Two sides of the same coin, material activity, fructive activity. So, this is the first class of bad men. The second class of bad men are those who are simply addicted to vicious work, sinful activities. For what? For sense gratification, for sense satisfaction. And naturally they suffer the consequences because they are outright engaging in sinful activity. They have to suffer. Sooner or later, they have to suffer. And the third class of bad men are those who are materially advanced in knowledge, but they suffer. In spite of being advanced in knowledge, they suffer because they do not have the sense to acknowledge the authority of the Almighty Supreme Lord. So, what happens? The effect of their knowledge is stolen away by the illusory energy: Māyayā pahṛtaṁ jñānam. And the fourth class of bad men, those who are known as atheists and who therefore purposely hate the very name of God,

**Key Quote:** "A pure devotee is not thinking, let me try to do good to some good people. No. He is thinking of doing good to all suffering people, all types of people who are suffering material miseries, whether they are good men or bad men."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the misconceptions of atheists and highlights the compassionate vision of a pure devotee who aims to benefit all suffering beings, regardless of their nature.

although they are always in difficulty, it is natural for somebody who is in difficulty to take shelter of God. But these people, because they have developed a hatred for God with a misunderstanding that God is their enemy, or God is against them, or God is not in their favour, or God is partial to somebody who is their enemy, all kinds of misconceptions, wrong conceptions, misunderstanding. So, they are always in difficulty because they engage in sinful activities one after another, one after another, and they continuously suffer. Still, they will never surrender to God. So, Nārada is advising Vyāsadeva, you please describe the glories of the Supreme Lord to do good to all eight classes of men, both good and bad. See, this is the vision of the Āchārya. This is the vision of the pure devotee. A pure devotee is not thinking, let me try to do good to some good people. No. He is thinking of doing good to all suffering people, all types of people who are suffering material miseries, whether they are good men or bad men. So, please understand, in this world, other than devotees of the Supreme Lord, everyone else can be classified into these eight classes of good and bad men.

**Key Quote:** "Srimad Bhagavatam is therefore not meant for any particular class of men or any particular section of society. No. It is meant for the sincere soul who actually wants his own welfare and peace of mind."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes that Srimad Bhagavatam is for everyone seeking welfare and peace, offering liberation from material miseries and transcendence through hearing the Lord's activities.

This is the analysis of the Gita: Chaturvidhā bhajante mām janā sukṛtino arjuna and namām duṣkṛtino mūḍhā prapadyante narādhamā māyayā pahṛta-jñāna āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritam. So, if people are not devotees of the Supreme Lord in this world, then they are either fruitive workers who perform pious activities or they are sinful people who simply don't care for any pious activities and they simply do all kinds of sinful activities. So, for doing good to all eight classes of men, Narada is advising Vyasa Deva kindly compile the Bhagavatam, in which you exclusively describe the transcendental glories of the Supreme Lord, especially by describing His extraordinary activity. So, the conclusion is, Srimad Bhagavatam is therefore not meant for any particular class of men or any particular section of society. No. It is meant for the sincere soul who actually wants his own welfare and peace of mind. Simply by hearing Bhagavatam, the extraordinary activities of the transcendental Supreme Lord, one can become free from all material miseries, one can become peaceful in the mind, one can become situated transcendentally above the three gunas, no more victimized by the three modes. So, that is what is the Bhagavatam. Hare Krishna. I will stop here.

So, the concluding verse of the previous chapter was that Narada finally concluded the chapter by telling Vyasadeva to describe the transcendental activities of Supreme God for the good of all classes of people, for everyone's good. And that's the only way to mitigate the material miseries in which people are suffering in this world. So now, the conversation will be taken further, where Vyasadeva makes some very important inquiries from Narada, so that Narada will reveal more about how he made progress after he got initiation from the Bhaktivedantas.

In this chapter, Nāradjī will describe how he was able to have a brief audience with the Lord, Supreme Lord, while he was absorbed in the Bhagavatam. He was absorbed in the transcendental thought of separation from the Lord, and when it was very painful for him." So, a disciple should be inquisitive. A disciple should inquire from his spiritual master and should inquire about relevant things. So, here the relevant question is raised about the perfection of Nārada.

**Key Quote:** "How was it achieved after he got initiated?"
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Narada received initiation and confidential knowledge, became endowed with spiritual opulences, and ultimately had a brief audience with the Supreme Lord while absorbed in the thought of separation from Him.

How was it achieved after he got initiated? Already, Nārada has described about his previous life, the birth and activities. Till this stage, he was able to get initiated, and the confidential knowledge about the personality of Godhead was revealed to him by the Bhaktivedanta's. And he was endowed with spiritual opulences and with the understanding about the confidential understanding about the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So now, Nārada is going to describe to Vyāsadeva, based on Vyāsadeva's enquiry, how Nārada was able to have a brief audience with the Supreme Lord, and it happened when he was completely absorbed in transcendental thought of separation from the Lord.

Because, Srila Prabhupāda says, he wanted to follow in Nārada's footsteps in order to attain to the same perfect stage of life. Nārada has achieved the perfection of spiritual life. So, Vyāsadeva is enquiring from Nārada, what did you do after initiation, exactly, before you got your present spiritual body? This desire to enquire from the spiritual master is an essential factor to the progressive path. This process is technically known as Saddharmaprcchā.

So, in the parport, Śrīla Prabhupāda says, "Śrī Nārada Muni in his previous life was just an ordinary maid servant's son. So, how he became so perfectly transformed into the spiritual body of eternal life, bliss and knowledge is certainly important. How did this transformation take place?" Bhagavad Gītā says our body is changing always. Dehi nosmin yathā dehe kaumāram yauvanam jarā. We all experience as spirit soul the body which is different from the spirit, the material body is changing from childhood to youth to old age. Similarly, the body changes at death. Of this there is no doubt. Everybody changes their body even at the time of death, tathā dehaṁ taraptiḥ. But, the significant question here is not whether the change of body has happened or not. It is about how he became so perfectly transformed into the spiritual body of eternal life, bliss and knowledge. That is the important question being raised here.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of learning from Narada's life how he achieved a spiritual body from an ordinary material one, highlighting the significance of the changes that occurred and ending with Hare Krishna.

That is not going to happen just like that. Change from a material body to a spiritual one is not going to happen easily. It doesn't happen automatically. So, how did this change happen? That is precisely the question that Vyasa Deva is asking from his spiritual master, Narada Muni. Sri Vyasa Deva desired him, desired that Narada, disclose the facts for everyone's satisfaction. It is very important to learn from the life of Narada how did Narada Muni get the spiritual body in this life when he had an ordinary material body in his previous life, like any of us, most insignificant parentage. He was born in the previous life as a son of an insignificant maid servant. But some changes happened, and those changes are important to hear about firsthand from Narada Muni himself. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

So he, Narada, the small boy, he started for north. North means the direction in which the Himalayas are situated. And in the Himalayas there are all kinds of facilities for somebody who wants to stay all alone and actually practice spiritual life. Especially in Satya Yuga the recommended method was meditation on the Lord in the heart.

#### cyclical creation, mundane wranglers, spiritual inquiry

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "The mundane wranglers waste time and energy with archeological excavations without searching into the vital necessities of life."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Srila Prabhupada's commentary on the cyclical nature of creation and criticizes 'mundane wranglers' who focus on material discoveries rather than spiritual inquiry.

So very interesting purport by Srila Prabhupada, a very pertinent observation is made by Srila Prabhupada. Kindly note this. Prabhupada says in the purport, "Man's activities in agriculture, mining, farming, industries, gardening etc. were all on the same scale as they are now." Sometimes we think when we read so-called history that there was a primitive civilization of man was very primitive condition caveman and then gradually evolved to become the present civilized society but that is not the fact. Man's activities in all these fields agriculture mining farming industries gardening etc. were on the same scale as they are now even previous to the present creation and the same activities will remain as they are even in the next creation cyclically this is going on creation maintenance destruction again creation maintenance destruction in a day of Brahma in a day of Brahma of course there are changes that happen even within one day of Brahma but at the beginning of the day of Brahma there is creation and the end of day of Brahma there is destruction so in between there is there are changes taking place with essentially man's activities at least on the earth are similar to what was there in a previous creation. So, Srila Prabhupada says, after many hundreds of millions of years, one creation is started by the law of nature and the history of the universe repeats itself practically in the same way. It is out of necessity that human beings have to do cultivation of the field and then there are forests which give certain produce without any human endeavor by the arrangement of the Supreme Lord through the nature, mother nature and then there are mines which has got deposits of different minerals, different metals, that mining activity was always there even in the past and it is there now and will be there in the future also. So, the history of the universe repeats itself practically in the same way. As far as major activities are concerned among the different classes of people on different planets, it repeats itself. Now, here is the important observation that Srila Prabhupada is making. The mundane wranglers waste time and energy. They waste time with archeological excavations without searching into the vital necessities of life. So, mundane wranglers. Mundane means they are only concerned with matter and material things and material existence. They are not have understanding of something beyond matter. They do not know who they are. They do not know their spirit. They don't know there is a spiritual dimension to existence in every human being, every living being actually, particularly in a human being. And there is a spiritual world beyond this material world, which is eternal. Of this, there are people who have no knowledge, no idea, no trace of any understanding. Totally zero when it comes to spiritual understanding. So they are called mundane wranglers.

#### spiritual inquiry, Brahma Jijnasa, human life's purpose
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/i1qa4vYcCXw?t=579
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Without making this inquiry, human life is completely wasted."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of spiritual inquiry (Brahma Jijnasa) as the vital necessity of human life, contrasting it with the wasted effort of focusing solely on material pursuits.

They are simply busy with material things. And they are fascinated if they discover something by excavation. Some ancient civilization, they had beautiful buildings. They had a... They had, you know, gold coins. They had a system of mining and purifying. Metallurgy was very advanced even thousands of years back. When they discover all this through excavations, then they waste so much time into rebuilding so-called history. But... What they... Are losing out is the valuable human life, the time we can spend in this human form of life into searching out the vital necessity of this human form of life. What is that? Inquiry into the absolute truth. In just three words in Vedanta Sutra, the whole thing is summarized: Athato Brahma Jijnasa. Vital necessity of life. Inquire into what is spirit. What is Brahman or who is God. Or who you are. Inquire into this. Without making this inquiry, human life is completely wasted. All the developed intelligence, the ability to ask fundamental questions and try to get meaningful answers, this opportunity is lost. It's a greatest loss for a human being. In the evolution of the consciousness through different species of life in this material world, the human form of life is the most evolved, developed state of consciousness. So, therefore, it is very well known human being is a rational animal, can think, can contemplate, can inquire, can learn, can teach, can do so many things with this developed intelligence, developed consciousness. So, the most important inquiry, the most important inquiry is inquiry about spirit, inquiry about God, inquiry about spiritual reality. That's called Brahma Jijnasa. And that is the most important part of a Vedic knowledge.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Just by studying, understanding, realizing your spirit soul, all your problems are solved."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights the importance of spiritual knowledge over material knowledge, emphasizing that realizing one's spiritual identity solves all problems, and concludes by reiterating Narada Muni's example of prioritizing spiritual pursuits.

Vedic knowledge, clearly there are two departments: material knowledge and spiritual knowledge. Of these two, spiritual knowledge is the most important because that is the vital necessity of a human being. Why? Just by studying, understanding, realizing your spirit soul, all your problems are solved. Your life is ultimately a success. You can end the repetition of birth and death. You can solve all your problems only by realizing the truth that you are spirit. And of course, the supreme absolute truth is the supreme spirit, Krishna. And you have got a relationship. Three things. But it begins with inquiry into who am I. Essentially, who am I? Am I this body? Am I something different from the body? Or this inquiry is the most important inquiry. So, instead of wasting time inquiring into what was this civilization like 300 years back or 500 years back, what kind of buildings were they building, what were they eating, what were they doing for entertainment, all these kind of things are waste of human energy. That is what is being pointed out. So, after getting his impetus in spiritual life, Narad Muni, even as a 5 year old boy, did not waste time a single moment with economic development. Although he passed through all these towns, villages, mines, industries, he continually went on till he reached that sacred holy place to sit and do meditation. That was his aim. So, we will continue this discussion in the next session.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Somebody serious about spiritual life will never be attracted to any place which is meant for satisfying the senses."
**Summary:** Narada Muni's travels are described, emphasizing his detachment from material attractions and focus on spiritual pursuits.

In this session, we will be discussing from the twelfth verse of the sixth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Chitradhatu Vichitradrin Ibha Bhagna Bhujadruman Jalashayan Shivajalan Nalini Surasevitaha Chitrasvanai Patrarathair Vibhrahmad Bhramara Shriyaha. The meaning of this verse is: I pass through hills and mountains full of reservoirs of various minerals like gold, silver, and copper, and through tracts of land with reservoirs of water filled with beautiful lotus flowers fit for the denizens of heaven, decorated with bewildered bees and singing birds. Naradamuni is describing his travel. He passed through different kinds of places, and as it will be explained in the next verse, it is the duty of a sanyasi, a renunciant, or one dedicated to spiritual life, to actually travel through different tracts of land which are all the creation of the supreme lord in this material world, and none of such places have any attraction for a serious spiritualist like Narada. There is no attraction. He is passing through reservoirs of gold, silver, copper, but he has no attraction for them, neither is he attracted to a beautiful place filled with clear water and lotus flowers so beautiful that it is fit for the heavenly inhabitants, singing birds, beautiful bees. He is not at all attracted by any of these because with one pointed attention he is determined to go to a place fit for him to sit and do meditation on the supreme lord as taught by the bhaktivedantas, his spiritual masters, when they were staying for four months during chaturmasya in that place in the forest where his mother was a maid servant. So somebody serious about spiritual life will never be attracted to any place which is meant for satisfying the senses. Any place which is meant for sense satisfaction, such a place has no attraction for a transcendentalist.

A serious spiritualist. The next verse describes further what are the different kinds of places he passed through. The thirteenth verse: nala venu sharastamba kusha ki chaka gahvaram eka evaati yathoham adraksham vipinam mahat ghoram pratibhayakaram vyala uluka shivajiram. The meaning of this verse is: I then passed alone through many forests of rushes, bamboo reeds, sharp grass, weeds, and caves which were very difficult to go through alone. I visited deep, dark, and dangerously fearful forests which were the play yards of snakes, owls, and jackals. So Narad Muni is passing through not only beautiful places, attractive places, but also through some dangerous tracts of land like forests which are deep, dark, and dangerously fearful because they are inhabited by snakes, owls, and jackals.

**Key Quote:** "The real purpose of a sanyasi is not to beg, so just to satisfy some householders he may take a little food, may take, may not take, but his main purpose is how to enlighten the householder in spiritual subject matter."
**Summary:** The role of a mendicant (parivrajaka acharya) is explained, emphasizing their duty to enlighten householders spiritually, rather than simply begging for food.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains it is the duty of a mendicant. Mendicant literally means a beggar, but it is taken in the sense of a spiritualist who lives a very simple life by being dedicated for spiritual practice, and for maintaining his body he simply begs for some little food from a householder. So such a mendicant is called a parivrajaka acharya. Parivrajaka means he is travelling constantly, wandering, and acharya means he is teaching. What is he teaching? He is teaching spiritual subject matter. He is awakening householders who are lost in material way of life to remind them about their spiritual goal in life. So he enlightens them, and on the plea of begging he goes to their house, but his real purpose of going to the house of a householder is not for begging, it is for enlightening them spiritually. Of course, in the Vedic culture, the householders welcome a sanyasi or a travelling mendicant or a transcendentalist. They welcome him home because they know that he brings in all auspiciousness, but the real purpose of a sanyasi is not to beg. So just to satisfy some householders, he may take a little food, may take, may not take, but his main purpose is how to enlighten the householder in spiritual subject matter which is the prime necessity for every human being.

**Summary:** The duties of a parivrajaka acharya are further elaborated, including experiencing God's creation through travel and enlightening others, followed by a brief introduction to the four stages of sanyas.

So here Srila Prabhupada is telling it is the duty of a parivrajaka acharya to experience all varieties of God's creation. How does he do that? By travelling alone through all forests, hills, towns, villages, travelling alone to gain faith in God and strength of mind as well as to enlighten the inhabitants with the message of God. This is the, this is the program of a parivrajaka acharya. In sanyas, there are four stages of development of a complete renunciation. The beginning stage is called kutichaka, the second stage is called bahudhaka, the third stage is called parivrajaka acharya, and the fourth stage is called paramahamsa.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "One's dependence should be on the supreme lord seated in the heart, who is always accompanying every person and is providing, maintaining, is actually taking care of the well being."
**Summary:** The four stages of sanyas are explained, focusing on the initial stages of renunciation and the development of dependence on God, leading to fearlessness.

Briefly I will just mention what are the stages of sanyas. Kutichaka is when one decides to renounce connection with family members, leaves home, but not yet practiced how to maintain himself independently, so he builds a cottage outside his village and he receives food from home. He is cut off from the family members, social interaction, but as far as his food requirement is concerned, it is taken care of by the family, former family members. When he is practiced in that way, then he realizes how he can actually maintain himself very easily by begging a little from many different houses, so nobody will feel a burden for weeding one person a little bit, collecting little, little from many houses, then nobody feels the burden and the person is very easily able to get his necessity of daily food, and so that's called bahudhaka, the second stage of sanyas where one is not dependent only on his one home, the former purvashram family residence, but begs little from the different people of the village outside which he is staying, and in that way very easily he maintains himself, his requirement of food. Then when he becomes further well established in sanyas, then he starts actually travelling. Travelling is for gaining strength of mind, faith in God, and enlighten the inhabitants as he is passing through different towns, villages, or settlements, human settlements like that. So these three things are particularly mentioned here: travelling alone, travelling alone to become fearless because a sanyasi knows that God is in my heart and he is my top most well wisher, he is my protector, he is my maintainer. Only due to illusion somebody may think that I have to depend on somebody else or something else outside of me. Actually one's dependence should be on the supreme lord seated in the heart who is always accompanying every person and is providing, maintaining, is actually taking care of the well being. It is only this supreme lord who does so. This is the purpose of a sanyasi.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "In this age of Kali, sanyasi is forbidden for ordinary people because they cannot maintain sanyasi like in former ages, but for the sake of preaching one may accept sanyasi simply for the sake of preaching Krishna consciousness."
**Summary:** Lord Chaitanya is presented as an example of a traveling sanyasi, and the role of sanyas in Kali Yuga is discussed, emphasizing the importance of preaching Krishna consciousness.

Now further Praveshwara Prabhupada says a sanyasi is duty bound to take all these risks without fear, and the most typical sanyasi of the present age is Lord Chaitanya, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. He took sanyas and he travelled in the same manner like Narada Muni. Narada Muni travelled in a former age. Chaitanya travelled through the central Indian jungles enlightening even the tigers, bears, snakes, deer, elephants, and many other jungle animals, what to speak of enlightening human beings. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu even enlightened jungle animals while travelling. Of course, he is the supreme lord, so he can enlighten any living being, any living entity, but at least we should attempt to enlighten human beings in the subject matter of sankirtana bhakti yoga or practice of devotional service which is the recommended process in this age. So sanyasi is duty bound to take all these risks without fear. So Srila Prabhupada further says in this age, Kali, in the age of Kali, sanyasi is forbidden for ordinary people because they cannot maintain sanyasi like in former ages, but for the sake of preaching one may accept sanyasi simply for the sake of preaching Krishna consciousness because there is a need for preachers to travel and preach. So this sanyasi is more than change of dress. What is important is to stop social intercourse and devote life exclusively for preaching the message of God among the common people. That is the truth. So I'll stop.

**Key Quote:** "A travelling mendicant can meet the needs of the body, namely thirst and hunger, by the gifts of nature without being a beggar at the doors of the householder."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Narada Muni's travels and how a mendicant should rely on nature's gifts rather than begging, emphasizing self-sufficiency and detachment.

In this session we will be discussing from the 14th verse of the 6th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Parishranta Indriya Atma Aham Trd Parito Bubhukshitaha Snatva Peetva Hrade Nadya Upas Prishto Gata Shramaha. The meaning of this verse is: Thus travelling, I felt tired, both bodily and mentally, and I was both thirsty and hungry. So I took a bath in a river, lake, and also drank water. By contacting water, I got relief from my exhaustion. So Narav Muni is describing his experiences while travelling to that place. In that holy place, on the way he came across so many different kinds of prosperous towns, gold mines, beautiful lakes filled with lotus flowers and singing birds, but he was not attracted by any of those. His mind was fixed on reaching that sacred spot where he could sit. So what about the demands of the body while travelling? A travelling mendicant can meet the needs of the body, namely thirst and hunger, by the gifts of nature without being a beggar at the doors of the householder.

**Key Quote:** "So to awaken them to spiritual reality is the duty of a traveling transcendentalist Parivrajakacharya."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the role of a traveling transcendentalist in enlightening householders who are often engrossed in family affairs.

By Krishna's arrangement, he could get the needs of the body. By Krishna's arrangement, there is sufficient food and water available for any person who just wants to dedicate himself for spiritual life without any need for begging at the door of a householder. So Srila Prabhupada further says the mendicant therefore does not go to the house of a householder to beg but to enlighten him spiritually. There is no need for begging, but then on the plea of begging sometimes is transcendent. A spiritualist may go and approach a householder simply to take the opportunity to enlighten the householder spiritually. That is a real purpose because people, especially in household life, they become busy with their work, family maintenance, providing for the needs of the family members, etc. Many responsibilities as regards the maintenance of the family. So they get more or less lost in such family affairs. So to awaken them to spiritual reality is the duty of a traveling transcendentalist.

Parivrajakacharya. Now Srila Prabhupada especially mentions elsewhere about the Himalaya mountains. He says that the Himalaya mountains are famous for all richnesses. What are the riches in the Himalaya mountains? There are innumerable caves to live in, numberless trees of good fruits to eat, good springs to drink water from, and profuse drugs and minerals to cure diseases. Any man who is not materially prosperous can take shelter of these great mountains and he will be provided with everything required. Both the materialist and the spiritualist can take advantage of the great shelter of the Himalayas. So Naran Muni is heading to the Himalayas only and in that place everything is provided for by the superior arrangement of the Supreme Lord.

Any of you have been to the Himalayas? If you have been to Himalayas you should—generally people don't go visit Himalayas like away from the crowded places. If you go to a place which is not so much crowded then you'll find so many nice fruit trees. Plenty of fruits and there are plenty of flowers available, caves where one can stay, numberless caves, so many caves are there and the river flows with crystal-clear water. There are springs, even hot water springs so that one can take bath when it is very cold in the hot water of the hot water spring and there are so many herbs to cure diseases. In case somebody becomes diseased then there are so many herbs to cure the diseases so everything is provided for both materially and spiritually and they can sit in a secluded place and nicely do meditation without being disturbed or bothered by anyone else so the fifteenth words Narada Muni further describes his travel.

The meaning of this verse is: after that under the shadow of a banyan tree in an uninhabited forest, I began to meditate upon the Supersoul situated within, using my intelligence as I had learned from liberated souls. So Narada Muni has reached a proper spot, uninhabited forest. It has to be a secluded place for doing meditation without being disturbed by anyone else and there under the shadow of a banyan tree. Banyan tree gives very nice shade so one can be sitting underneath a banyan tree then firmly seated he began to meditate upon the Supersoul within his heart doing meditation and there's a system of meditation and to search out the Supersoul one has to use one's intelligence applying the intelligence to search out the Supersoul by the method that has been taught by liberated souls whatever he had

Meditation is not like whatever I like to do I'll do, no, that is not proper. Such meditation which one does whimsically will not give any tangible result in terms of self-realization. So Srila Prabhupada further says one should know perfectly well from the authoritative sources of scriptures through the transparent medium of a bona fide spiritual master and by proper use of one's trained intelligence for meditating upon the Supersoul dwelling within every living being. So first of all one should know that Supersoul is seated in my heart and this description is available in the authoritative scriptures but such scriptural knowledge is learned from a bona-fide spiritual master and the spiritual master trains one's intelligence how to search out the Supersoul within the heart and when these words are said surely achieve enlightenment the spiritual master will not pit itself on aHa and fix one's mind on the form of the Supersoul in the heart to meditate and

So what is the training that the spiritual master gives? He trains the devotee how to render loving service to the Supreme Lord Krishna. This is the training and this training results in the consciousness being properly fixed in devotional service to the Supreme Lord. That is very very important. It's a standard one has to establish in order to be properly situated for doing meditation. Now it is described here as far as Narada is concerned even when he was a small boy, five-year-old boy, he contacted bona fides spiritual masters. He served them sincerely and he got enlightenment rightly. They blessed him with the transcendental knowledge and Narada was enlightened because he had rendered nice service to them so they gave the blessing by which he could understand that he has to meditate on the Supersoul in the heart and he has to follow the right process for that.

Our entire mind or consciousness on the process perfectly following whatever has been taught by the spiritual master without any concoction, without any speculation, without any doubts.

So in development of Bhakti, the science of devotional service, it is explained Bhakti begins with Shraddha. And there are nine steps through which one progresses as one practices Bhakti according to the standard procedure given in the devotional literature. So in different places in the scriptures, it is described how Bhakti has to be practiced. One of the disciples of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, by name Shrila Rupa Goswami, has gathered all the details of the practice of Bhakti from different scriptures. He is expert in gathering all the connected details about practice of bhakti and he has presented them systematically as the science of bhakti yoga in a scripture he has compiled called Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu, which is translated and explained by Sri la Prabhupada, the founder acharya of ISKCON, as Nectar of Devotion. So in Nectar of Devotion, Sri la Prabhupada explains, citing Sri la Rupa Goswami, that Bhakti begins with Shraddha. Shraddha is faith, transcendental faith. So what is this transcendental faith?

Prema is love for Krishna. So starting with shraddha till prema, there are nine steps. Pradha is the first step and prema is the ninth step, the highest perfection, the ultimate perfection. In between there are other steps. So shraddha leads to sadhu sangha, associating with like-minded devotees who are also practicing the standard procedure and our serious aspirants for achieving the highest perfection. Sadhu sangha then bhajana kriya step. Bhajana kriya is the standard activities, especially the initiation, the deeksha initiation from the bona fide spiritual master and that initiation as taught by Sri la Prabhupada according to the parampara system in which he is coming, bringing down this, uh, this knowledge and the practice, the bona fide method of practicing bhakti in this age.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Anartha Nivritti (cleansing of misgivings) and Nishtha (fixed devotion) as steps in the process of Bhakti.

Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. That leads to Anartha Nivritti, the fourth step. Anartha Nivritti involves cleansing the heart of all kinds of misgivings, all kinds of misconceptions, wrong ideas about who I am, who is God, what is my relationship, what is this world, where have I come from, what is my ultimate goal in life, everything. We have some... some idea. But all the misunderstandings are cleared away and the correct understanding becomes established properly in the heart. And when Anartha Nivritti has sufficiently happened, say about 80 percent, then there is nishtha. One becomes fixed up in the practice of devotional service. In the association of devotees, following the standard procedure as taught by the bona fide spiritual master, without any deviation, without any speculation, without any concoction, and without any doubt. So one makes steady progress. So nishtha is the fifth stage or the fifth step. In the nine step process of perfection in bhakti, nishtha is that one becomes fixed up. There is no more any wavering. In the beginning, there is little obstacle which may make one feel that, oh, today I cannot chant or today I cannot do this. Today I cannot read. But by... by cleansing the heart of the misgivings and sufficient cleansing has happened. As I mentioned, about 80 percent cleansing has happened. Then one becomes very serious, very fixed up and will every day do the chanting, do the follow the process of bhakti, practice of bhakti without any... without any... break. Continuously, steadily follow the process without any break. Just like a good student in school will attend class every day. The school is arranging to conduct the classes. A serious student, a good student will very nicely attend the classes and do all the work associated with learning. Similarly, in bhakti also every day chanting everyday, reading every day, praying every day, paying obeisances. Whatever the standard processes.

Then the sixth step from nishtha it progresses to the six step, it's called... Ruchi. Ruchi progresses to the sixth step. It's called Ruchi. One develops spiritual taste for whatever one is doing. The spiritual taste is different from any material liking or material experience of some pleasantness. Beyond that, it is a spiritual taste which is because of the heart being cleansed of all material misgivings. So one develops the spiritual taste which is going to even make the devotee further determined to continue very seriously, very nicely, very rigidly follow the process and the seventh step is what is called as asakti, attachment. One becomes so attached to doing this chanting and reading and hearing and bowing down and worshipping and all those things, the process that I cannot remain without doing this even one day. I just cannot miss it. It becomes the most important thing in one person's, a devotee's life. This practice of bhakti becomes so I become attached, asakti.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Bhava (transcendental ecstasy) and describes the symptoms of ecstasy, referencing Narada Muni's experience.

Then the 8th step is bhava. That is what is mentioned here. Bhava is one the stage where one experiences transcendental ecstasy. There is joy by chanting, by reading, by hearing, by worshipping, by contemplating on the pastimes of the Lord as described in the Bhagavatam. There is ecstasy and Narada Muni, he is briefly describing he began meditation and he came to the stage of bhava where he began to experience ecstasy within and there are 8 symptoms of ecstasy that is described again in Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu that the 8 symptoms of ecstasy are perspiring, standing of the hairs on the body, faltering of the voice, trembling of the body, change of bodily colors, shedding of tears. That is described here ashrukh, ashru means tears, ashru colour tears roll down akshuesya of the eyes and tears started rolling down means he is getting daunted, tears started rolling down means he is getting daunted means he has come to the stage of bhava he is experiencing transcendental ecstasy and the last symptom that is described here is devastation. So these are not to be imitated but these are natural, natural reactions because the body cannot contain that extreme joy, spiritual joy which is beyond any material experience. It's a completely different experience and it's a very advanced stage of bhakti. So Naradunni experienced that and that is what is

In this session, we will be discussing from the 17th verse of the 6th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Prema Atibhara Nirbhinna Pulaka Ango Ati Nirvrata Ananda Samplave Leeno Na Apashyam Ubhayam Mune. The meaning of this verse is, O Vyasa Deva, Narada Muni is speaking to Vyasa Deva, describing the experience he underwent in his previous life when he was instructed by the Bhaktivedantas and he went to a secluded place, a sacred spot in the Himalayas and he sat there firmly and began to do meditation. So, we have heard so far how he experienced symptoms of ecstasy. So, what does it mean to ecstasy? One of the symptoms is described in the 16th verse, that tears started rolling down from his eyes. What else happened? That is being described in this verse. O Vyasa Deva, at that time, being exceedingly overpowered by feelings of happiness, every part of my body became separately enlivened. Being absorbed in an ocean of ecstasy, I could not see both myself and the Lord. This is the 17th verse.

**Key Quote:** "Spiritual feelings of happiness and intense ecstasies have no mundane comparison."
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the incomparable nature of spiritual joy and ecstasy, contrasting it with the limitations of material happiness.

I just read the translation of the 17th verse. If you remember, in the 16th verse, Narada Muni had told, he experienced that joy, the ecstasy of having come to the stage of that bhava. Bhava nirjita chetasa and tears began to flow from his eyes, tears of joy, extreme joy and he also had mentioned the Supreme Lord appeared on the lotus of his heart. Krishna, who is seated on the heart, gave him darshan. Gave him darshan. Next, what? He experienced, Narada experienced, that he is overpowered by feelings of happiness, exceedingly overpowered. That means the happiness is so much, there is no comparison to any material experience of happiness at all. It is completely different. This is the first point. Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, Spiritual feelings of happiness and intense ecstasies have no mundane comparison. There is no comparison with anything material that we experience in this world. There is no material comparison. This is entirely a different experience. It is incomparable because, the amount of joy one experiences is actually unlimited.

**Summary:** The speaker outlines the stages of Bhakti, emphasizing the importance of spiritual practice, purification, and giving up misconceptions to progress towards experiencing divine ecstasy.

Though we are very, very tiny and our experience has got limitation, but still, to the extent we can experience as much joy as we really can, it is possible to experience as much joy as we really can. It is possible by spiritual practice of Bhakti, Sadhana Bhakti, through the stages, as I mentioned in the previous session, Shraddha, Sadhu Sangha, Bhajana Kriya, Anartha Nivritti, Nishtha, Ruchi, Asakti, Bhava. In that Bhava stage, the eighth stage, one stage before Prema, one stage before the ultimate perfection. In that Bhava stage, the eighth stage, one stage before Prema, one step before the ultimate perfection. In that stage, one is exceedingly overpowered by feelings of happiness. So, there is no mundane comparison. Therefore, it is very difficult to give expression to such feelings. We can just have a glimpse, as far as we are concerned, we are beginners, how we have got to make progress. It will take time. We have to become serious. We have to apply the principles. We have to follow all the rules, regulations. We have to associate with devotees. We have to give up all misconceptions that we have about ourselves, or God, or the relationship, or about this world. Everything we have to. We have to purify our heart. We have to purify our consciousness.

**Summary:** The lecture explains how the senses become awakened to serve the Lord, focusing on experiencing Krishna's form, fragrance, and other transcendental qualities through the senses.

So, we can get an idea in the words of Narada, as he is describing to Vyasa Deva. In the words of Narada, we can get a brief glimpse of the ecstasy that Narada Muni experienced by reaching that eighth stage. Reaching that eighth stage of progress in the practice of Bhakti. Here, Srila Prabhupada says, Each and every part of the body or senses has its particular function. See, a living person means there are senses. Senses of perception and senses of action. All these ten senses are centered around the mind. And the mind is called the sense within. Mind is the center. So, in the mind and the senses, one is able to experience joy, spiritual joy. And such experience, what does it do? The spiritual joy of ecstasy, bhava. That after seeing the Lord, the senses become fully awakened to render service to the Lord. Every sense has got a certain function. The eyes for seeing the form of the Lord. The ears for hearing about the Lord. The tongue for tasting food offered to the Lord. Offered tasting the tulsi leaves offered in the lotus feet of the Lord. The taste of prasadam or the taste of remnants of yajna shishta. And the nose for smelling the fragrant incense offered to the Lord. And all, all spiritual fragrances. It's not just that. That is the beginning. In the beginning we offer incense to the Lord when we do worship. But there are other kinds of spiritual fragrances. And just like Krishna's transcendental form has got a spiritual fragrance. Every spiritual form has got a unique spiritual fragrance. So when one is able to come face to face with Krishna, one is able to smell, relish that fragrance of Krishna's transcendental form.

#### transcendental form of the Lord, mind's desire, mental incongruities, Narada Muni's experience
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/xoI1iFCIR8g?t=58
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The transcendental form of the Lord, as it is, satisfies the mind's desire and at once erases all mental incongruities."
**Summary:** This segment explains the meaning of the verse, focusing on how the transcendental form of the Lord satisfies the mind and removes mental incongruities, as experienced by Narada Muni.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 18th verse of the 6th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: रूपं भगवतो यत्तन मनकान्तं शुचापहं अपश्यन सहत सोतस्थे वैक्लव्या दुर्मना इवा. The meaning of this verse is: "The transcendental form of the Lord, as it is, satisfies the mind's desire and at once erases all mental incongruities. Upon losing that form, I suddenly got up, being perturbed, as is usual, when one loses that which is desirable." So, Srila Nargumuni is explaining his experience to Vyasa Deva from his previous life. He began meditation. He had a glimpse of the Lord, and he became overjoyed with ecstasy. Suddenly, he lost that form. So then, after losing sight of that form, after getting a brief glimpse of darshan of that form of the Lord in the heart, Nargumuni is describing what was the kind of loss that he really felt when he lost sight of the Lord. The transcendental form of the Lord, as it is, satisfies the mind's desire. The mind is the center of all the senses, and the mind is driving the senses towards sense objects, looking for something. What is that something that each one of us is looking for? It is actually Krishna. Everyone is looking for Krishna, having forgotten Him, and also desiring to get back that which we have lost. The most desirable, the most beautiful, the most wonderful, the dear most, the dearest, we have lost that, so we are looking for that. So therefore, when we actually get darshan of the transcendental form of the Lord, then immediately our mind's desire is completely satisfied. And also, all the mental incongruities are erased, means in the mind we settle for something when we don't get what we are really looking for, and we think maybe this can satisfy me, but then we find something else which may be relatively either better or more beautiful or more pleasing for the mind, again it creates in the mind a kind of complex situation that maybe this is what I was looking for, no no no, this is not what I was looking for. So there are so many mental incongruities essentially established through contact with so many other forms other than the form of the Lord, so all these incongruities in the mind are completely erased when we actually get darshan of the form of the Lord.

#### Narada Muni's experience, form of the Lord, material vs. spiritual form, limitations of material vision, Nirakar
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/xoI1iFCIR8g?t=304
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Nirakar means the Lord does not have a material form."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Narada Muni's experience of seeing the Lord's form, contrasting it with the common understanding of God being formless (Nirakar), and clarifying that Nirakar means the Lord doesn't have a material form, but a transcendental one, which cannot be seen with material eyes.

And that's what Narad Muni is describing here. So he says, "I lost that form which was completely satisfying to my mind, which erased the form of the Lord, which erased all my mental incongruities, that form I lost." And suddenly, on losing the form, all of a sudden I lost that form, then I became very much perturbed in my mind, and that is to be expected because when somebody loses something which is very, very desirable, then how do they feel? That's how I felt. So, Shrila Prabhupada makes a very important point in the purport here that the Lord is not formless, is experienced by Narad Muni. A widely prevalent understanding about God is that God is formless, Nirakar. Nirakar is one of the terms that is used to describe God. It is one of the terms that is used to describe the Lord's features, but we should carefully understand what this Nirakar means. Nirakar means the Lord does not have a material form. He doesn't have a form made of flesh and blood and skin and bones. No, He doesn't have such a form. He has a transcendental form. He has a completely spiritual form. That form cannot be seen with these ordinary eyes. These eyes are suitable only for seeing some material forms. Even material forms which are very big we cannot see. Material forms which are too close to the eye we cannot see. We cannot see even our own eyelids. We can't see something very small. We can't see if there is no light to see a particular object or a form. So, these eyes have got limitations. In any case, even if we overcome all kinds of limitations of this eye by some mechanical means, material means, still, spiritual form can never be seen by any material adjustment even for these eyes. You cannot see spiritual form with material vision, even making adjustments.

#### spiritual endeavor, transcendental form, satisfaction of the mind, mental incongruities, material forms vs. spiritual form

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "One who has once seen that form is not satisfied with anything else."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that Narada Muni saw the transcendental form through spiritual endeavor, highlighting the unique ability of the Lord's form to completely satisfy the mind and erase mental incongruities, unlike any material form.

Not possible. So, here Srila Prabhupada is telling Narada Muni's experience of seeing the form of the Lord, is that Narada Muni is able to see the transcendental form of the Lord by his spiritual endeavor, by his spiritual efforts, not by any material efforts. But his form is completely different from all forms of our material experience. This is an important point. What Narada Muni saw was not just another experience of seeing a material form. It's not that. It is completely different. So, Srila Prabhupada explains, for the whole duration of our life, we go see different forms in the material world, but none of them is just apt to satisfy the mind, nor can any one of them vanish all perturbance of the mind. Two things Prabhupada is mentioning: none of them can satisfy the mind. No material form can satisfy the mind completely. And none of the material forms have got the power to erase all mental incongruities. That's not possible. So, therefore, what is mentioned by Narada Muni in this verse is very important to note. These are the special features of the transcendental form of the Lord. The transcendental form of the Lord is distinctly different from all material forms, and the special features are being mentioned specifically by Narada Muni, that it completely satisfies the mind. Vision of the transcendental form of the Lord completely satisfies the mind, and it erases all mental incongruities. Further, Srila Prabhupada says, one who has once seen that form is not satisfied with anything else. This is a fact. Having seen the transcendental form of the Lord even once, for a brief moment even, then one can never be satisfied with any other form.

**Key Quote:** "As spiritual beings, having eternal relations with that transcendental form of the Lord, we are life after life searching after that form of the Lord."
**Summary:** This segment reiterates the meaning of Nirakar, explains that we are eternally searching for the Lord's spiritual form, and describes Narada Muni's reaction of perturbation upon losing sight of that form.

The Lord is formless or impersonal means that He has nothing like a material form. This is again being stressed, that Nirakar means the Lord does not have a material form. Even descriptions of Lord being impersonal means He doesn't have a material personality. Now, Srila Prabhupada is also explaining in the purport, as spiritual beings having eternal relations with that transcendental form of the Lord, we are life after life searching after that form of the Lord, and we are not satisfied by any other form of material appeasement. See, this is a secret being revealed by Prabhupada based on Narad Muni's statement, that we are always looking, we are searching. But what are we searching? We are searching for the spiritual form of the Supreme Lord. Only that can satisfy our mind. Only that can give us the real joy that we are looking for. Narad Muni got a glimpse of this, but having not seen it again, he became perturbed and stood up all of a sudden to search it out. See, he got a glimpse, and he lost it, so he stood up all of a sudden. He was sitting and doing meditation. He stood up, and he began to search out, where did I lose, how did I lose sight of that beautiful transcendental form of the Lord?

**Key Quote:** "For the soul there is no death, there is no birth."
**Summary:** This segment explains the concept of reincarnation and the continuous search for the transcendental form of the Lord due to spiritual ignorance, emphasizing the struggle for existence in the material world.

What we desire life after life. See, it is not just this life. From the Bhagavad Gita we understand, we are spirit soul. For the soul, for the real you or real I or real person, there is no death, there is no birth. So our real nature is spiritual, but we keep changing bodies. As long as we don't realize our self, we don't realize the Supreme Lord Krishna, and our relationship with Him, as long as we don't realize these three things, we keep taking birth again and again, simply quitting one body, entering another body. What kind of body? Material body. So that is what is being described here. What we desire life after life, if we remain spiritually ignorant, if we are not fortunate enough to come in touch with a pure devotee of Krishna, then we remain in ignorance. We simply are engaged in a hard struggle for existence. We keep searching for that spiritual form, transcendental form of the Supreme Lord, and none of the material forms...

**Key Quote:** "Though the deity is Krishna, the deity is completely spiritual, but unless our eyes are trained, unless we have got spiritual training, unless we have developed the spiritual vision, we cannot see the spiritual form of the deity."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the deity form in the temple, explaining that without proper spiritual training and vision, one may perceive it as merely a material statue, failing to recognize its spiritual essence.

Are like that. Somebody may say that the deity form in the temple is the transcendental form of the Lord. But then when we see the deity form without proper understanding, without proper spiritual training, then we see it as a material statue. We see it as simply a statue made of metal or wood or clay or stone, etc. We don't see it as a spiritual form, though the deity is Krishna. The deity is completely spiritual, but unless our eyes are trained, unless we have got spiritual training, unless we have developed the spiritual vision, we cannot see the spiritual form of the deity through our ordinary vision.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "I desire to see again that transcendental form of the Lord in the heart, but despite my attempts to concentrate upon the heart, with eagerness to view the form again."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Narada Muni's desire to see the Lord again after a brief vision, and his subsequent dissatisfaction when he couldn't.

In this session we will be discussing from the first canto, sixth chapter, nineteenth and twentieth verses of the Srimad Bhagavatam. First the nineteenth verse, DIDRUKSHU STAD AHAM BHUYAH, PRANIDHAYA MANOHRDI, VIKSHAM ANO PINAPASYAM, AVITRUPTA IVATURAHA. The meaning of this verse is, I desire to see again that transcendental form of the Lord, but despite my attempts to concentrate upon the heart with eagerness, to view the form again, I could not see him anymore, and thus, dissatisfied, I was very much aggrieved. So the background for this verse is, in the previous session, we had heard how Narad Muni began to meditate on the form of the Lord in the heart, as he had been taught by the Bhaktivedantas, and using his intelligence to search out for the Lord in the heart, and very quickly he came to the stage of bhava, tears started flowing down from his eyes, and every part of his body he felt separately enlivened. In that state, the Lord gave him darshan within the heart, a brief darshan, but after a brief moment, when he was experiencing that ecstasy of joy of seeing the form of the Lord in the heart, suddenly he lost sight of that form. Then, he again tried to see that form of the Lord. So that is the description here. I desire to see again that transcendental form of the Lord in the heart, but despite my attempts to concentrate upon the heart, with eagerness to view the form again. He is again wanting to see. So he is thinking, let me do the same thing which I did previously. But he could not see the Lord, in spite of very sincere attempts, the same way, exactly the same way, as he had been taught, as he had done already, as he had already seen, he could not again see the form of the Lord, and he was very much dissatisfied and

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "There is no mechanical process to see the Lord, and it completely depends upon the causeless mercy of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that seeing the Lord is not a mechanical process based on karma, but depends entirely on the Lord's causeless mercy, using the analogy of the sun rising.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport that there is no mechanical process to see the Lord, and it completely depends upon the causeless mercy of the Lord. This word causeless means Lord will not give darshan because you are doing something good. Because of some act of yours, as it generally happens in this material world, according to the laws of karma, I do some pious activity, I get some pious result, or I do some sinful activity, then I may get a sinful result. But, the way to see the form of the Lord is no mechanical process, is no material method. We are completely dependent upon the causeless mercy of the Lord in trying to see his form. We cannot demand the Lord to be present before our vision. That I did this, I followed the process, I had taken instructions from the masters, the bhaktivedantas, so I should be able to see. Nobody can say that. And Srila Prabhupada gives an example just as we cannot demand the sun to rise whenever we like. Very good example. The sun rises exactly at the time according to its own schedule. The sun doesn't become subject to somebody else's control, or somebody else's demand. No. Same way, the Supreme Lord will give darshan whenever he wills, whenever he wants to give darshan. One should simply await the opportune moment and go on discharging his prescribed duty in devotional service of the Lord. So, this is the meaning of we should actually depend upon the causeless mercy of the Lord and not on

**Key Quote:** "One is our own sincere efforts according to the scriptural direction, according to the instructions of the bona fide spiritual master, according to the process, authorized process that has to be there. But this alone is not enough."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that while seeing the Lord depends on His mercy, sincere effort and following the authorized process are also necessary, and recounts Narada Muni's failed second attempt.

However, this does not mean that I may do nothing and I simply think that whenever the Lord wants to give me darshan, he will give me. Sometimes when we invite people to the temple, they tell, Jab Bhagwan bulayenge, hum ayenge. Whenever the Lord wants me to come, I'll come. Or whenever he invites me, I'll come. Now, this is not the correct attitude. If we don't take any step at all towards approaching the authorized process, then we'll never be able to see the Lord. We'll never be able to approach the Lord. This is very clear. So, two things. One is our own sincere efforts according to the scriptural direction, according to the instructions of the bona fide spiritual master, according to the process, authorized process that has to be there. But this alone is not enough. The second thing is the Lord's causeless mercy. So that is being described here that we have to await the opportune moment. We simply wait after doing whatever we have to do properly. Narad Muni thought the Lord could be seen again by the same mechanical process that was successful in the first attempt. But in spite of his utmost endeavor, he could not make the second attempt successful.

**Key Quote:** "He can simply be bound up by the tie of unalloyed devotion... It is love that can bind the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that pure, unalloyed devotion is what pleases and binds the Lord, illustrating this with the story of Mother Yashoda trying to tie Krishna.

So, Srila Prabhupada says the Lord is completely independent of all obligations. But one important thing, the most important thing we should know about approaching the Lord or doing the devotional services, he can simply be bound up by the tie of unalloyed devotion. One thing that Krishna really is completely thoroughly pleased when a devotee offers pure devotional service. It is also called devotion unmixed with anything else. Sent person pure devotional service. Only that can actually bind the Lord because he agrees to become bound up. Just like Mother Yashoda, she attempted to tie the Lord her child, whom she thought of as her beloved child when he was becoming little naughty. She wanted to tie him to a grinding mortar with a rope. She was trying and trying and trying and the rope was always falling short by two fingers. That actually Krishna showed to us, it was for demonstrating to us, that he is not bound up simply because you know, of some mother Yashoda catching him and binding and attempting to bind him with some rope. She got all the rope available in her house but she was somehow not able to tie him. And his form appeared only a limited form but we should know the Lord's form is unlimited and also one cannot bind him simply by some attempt of one's own. The Lord should agree to become bound. So after Mother Yashoda tried and tried and she became exhausted, then Krishna just smiled and immediately she was able to tie him. So that is actually to also teach us that he agreed to become bound up by the love of Mother Yashoda. It is not ropes that can bind the Lord. It is love that can bind the Lord. And what kind of love is this? Love out of pure devotion. That is what can

**Key Quote:** "The Lord is not visible or perceivable by our material senses... He may be seen out of his own accord when he gives darshan, when he gives vision to us."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Lord's spiritual form cannot be perceived by material senses, but He can give darshan out of His causeless mercy, though people may misunderstand His form.

So, he cannot be bound up simply by some material attempts. Similarly, the Lord is not visible or perceivable by our material senses. Shastras clearly say material senses are totally incapable of actually perceiving the Lord. Though, when he appears as an incarnation, he gives darshan even though he comes in his spiritual form and these eyes are useless for seeing spiritual form. They are totally incapable of seeing any spiritual form. But still, he gives darshan to even people who have just got this ordinary vision. He gives darshan. That is his causeless mercy. But people mistake him to be another created being of this world. If he appears in a human-like form, as he appears when he appears as Krishna, then they think he is an ordinary covered boy or ordinary prince of this world, as son of Vasudeva. As son of Nanda Maharaj, they think he is just an ordinary covered boy. Or when he appears in the form of a fish or a tortoise or a boar, they think he is another and that creature is another boar or another fish of this world. No! He is completely spiritual and completely transient to everything material. He may be seen out of his own accord when he gives darshan, when he gives vision to us.

**Key Quote:** "Seeing my attempts in that lonely place, the personality of Godhead who is transcendental to all mundane description spoke to me with gravity and pleasing words just to mitigate my grief."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 20th verse, explaining that the Lord spoke to Narada to mitigate his grief, and discusses how the Lord's words are beyond mundane understanding, yet accessible by His mercy.

And then in the 20th verse, it is said, evam yatantam vijane maam aha agochara giram gambhir shrakshanaya vaacha shuchap prashama yan iva Seeing my attempts in that lonely place, the personality of Godhead who is transcendental to all mundane description spoke to me with gravity and pleasing words just to mitigate my grief. Krishna is very kind. Even though he gave a brief darshan to Narada, still to mitigate Narada's grief because Narada was at grief, he was not able to see again. Just to mitigate his grief, the Lord spoke to him. Now, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, in the Vedas it is said, God is beyond the approach of mundane words and intelligence. avam manasa gochara Yet, by his causeless mercy, one can have suitable senses to hear him or to speak to him. By his mercy, at the present moment, we are using our material senses to perceive material objects, but the completely spiritual form of the Lord or the spiritual sound of his transcendental vibration can be heard or can be seen by the Lord's mercy. So, this is the Lord's inconceivable energy. We cannot understand with our mundane logic. The Lord was very pleased with Narada Muni and therefore, the necessary strength was invested in him so that Narada could hear the Lord. It is not, however, possible for others to perceive directly the touch of the Lord during the probationary stage of regulative devotional service. Those who are practicing in the probationary stage of regulative devotional service are said to be in the probationary stage of regulative devotional service.

**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that even Narada Muni, despite his advancement, was not fully purified, and discusses the devotee's feelings of separation and the value of hearing the Lord, ending with a thank you and Hare Krishna.

we are practicing. It is also called sadhana bhakti, the stage of practice. In the stage of practice, we are yet to reach the perfection. Mind you, Narada had reached perfection. But still, he had not yet become fully purified, 100% purified, yet, though he was very sincerely following and had come to a stage of pretty good advancement stage. So, when he heard the pleasing words of the Lord, the feelings of separation were to some extent mitigated. A devotee in love feels always the pangs of separation, and is therefore always enwrapped in transcendental ecstasy. Even hearing the Lord is in no way inferior to seeing the Lord or any other experience. Though, we always desire if there is a person, we want to see him face to face. We want to interact with him the way we interact with any person in this world. Especially, dealings of love between two persons means there is active reciprocation. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

#### purity, material contamination, modes of nature
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/TqNMFlPuMuw?t=54
**Verse References:** BG 10.12-13
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So there is no trace of a tinge of materiality in this person."
**Summary:** The Lord is completely pure and free from material contamination, unlike us who are influenced by the illusory energy, leading to a material conception of self and the world.

In this session we will be discussing from the first canto, 6th chapter, 21st verse of the Srimad Bhagavatam. हन्तास्मिन् जन्मनी भवान् मामाम् द्रष्टुम् इहार्हती अविपक्व कशायाणाम् दुर्दर्शोहं कुयोगिनाम् The meaning of this verse is, O Narada, the Lord is speaking to Narada, I regret that during this lifetime you will not be able to see me anymore. Those who are incomplete in service, and who are not completely free from all material taints, can hardly see me. Now here the Lord is explaining to Narada that Narada is not yet freed from all material taints. That's why one cannot see in spite of all sincerity, sincere attempts and endeavours. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, the personality of Godhead is described in the Bhagavad Gita as the most pure. In the 10th chapter, Param Brahma Param Dhama Pavitram Paramam Bhavan. Pavitram means pure. Paramam Bhavan Paramam Pavitram, Supreme pure, complete pure, 100% pure. And he is described also as the supreme and the absolute truth, Param Brahma. So there is no trace of a tinge of materiality in this person. Unlike our personality, right now, in the material world, there is a contamination of materiality in this person. So that is the categorization of this personality. There is a contamination of the illusory influence of the material energy in our consciousness, and that's why we have a material conception of our self, of everything. Whereas the Lord, even when he comes to this material world, He is 100% pure, completely spiritual. There's no tinge of any materiality in this personality. But he is giving us this materiality, the same materiality that the Lord gave us. Even though he appears like a person who is created being of this world, he appears like that, son of Devaki, or he appears in his incarnation as Matsyavatara, he appears as a fish, but he is not touched by the material energy. It's not a material form, it's not a material creation. He comes in his original transcendental form only, though he appears as required, whichever form he desires to appear, to incarnate, to give darshan to his devotees, to mitigate the problems, the sufferings of his devotees, Paritranaya sadhuna. So, therefore, it is said here, thus, one who has the slightest tinge of material affection cannot approach him. So, this is conversely also explained that the Lord doesn't have any tinge of materiality and those in this material world who have any tinge of material affection cannot approach him. Not possible. The beginning of devotional service starts from the point when one is freed from at least two forms of material modes, namely the modes of passion and ignorance. The result is exhibited by the signs of being freed from karma and lobha. Karma means lust, lobha means greed or covetousness. That is to say, one must be freed from the desires for sense satisfaction and the avarice for sense gratification. Generally material conception of life is I am seeking satisfaction of my senses and I am also desirous or greedy for getting more of sense enjoyment. These two things, kama and lobha, are the symptoms of rajas and tamas.

#### modes of nature, transcendence, spiritual platform
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/TqNMFlPuMuw?t=350
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "We have to rise above tamas guna, rajas guna and sattva guna, and come to the plane of transcendence."
**Summary:** To see the Lord, one must transcend the three modes of material nature (goodness, passion, and ignorance) and reach the spiritual platform.

To be completely freed from all material tinges is to become free from the mode of goodness also. As you know there are three gunas, three modes, rajas, tamas and sattva guna. Don't think sattva guna is something spiritual. No, it is also material. So we have to become completely free from all the three modes. So it is described here by Srila Prabhupada, to search out the audience of God in a lonely forest is considered to be in the mode of goodness. As is explained elsewhere, a liquor shop is in the mode of ignorance, tamas guna. And a city is in the mode of passion, as a place, talking of different places, influence in different places. And a forest is considered to be in the mode of goodness or sattvic place. One can go into the forest to attain spiritual perfection, but that does not mean that one can see the Lord personally there. Just because I go to the forest, and the forest is in the mode of goodness, simply by attempting to do some meditation or some spiritual practice there, we cannot see the Lord, simply like that. One must be completely freed from all material attachment, and be situated on the plane of transcendence. We have to rise above tamas guna, rajas guna and sattva guna, and come to the plane of transcendence, shuddha sattva, purified goodness, or transcendental platform. This alone will help the devotee to get in personal touch with the personality of God. Because the Lord is on the spiritual platform, unless we rise to the spiritual platform and become fixed up, we will not be able to see the Lord.

#### deity worship, temple, bhakti yoga
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/TqNMFlPuMuw?t=503
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "The deity form is completely a spiritual form, though it appears like a material form."
**Summary:** Deity worship in the temple is a transcendental practice, superior to other forms of spiritual practice, especially in Kali Yuga, because the Lord manifests in the deity form out of His causeless mercy.

The best method is that one should live at a place where the transcendental form of the Lord is worshipped. Now here Srila Prabhupada explains the importance of the deity form of the Lord in the temple, or even at one's home. The deity form is completely a spiritual form, though it appears like a material form. After all, the deity is made out of stone, or wood, or metal. But that doesn't mean it is a metallic form, or a clay form, or a stone form. No, it is not. The deity is not a material form. Why? Because the deity is also called Archamurti, or Archavigraha. The Lord is invited after the form of the Lord is prepared, according to Shastra. And then, by the mercy of the bona fide spiritual master, or the Acharya, the Lord agrees to come and reside in that form, and accept the worship, the service, the devotional service, agrees to give darshan to even people who don't have spiritual vision. That is the causeless mercy of the Lord. That's the mercy of the transcendental form of the Lord in his form as the deity. The temple of the Lord is a transcendental place, whereas the forest is a materially good habitation. This difference exists, that a temple of the Lord where the deity form is worshipped regularly is completely a transcendental place. It's not different from Vaikuntha. Whereas the forest is a place which is in the mode of goodness, a sattvic place. So, forest still there is some material influence, but in the temple, it is completely a spiritual place. There is no material influence in the temple, just because of the presence of the archavigraha. Devotional service begins from the process of archana, which is better than going out in the forest, especially for us in Kali Yuga, where we are not equipped to do meditation, where we are not properly equipped or not prepared to properly undergo studies, properly engage in other forms of yoga other than bhakti yoga.

#### bhakti yoga, pure devotee, archana, kirtana
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/TqNMFlPuMuw?t=690

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Simply accept the process of bhakti yoga and don't ever even attempt any other form of yoga. It's not going to be successful."
**Summary:** Bhakti yoga, especially archana (deity worship) and kirtana (glorification), is the recommended path for spiritual progress, and pure devotees like Narada Muni can transform any place into Vaikuntha by their presence.

Therefore, in this presentation, it is recommended, simply accept the process of bhakti yoga and don't ever even attempt any other form of yoga. It's not going to be successful. And Narada Muni, in his present life, he is describing his previous life to Vyasa Deva, if you remember this whole description. But in his present life, he is completely free from all material hankerings, because he is a pure devotee. He does not go into the forest, although he can turn any place into Vaikuntha simply by his presence. Simply by his presence, because a pure devotee carries the Lord in his heart. So wherever he goes, he turns that place into a completely transcendental place. So Narada Muni now, in his present life, he travels from one planet to another, throughout the universe he travels, simply to convert all categories of persons, men, gods, that is demigods, kinaras, gandharvas, rishis, munis, anyone who is willing, he wants to convert them into a devotee of the Supreme Lord. And there are examples by his activities, he has engaged many devotees, like Prahlad Maharaj, Dhruva Maharaj, so many others, in the transcendental service of the Lord. A pure devotee of the Lord, therefore follows in the footsteps of great devotees, like Narada Muni and Prahlad Maharaj, and engages his whole time in glorifying the Lord by the process of kirtana. So archana is the worship of the deity form, and it's always to be accompanied by kirtana, the glorification of the Lord, either by singing his holy, glorification of his holy name, or glorification of his activities or pastimes, like that. Such a preaching process is transcendental to all material qualities. So clearly, Srila Prabhupada is explaining, the advantage we have in the process of archana, kirtana, of course, Bhakti Yoga begins with Shravanam Kirtanam Vishnu, but of all the processes for a neophyte, especially in this age, archana is recommended. Either you directly worship, or if you are unable to worship, then you participate in the worship of the Lord in the temple. That's what you should do. In this way, you can actually very easily progress in Bhakti Yoga and come to the stage of perfection very quickly. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (SB 1.6.22) and explains the context of Lord's words to Narada Muni after he lost sight of the Lord in meditation.

canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Sakradya Darshitam Roopam Etat Kamayate Anagha Matkamas Shanakai Sadhu Sarvan Munchatih Richhayan. The meaning of this verse is, O virtuous one, you have only once seen my person and this is just to increase your desire for me because the more you hanker for me, the more you desire for me, the more you will be freed from all material desires. So the Lord is speaking to Narada Muni. After Narada Muni began meditation, he reached the stage of bhava, ecstasy. And in that stage of ecstasy, he was able to have a brief glimpse of the Lord in the heart. But then after that brief darshan, he lost sight of the Lord and then he tried again to get that darshan, but he could not. And when he was morose, that is when the Lord spoke to him. And the Lord is speaking and explaining something very important for Narada and for all of us

**Key Quote:** "Because till one is completely purified in the heart, one cannot actually see the Lord, the spiritual form of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the reason why the Lord gave only a brief darshan to Narada, emphasizing the importance of purification and increasing the desire to see and associate with the Lord.

to understand. So in the 21st verse is the beginning of the Lord's words, Lord's speaking to Narada from within the heart. O Narada, in the 21st verse, the previous session, we discussed this. I regret that during this lifetime, you will not be able to see me anymore. So just the brief darshan was given. So in this verse, the Lord is telling, you have only once seen my person and just to increase your desire for me, I have done it. Because till one is completely purified in the heart, one cannot actually see the Lord, the spiritual form of the Lord. It's not possible. And why did the Lord give darshan, that brief darshan? Even before Narada was fully purified, it is because to increase the hankering, the desire to see the Lord, to associate with the Lord in person.

**Key Quote:** "A living being cannot be vacant of desires."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada, explaining that spiritual life doesn't mean becoming desireless, but rather purifying or replacing material desires with spiritual desires, focusing on pleasing the Lord instead of the senses.

And that will automatically free Narada from all material desires. So Srila Prabhupada very nicely explains in the purport. He says, A living being cannot be vacant of desires. You would have heard many times, spiritual life means we have to become desireless. Now becoming desireless, we have to understand very carefully. We cannot be completely vacant of all desires. So what does it mean to become desireless in order to advance in spiritual life? It means to become free from all material desires. And that is possible not by just trying to negate all material desires, but rather replace material desires with spiritual desires. Or as Srila Prabhupada explains elsewhere, we have to purify our desires. We have to purify our desires. In our material condition, we are full of material desires. But the same desires can be turned into spiritual desires, when we desire for the Lord. Instead of desiring for ourselves, we desire to please the Lord instead of desiring to please our own senses.

**Key Quote:** "Thinking for the service of the Lord itself is spiritual."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain Prabhupada's teachings, highlighting that living beings must have desires and that entanglement arises from material thinking, feeling, and willing, while devotional service frees one from entanglement by focusing on the Lord's service.

So Srila Prabhupada explains a living being cannot be vacant of desires. He is not a dead stone. What or who is vacant of all desires? It is dead matter. No desire. So living person must have desires. That is symptom of life. So Srila Prabhupada says further, he must be working, thinking, feeling and willing. But when he thinks, feels and wills materially, he becomes entangled. That is our present condition. We are entangled because we are thinking, feeling and willing materially. Conversely, when he thinks, feels and wills for the service of the Lord, he becomes gradually freed from all entanglement. This is the wonderful thing about devotional service, that you start thinking, feeling, willing for the service of the Lord. This is the process of bhakti, process of devotion, devotional service. A positive process. Automatically material thinking, feeling, willing will be replaced or purified when you start thinking, feeling, willing for the service of the Lord. And gradually we are freed from all entanglement. Thinking for the service of the Lord itself is spiritual, and it also frees us from all entanglement. We are free from all entanglement. Thinking for the service of the Lord itself is spiritual. We are free from material entanglement.

**Key Quote:** "The more a person is engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, the more he acquires a hankering for it."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the nature of devotional service, explaining that even a small beginning, like chanting Hare Krishna, can lead to an increased hankering for the Lord and that guidance from experienced devotees is essential.

We are free from material entanglement. The more a person is engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, the more he acquires a hankering for it. This is the nature of devotional service. This is so nice, that you start with a little service. Make a beginning by doing a little service. Just vibrate your tongue and say Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. You begin devotional service and you keep on doing more and more of this chanting and hearing of the holy name of the Supreme Lord, the more you will acquire a hankering for chanting. That is really true. We all begin by chanting once, few times, few minutes, 108 times. Gradually, if we get guidance by experienced devotees, representatives of the spiritual master, representatives of Krishna, then we are advised to start in a small way and increase in the

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "This is spiritual sound this is transcendental it is full of spiritual nector."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts chanting Hare Krishna with repeating a material sound, like 'coca-cola', explaining that the transcendental nature of the holy name prevents boredom and increases the desire to chant.

in the beginning you may not have taste for it like the way pure devotees have taste, but then you increase it and you notice that it is not like a material sound vibration. If I tell you keep saying coca-cola, coca-cola, coca-cola, coca-cola, how many times can you say that? Few times. You cannot keep repeating that material sound again and again and again. It will become hackneyed, it will become boring. But devotees have been chanting Hare Krishna for so long, they chant every day the same mantra so many times, but they never find it is boring. They never experience any boredom. Why? Because this is spiritual sound. This is transcendental. It is full of spiritual nectar. Of course we don't experience the nectar immediately, but certainly we can experience the difference in terms of not feeling the boredom. That itself is a confirmation of the sound being transcendental. The very fact that we can repeatedly chant day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year, and increase, keep increasing the chanting itself is proof that this is spiritual sound and therefore it increases.

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Material service has satiation... Whereas spiritual service of the lord has neither satiation nor end."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of satiation in material activities using the analogy of eating chocolate, contrasting it with the eternal and non-satiating nature of spiritual service to the Lord.

That is the transcendental nature of godly service, devotional service, spiritual service, spiritual activities like that. It is the transcendental nature of such service. Material service has satiation. What is satiation? You have experience that is, eat a small piece of some edible, ordinary edible that you like to eat. Let's say it's a piece of chocolate a child likes. So you give the child a piece of chocolate. So you give the child a piece of chocolate. So you give the child a piece of chocolate. So you give the child a piece, it'll eat and say very nice. You give more, it'll eat that second piece, very nice. Third piece, fourth piece. How much can the child go on eating, eating, eating, eating and experience more and more pleasure and satisfaction? There's a limit. So that limit is reached, that's called satiation. You cannot eat anymore to derive more and more pleasure, or taste, or satisfaction out of eating the sweet. That is the nature of material service, or material activity, or material objects. Whereas spiritual service of the lord has neither satiation nor end. Even the material activity comes to an end with satiation. Even the material activity comes to an end with the body. The body is not permanent. The material body is not permanent. So life in this body is not going to continue forever, no.

**Key Quote:** "Spiritual service is on the spiritual platform therefore it is eternal."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the eternal nature of spiritual service, emphasizing that it continues beyond the material body and that devotional service, like chanting Hare Krishna, has no satiation.

It is going to end when we have to quit the body at the time of death, we do. Leave this body. So spiritual service is not of the nature of material. So spiritual service is not of the nature of material activity or material service because spiritual service continues life after life after life after life. It is on the spiritual platform, therefore it is eternal. It's in the platform of the soul. The soul is eternal, therefore spiritual service is eternal. Material service has satiation, whereas spiritual service of the Lord has neither satiation nor end. What is satiation? Satiation means something material, you cannot repeatedly do that activity to derive more and more pleasure or more and more satisfaction, just like eating a piece of sweet meat or a chocolate. You eat one piece, very nice. You eat a second piece, okay this is also pleasurable. But how much can you keep on eating and deriving more pleasure? There's a limit to that. Everything material is like this. Whereas spiritual service of the Lord has neither satiation nor end. Devotional service, just like we chant Hare Krishna, there is no satiation. We go on chanting more and more and more and more. It does not become boring, it does not become hackneyed. So therefore spiritual service is on the spiritual platform, it is eternal. One can go on increasing his hankerings for the loving transcendental service of the Lord and yet he will not find satiation

**Key Quote:** "Anybody engaged in devotional service is actually seeing the lord through the service because the lord and his devotional service are identical."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by explaining that engaging in devotional service is equivalent to seeing the Lord, as the Lord and His service are identical, and encourages sincere devotees to continue their service for purification and perfection.

or end. This is the nature of a transcendental loving service of the Lord. There is no satiation. There is no end because it is not going to end with satiation. The body. By intense service of the Lord, one can experience the presence of the Lord transcendentally. Therefore, seeing the Lord means being engaged in his service because his service and his person are identical. So we are to understand this point very carefully, that anybody engaged in devotional service is actually seeing the Lord through the service because the Lord and his devotional service are identical. Of course it's difficult to understand in the beginning, but in the words of the acharyas, we have to understand this fact about devotional service. So the sincere devotee should go on with sincere service of the Lord. The Lord will give proper direction as to how and where it has to be done. So Narada had no material desire and simply to increase his intense desire for the Lord, the Lord gave him brief darshan and then said, now continue your devotional service the way you have been doing and then one day you'll reach perfection, you become completely purified, then you'll reach perfection. I'll stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Serving the Absolute Truth means rendering service unto the Absolute Personality of Godhead under the direction of the bona fide spiritual master."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of 'service to the Absolute Truth' according to Prabhupada, emphasizing the importance of serving the Absolute Personality of Godhead (Krishna) under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master.

So this is yet another verse which is spoken by the Supreme Lord, who, unseen but through his transcendental voice, is communicating to Narada. He is telling here, the Lord is telling Narada, "By service of the Absolute Truth." So what does it mean, service of the Absolute Truth? That is explained by Prabhupada in the precepts of the Absolute Truth. Prabhupada, serving the Absolute Truth, means rendering service unto the Absolute Personality of Godhead under the direction of the bona fide spiritual master. So very clear, Prabhupada is explaining what does service of the Absolute Truth mean, Satsevaya. So serving Absolute Truth is three features, having three features: Brahman, Paramahansa, and the Supreme Lord are three features. Brahman, Paramahansa, and the Supreme Lord are three features. As devotees, we are particularly concerned about the Bhagawan feature, the Absolute Personality of Godhead. So therefore, Srila Prabhupada says, serving the Absolute Truth means rendering service to the Absolute Personality of Godhead. Now, how do you render service to the Absolute Personality of Godhead? Under the direction of the bona fide spiritual master, because we do not know, at least as neophyte devotees, we do not know who is God, or we have no way to approach God directly. So we are approaching God through the bona fide spiritual master. We are approaching God through the bona fide spiritual master. The bona fide spiritual master directs the disciple, directs the aspirant, spiritual aspirant, if the spiritual aspirant agrees to follow the spiritual master. So under the direction of the bona fide spiritual master, one has to render service to Krishna, the Absolute Personality of Godhead. Now, the bona fide spiritual master is described by Prabhupada as a transparent via medium between the Lord and the neophyte devotee.

**Key Quote:** "The experience Srila Prabhupada says is direct, when I offer a flower to the Lord I am offering through my spiritual master but it is as good as me does I am directly offering flower to Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the role of the spiritual master as a 'transparent via medium' between the devotee and Krishna, making the experience of devotional service direct and personal.

What's the meaning of this transparent via medium? I am there, Lord is there, in between is the spiritual master. So via medium, and what kind of via medium is the spiritual master between the neophyte devotee and the Lord? He is a transparent via medium. Transparent means it is as if I am directly approaching the Lord, but still we should not forget I am approaching through the spiritual master. So the experience, Srila Prabhupada says, is direct. When I offer a flower to the Lord, I am offering through my spiritual master, but it is as good as me, as I am directly offering flower to Krishna. So by service of the Absolute Truth, even for a few days, adhirgaya api, not for very long time. So this is the special feature of Bhakti Yoga, unlike the other yoga systems which take a very, very, very long time for reaching perfection, achieving the ultimate result or goal takes a very long time. Panthastu Koti Shatavatsara Sampragamyo, see Koti Shatavatsara, hundreds of crores of years, whereas Bhakti Yoga is this lifetime, this lifetime, immediately, as soon as possible. So adhirgaya api, even for a few days, a devotee attains firm and fixed intelligence in me. What is this attaining intelligence in Krishna?

**Summary:** The speaker explains how training from the spiritual master, even for a short period, can lead to firm and fixed intelligence in devotional service to Krishna.

That is explained by Srila Prabhupada, that the neophyte devotee has no ability to directly approach the Lord because he has got imperfect material senses which are useless for receiving the Lord. Therefore, the direction of the spiritual master is essential, and by such direction, one gets trained up in serving the Lord. Even if for some days one gets training from the spiritual master, then such a neophyte devotee gets intelligence in rendering service to the Lord. So when he gets intelligence, that is described as devotee attains firm and fixed intelligence in the Supreme Lord Krishna. That is described here as mati, means intelligence, firm and fixed intelligence is attained by such training by the spiritual master. Even for a few days, the training is potent, it is very, very powerful, it is effective, and very quickly this intelligence becomes fixed in devotional service.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the ultimate goal of devotional service: to become an associate of Krishna in the transcendental world, leaving behind the miseries of the material world.

Consequently, as a result of this, he goes on to become my associate in the transcendental world. See the game of rendering service to the Lord. We all belong to the Lord, we all belong to Krishna. We are all Krishna's. In the fourth chapter of Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says, "You are all mine, you belong to me, you come back to me, you live with me, you engage always in thinking of me." So this closeness of relationship, hmm, closeness of relationship is very, very important to understand. So one goes on to become Krishna's associate in transcendental world, in Krishna's personal abode, not in this material world, no, because it is described this happens after giving up the present deplorable material world, hmm, hitva avadyam imam lokam. This word avadyam, avadyam means deplorable. It is not the perfect place for a devotee, this material world, filled as it is with miseries, hmm. Krishna describes this material world, naapnuvanti mahatmanah. If we don't practice devotional service, then we keep taking repeated birth in this material world and suffer the consequences of birth in the material world, suffering different miseries, whereas by devotional service we have become eligible to go to Krishna's personal abode to become one of his associates.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that even a little training in devotional service is potent and effective, leading to liberation from the cycle of birth and death in the material world, with Krishna personally ensuring the devotee's promotion to His abode.

Hmm, so Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport that even if the neophyte devotee gets trained by the spiritual master how to render service for a few days, it is very, very potent, effective, it is very quickly we are able to perfect our service. This leads ultimately to get free from perpetual inhabitation in the material world. Material existence is such that we have been here for millions and millions of births in ignorance, simply with a desire to enjoy materially, hoping every time to succeed in getting the happiness we are really looking for, which is never available in this world, which is never available in any material activity, but we somehow have some hope, we have false hope, durashaya ye bahirartham anina, in the Bhagavatam elsewhere it is explained, durashaya, it is a hopeless hope, there is no possibility, but still we are cheated by maya, we have some hope which is never to be fulfilled, durashaya. So here Prabhupada says, ultimately we get free from the perpetual inhabitation in the material world, we no longer will have to be in the material world, we have nothing to do with this material existence, and what happens? We are promoted to the transcendental world. Krishna will ensure that we are promoted. Krishna takes personal charge of his devotees. Yogi may transfer himself by the strength of his yogic power, but a devotee, he simply is dependent, and Krishna likes that. Krishna is very pleased when we declare our entire dependence upon him because we belong to him. He is our well-wisher, suhurdam sarva bhutanam, he is our everything. So such supreme lord, it is very good, very nice to depend on him completely, and he takes charge, he will transfer us, he will promote us to his personal abode.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by describing the benefits of being transferred to Krishna's personal abode, emphasizing liberation, purification, and the eternal benefits of even small acts of devotional service, assuring that spiritual advancement is never lost.

And what happens in Krishna's personal abode after we transfer, we are transferred there by Krishna? We become one of the liberated associates of the Lord in his kingdom, liberated associate. So that is very important. Such transfer means automatically there is liberation from material bondage, purification. Purification is 100% complete when we are transferred to the spiritual world by devotional service. We become purified, and only when we are fully purified we can go there, but that happens very fast. We don't have to wait for very long time. Of course, in the beginning we may sometimes feel I am not making any progress, but the fact is that every chanting of Hare Krishna, every small little service done in devotion to Krishna is actually accounted and it is to our permanent credit, it is eternally beneficial, it is never lost, even little bit is never lost. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains this, a little advancement on the path of Krishna consciousness is going to guarantee freedom from, from greatest dangers, from all great dangers. One doesn't have to actually suffer degradation at all, never suffer any degradation, only progressively keep advancing, advancing, and unlike material gain, spiritual advancement is never lost. Materially, whatever I gain now I have to leave behind, but spiritual advancement is never lost. So this is the assurance by the Lord to Narada. I will stop here.

**Key Quote:** "Intelligence engaged in my devotion cannot be thwarted at any time."
**Summary:** The speaker explains verse 24, emphasizing the eternal nature of devotional service and the Lord's mercy, highlighting that devotion is never lost.

First the 24th verse: Matir Mayi Nibaddheyam Na Vipadyeta Karihichit Praja Sarga Nirodhepi Smritischa Mad Anugrahat. The meaning of this verse is: Intelligence engaged in my devotion cannot be thwarted at any time. Even at the time of creation as well as at the time of annihilation, your remembrance will continue by my mercy. The Supreme Lord is speaking to Narada. He is unseen but he is heard. After Narada had a brief glimpse of the Lord in the heart, and he tried to get that darshan once again but he could not, and the Lord spoke to him to pacify Narada. So in this verse, the Lord is speaking to Narada. He is explaining something very important: Intelligence engaged in my devotion cannot be thwarted at any time. So everything in relationship with the Lord is eternal. Nothing is temporary. There is no question of any loss in devotional service.

**Summary:** Referencing Srila Prabhupada's purport, the speaker contrasts material and spiritual realities, emphasizing the permanence of devotional service compared to the transient nature of material achievements.

So Shri Lakshmi... Sri La Prabhupada explains in the purport: devotional service rendered to the personality of Godhead never goes in vain, since the personality of Godhead is eternal, intelligence supplied in his service or anything done in his relation is also permanent. We have experienced materially whatever we may do, it is not going to last forever, it is subject to annihilation by time. Everything material is like that. In fact, the whole creation itself is completely annihilated at the end of Brahma's life. So everything material is subject to destruction by time, everything spiritual is permanent, eternal, never subject to any loss or deterioration by time. This is very important principle we have to remember, we have to understand, and we have to apply. So how should we be spending our time? We should be very careful to spend our time exclusively in devotional activities and devotional service.

**Key Quote:** "Anything done in devotional service bears permanent result, bears permanent result it's never lost and one continues end devotional advancement in the next life from where he left off in his previous life."
**Summary:** The speaker addresses Arjuna's question about incomplete devotional service, explaining that even unfinished devotional efforts accumulate and continue in the next life, unlike material gains.

In the Bhagavad Gita it is said that such transcendental service rendered unto the personality of Godhead accumulates birth after birth. See, it's not lost. We may make some progress by doing devotional service in this life, even if we don't complete, there is no loss. Arjuna asked this question in the sixth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. Arjuna asked what happens if somebody takes to devotional service but does not complete? Isn't he a loser both spiritually and materially? Because for taking up devotional service one sacrifices material enjoyment, material engagements, so he loses materially as well as spiritually because spiritually he is not successful. So does it mean whatever devotional activity says performed is completely a wasted, a waste of time? No, Krishna says no, anything done in devotional service bears permanent result, bears permanent result, it's never lost and one continues end devotional advancement in the next life from where he left off in his previous life. This is very important. Supposing you have earned a lot of wealth, do you carry any credit for that wealth earned in this life? If you are unable to exhaust that wealth or spend it off, you have a huge bank balance, so when you quit the body what happens to that bank balance? It doesn't go with you.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the eternal nature of devotional credit, emphasizing its connection to the soul rather than the temporary body, and how it accumulates until maturity.

You don't get any credit in your next life, you have to begin again. So unlike material gain in this life which is never carried forward to the next life or to the future, spiritual advancement is always eternally carried forward, it is never lost. So therefore when the devotee is fully matured, the total service counted together makes him eligible to enter into the association of the personality of Godhead. So even if we make some progress that progress is permanently to the credit of the devotee. Devotional service is associated with the soul not with the body. So body is replaced, body is changed, but the soul is eternal, the person as spirit soul is eternal, his devotional credit is eternal, his devotional credit is eternal, his devotional credit is also eternal. Such accumulation of God's service is never vanquished but increases

The meaning of this verse is: Then that supreme authority personified by sound and unseen by eyes but most wonderful stopped speaking, feeling a sense of gratitude I offered my obeisances unto him bowing my head. So Narada has heard the Supreme Lord speak and and in his own words he is describing it was a most wonderful speech that he heard and he is describing here that it was a supreme authority, the Supreme Lord is a supreme authority personified by sound, he could clearly hear the Lord speaking but he could not see the Lord, unseen by eyes.

**Summary:** Referencing Srila Prabhupada's purport, the speaker explains the absolute nature of the Lord, emphasizing that His name, form, qualities, and instructions are identical to Him, unlike material sounds and objects.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport that the personality of Godhead was not seen but only heard does not make any difference in spiritual life. We learn about the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord, the personality of Godhead. What is the meaning of absolute nature? The Lord, the person personality of the Lord, his name, his form, his qualities, his speech, his instructions, his abode, his paraphernalia, everything is identical with him 100%. That means the Lord is fully present in his name. If I say Krishna in these two syllables, the Lord is fully present as transcendental sound. We are able to hear that sound Hare Krishna or Krishna, the name Krishna, but in that sound he is fully present, unlike a material sound where we say this is a table, the sound table reference the the company of prереquited in the kristini end and also the school of Godhead and refers to another object called the table. The sound table and object table are two distinct different entities. We make the association by saying this is called a table. That is not the case with the Lord's name or the Lord's instructions or the Lord's form or the Lord's qualities or his activities descriptions of his features all are identical with him.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how the Vedas originated from the Lord's breathing and how they are non-different from Him, emphasizing the importance of hearing the Vedas from a qualified teacher.

So it is explained here by Srila Prabhupada further, the personality of Godhead produced the four Vedas by his breathing. This is what the Vedas say. How did he give the Vedas in the beginning of the book of the creation? He produced the Vedas, the four Vedas, the original Vedic knowledge by his breathing. And He is seen and realized through the transcendental sound of the Vedas. The Vedas are again non-different from him because Vedas are describing the absolute personality of Godhead. Therefore he is seen and realized through the transcendental sound of the Vedas. Formerly there was no need of any written books, simply the teacher would recite the Vedas, the student would hear the recitation by the master, by the teacher and simply by hearing the edict of the master, by the teacher, by hearing the student's studying of the Vedas etc. This incident be a study of阿 aquí remedy especially in School by the Master by the teacher by the Teacher simply by hearing the student to learn the recitation by the Master by the teacherer fully as the teacher did not hear the recitation from the various references짱 with full attention the student would realize the subject matter completely.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the power of hearing Srimad Bhagavatam and Bhagavad Gita, explaining that they are literary and sound incarnations of Krishna, respectively, and that understanding them through a bona fide spiritual master leads to realization.

So this is the method. Even Srimad Bhagavatam recommends that you simply hear the Bhagavatam and you can realize Krishna because Bhagavatam is non different from Krishna. Bhagavatam is the incarnation, the literary incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna. So simply by hearing Bhagavatam you can realize Krishna and that's how Parikshit Maharaj realized, that's how Shukadeva Goswami realized, he simply heard the Bhagavatam from his father Vyasadeva. Vyasadeva heard from Narada the Bhagavatam and realized the subject matter, realized subject matter of Krishna. Vyasadeva heard from Narada, Narada heard from Brahma, Brahma heard from Krishna himself. So it is explained here the Bhagavad Gita is the sound representation of the Lord and there is no difference in identity. Bhagavad Gita is personally spoken by Krishna to Arjuna and through Arjuna to all of us, to everyone, everyone in the whole world. So when Krishna spoke whatever words came out of Krishna's lotus mouth that is identical with Krishna himself. So even today we can hear the Bhagavad Gita, we can recite the Bhagavad Gita, we can study the Bhagavad Gita, we can understand the message of the Gita when it is explained by a spiritual master bona fide spiritual master in parampara in this way.

a Bhagavad Gita is non different from Krishna. So the conclusion is that the Lord can be seen and heard by person chanting of the transcendental sound, the transcendental sound of the Bhagavad Gita when Krishna spoke the lotus mouth sound could be the sound of Bhagavatam, the sound of the Hare Krishna mantra, the sound of Krishna's instructions, anything. So transcendental sound we simply have to chant and in this way by hearing repeatedly, persistently with full attention, offenselessly we can fully realize Krishna. I'll stop here thank you.

So Narada Muni is going to conclude his description about his previous life. This is the last verse about his previous life. What happened? As he was engaged in traveling throughout the earth, chanting and glorifying the Lord without any material formalities, he, in course of time, when he had become fully absorbed in thinking of Krishna and in such a state of consciousness, he did not think of Krishna. So he was not fully absorbed in thinking of Krishna. He had become completely free from all material attachments, no attachment to anything in this material world. It is important to note this, that even if a devotee has a tinge of material attachment, he has to take birth again after quitting this body in the material world, whereas that devotee who is completely free from all attachments, and how is that possible?

Supreme Lord, being completely freed from all material taints. Completely free from all material taints, as one goes on chanting and hearing, the heart becomes cleansed and no further contamination can enter because such a devotee is always engaged thinking of Krishna, always engaged in hearing about Krishna, always engaged in chanting the holy name, fame, qualities, past times of Krishna, etc. So no further contamination and all past contamination is completely cleansed away. Then, in course of time, he met with death. What is that death? Quitting the present body. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, the soul doesn't die, the real person, the spiritual identity is not lost at the time of death. It is only the material body that one quits. So met with death as lightning, in the lightening and illumination occurs simultaneously. Now what is the significance of Narada Muni telling he met with death as lightning and

**Summary:** The speaker explains Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing that a devotee absorbed in Krishna has no hankerings for petty material things, which are temporary and without permanent value.

illumination occurs simultaneously is explained by Prabhupada in the purport. So let us go through the purport. To be fully absorbed in the thought of Krishna means clearance of material dirts or hankerings. Such cleansing away of material dirt is not possible for somebody who is engaged in material activities. Material activity means actions and reactions under the influence of the three gunas. So material activity means, what is the material activity? It means one becomes further entangled more and more in the material existence. Whereas cleansing away the material dirt by being absorbed fully in thought of Krishna means no more material entanglement, no more material contamination. And Srila Prabhupada gives a nice example here: As a very rich man has no hankerings for small petty things, so also a devotee of Lord Krishna who is guaranteed to pass on to the kingdom of God where life is eternal, fully cognizant and blissful, Satchitananda, naturally has no hankerings for petty material things which are like dolls or shadows of the reality and are without permanent value. Srila Prabhupada is nicely summarizing. What is this material existence consisting of? Petty material things and these material things have no permanent value. Nothing material has permanent value. We discussed this in a

previous session. So this being reinforced, this understanding for our benefit, because we have got a background of having developed value for so many different material objects or material things. But now in spiritual life, we should understand none of those material things are of any permanent value. They are compared to material things, compared to shadows of reality. That means the real shadow means there is a real object of which the shadow is nothing but a reflection. So the real object is valuable. The shadow is not. Similarly, anything material is nothing but a shadow or a reflection of the spiritual reality. So if we have a material body, it is a reflection or a shadow of our spiritual form, spiritual body. That spiritual body is covered by material coverings. Similarly, the entire material world itself, not only our own form but even the material world itself, is nothing but a reflection or a shadow of the spiritual world. Krishna's personal abode, Parastasmatubhavonyo vyakto vyaktatsanatanah, that eternal abode of the Supreme Lord. It is called the kingdom of God where life is eternal, fully cognizant and blissful. There are no miseries. There is no ignorance. There is no temporary life. There is only eternal life. There is full cognizance, full knowledge. Full knowledge. There is no ignorance at all.

of God is of permanent value, is eternal. So that is where we belong. That should be our destination. So Srila Prabhupada says that is the sign of spiritually enriched persons. Spiritually enriched persons. That's how they lose all attraction for everything material. That's how they lose value for anything material. And in due course of time when a pure devotee is completely prepared. What is the complete preparation? Full absorption in thought of Krishna. Complete preparation of the self. Completely purified of all material taints and completely freed from all material hankerings. No more material contamination. No more material attachments. Completely freed. Then all of a sudden the change of body occurs which is commonly called, the change of the body occurs which is commonly called death. For a devotee, death is a sudden change of body. What is this change of body? This change of body for a devotee is that it takes place exactly like lightning and illumination follow simultaneously. In this, when there are rains, you can see there is a flash of lightning. It is simultaneously occurring with the sound of the thunder.

**Key Quote:** "A pure devotee's body, material body, so called material body, is not material at all. It is spiritualized because he completely engages his body, his mind, his words, everything in Krishna's pure devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that a pure devotee's body becomes spiritualized through devotional service, like an iron rod in fire, and upon death, they attain a fully spiritual body and return to Godhead.

Both happen simultaneously. The material body, generally when we quit this material body, we enter another material body. For those who are not fully purified by devotional service, they will enter another material body. But those who are completely purified and are fully ready to go to the kingdom of God, to go back to Godhead, for them simultaneously the material body, the devotee quits the material body and simultaneously develops a fully spiritual body by the will of the Supreme. This happens by the will of the Lord. Actually, it is described here, even before death for a pure devotee, there is no material affection. Why? Because a pure devotee's body being completely engaged in pure devotional service becomes spiritualized. A pure devotee's body, material body, so called material body, is not material at all. It is spiritualized because he completely engages his body, his mind, his words, everything in Krishna's pure devotional service. Exactly like an iron rod when placed in fire becomes completely red hot and acts like fire. This is the best example. Easily we can understand. Iron rod placed in blazing fire becomes completely red hot, then it acts like fire. Similarly, a pure devotee's material body, which we see ordinarily with our eyes as a material body, actually is not anymore material because he is fully engaged in pure devotional service. It becomes completely spiritualized. And when he quits that body, then fully spiritual body, in that fully spiritual body, which he develops instantaneously, he goes back to Godhead. He does not take birth again in this world. So I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the transcendental body awarded to Narad Muni and the cessation of karma for perfected devotees.

body is it, it is described in this verse, befitting and associate of the Personality of Godhead. So everywhere in the scriptures it is said that we are the same quality as Krishna, as a Supreme Personality of Godhead. Krishna has a completely transcendental form, even we in our original position, we have a completely spiritual form. And Narad Muni, he is ready for going back to Godhead, so he is awarded a transcendental body, befitting and associate of the Supreme Personality of God. And then what happened to the other body? He says, "I quit the earlier body. I quit the body made of five material elements." Of course, everybody quits such a body, but then the advantage is for Narad Muni, does all acquired fruiting results of work or karma stopped? No more karma, no more reactions. So that is the wonderful achievement of a devotee who has perfected his devotional service.

**Key Quote:** "By devotional service the spiritual body develops exactly as we go on performing pure devotional service we go on purifying our material contamination that spiritual body develops"
**Summary:** This segment explains that our spiritual form is currently undeveloped and how devotional service, guided by the spiritual master and Krishna's mercy, helps it develop.

In the purport, Shrila Prabhupada says, "Informed by the Personality of Godhead that he would be awarded a transcendental body befitting the Lord's Association." Narada got his spiritual body as soon as he quit his material body immediately. Actually, our original form is not real itself butday's body as it is said also in the bible as soon as he quit this material body immediately actually our original form is a spiritual form. What is the meaning of being awarded? It means that our spiritual form is in a undeveloped state, that is our real identity, अहम ब्रह्मास्मी, I am spirit soul. Spirit soul means spiritual form, but it is undeveloped in our present condition because we are covered by a material body due to our desire to enjoy materially. So that spiritual form is undeveloped. By spiritual practice, by devotional service, the spiritual body develops exactly as we go on performing pure devotional service. We go on purifying our material contamination, that spiritual body develops. We are awakened to spiritual reality as we go on doing pure devotional service and proportion in proportion to our awakening, we are engaged more and more and more in pure devotional service. This is only by the mercy of the spiritual master and Krishna, guru krishna, by their mercy only it's possible.

**Summary:** This segment describes the freedom from material attraction and sense disturbances that comes with a transcendental body, contrasting it with the challenges of sense control in the material world.

and time of death for a devotee, there is no fear, there is no uncertainty, there is no anxiety, there are no reactions because the devotee is guaranteed to change his body from material body to spiritual form. Now proper further explains this transit body is free from material affinity, it has got no material attraction. Just like in this body you always feel some material attraction for material sense objects, the senses, body mean senses. So these material senses are always attracted to some material sense object, eyes are looking for beautiful form, but it is very Klarboar instrument as well. This Transient ward secure character is beautiful form, ears are searching for melodious music or some words of praise, honor, nose is looking for nice fragrance or nice aromas like that, but a transcendental body is free from material affinity, no material attraction, no material attraction at all. So all the senses of the transcendental form are not disturbed, are never attracted to anything material, total freedom from all material attractions. That is the biggest problem in this material world for those who want to control their senses that senses don't easily come under the

**Key Quote:** "A transcendental body is eternal means there is no material deterioration there is no material destruction and freedom from material modes"
**Summary:** This segment contrasts the temporary and changing nature of the material body with the eternal and unchanging nature of the transcendental body, also discussing the influence of the three gunas and how devotional service can lead to freedom from them.

to avoid sense gratification is very difficult because very naturally it seems like the senses are always attracted to the sense objects, but when we get a transcendental body it is no longer so. And it is further said here, this transcendental body is invested with three primary transcendental qualities. There are three primary transcendental quality, what are they? Eternity, that means this form is an eternal form, unlike this material form which is never eternal, it is therefore a fixed duration, that's all. And even during that limited duration of time this body undergoes changes, देहिनो ऽस्मिन् यथा देहे कौमारं यौवनं जरा, it goes through stages of change through changes through changes. it goes through stages of change. and youth and old age and old age is a fundamental misery that we have to suffer invalidity due to old age. So a transcendental body is eternal means there is no material deterioration, there is no material destruction and freedom from material modes. Not only is this body temporary what we have, but it is also influenced by the gunas, raja guna, sattva guna, tamo guna, the three influences will always be there. Sometimes sattva guna dominates, sometimes raja guna dominates, sometimes tamo guna dominates, accordingly our behavior also changes. So this is material existence, it's horrible, we don't have the freedom to act properly when we are under the influence of the three gunas, but my devotional service we can rise above the gunas gradually as we go on doing devotional service and devotional service leads to our freedom completely from the three gunas.

**Key Quote:** "A devotee's body becomes at once surcharged with transcendental qualities as soon as he is engaged in the devotional service of the lord this is a wonderful thing about devotional service pure devotional service as soon as we engage we become surcharged with transcendental qualities"
**Summary:** This segment discusses freedom from the three modes and reactions of fruitive activities in a transcendental body, emphasizing that engaging in devotional service immediately imbues the devotee's body with transcendental qualities.

material mode, we come to the spiritual platform, being freed from all the three modes, three modes means the influence of the three modes, and the third characteristic of the transcendental bodies, freedom from reactions of fruitive activities, always this body is a store of previous fruitive activities, their reactions. These reactions keep on unfolding as Kala acts on this body, by the action of time, the reactions are unfolding, sometimes good, sometimes not so good. So both happiness and distress, Dvandva, Sukha Dukha, this we have to experience, but a transcendental body, has no reactions at all, no reactions, such a wonderful state of existence. This is what Krishna is inviting us, come back to me means, come back to the spiritual life of eternity, bliss and knowledge. The material body is always afflicted with a lack of these three qualities, material body is not eternal, material body is not free from material influence of the gunas, material body is not free from reactions, always these three things are there. A devotee's body becomes at once surcharged with transcendental qualities as soon as he is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. This is a wonderful thing about devotional service, pure devotional service, as soon as we engage we become surcharged with transcendental qualities.

**Key Quote:** "The effect on this material body is that the material body will not be an obstacle for our krishna consciousness"
**Summary:** This segment uses the analogy of a touchstone and iron to illustrate how devotional service immediately influences the material body, removing obstacles to Krishna consciousness, and cites examples of devotees who saw the Lord face-to-face.

immediately, immediately you don't have to wait for some advancement in Krishna consciousness, you don't have to wait, immediately the body becomes surcharged with transcendental qualities. That's how we are able to do devotional service and Prabhupada gives an example here, it acts like the magnetic influence of a touchstone upon iron. When there is iron a magnetic stone or a magnet it will immediately influence that magnetic influence on iron will always be there in the presence of a touchstone or a magnetic stone. Similarly when we do devotional service the effect on this material body is that the material body will not be an obstacle for our Krishna consciousness. That's why devotional service is described ahaituki apratihata, this is the nature of pure devotional service. Therefore change of body means stoppage of the reaction of the three qualitative modes of material body nature upon the pure devotee, no more influence. And there are many instances of this in the revealed scripture, Druva Maharaj and Pralad Maharaj and many other devotees were able to see the Personality of God face to face apparently in the same body. This means how could they see with these eyes? We cannot see it spiritual form transcendental form, how were they able to see? This means that the quality of a devotee's body changes from material to spiritual as soon as he engages in devotional service changes. So only the devotees free from influence of the reactions influence of the three gunas because of the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord upon the devotee. I'll stop here, thank you very much, Hare Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Narada is not forced to take birth like us we are forced to take birth by laws of karma only because we have got residual reactions from the previous life or previous lives therefore we take birth and we are forced to take birth by the laws of karma"
**Summary:** The speaker explains Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing the transcendental nature of Narada's birth and comparing it to the birth of Krishna, highlighting that pure devotees are not subject to karmic laws in the same way as ordinary beings.

So this is a description of what happened to Narada after he quit his material body at the time of death in his previous life. And then he was awarded a transcendental body. But still, at the end of the millennium, Prabhupada explains in purport what is the meaning of end of the millennium. So Prabhupada says in the purport, Narada is known as the son of Brahma in this present life, and Lord Krishna is known as son of Vasudeva, the personality of Godhead. And his liberated devotees appear in the material world by the same process. That means a devotee taking birth in this material world, a pure devotee is taking birth in a material world is not like ordinary persons taking birth, just like the Supreme Lord's birth and activities are completely transcendental, Janma Karma Chame Divyam Evam Yo Vetthi Tatvatah. Same way, even pure devotees appearance and activities in this material world are completely transcendental. The process is the same as it is said in the Bhagavad Gita, Janma Karma Chame Divyam. That same thing Prabhupada is telling, the birth and activities of the Lord are all transcendental, completely spiritual. Therefore, according to authorized opinion, the birth of Narada as the son of Brahma is also a transcendental pastime. What does it mean? Narada is not forced to take birth like us. We are forced to take birth by laws of karma only because we have got residual reactions from the previous life or previous lives. Therefore, we take birth and we are forced to take birth by the laws of karma only because we have got these personal tendencies, but when a child is given food he is forced to take birth in a material body. Narada or the Supreme Lord, they also apparently take birth, but they appear in spiritual form. They don't accept a material body. So it is said the birth of Narada the son of Brahma in the present life is actually a transcendental pastime, just like the Lord appears for the sake of pastime. Narada absolutely doesn't need birth of a prábh 환 hanno and shouldn't, but it is said between Narada also appears for the sake of

transcendental pastimes. His, that means Narada's appearance and disappearance are practically on the same level as that of the Lord. There is no difference. The Lord and his devotees are therefore simultaneously one and different as spiritual entities. Spiritual entities, both are spiritual entities. But that doesn't mean that pure devotee is God. No. God is God, pure devotee is pure devotee. But they are in the same category. They are having similar qualities. They are completely spiritual beings. They belong to the same category of transcendence. They have nothing to do with any material energy, material body, material existence. Nothing. So even though they seem to take birth in this material world, they are completely aloof from everything material. How is that possible? Mam chayo avyabhicharena bhakti yogena sevate sagunan samatit ketan brahma bhuyaya kalpate. They are always on the transcendental platform, above the three gunas, Gunatita, Gunatita. So Lord is always gunatita, and his pure devotees who are engaged always in his pure devotional service are also gunatita. But they may appear like they are also conditioned in this material world. They may appear like that, but they are not. So this difference we always have to remember.

All these are transcendental appearance of the Lord. Similarly, transcendental appearance of Narada as the son of Brahma. Pure devotee. 30th verse: Sahasra yuga pariyante utha yedam sisrikshata ha mariichi misra rishayaha pranebhyoham ca jagnire.

**Key Quote:** "When Brahma's days over, at the beginning of Brahma's night, there is a partial devastation of the universe."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the process of partial devastation at the end of Brahma's day, the entering of living entities into Garbhodakshayi Vishnu, and the subsequent re-creation by Brahma, including the appearance of Narada and other rishis.

and I also appeared along with them. When Brahma's day is over, at the beginning of Brahma's night, there is a partial devastation of the universe. The middle and the lower planetary systems are completely flooded and all the living entities enter the body of Garbhodaka Shaiv, Vishnu. The Vishnu who is lying on the Garbha ocean. This universe is like a shell half filled with water. That water is called garbha ocean. So everyone enters Garbhodaka Shaiv Vishnu, transcendental body and they remain there for the night of Brahma. How long does this night of Brahma last? The same duration as the day of Brahma. Day of Brahma the calculation is given in the Bhagavad-Gita sahasra yuga pariyanta mahar yad brahmano viduhu. Brahma's day, 1000 cycle of the four yugas on this earth, that's a duration of Brahma's day that works out to four billion three hundred million solar years account our calculation on the earth. So same duration is the night. So for the night Brahma and the residents of Brahmaloka and even Narada they entered the body of Garbhodakshayi Vishnu when the devastation happened in the previous day of Brahma and the night they remain there as if asleep, as if asleep. But when Brahma wakes up to create again by the will of the Lord, when the night is over the next day begins, then all the rishis like Marichi Angira Atri they are created by the transcendent from the transcendental body of the Lord, that means they also awaken and Narada also awakens, he also appears along with them

**Summary:** The speaker continues explaining Brahma's day and night, emphasizing the concept of 'yoga nidra' and differentiating it from ordinary sleep, highlighting Brahma's continued spiritual awareness.

as if he has taken birth the son of Brahma he appears along with them. So Prabhupada explains in the Evanpa, the duration of a day in the life of Brahma is 4 billion 320 million solar years. This is also stated in the Bhagavad Gita sahasra yuga pariyuntham at one. So for this period Brahma highercher rests in yoga Nidra within the body of Garbhodakshayi Vishnu the generator of Brahma. Sometime earlier it was described in the Bhagavad Gita itself in the third chapter of the first Kanto that Brahma appears, the Lotus which is generated on the navel of Vishnu Garbhodakshayi Vishnu, that's why the Garbhodakshayi Vishnu is also called Padmanabha. One Padma, one Lotus appears from his navel on that Lotus Brahma is born from Garbhodakshayi Vishnu. So Brahma when the end of his day happens he rests in yoga nidra. Yoga nidra is not like our sleeping. Our sleeping is total ignorance, we go into ignorance, but Brahma's resting is just not in ignorance but it is in spiritual awareness, that's called yoga nidra, spiritual awareness is there. After the sleeping period of Brahma when there is again creation of Brahma then there is again creation of Brahma then there is again creation by the will of the Lord

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Lord engages Brahma and other personalities in creation, maintenance, and destruction due to their desires, and reiterates the concept of yoga nidra.

by the will of the Lord through the agency of Brahma all the great Rishis through the agency of Brahma all the great Rishis again appeared from different parts of the and again appeared from different parts of the transcendental body and not also transcendental body and not also appears. This is the pastime of the Lord creation appears. This is the pastime of the Lord creation maintenance and destruction of I have seen in digestions of Sah dé H God as the Lord is improving employment by教ensen education of 401 by I haveordnung D are taking help or being assisted by taking help or being assisted by the when you takeВ stance you product to become Transcendental Body as well, then it like the Lord is implementing or taking help or being assisted by the will of the Lord Stini lily básnhie laya is always in your life dia nuit workshop dny lily lee hi shi by Brahma and the other devatas and the rishis but actually the Lord is independent. He just wants to engage all of these other personalities because they have a desire, they have a desire the Lord over material nature of course they are pious beings so they assist the Lord in creation maintenance and destruction. This means that Narada appears in the same transcendental body as a man awakes from sleep in the same body. Just like we have experienced night we go to sleep next day morning we get up we get up in the same body but in our case something else happens at night when we go to sleep we forget this body whereas Brahma goes into yoga nidra he does not forget his original

**Key Quote:** "Narada appears in the same transcendental body because Narada was awarded a transcendental body when he became perfect in devotional service he was awarded and he quit that previous body made of the five elements pancha bhautikam then he was awarded a transcendental body"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Brahma's yoga nidra with ordinary sleep, emphasizing that Brahma retains his form, and explains that Narada appears in the same transcendental body he was awarded after perfecting devotional service.

body, form as Brahma he doesn't forget that form so he is going to sleep is not same as our going to sleep therefore yoga nidra the word the prefix yoga is used for nidra whereas in our case even though we forget this body when we awaken in the morning we again awake we are awakened in the same body that we slept in the previous night. Same way Brahma also appears in the same body as he slept in the previous night. Narada appears in the same transcendental body because Narada was awarded a transcendental body when he became perfect in devotional service he was awarded and he quit that previous body made of the five elements pancha bhautikam then he was awarded a transcendental body in that transcendental body again he awakens next day of Brahma and Narada is eternally free to move in all parts of the transcendental and material creations of the Almighty. That is a nature of transcendental form spiritual form eternal form he is free to move anywhere just by his will like he is in let's say heavenly heaven planet swargaloka he decides I want to go to the earth planet he just wills and he's in the earth planet he travels like that. So this transcendental body is difficult for us to conceive difficult to understand we had to hear about that from the authentic source. So Narada Muni appears and disappears in his own transcendental body which is without distinction of body and soul unlike

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Since then, by the grace of the Almighty Vishnu, I travel everywhere without restriction, both in the transcendental world and in the three divisions of the material world."
**Summary:** This segment introduces Narada Muni's ability to travel freely due to his unbroken devotional service and transcendental body, as described in Srimad Bhagavatam.

In this session we will be discussing from the 31st verse of the 6th chapter of the 1st canto of Sriman Bhagavatam: अन्तर बहिष्च लोकाम स्त्रीन परियेमी असकंधित व्रतः अनुग्रहान महा विष्णोर अविघात गति क्वचित. The meaning of this verse is: Since then, by the grace of the Almighty Vishnu, I travel everywhere without restriction, both in the transcendental world and in the three divisions of the material world. This is because I am fixed in unbroken devotional service of the Lord. So this verse pertains to Narad Muni's describing to Vyasa Deva about his present life. As was explained in the previous verse, after the night of Brahma, next day when the creation began, Narad Muni appeared as a son of Brahma, but he appeared in the same transcendental body. He changed from his material body to a transcendental body when he quit his body in his previous life. After that, once he is in a transcendental body, there is no more change of body. So, just along with Brahma, he entered into Garbhodakshayi Vishnu's transcendental form. And during the night of Brahma, he remained there and he came out appearing as the son of Brahma. But this appearance is complete, just like Krishna appears as the son of Vasudeva and Devaki, like that. So, after that appearance, he is describing here, since then, by the grace of the Almighty Vishnu, Narad Muni is the pure devotee of the Supreme Lord. So, by the grace of the Supreme Lord, Almighty Vishnu, I travel, that means Narad Muni travels everywhere without restriction. Which all places does he travel? Both in the transcendental world and in the three divisions of the material world. So, that would be explained by Prabhupada in the purport. He travels everywhere, both in the spiritual world and all the divisions of the material world. Why? How is this possible? This is because I am fixed in unbroken devotional service to the Lord. How is it possible? Because Narad Muni is fixed up completely in unbroken devotional service of the Lord. That is described in the Sanskrit as Unbroken vow. Unbroken vow of devotional service.

This entire material universe, there are three divisions: Urdhva Loka, the upper planetary systems; Madhya Loka, the middle planetary systems. We are in the middle planetary system on the earth planet. And downward, below the earth, that is Adho Loka. Now, beyond the Urdhva Loka, beyond the upper planetary systems of which the Brahma Loka is the topmost in this universe, there are the material coverings of the universe. This whole universe is like a shell, Brahma Anda. It's called Brahma Anda, egg-shaped, Anda, therefore. And outside this shell, there are seven layers of coverings. And above this universe with its coverings, outside that, is the spiritual sky. And the spiritual sky is described as unlimited in expansion. Material sky is limited within the universal shell, whereas the spiritual sky is spread throughout, unlimited expansion, and contains unlimited self-illuminated Vaikuntha planets. Now, Vaikuntha planets are spiritual planets, unlike the material planets within the material universe. And these Vaikuntha planets are inhabited by God himself, along with his associates, who are all eternally liberated living entities. There are living entities in this material world. There are living entities in the spiritual world.

**Key Quote:** "Such a travelling devotee is called Parivrajaka Acharya."
**Summary:** This segment contrasts conditioned souls in the material world with liberated souls in the spiritual world, highlighting Narada Muni's role as a Parivrajaka Acharya who travels to preach Krishna consciousness.

What's the difference? Living entities in the material world are conditioned souls, are bound up by their own reactions of their material actions, whereas in the spiritual world, everyone is a devotee, everyone is engaged in devotional service, and everyone is liberated eternally. Sri Narada Muni could enter all these planets in both the material and spiritual spheres without restriction. This is the position of a pure devotee who is engaged in unbroken devotional service of the Supreme Lord. He is free to travel everywhere. Why does he travel? Because he is engaged always in preaching Krishna consciousness, Krishna Bhakti. That is the reason he travels. Such a travelling devotee is called Parivrajaka Acharya. Acharya means the authority in devotional service, in spiritual line. And Parivrajaka means one who constantly travels, Parivrajaka Acharya. So, Narada Muni is free to personally travel in all the material planets as well as in the spiritual planets also, without any restriction. Srila Prabhupada says here, as much as the Almighty Lord is free to move personally in any part of His creation.

**Summary:** This segment contrasts pure devotional service with fruitive work and philosophical speculation, stating that devotees never fall from the spiritual platform, unlike materialists and impersonalists.

to those who engage in pure devotional service of the Supreme Lord, भक्त्यामाम अभिजानाती, therefore it is said here, devotees never fall down from this spiritual platform, whereas the fruitive workers and speculative philosophers, both the materialists and the spiritualists who are only aware of the impersonal feature, they fall down, they can't remain, even if they elevate themselves, they cannot remain on the spiritual platform. Now, it is described here, at the time of creation, Narad Muni appeared along with so many other rishis like Marichi and Sanaka, Sanatana, but the important point is, the rishis like Marichi and Sanaka, Sanatana, they are not able to travel freely like Narad Muni in the spiritual world. Why is that? It is explained here, rishis like Marichi are authorities in fruitive work, and rishis like Sanaka and Sanatana are authorities in philosophical speculation.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "whereas spiritual activity transcendental activity devotional service is without material inebriety without material inebriety without any material defect without any material contamination just like when we chant Hare Krishna that sound of the holy name"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the transcendental nature of Narada Muni's Veena and contrasts spiritual activity with material contamination, using the chanting of Hare Krishna as an example of pure sound.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 32nd verse of the 6th chapter of the first canto of Shreemad Bhagavatam: देवदत्ताम इमाम वीनाम स्वरब्रम्म विभूशिताम मूर्चयित्वा हरिकताम गायमानश चराम्यहम. कृष्ण, सब्सक्राइब गुंग super सब्सक्राइब गुंग गुंग सब्सक्राइब गुंग इन द्विदिशन व वर्ड इनटरे अग्रियल इस्तोंस पूरा वूंड फार्ड दोस्व who are forgetful Krishna, those who want to enjoy independent of Krishna, those who want to imitate Krishna, those who are envious of Krishna. In several ways, it's described in different places, it's for the materialists. So it is described the Veena which was handed over by Krishna to Narada and always carried by Narada, that is a transcendental instrument. Why is it a transcendental instrument? Because it is identical with Lord Sri Krishna. And Narada being in the same spiritual category, some vibrated by this instrument which Narado Muni carries. This Veena cannot be material because the Veena is itself transcendent and therefore the glories and His past विज़ाईंस विचर ब्रॉड़कास वाडि इंस्ट्रोमेंट नारदा आर आउसो ट्रसेंड नेंटल विदाउट एक टींज वो मेटीरियल इन्ने ब्रीडी कि वो टींज उपटिड इन इफरीडी मेटीरियल इन्एब्रिटी ही समितिडियल्ड इफिक. In this material world, whatever work we do ordinarily has got this material inebriety or material contamination or material defect, if I may use that word, it is a defect. So that material defect is, it is the cause of bondage, it is a cause of bondage, it results in reactions, whereas spiritual activity, transcendental activity, devotional service is without material inebriety, without any material defect, without any material contamination, just like when we chant.

**Key Quote:** "it is possible to remain on the spiritual platform by constantly singing the glories of the lord"
**Summary:** The speaker explains how self-realized individuals can remain on the spiritual platform by constantly singing the glories of the Lord, referencing the Bhagavad-gita and describing the characteristics of a Mahatma or pure devotee.

Also properly use the sound meters, namely saray gama etc., in the service of the Lord by constantly singing the glories of the Lord as confirmed in the Bhagavad-Gita. So anybody who is self-realized, if they want to remain on the spiritual platform, on the platform of spirit, spiritual platform, then Bhagavad-Gita says it is possible to remain on the spiritual platform by constantly singing the glories of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-Gita, Krishna explains in the ninth chapter how do devotees worship Krishna? They worship Krishna, they are always constantly singing the glories of the Lord, always without any break, without any interruption, 24 hours a day, and in that way they are engaged in such glorification of the Supreme Lord with determination, very firm determination, it's not shakeable. They always bow down with all humility, with devotion they bow down to the Lord. They always bow down to the Lord, and in this way they are always engaged in worshipping the Lord. This is a description of someone who is called a Mahatma. Mahatma means a pure devotee according to the Bhagavad-Gita. That also, that is also described by a verse in the Gita: mahathmanastumam partha daivin prakritimahatmanastumam partha daivin prakritimahatmanastumahatmahatma.

And Narada Muni being a pure devotee, he is also engaged specifically in preaching through constantly glorifying the Lord by singing.

#### Absolute Truth, Relative Truth, Material vs. Spiritual

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Absolute Truth is Truth which is... Truth in all phases of time. Past, Present and Future."
**Summary:** The speaker defines Absolute Truth as unchanging and contrasts it with Relative Truth, which is subject to change in the material world, using the example of a person residing in a house.

The very opening verse, it is said by Vyasadeva, the author of the Bhagavatam, that I meditate upon Shri Krishna because he is the Absolute Truth. सत्यं परं धीमही. सत्यं परं सत्यं परं सत्यं is truth. परं there indicates Absolute Truth. So what is this Absolute Truth? Absolute Truth is Truth which is... Truth in all phases of time: past, present, and future. The Truth is always the Truth. It doesn't change. Relative Truth is Truth which is not true in all phases of time. Every Truth in the material world of some material object or material activity is a Relative Truth. If... To give an example, if I say such and such a gentleman is residing in a particular apartment or house. Now this statement is a Relative Truth because what happens with time, in course of time, that gentleman who's staying in a particular house, when he passes away, when he changes body, when he dies, then that statement, 'such and such a gentleman residing in the house,' is no longer true. Then we are to say he was residing, and when he died, he is no longer residing in the house, or even when he shifts from that residence due to whatever reason to another residence, then that statement, 'such a gentleman is residing in this house,' is no longer true. So like this, every statement we make about a material phenomenon in this world is a relative truth. It is relative to time, whereas the absolute personality of Godhead Krishna is absolute truth. He is always the Lord. He doesn't change his body. He doesn't change his position. His form, his name, his qualities, his forms don't change. You look at our own form, material body, it changes. They... He knows when you thought they... Hey, come on, your venom, Jara, anything material, it is constantly undergoing change. That's the...

**Key Quote:** "Spiritual existence is full of Rasa... spirit is dynamic unlike matter matter is static."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that spiritual existence is unchanging yet full of Rasa (flavor) and is dynamic, unlike static matter, emphasizing Krishna as the ultimate source of everything.

Spiritual existence is not changing, unchanging reality. So unchanging reality should not be mistaken to be something which is uninteresting in the material world because inherently in anything material, there is no Rasa. Therefore, everything material is actually without any substance. It is without substance, is without life, really speaking, without any Vasu, whereas spiritual existence is full of Rasa. Minute coworkers are... How is it interesting if it is unchanging? It is interesting because spiritual existence is full of rasa, even though unchanging. How is it interesting? It is... Spirit is dynamic, unlike matter. Matter is static, spirit is dynamic. So spirit is always alive, full of life. Spirit is actually full of life, and that life never expires, just like we say, we understand from the Bhagavad Gita that this real person inside this body, the spirit soul, does not die, is always living but changes body. The body is something which is material, is subject to deterioration, and one day we have to quit this body when it becomes old and useless. So spirit is dynamic, spirit is full of life, spirit is actually full of Rasa. That is because the Supreme Lord, personality of Godhead Krishna, the absolute personality of Godhead, he is the ultimate reality, ultimate person, the ultimate source from him everything is emanating.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the process of devotional service, particularly hearing, chanting, and remembering the Lord's names, fame, and activities.

All of them are actually absolute. All of them are absolute. They are non-different from each other. So as soon as a pure devotee engages himself in the pure devotional service of hearing, chanting, and remembering the name, fame, and activities of the Lord, a pure devotee is engaged always in devotional service. What does devotional service consist of? Nine different kinds of activities: shravanam kirtanam smaranam paada sevanam archanam vandanam dasyam sakhyam atmanivedanam, of which three are particularly mentioned here, the first three: hearing, chanting, and remembering, shravanam kirtanam smaranam. About what? Hearing about what, or chanting, or remembering what? The name, fame, and activities of the Lord. That is the recommendation in the Bhagavata: shravanaam kirtanam Vishno smaranam paada sevanam, about Vishnu, about the Supreme Lord. We have to hear about his names, his qualities, his pastimes, his forms, his paraphernalia, his Abode, his devotees, his relationships, his creation, his maintenance, destruction, everything about him when we hear that, or we chant about it, or we remember them...

**Key Quote:** "At once the Supreme Lord becomes visible to the transcendental eyes of the pure devotee... he reflects himself on the mirror of the heart by spiritual television."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a spiritual television to explain how the Lord becomes visible in the heart of a pure devotee engaged in devotional service.

At once, the Supreme Lord becomes visible to the transcendental eyes of the pure devotee. This ordinary eyes, we cannot see anything spiritual. How do the pure devotees see? They with transcendental eyes. And how do they see with transcendental eyes? That is described here by reflecting himself on the mirror of the heart of the spiritual... Prabhupada uses a term called spiritual television. Just like you have got experience of a material television, you have a television at home. Now the program that is broadcast by a station, you tune in or you connect to that station through your whatever the set of box or whatever, then the program being broadcast appears on your television screen, and you are able to see that program. That program is going on somewhere, either it is recorded and the recording is broadcast, or live it is going on. Let's say a cricket match is going on in Australia, and you are sitting in India, you can watch that cricket match live through this arrangement of television, is it not? Same way, there is something called a spiritual television. What is the spiritual television? That when a devotee sings the Lord's name or hears about the Lord's glories or remembers the Lord's glorification which he has heard before or recited before, immediately the Lord appears in his heart like a spiritual television is switched on. He reflects himself on the mirror of the heart by spiritual television, and this is possible for anybody who is engaged in pure devotional service. Seeing the Lord within the heart reflected by the spiritual television is possible for anyone who engages in pure devotional service of hearing or chanting or remembering. Therefore, a pure devotee who is related with the Lord in loving transcendental service can experience the presence of the Lord at every moment. What is the nature of pure devotees? They're always engaged in devotional service of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, they are always experiencing the presence of the Lord every moment because as soon as they sing or hear or do devotional service, the Lord is appearing on their heart.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights Narada Muni's chanting for the benefit of others and emphasizes the power of hearing the Lord's glories from pure devotees, even for those not spiritually advanced.

Another thing Sri La Prabhupada explains is that Sri Narada chants the glorification of the Lord not only for his personal benefit, but he is doing it for the benefit of everyone, especially in this material world, and even when they are not spiritual. From the spiritual point of view of the Lord, they are doing it with the intention of receiving the glory of the Lord. There are also other ways of receiving the glory of the Lord, just by hearing the glory of the Lord, simply by hearing the glories of the Lord from pure devotees.

**Summary:** Narad Muni instructs Vyasa Deva that chanting the transcendental activities of Lord Krishna helps overcome anxieties of material existence.

In this session we will be discussing from the 34th verse of the 6th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: एतद्ही आतुरचित्तानाम् मात्रास्परशेच्छयामुहु भवसिंदुप्लवो दुरुष्टो हरिचरियानु वर्णनम। The meaning of this verse is, it is personally experienced by me that those who are always full of cares and anxieties due to desiring contact of the senses with their objects can cross the ocean of nescience on a most suitable boat, the constant chanting of the transcendental activities of the personality of Godhead. These are words spoken by Narad Muni. He is instructing Vyasa Deva that by his personal experience he has found out that anybody who is full of anxieties due to this material existence, they can very easily cross over this ocean of nescience, ocean of ignorance, ocean of material existence by taking help of the constant chanting of the transcendental activities of Lord Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "The symptom of a living being is that he cannot remain silent even for some time."
**Summary:** A living being is always active, thinking, or talking, animated by the eternally living spirit soul.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, how does it work? The symptom of a living being is that he cannot remain silent even for some time. He can't find food. He can't even consume food. There is this past sente constantly silent. There is this present sensation of absence. For just some night. Nothing will happen. Continuously nothing will happen. He is unable to be became empty. Otherwise the body is by itself dead matter, what appears like a living body is not a living body, it is a dead body animated by the living spirit soul, eternally living spirit soul. So Srila Prabhupada says a living being cannot remain silent at any time, so he must be doing something or he must be thinking of something or talking about something.

**Key Quote:** "they become full with cares and anxieties"
**Summary:** Materialistic men discuss subjects that satisfy their senses, but such activities under the influence of illusory energy do not give satisfaction and lead to anxiety.

So some activity is always there if somebody is living. Generally the materialistic men think and discuss about subjects which satisfy their senses. So normally people are in ignorance about who they are and therefore they generally talk or discuss about subjects like what is meant for satisfying their senses because such things are exercised under the influence of the external illusory energy. Such sensual activities do not actually give them any satisfaction, however it may be promising or pleasing for the senses. None of these activities which are under the influence of the illusory energy can actually give us satisfaction, none of them can give us satisfaction. On the contrary, they become full with cares and anxieties. Then somebody tries to squeeze out some pleasure or happiness or some satisfaction out of material or sensual activities, then they are not able to get the satisfaction, at the same time they become filled with anxiety. This is called maya.

**Summary:** People under the influence of illusory energy seek pleasure in things that cannot provide it, leading to frustration, which can be overcome by chanting the activities of the Lord.

Or what is not, maya means not this, that which cannot give them satisfaction is accepted as an object for satisfaction. People under the influence of the illusory energy, they are always accepting something which is not pleasurable as pleasurable. So Narad Muni, so Narad Muni by his personal experience he says that satisfaction for such frustrated beings engaged in sense gratification is to chant always the activities of Lord. What is sense gratification? The senses are seeking some objects. What is sense gratification? No. For the eyes beautiful form, for the ears some melodious sound, for the nose some fragrant smell, for the tongue something very tasty to eat, for the sense of touch something which is very soft, something which is very smooth, something which is very warm, etc. Like that all the senses are ever seeking pleasure through this sense contact, but the result of the sense contact is not really pleasure. If at all there is some pleasure, some momentary pleasure may be there by such contact, but after that they are full of anxiety. Every action results in a reaction.

So they indulge in satisfying the senses, then they become very much filled with anxiety because the senses cannot actually give any satisfaction. On the other hand, they become entangled and therefore they are always frustrated. Entanglement means there is only complicated miseries. Now what happens if somebody starts chanting the activities of the Lord?

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "yoga system is helpful to actually control the senses but it is not effective in giving satisfaction to the soul"
**Summary:** Narada Muni explains that while yoga can control the senses, it doesn't provide soul satisfaction, which comes from devotional service.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 35th verse of the 6th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. We are continuing the conversation between Narada and Vyasa Deva. Towards the end of the chapter, a few more verses, the chapter will conclude. So the 35th verse is, the meaning of this verse is, it is true that by practicing restraint of the senses by the yoga system, one can get relief from the disturbances of desire and lust, but this is not sufficient to give satisfaction to the soul, for this satisfaction is derived from devotional service to the Personality of Godhead. So Srila Narada Muni is clearly explaining that the yoga system is helpful to actually control the senses, but it is not effective in giving satisfaction to the soul. Ultimately, we are always seeking satisfaction of the soul, though we do not know it, especially those in ignorance of the spiritual nature of the self. They are unaware that the satisfaction of the senses, mind, or intelligence is not satisfaction of the soul. I, the real person, am different from the body or the senses. I am different from the mind. I am different from my intelligence. I am spirit, so this spirit requires spiritual satisfaction, soul satisfaction. So that is explained very nicely by Srila Prabhupada in the purport: yoga aims at controlling the senses. This is one of the main purposes of practicing yoga, to control the senses. Generally, our senses are totally uncontrolled in the sense, with the idea that whatever the senses demand, we are simply busy satisfying those demands, but that is not the way of spiritual life. So in yoga practice, there is by practice of the mystic process of bodily exercise in sitting, thinking, feeling, willing, concentrating, facing, and setting away, meditating and, as beam bus into trance and in this one can control the senses. So this, they call it eight-fold yoga system, Ashtanga Yoga: yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, na para nayam, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, samadhi. Samadhi is completely being merged into transcendence. But the scriptures also describe this method of controlling the senses through yoga practice, Ashtanga Yoga practice. About that, the scriptures are telling, the senses are considered like venomous serpents, and the yoga system is just to control them. Narad Muni is recommending another method for controlling the senses. What is that? The method of transcendental loving service of Mukunda, the Personality of Godhead, the system of Bhakti, the process of Bhakti. It is different than the Ashtanga Yoga process.

#### Ashtanga Yoga, devotional service, sense engagement, Krishna Consciousness

**Key Quote:** "Ashtanga Yoga is denying the sense satisfaction, denying mind satisfaction, denying intellectual satisfaction all this by forcibly restraining the senses"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Ashtanga Yoga's artificial method of denying sense gratification with devotional service's positive engagement of the senses in spiritual activities.

By his experience, Narad Muni says that devotional service to the Lord is more effective and practical than the system of artificially controlling the senses. The method of Ashtanga Yoga is an artificial method. That means you have to force yourself against your natural way of living, whereby you engage your senses in sense satisfaction in some activity aimed at either satisfying the senses or the mind or the intelligence. So Ashtanga Yoga is denying the sense satisfaction, denying mind satisfaction, denying intellectual satisfaction, all this by forcibly restraining the senses, holding back the senses from their sense objects, holding back the mind, not indulging the mind or the senses or the intelligence, whereas what happens in devotional service? In the service of the Lord Mukunda. Mukunda means another name for Krishna. The senses are transcendentally engaged. This is the big difference. It is not stopping the senses, it is engaging the senses, but in a different way. What is that different way? Spiritually engaging them, transcendentally engaging them. That means we do spiritual activities in Krishna Consciousness. That is the system of Krishna Consciousness, the system of Bhakti. We engage the senses in spiritual activities, just like you may like to hear a very melodious Kirtan, Hare Krishna Kirtan. That is transcendentally engaging your ears and your mind and even your intelligence, or you may relish tasting nice Krishna Prasadam. That is engagement for the tongue, the mind, the intelligence, everything. So it is positive engagement. Bhakti is positive engagement, of course, in a specific type of activity, spiritual activity, and there are varieties, there is variety, ample variety of spiritual activities. In this way, if the senses are transcendentally engaged while serving Lord Mukunda, Lord Krishna, there is no chance of the senses being engaged in sense gratification, no chance. And the important point to notice, the senses want some engagement. They cannot be kept for long without any activity. That is artificial. To check them artificially is no check at all, because as soon as there is some opportunity for enjoyment, the serpent-like senses will certainly take advantage of it.

#### sense control, Vishwamitra Muni, Haridas Thakur, devotional service, Maya

**Key Quote:** "a devotee who is engaged in devotional service cannot be allured by Maya because this is a superior engagement"
**Summary:** The speaker uses the examples of Vishwamitra Muni and Haridas Thakur to illustrate the difference between artificial sense control and the power of devotional service to overcome Maya.

And Prabhupada gives a nice example. There are many such instances in history, and they have been recorded in the Puranas, in the scriptures, just like the example is given of Vishwamitra Muni. He was a great king. He renounced his kingdom and all the wealth and the comforts, royal comforts, and he went away to a forest, a secluded place, and he was performing tapasya. But he, while practicing tapasya, Vishwamitra Muni became a victim to the beauty of Menaka. Whenever any great personality is very determined to perform tapasya, Indra, the king of heaven, he becomes very worried that this person who is doing tapasya may overtake me and replace me as the king of heaven. So Indra sends Apsaras to disturb the tapasya, and that's what exactly happened when Vishwamitra Muni was sitting in the forest and performing meditation. Indra sent one Apsara by name Menaka, and Menaka came and she allured Vishwamitra Muni, and Vishwamitra Muni became completely distracted from his tapasya. But the other example that is also given, a devotee of Lord Chaitanya Thakur, Haridas, he was allured at midnight by the well-dressed Maya. Maya Devi herself came to allure Haridas Thakur when he was sitting and chanting Hare Krishna. Still, she could not induce him into her trap. She could not do that. In fact, Maya Devi surrendered to Haridas Thakur and begged for the holy name from him. So a devotee who is engaged in devotional service cannot be allured by Maya because this is a superior engagement. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita, param drishtva nivartate. If you want to stop the senses from being engaged in mundane sense activities, then you should engage the senses in devotional service, and such engagement is superior.

**Key Quote:** "without devotional service of the Lord neither the yoga system nor philosophical speculation can ever become successful"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that pure devotional service is the topmost path to self-realization, superior to yoga, jnana, and karma, and that these other paths are dependent on bhakti.

You cannot be distracted by Maya. The whole idea is that without devotional service of the Lord, neither the yoga system nor philosophical speculation can ever become successful. Always yoga means karma, karma yoga, jnana, jnana yoga, tapasya, ashtanga yoga, they are different. Whenever the word yoga is suffixed to karma, jnana, or tapasya, then it means that you have to mix with devotional service. Now, pure devotional service of the Lord is without any tinge of or without any mixture of fruity work, mystic yoga, or speculative philosophy, without any mixture of karma, jnana, or tapasya, that without any mixture of that, pure devotional service is actually the foremost procedure for self-realization. This will be explained in detail in the later portions of the Bhagavatam. Such pure devotional service is transcendental in nature, and the systems of yoga and jnana are subordinate to such a process. Yoga and jnana are dependent on mixture of bhakti, whereas pure bhakti is independent of yoga, jnana, karma, everything else. When the transcendental devotional service is mixed with a subordinate process, it is no longer transcendental. It is called mixed devotional service. So all this will be explained by Sri Vyasadeva in the text later on, but for now Narada Muni is telling, bhakti can give complete satisfaction for the soul. Yoga can help in controlling the senses, but it cannot give satisfaction for the soul. Therefore, he is recommending bhakti over the process of yoga or even the process of jnana or even karma. So bhakti, pure devotional service, is the topmost.

**Key Quote:** "What is the cause for his dissatisfaction? That's clearly answered by Narada."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Vyasa Deva's dissatisfaction despite compiling Vedic literature and how Narada Muni instructed him to compile Srimad Bhagavatam, which exclusively glorifies Krishna.

This is almost the concluding portion of this chapter. This was spoken by Narada in response to a question by Vyasa Deva. Vyasa Deva, after compiling the varieties of Vedic literature, he was somehow feeling dissatisfaction in his heart that he had not done enough for the welfare of the people. So, just at the time when he was contemplating what was the cause of his dissatisfaction, that's exactly when Narada Muni arrived in his ashram, in Vyasa's ashram. So, Vyasa received Narada very respectfully and inquired from him, what is the cause of my dissatisfaction? So, then Narada Muni pointed out, even though you have compiled so many varieties of Vedic literature, you have not compiled one particular literature which exclusively glorifies Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhood. And Vyasa Deva was instructed by Narada to compile that particular literature. So, Narada gave instructions to Vyasa Deva how to go about compiling the Srimad Bhagavatam, which is the exclusive literature glorifying Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now not only did Vyasa get instructions about compiling Bhagavatam but he also inquired from Narada about his own self-realization and that is what Narada has explained. How did he become self-realized? How did he become the great devotee Narada? So the whole history has been described. I have explained my birth and activities for self-realization as you asked. So whatever Vyasa Dev asked, Narada has described. Now Vyasa Dev is being told by Narada, all this will be conducive for your personal satisfaction also. So Vyasa Dev was looking for a clue. What is the cause for his dissatisfaction? That's clearly answered by Narada.

So in the purpose of this video, I would like to share with you the quote. Prabhupada is summarizing Narada's instructions to Vyasa Deva. The process of devotional activities from the beginning to the stage of transcendence is all duly explained to satisfy the inquiries of Vyasa Deva. If you recollect, it was described the process of Bhakti begins with Shraddha, initial faith. Isinya and is it true that the Ram shanti are also somewhataka? Shanta's Bhakti starts as a mock example.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how Narada's devotional service began in his previous life as the son of a maidservant through association with sages and partaking of their remnants (prasadam), leading to purification and attraction to Krishna katha.

So all these have been explained in brief, of course, by Narada to Vyasa. So Prabhupada is further explained. Narada has explained how the seeds of devotional service were sown by the transcendental association, and how they gradually developed by hearing the sages, the bhaktivedantas who happened to be passing by that place where Narada in his previous life as the son of a maidservant was staying with his mother. And the sages happened to stop by in that spot, and Narada's mother was rendering some menial service to the sages, and Narada as a small boy joined his mother. And one day he took some remnants of some food left behind by the sages, the bhaktivedantas, and that resulted in his purification and he became attracted to the subject matter of krishna katha which they were discussing. From those self-realized sages was detachment from worldliness so much so that even a small boy could receive the death news of his mother who was his only caretaker as the blessings of God. The boy became enlightened in their association by hearing them after he partook remnants of uh prasadam left behind by them so it had a very big transformation of his heart the small boy narada in his previous life as a small boy and at once he took the opportunity to search out the lord.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Narada's search for the Lord, the brief darshan he received, and how devotional service helps one get rid of the reactions of fruitive activities, breaking the cycle of birth and death.

We have to re-establish our lost relationship with Krishna, that is the whole practice of bhakti, that is what bhakti is meant for. So this boy went for searching the Lord exactly as he had been instructed by those sages, the bhaktivedantas. A sincere urge for having an interview with the Lord was also granted to him, although it is not possible for anyone to see the Lord with mundane eyes. Krishna gave him brief darshan and afterwards Narada tried to have the darshan again and he could not, but the Lord spoke to Narada to encourage him to continue his practice of meditation on the Supreme Lord in the heart as taught by the bhaktivedantas. So Naramuni also explained to Vyasa Deva how by execution of pure transcendental service one can get rid of the fruitive action of accumulated work. We have been doing so many material activities in contact with this material world, contact with the three modes and that has resulted in so many reactions and those reactions result in a repetition of birth and death in this world. We cannot get out of material existence but pure devotional service helps us to completely clear away all these reactions.

**Summary:** The speaker explains why the results of devotional life are not directly explained in the Vedas and Upanishads, highlighting that Srimad Bhagavatam is the mature fruit of Vedic literature and the most important text, especially in the age of Kali.

means it's very difficult to find this in the original vedas why why is it difficult to find sri la prabhupada explains in the vedas and upanishads there are only indirect hints to all this only indirect hints are there direct clear specific explanation is not there in the original vedas and the upanishads no why because the vedas are dealing with the actions and reactions to the three modes of material nature in this material world and because most people are so much interested in material gain through fruitive activity the vedas are suggesting how they can do pious activities and get their desires satisfied their material desires but we are not meant for material existence neither we can really achieve a soul's satisfaction but we have the right to achieve it without conflict we are also interested in material life and we live in a material state after the hinaus Sec mangoes we live pretty much the same but we can't ever be in a material eighteen condition so true belief your veda has a desire to live being馨 Th bread and answering with what is what is as the desire for the customer takes your body through theaction to determine이젏 the desire for the person in fact as we build in their fruit of life it is not a deskritở by material desires being fulfilled.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse to be discussed (SB 1.6.37) and explains the context of Suta Goswami narrating to the sages and Narada Muni's departure after instructing Vyasa Deva.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudireet In this session we will be discussing from the last two verses of the 6th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam.

Sūtavvāca evam sambhāśya bhagavān nārado vāsavīśutam āmantryavīnām ranayan yayau yadṛcchiko muniḥ The meaning of this verse is Sūt Gosvāmī said. Remember, Sūt Gosvāmī is narrating all this to the sages of Naimisharanya based on their inquiry. So Sūt Goswāmī is telling the sages thus addressing Vyasa Deva, Srila Narada Muni took leave of him and vibrating on his Veena instrument, he left to wander at his free will.

**Key Quote:** "every living being is anxious for full freedom because that is his transcendental nature"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Narada Muni's freedom and contrasts it with the limitations of material existence, emphasizing that true freedom is obtained through transcendental service to the Lord.

So Narada Muni is being glorified that he instructed Vyasa Deva exactly to the point, and after finishing his instructions, after completing his instructions, he left to wander at his free will. He is a liberated soul and he simply is directed within his heart by the Supreme Lord directly. So we will see here in the Srimad Bhagavatam Narada Muni appearing in so many different situations in different places only for the sake of preaching about Bhakti, only for one purpose, glorifying the Lord and thereby broadcasting these glories among different people, different persons. God is null for itself. So in the purport Srila Prabhupada says something about Narada's freedom to travel at will wherever he wants. Every living being is anxious for full freedom because that is his transcendental nature. What is our nature as spirit soul? We have full freedom as spirit soul, unlike this body. What is the nature of this material body? It is full of limitations. Every body has got a very specific characteristic, just like there are creatures which can fly, creatures which can walk only, creatures which can only live in water, creatures which can only crawl on the ground, creatures which can only run or walk on four legs. Like that, every body has got a limitation and every body is a material body subject to the influence of the three gunas, subject to threefold miseries, subject to fourfold fundamental problems and all these material bodies are temporary. So we should seriously consider what is being said here. This freedom is obtained only through the transcendental service of the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the illusion of freedom in the material world, highlighting the ignorance of people regarding their true spiritual nature and the limitations of a conditioned soul.

And the only way to obtain this freedom is only through the transcendental service of the Lord. This freedom from material bondage, freedom from the limitations of this body is obtained only one way, what is that? Through transcendental service of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Illusione by the external energy everyone thinks that is through themselves free. Common people, ordinary people generally think I'm free, but actually he is bound up by the laws of nature. What people don't realize is that we are entitled to eternal life. We don't have to die, we don't have to take birth, we don't have to become old, we don't have to get diseased. Are people aware of this? Most people are ignorant about this. That is also the bad system of education that we have. People are not being taught the essential fundamentals of our real nature for real existence, spiritual existence. So Bhagavad-gita is the ultimate wisdom of the world.

**Key Quote:** "but a full-fledged free soul like Narada always engaged in the work of God always engaged in chanting the Lord's glory is free to move not only on earth but also in any part of the universe as well as in any part of the spiritual sky"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad Bhagavatam in enlightening us about our true nature and contrasts the freedom of a pure devotee like Narada Muni with the limitations of conditioned souls and yogis.

So Bhagavad-gita is the ultimate wisdom of the world. Bhagavatam is enlightening us, Srila Prabhupada is enlightening us that only under illusion we may think that I am free, but actually we are not free. A conditioned soul, who is a conditioned soul? One who is subject to the influence of this material nature consisting of three gunas because of the material body, because of our desire to enjoy materially. So a conditioned soul cannot freely move from one place to another even on this earth, and what to speak of one planet to another. On earth do we have freedom to just go wherever we want freely? No, we are bound by so many limitations. But a full-fledged free soul like Narada always engaged in the work of God, always engaged in chanting the Lord's glory is free to move not only on earth but also in any part of the universe as well as in any part of the spiritual sky. Just take note of the extent of freedom Narada Muni has. Yogis who have got mystic power can travel within this universe, but they cannot penetrate the cover of the earth and they cannot penetrate the earth and they cannot penetrate the earth and they cannot penetrate the earth and they cannot of the universe by their mystic power, not possible. Devotees like Narada who are always engaged in glorification of the Supreme Lord, they are free to travel anywhere including the spiritual world penetrating the seven layers of coverings of this universe. So that is the specific freedom that is there for pure devotees who are always engaged in broadcasting the glories of the supreme god. We can just imagine the extent and unlimitedness of his freedom, whose freedom? Narada Muni's freedom. To what extent is he really experiencing freedom which is as good as that of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is free to travel anywhere and everywhere in the whole creation in the material world or the spiritual world. Similarly Narada is also free to travel though Narada is not God, nobody becomes equal to God, but they are bestowed upon, bestowed with the freedom to travel at will by the Supreme Lord. There is no reason or obligation for his traveling and no one can stop him from his free movement.

**Key Quote:** "whereas narada bani is fully self-satisfied by devotional service to krishna which he has for the entire creation of the supreme lord krishna which he engages always and therefore he has no reason to travel that i want something i want something"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Narada Muni's travels are not driven by personal desires but by his self-satisfied engagement in devotional service to Krishna, contrasting this with the motivations of ordinary people.

If we travel we generally will have a purpose, obligation, duty or some desire for enjoyment. We are always having a reason, whereas Narada Muni is fully self-satisfied by devotional service to Krishna which he has for the entire creation of the Supreme Lord Krishna which he engages always and therefore he has no reason to travel that I want something, I want something. A pure devotee never wants anything. Of course a pure devotee always prays to Krishna may I always be engaged in your service. This is a pure devotee's prayer and the Lord is pleased with such prayers and he engages a pure devotee in devotional service always eternally. So Srila Prabhupada explains similarly the transcendental system of devotional service is also free. The transcendental system of devotional service is also free. You it may or may not develop in a particular person even after he undergoes all the detailed formulas. There is no obligation on the part of the Supreme Lord to grant us this freedom by performing devotional service. It is not obligatory for the Lord. Of course the Lord is, Lord Krishna is always our topmost well-wisher, but then we should surrender to him, execute devotional service without any reservation and then we can expect the mercy of the Lord by which alone we can get this freedom which a pure devotee enjoys by the mercy of the Supreme Lord. The association of the devotee is also free. One may be fortunate to have it or one may not have it even after thousands of endeavors. People have so many different kinds of associations in this world. Somebody's interest in sports then they are associating with other people and they are associating with the Lord because they are interested people in sports. Somebody's interested in some profession, some technical development and they associate with such technocrats. Somebody is interested in some mundane music, somebody else is interested in mundane literature. So many different interests are there and they are busy with that.

**Key Quote:** "And yet, acharyas like Prabhupada come down and they want to liberally distribute devotional service to all those who are unfortunate, all those who are bereft of devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by highlighting the rarity of devotional service and the compassion of acharyas like Prabhupada who distribute it to the suffering souls, emphasizing the importance of surrendering to the spiritual master and awaiting the causeless mercy of the Lord.

So, devotional service is not easily available in this material world. And yet, acharyas like Prabhupada come down and they want to liberally distribute devotional service to all those who are unfortunate, all those who are bereft of devotional service. Acharyas like Prabhupada, Prabhupada, his guru, his guru's guru, all the acharyas in the parampara, in the sampradaya, Vaishnava sampradaya, they are very, very, very compassionate upon the suffering souls of this world, just as Krishna is compassionate. Why does Krishna incarnate? For the sake of the conditioned souls, to rescue them. And he senses confidential devotees also to rescue the conditioned souls. Krishna is anxious for this. This is only anxiety. Prahlad Maharaj says, People are busy with illusory activities, simply for some illusory pleasure. And they are simply wasting their time. Unfortunately, they are ignorant. But the ignorance, even if it is not difficult to remove, we may not become really delivered or free from material bondage, simply by some mechanical process. No. So, therefore, it is said here, devotional service, voluntarily taken up by somebody, and serve the spiritual master, and through the spiritual master, the Supreme Lord Krishna, without any reservation, and await the causeless mercy of the spiritual master and the Supreme Lord. This is the formula. I will stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of bhakti, hearing the glories of Krishna from pure devotees, and the role of the spiritual master as a transparent medium for the Lord's mercy.

Like this, all the defects of material existence, if we were to analyse, it is too complex. But simply take to the process of bhakti, especially hearing the glories of Krishna from such pure devotees as Narada, Vyasa, Srila Narad Muni, Sita Goswami, Sita Chandra, Srila Prabhupada. Your life is going to be a complete success, ultimate success. So how does it actually happen? In the previous session I was discussing about devotional service. That one may not attain devotional perfection even after following all the rules and regulations of devotional service, or one may get it, you know, very easily, very quickly. So it all depends on the mercy of the supreme lord coming through the transparent medium of the bona fide spiritual master. What's the meaning of this transparent medium? We discussed this earlier. The spiritual master facilitates lord's mercy to be distributed to the suffering souls for the benefit of the suffering souls. But in distributing like this, this mercy of the supreme lord to the suffering souls, the spiritual master engages in what is called as devotional activity

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of freedom in devotional service, emphasizing that bhakti cannot be forced and that the Lord's mercy is bestowed according to one's willingness to accept it.

which are meant for enlightening the ignorant souls about bhakti, especially about bhakti. But the characteristic of bhakti is, in all spheres of devotional service, freedom is the main pivot. Bhakti cannot be forced. You cannot demand bhakti. Lord is not obligated to bestow devotional service upon anyone and everyone, and yet the scriptures say even though the lord is fully independent, he is also very, very kind to the suffering souls of this world. So therefore it is his only anxiety that my beloved part and parcels are suffering in this world under illusion, so he wants to rescue, but not against our wish. The pivot of all devotional activities is freedom. You are free to accept the path of devotional service, you're free to reject it or to not accept that at all. But you should understand other than devotional service there's no way

**Summary:** The speaker explains that surrendering to Krishna leads to true freedom and liberation from material bondage, attracting the Lord's mercy.

anybody can get ultimate liberation from all material problems, and with a sober cool head if you study Bhagavad-Gita and Bhagavatam, you can understand this thoroughly. There are so many examples in the Bhagavata and Bhagavad-Gita systematically explains the principles by which devotional service works. So here Srila Prabhupada says a very important thing: without freedom there is no execution of devotional service. The freedom surrender to the Lord, it is advice in the Bhagavad-Gita. Krishna advises us, surrender your so called illusory freedom. We don't have real freedom in this material world, we have illusory freedom. So Krishna says surrender that to whom? To Krishna. That does not mean that by surrendering we become slaves. No, by surrendering to the lord we become completely free. We become free from material bondage, we attain ultimate liberation, we attract the mercy of the supreme lord.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Narada Muni's role in glorifying the Lord through his Veena, emphasizing the transcendental nature of the instrument and its sound.

So we have to, with this cool head, we have to understand this. So in the purport to this last verse, Srila Prabhupada explains, in the purport itself, Sri Narad Muni plays on his instrument to glorify the transcendental activities of the Lord. There's a song written by one of our, the veena which Narad Muni carries is completely transcendental. It's of the same spiritual quality as the supreme lord, pure devotees, the spiritual world, etc. So the sound vibrated by this veena is completely spiritual. So what is the proof that it is spiritual? Narad Muni vibrates for place on this instrument called veena and by doing so he simply sings the glories of the supreme lord. Not only Narad Muni playing on the veena instrument glorifies the supreme lord, but he also does give relief to all miserable lives.

living entities of this universe. We should be fortunate to hear Narad Muni singing, playing on the Veena. So Narad Muni does that. He travels. And he enlivens others by simply glorifying the Lord while playing on his instrument, the Veena. So Prabhupada says in this purport, no one is happy here within the universe. And what is felt as happiness is Maya's illusion. This I explained in the previous session. The same thing is repeated, that only under the influence of illusion, due to illusory presentation called happiness, a person thinks himself or herself happy. But nobody is happy. Nobody. Nobody is really happy, because the quality of this material happiness is illusory. That's why. The illusory energies of the Lord is so strong that even the hog who lives on filthy stool feels happy. What kind of happiness is this, this material happiness? The hog is eating some rubbish, and the hog feels very, very happy eating such rubbish. We think it is very abominable. So whole material existence is like that. So Srila Prabhupada says, no one can be truly happy within the material world.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts material happiness with the qualitatively different pleasure derived from devotional service, stating that true happiness cannot be found through material means.

If you want real happiness, it is not available by any material methods. OK. What do people do when they try to get some happiness through material methods, and they don't get it? Or they get something which is limited, and it's not satisfying the core of the heart, the spirit soul. Then they attempt to get some other similar happiness in another way, another attempt, another background, another technique. But actually, Prabhupada's statement here is, no one can be truly happy within the material world. No one can be truly happy. And you can talk to any number of materialistic persons. If they're honest with you, they will admit that whatever pleasure they are seeking, that is simply some material happiness, which is illusory. And they will not easily admit, but that confide that such material happiness is not at all the same as the pleasure derived from devotional cells. It's totally different in quality.

So mission of all genuine devotees of the Lord is to follow in the footsteps of Narad Muni. Narad Muni is the Acharya. And we are meant to follow the Acharya. Acharya teaches by example.

So such acharyas are simply concerned with welfare of the suffering souls in this world. Even Srila Prabhupada is acharya, present acharya. He's always unhappy about the suffering of the souls, conditioned souls in this world. Some or the other convince them and actually get them to engage in devotional pure devotional service and get that if they get a little taste, a very, very little taste that is so sweet that they'll be attracted to get more such pleasure, spiritual happiness more and more and more and more and it can be unlimitedly expanded because Krishna's unlimited, his service is unlimited, his spiritual abode is unlimited like that. So we can expect that we engage in pure devotional service under proper guidance with proper and strictly following the rules regulations in the association below we get a little glimpse of the taste of pure devotional service itself even before reaching perfection.

**Key Quote:** "So, something which happened billions of years back, and after that happened, everything was completely annihilated, still, how is it fresh in the mind of Narada?"
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains Vyasa Deva's question to Narada Muni about how Narada remembers events from a previous kalpa, even after annihilation.

In this session, we will continue to discuss from the 6th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, verses 4 onwards. Today we will discuss 4 to 9, that is about 6 verses. The 4th verse, प्राककल्प विशयाम एताम् स्मृतिम्ते मुनिसत्तमा नही एश प्यवधात काल एश सर्वनिराकृतिही. The meaning of this verse is, O great sage. This verse is spoken by Vyasa Deva as an inquiry to Narada Muni. Vyasa Deva is inquiring from Narada about the further events after his initiation in his previous life, Narada's previous life. So Vyasa Deva's inquiry now is, O great sage, time annihilates everything in due course. So how is it that this subject matter, which happened prior to this day of Brahma, is still fresh in your memory, undisturbed by time? We have to be reminded that Narada is speaking of his previous life in a previous kalpa. Kalpa means a day of Brahma. In one day of Brahma, there are 1000 cycles of the 4 yugas on this earth. So, something which happened billions of years back, and after that happened, everything was completely annihilated, still, how is it fresh in the mind of Narada?

**Key Quote:** "A spirit is not annihilated even after the annihilation of the material body. So also, spiritual consciousness is not annihilated."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains Srila Prabhupada's explanation that the spirit soul and spiritual consciousness are eternal and not destroyed like the material body.

That is Vyasa Deva's question. So Srila Prabhupada explains, how is it fresh? Srila Prabhupada says, A spirit is not annihilated even after the annihilation of the material body. So also, spiritual consciousness is not annihilated. So, we are spirit soul. Spirit soul is eternal, never destroyed, no birth, no death, no deterioration. And the body is, of course, it is destroyed after death. So unlike the body which is destroyed, every time we acquire a body, it will be destroyed. So body is destroyed, yes, but not the spirit soul. Similarly, spiritual consciousness, the consciousness belongs to the spirit. Consciousness doesn't belong to the body or doesn't belong to anything material. Just like all the material objects around us, they are all dead matter. There is no consciousness in them. Similarly, the body itself independently does not have consciousness. Then, what is the consciousness we exhibit while in this body? So that Srila Prabhupada explains, that Narada developed his spiritual consciousness even when he had his material body in the previous kalpa, in the previous day of Brahma. He developed the spiritual consciousness.

**Key Quote:** "Whereas, the spiritual consciousness is not dependent on the condition or the state of the body."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami contrasts material consciousness, which is temporary and dependent on the body, with spiritual consciousness, which is eternal.

Now, consciousness of the material body means spiritual consciousness expressed through the medium of a material body. Just like everybody exhibits consciousness, all living persons, even though they are not situated in spiritual consciousness, whatever consciousness they are exhibiting, they are exhibiting the consciousness of the spirit through the medium of the material body. Now, this consciousness exhibited through the material body, is inferior, it is destructible and it is perverted. It is not permanent. Just like even in this life, you can see a child exhibits consciousness of a small child behavior or the characteristics of a small child. The same child, when it grows up, when its consciousness changes from the consciousness of a child to the consciousness of a young adult, it is completely different. The consciousness is different. So, that consciousness of a child is gone with that child body. The child body is no longer there. So, that consciousness of a child, is not there exhibited anymore. It is gone with the body.

Whereas, the spiritual consciousness is not dependent on the condition or the state of the body. It is the awakening of the spirit. It is the awakening of the spirit. So, that is the super consciousness of the supra mind, as Prabhupada says here. It is spiritual consciousness, which is above material consciousness. And it is of the super mind. The spiritual mind, not the material mind. And it is on the spiritual plane. It is on the spiritual platform. It is as good as the spirit soul and is never destroyed, never annihilated. So, this is the explanation Srila Prabhupada gives, how Narada did not forget what happened in a previous day of Brahma, when everything at the end of the day of Brahma was annihilated. So, everything is annihilated means except the spirit and the spiritual consciousness,

So, the fifth verse, Narada Vacha, Narada Muni now responds to Vyasa Deva's questions. Bhikshu Bhir Vipravasite Vijnana Adheshtra Bhirmama Vartamano Vyasyaadhe Tata Etad Akarasham. Narada Muni is telling Vyasa Deva, Sri Narada said, The great sages who had imparted scientific knowledge, knowledge of transcendence to me departed for other places and I had to pass my life in this way. So, the sages went away because their four month period, chaturmasya is over. So, they resumed travelling. And Narada Muni says, I had to pass my life in this way. What is that?

How did he continue to live after the initiation? So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, In his previous life when Narada ji was impregnated with spiritual knowledge by the grace of the great sages, there was a tangible change in his life. Although he was only a boy of five years, there was a significant change in his life. Even though he was a small boy, that initiation or imparting the spiritual knowledge, awakening the spirit within, that is a significant change in the life of the initiated candidate. Small boy still, the change is very, very significant. And Srila Prabhupada says, That is an important symptom visible after initiation by the bona fide spiritual master.

**Key Quote:** "The world is under the full control of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, everyone is like a wooden doll in the hands of a puppet master."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces verses 6 and 7 of Srimad Bhagavatam 1.6, explaining Narada Muni's dependence on his mother and the concept of divine control, while also touching upon the idea of limited free will.

This session will be discussing from the Srimad Bhagavatam, the first canto, sixth chapter. Sixth chapter is entitled Conversation between Narada and Vyasa Deva. This is the sixth verse I am going to read now. The meaning of this verse is: I was the only son of my mother who was not only a simple woman but a maid servant as well. Since I was her only offspring, she had no other alternative for protection. She bound me with the tie of affection. This is Narada Muni describing his previous life to Vyasa Deva. He is particularly answering Vyasa's question as to what did he do after initiation. So he was the only son of his mother. He was the only son of his mother and his mother was a maid servant doing some simple work and he was her only son. So she bound him up with her affectionate bondage. The next verse, the seventh verse. The meaning is: she wanted to look after my maintenance properly but because she was not independent, she was not able to do anything for me. The world is under the full control of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, everyone is like a wooden doll in the hands of a puppet master. So Narada Muni is explaining that the mother was having a plan to look after this boy very nicely. But we should always remember, none of us in this world are independent. The world is under the full control, complete control of the Supreme Lord. It is described here. Therefore, everyone is like a wooden doll in the hands of a puppet master. It is described here. Therefore, everyone is like a wooden doll in the hands of a puppet master. It is described here. So does it mean that what can we do? Whatever happens is completely under the control of the Supreme Lord. So we are kind of totally helpless.

**Key Quote:** "But he also has given each of the human beings, particularly, a little free will, little independence."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that while the Lord is in control, humans have a degree of free will and are responsible for their actions and desires, which influence their experiences within the boundaries set by the Lord.

This sort of understanding is not the correct understanding. What is the correct understanding? The Lord is in full control, yes, that's a fact. But he also has given each of the human beings, particularly, a little free will, little independence. And we have to become responsible in properly utilizing the tiny amount of independence. Now this use of independence is dependent on our desires. In what way we want to cultivate our desires. In what way we want to cultivate our desires. So, depending on the desires and depending on our past karma, So, depending on the desires and depending on our past karma, the Supreme Lord arranges everything for a person, for each one of us.

**Summary:** The speaker continues with verses 8 and 9, describing Narada Muni's childhood dependence on his mother and her death by snakebite, attributing it to the supreme will of the Lord.

Absolute freedom belongs only to the Supreme Lord and nobody else. So, I continue. The eighth verse. The meaning of this verse is: When I was a mere child of five years, I lived in a Brahmana school.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the mother's death was the Lord's mercy, freeing Narada from material bondage and dependence, and emphasizes the illusory nature of bodily connections and the uncertainty of material relationships.

So, this is the supreme will of the Supreme Lord. So, Śrīla Prabhupāda explains, That is the way of dragging a sincere soul nearer to God. The boy was bound up by his mother's affection. But, to release him from that bondage, the Lord has arranged something. What is that? The poor boy was being looked after only by his affectionate mother. And yet, the mother was taken away from the world by the supreme will, in order to put him completely at the mercy of the Lord. See, this is described here as the Lord's mercy upon this soul, Narada, in his previous life. Actually, each one of us is completely dependent entirely on the Supreme Lord. It is not just the case with this boy, Narada. It is the case with everyone. But, we have created artificial sources of dependence, based on some bodily connections. But, all these are simply the effect of the illusory energy. The body itself is the arrangement of the illusory energy. So, what to speak of the bodily connections? They are all completely governed by kala karma guna. So, there is no certainty how long a certain relationship will exist, and what will be the outcome of a certain relationship, at a certain time. Nobody can actually predict, or make a definite plan, though we try to make so many plans. But, all such plans are ultimately nullified,

by the action of the supreme time. So, the boy was having only his mother. And, the mother was taken away, so that he could completely come to depend upon the Supreme Lord, who is the only available shelter, ultimately, and nobody else is the shelter. The tenth verse, tadātadaham īśasya bhaktānāṁśaṁ abhīpsatah anugrahaṁ manyamāṇaḥ prātiṣṭham diśaṁ uttarāṁ The meaning is: I took this as the special mercy of the lord, who always desires benediction for his devotees. And so thinking, I started for the north. So, Śrīla Prabhupāda explains, Confidential devotees of the lord see in every step a benedictory direction of the lord. What is considered to be an odd or difficult moment, in the mundane sense, is accepted as a special mercy of the lord. This is the position of a devotee. This boy was initiated, instructed, and enlightened by the sages, even when he was a very small boy. But he could understand, Oh, now that my mother is taken away from me, who is there for me, other than the Supreme Lord, nobody else. And therefore, this boy thought that it's the lord's mercy, that I have been placed in a situation where I exclusively have to depend on him. And, he understood that the lord has freed him from this bondage. And, as he was directed, or instructed by the sages, he actually started towards the north.

the saintly persons. So, it is explained here, mundane prosperity is a kind of material fever. And by the grace of the lord, the temperature of this material fever is gradually diminished. So, what we calculate according to our material calculation, that is not the proper understanding from the spiritual perspective. Just like fever is to be reduced. It's a symptom of an unhealthy body. Similarly, material prosperity, which may make us attached materially, or bound materially, is like a fever, unhealthy condition. So, when it comes down, then we come out of the bondage, material bondage. And that's what happened to Narada Muni. Of course, people do not understand this. Ordinary people do not understand this. It's only spiritual perspective which helps us understand this situation. So, I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

The meaning of this verse is, Rishi Shaunaka asked, O Suta! The great and transcendentally powerful Vyasa Deva heard everything from Shri Narada Muni. So after Narada's departure, what did Vyasa Deva do? If you remember, the conversation between the sages of Naimisharanya headed by Shaunaka Rishi and Suta Goswami is the beginning of the first chapter of the first canto of Bhagavatam, the opening of the Bhagavatam. So, seeing the eagerness of these sages to hear about Krishna, Suta Goswami decided to recite the Bhagavatam, which he had heard from Shukadeva Goswami. So before reciting the Bhagavatam, Shaunaka Rishi asked many other questions apart from the first six questions to Suta Goswami. So, in response to questions asked by Shaunaka Rishi, who is the representative of the sages of Naimisharanya, Suta Goswami is answering. Here, Shaunaka Rishi is asking to continue, what did Vyasa Deva do? After he heard everything about Narada Muni's previous birth, how Narada Muni actually got enlightenment from the Bhaktivedanta centers, how Narada Muni actually got enlightenment from the Bhaktivedanta... How Narada Muni actually got enlightenment from the Bhaktivedanta... How he practiced going to a sacred place, the meditation on the Supreme Lord, how he had a brief glimpse of the darshan of the Lord, then the Lord spoke to him, and then he became perfect, and when he quit his body in his previous life, he changed from a material body to a completely spiritual body, and in that spiritual body now, in this day of Brahma, he is born as the son of Brahma, in his same transcendental form, and he travels everywhere simply singing the glories of the Supreme Lord, while vibrating on his transcendental instrument, the Veena, which is given to him by Krishna himself, and in this way, he is himself completely enlivened, and he enlivens others also.

**Summary:** This segment defines the concept of an ashram as a spiritually surcharged place suitable for transcendentalists, emphasizing the importance of spiritual culture and renunciation of sense enjoyment.

hills of the Himalayas and even other places there devotees do visit that place it's called Vyasa Gufa, the cave of Vyasa Deva, that's the literal meaning in Hindi, Vyasa Gufa. So that place, that is the place where Vyasa Deva's ashram is located, and Vyasa Deva sat there and engaged in meditation, and when he was and had reached Samadhi, he was able to actually realize the entire truth about the absolute personality of Godhead Krishna that will be described now. Now, Srila Vyasa Deva was a householder, that's how he had a son Sukhdev Goswami, yet his residential place is called an ashram. So what is ashram? An ashram is a place where spiritual culture is always foremost. Ashram is a residential place, but it is a spiritually surcharged place because it is the most suitable place for such a spiritual place, but it is a place where you are... spiritual shelter for any transcendentalist. It is necessary to reside in a place where spiritual culture is foremost. That means a transcendentalist does not live in any place simply for engaging in some sense enjoyment. A transcendentalist voluntarily gives up sense enjoyment in order to cultivate spiritual life.

So Vyasa Deva, of course, is perfect because he is the empowered incarnation of the Supreme Lord for compiling all the Vedic literature, and he has appeared for this purpose specifically. He says also an incarnation of the Lord, Shakya Vesha Avatar, so he has no need to practice, but nonetheless, to set an example, he is situated in his ashram, and he is performing meditation in order to fix his mind on the absolute personality of Godhead, the absolute truth, and realize the whole subject matter of the Bhagavad Gita before compiling. Srila Prabhupada further explains, it does not matter whether the place belongs to a householder or a mendicant. Mendicant means somebody who is a renunciant, who is a tapasvi, who is a renounced order of life. The whole varnashrama system is so designed that each and every status of life is called an ashram. Varana ashrama, four varanas: brahmana, kshatriya, vaishya, shudra. This defines the whole system of life. This defines the occupational duty of four different classes of people in the civilized human society. Apart from these four varanas, there are four ashramas. What are the four ashramas? brahmachari ashram, grihastha ashram, vanaprastha ashram, sannyas ashram. These are four stages of gradual progress towards the ultimate goal of self realization while spiritual culture is very prominent.

**Summary:** The speaker delves into the various meanings of the words 'Atmarama,' 'Munayaha,' and 'Nirgrantha,' drawing from Sanskrit dictionaries and scriptures to provide a comprehensive understanding of these terms.

there are so many meanings of the verse that can be derived. So this is a very elaborate shloka: Atmarama, Munayaha, Nirgantha, Api, Cha, Urukrama, Kurvanti. So Lord Chaitanya says, according to the Vishwa Prakasha, Sanskrit dictionary, there are seven synonyms for the word Atmarama. What are the seven synonyms? The first one is Brahman, the Absolute Truth. The second one, Atma refers to body. The third one, mind. The fourth one, atma refers to endeavor. The fifth one, atma refers to endurance. The sixth one, atma refers to intelligence and the seventh one is atma referring to personal habits. Next Lord Chaitanya says the word Munayaha refers to, again there are seven different meanings for the word Munayaha. First is those who are thoughtful. Muni means somebody who's a deep thinker, so those who are thoughtful. Second meaning of the word Munayaha is those who are grave and silent. The third meaning is those who are ascetics. Ascetics means they have taken severe vows and they undergo austerities, penances. The fourth meaning of the word Munayaha is those who are persistent, determined. The fifth meaning is those who are mendicants. Mendicants means beggars. The sixth meaning is those who are sages and the last meaning in this series, the seventh meaning is Munayaha referring to saintly persons or Saints. Then the word Nirgranta, here for the word Nirgranta, there are four meanings given. The first meaning is one who is liberated from nescience. Nescience means ignorance, one who is enlightened spiritually may be called nirgranta. The second meaning is one who has no connection with scriptural injunction. Granta can refer to scriptures, so nirgranta can refer to one who has no connection with scriptural injunctions, that is one who is freed from the obligations of the rules and regulations mentioned in the revealed scriptures like ethics, vedas, philosophy, psychology and metaphysics. In other words, this nirgranta in the second sense refers to fools, illiterate people, archins etc who have no connection with regulated principles. The third meaning of nirgranta is a capitalist and the fourth meaning of nirgranta is one who is penniless, one who is utterly poor.

**Key Quote:** "So this word urukrama specifically indicates the lord's incarnation as Vamana."
**Summary:** The lecture continues by defining 'Urukrama' and relating it to Lord Vishnu's incarnation as Vamana, highlighting the Lord's glorious activities and potencies in creating both the spiritual and material worlds.

Now the dictionary called shabdakosha, the affects me used in the sense of certainty counting building forbiddance and the word grantha is used in the sense of wealth thesis vocabulary etc. So the word nirgranta also is broken up into nirgranta and grantha. The word urukkrama means the one whose activities are glorious. Krama means step, so this word urukrama specifically indicates the lord's incarnation as one whose activities are glorious. Karma means step, so this word urukkrama specifically indicates the lord's incarnation as one who is prime abode with these affections and process go to our forum here is ah bombing descriptor words complying maybe vehicle organization or as Vamana. You would have heard of the name Vamana. The Lord appeared as a small Brahmachari boy and went to Bali Maharaj, asked for three steps of land and then when he actually had to take the measurement, he expanded himself and covered the whole universe by his immeasurable steps. So, it is said here Lord Vishnu is powerful and his activities are so glorious that he has created the spiritual world by his internal potency. He has created the material world by his material potency and by his all-pervading features, he is present everywhere as a supreme truth. And in his personal feature, he is always present in his transcendental abode of Goloka Vrindavana where he displays transcendental pastimes in all variegatedness. Now, Lord Vishnu's activities cannot be compared to anyone else's activities and therefore, the word Urukrama is applicable only to him.

#### Itthambhoota Guna, transcendental bliss, devotional service, Krishna

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is both attractive and very pleasing he is the most sublime abode of transcendental bliss"
**Summary:** The speaker explains 'Itthambhoota Guna' as transcendental bliss, contrasting it with Brahmananda and emphasizing the supreme attractiveness and pleasure derived from realizing and serving Lord Krishna through devotional service (bhakti).

Only to Lord Vishnu and nobody else. Now, there is another term that is used that's called Itthambhoota Guna. The last line of this verse, Itthambhoota Gunoharihi. In that last line, one term Itthambhoota Guna has got different meanings. The word Itthambhoota is transcendentally exalted because it means full of transcendental bliss. Itthambhoota means full of transcendental bliss. Before this transcendental bliss, the bliss derived from merging into existence of the absolute Brahmananda, what is called as Brahmananda, becomes like a piece of straw in comparison. Which means, Brahmananda or the joy of merging into the existence of the Supreme is insignificant in front of the transcendental bliss derived by realization or connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Vishnu. Now, here is a quotation from a scripture. This quotation clarifies this point. What is Brahmananda in comparison with the joy of devotional service? This quotation says, My dear Lord, O Master of the universe, since I have directly seen you, seen whom? seen the personality of God at Krishna, my transcendental bliss has taken the shape of a great ocean. Being situated in that ocean of transcendental bliss, I now realize all other so-called happiness like the water contained in the footprint of a car. It means very very very meager, very insignificant, very very little, all other happiness is very little. Now the special feature of Lord Krishna is that Lord Krishna is so exalted that he is more attractive than anything else and more pleasing than anything else. Krishna is both attractive and very pleasing. He is the most sublime abode of transcendental bliss. Krishna is the reservoir of unlimited transcendental bliss. By his own strength, he causes one to forget all other ecstasies. That is Krishna's special feature. Pure devotional service is so sublime that one can very easily forget the happiness derived from material enjoyment, happiness derived from material liberation and the happiness derived from mystic perfection. Thus the devotee is bound by Krishna's mercy and by Krishna's uncommon power and qualities. This is a result of realizing Krishna, of contacting Krishna, the personality of Godhead, of seeing Krishna, of rendering service to him. Some or the other get in touch with Krishna, the personality of Godhead and that's only possible through bhakti and no other way. But it's explained here even if somebody does not directly take to the process of bhakti, through so many other processes if they are progressive, they will come to the point of bhakti.

**Key Quote:** "So, here Suta Goswami is justifying that even liberated souls are attracted to Krishna because of his wonderful qualities."
**Summary:** Suta Goswami justifies why even liberated souls are attracted to Krishna due to his unlimited good qualities, as explained by Lord Chaitanya to Sanatana Goswami.

Just to refresh your memory, the meaning of that verse: all different varieties of Atmaramas, or those who take pleasure in the Atmarama, the life of the self, especially those engaged in self-realization, though freed from all kinds of material bondage, desire to render unalloyed devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This means the Lord possesses transcendental qualities and therefore can attract everyone, including liberated souls. If you remember, before this, there was a question raised by Saunakarishi to Suta Goswami, why did Sukadev Goswami, the great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, undertake the trouble of going through this vast literature of Bhagavatam from his father Vyasadeva, when he was already a liberated soul? So, here Suta Goswami is justifying that even liberated souls are attracted to Krishna because of his wonderful qualities. He is a reservoir of unlimited good qualities. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur says, and who are the varieties of different transcendentalists who get attracted to Krishna? And even non-transcendentalists get attracted to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna offers himself to his devotees because devotees don't accept anything from Krishna for the service they render to him."
**Summary:** The discussion focuses on Krishna's transcendental qualities, his unlimited nature, and his magnanimity in offering himself to his devotees because they don't seek anything in return.

So, that is described elaborately by Lord Chaitanya to Srila Sanatana Goswami. So, here continuing the description of the different meanings, the word guna means quality. The qualities of Krishna are transcendentally situated and are unlimited in quantity. All of the spiritual qualities are full of transcendental bliss. That is the nature of Krishna's qualities. Krishna's transcendental qualities of opulence, sweetness and mercy are perfect and full. As far as Krishna's affections are concerned, leaning toward his devotees is concerned, he's so magnanimous that he can give himself to his devotees. Why is this said like this here? Because even if Krishna wants to offer anything to his devotees, the pure devotees do not accept anything in return for the service they render to Krishna. So Krishna says, "I have nothing in my possession which I can give you, so I give myself to you." There is such a statement in these scriptures. Krishna offers himself to his devotees because devotees don't accept anything from Krishna for

**Key Quote:** "When the breeze carrying the aroma of Tursi leaves and saffron from the lotus feet of the lotus eyed personality of Godhead entered through the nostrils into the hearts of those sages, the Kumaras, they experienced a change in both body and mind."
**Summary:** Krishna's qualities attract devotees through beauty, mellows, and fragrance, exemplified by the Kumaras being attracted to Krishna by the aroma of Tulsi leaves offered to the Lord.

the service they render to him. Now Krishna has unlimited qualities, ittambhuta gunoharihi, that is being described here. Krishna has unlimited qualities. The devotees are attracted by his uncommon beauty, by his mellows. Mellow means the rasa that is exchanged in transcendental loving service and the fragrance. Thus they are differently situated in different transcendental mellows, devotees situated in different kinds of relationship with Krishna. Therefore Krishna is called all attractive. The name Krishna means, one of the meanings Krishna means, all attractive. He is completely attractive to everyone without exception. Now examples have been given by Lord Chaitanya. The minds of the four boy sages, Kumaras, Sanaka, Sanatana, Sanandana and Sanat Kumara were attracted to the lotus feet of Krishna by the aroma of the Tursi that had been offered to the Lord. Lord Vishnu or Narayana always is worshipped by offering Tursi mixed with Chandan. We call it Charan Tursi. So that is offered to Lord Narayana or Krishna or Vishnu always by the devotees. So the fragrance of that Tursi mixed with Chandan attracted the attention of the people. These are the four liberated sages, Kumaras. So that is explained further. In the Bhagavatam, there is a statement: When the breeze carrying the aroma of Tursi leaves and saffron from the lotus feet of the lotus eyed personality of Godhead entered through the nostrils into the hearts of those sages, the Kumaras, they experienced a change in both body and mind, even though they were attached to the inner world, even though they were attached to the inner world. This was Murabbi's impassional Brahman understanding.

**Key Quote:** "They do not have any attraction for anything material in this world."
**Summary:** The story of the Kumaras entering Vaikuntha, being stopped by Jaya and Vijaya, and subsequently cursing them is narrated.

There is a description in the 15th chapter of Srimad Bhagavatam that once these four Kumaras happened to be wandering without any particular aim because they were liberated sages. They do not have any attraction for anything material in this world. They are not interested in any material enjoyment, material power, material facilities, material opulence, they are not interested in any of those things. They are completely transcendentally situated. So while they were wandering, they happened to enter the Vaikuntha planet. Now how is it that could enter the Vaikuntha planet? Because they're liberated souls. Those who are conditioned, even by dint of yogic power, they cannot go outside the coverings of the universe. A conditioned soul cannot go outside the coverings of the universe. A liberated soul, by the mercy of the Supreme Lord, can even go to the spiritual planet, the Vaikuntha loka. So by chance, without any particular aim, the Kumaras who are wandering everywhere happen to enter the Vaikuntha loka. Now as soon as they entered the Vaikuntha loka, something happened. They were stopped by one of the, by a pair of door keepers, Jaya and Vijaya, who were guarding the doors of the entrance of the Vaikuntha palace of the Supreme Lord. So the Kumaras became very angry at the Vaikuntha loka. They were stopped by one of the, by a pair of door keepers, Jaya and Vijaya. Who were these door keepers? You are not fit to be living here, staying in this place where there is no duality. How come you are wrongly stopping somebody who is eligible to go? Because we have no particular desire or we have no particular attraction or no particular need for any enjoyment and you're stopping us, so you don't deserve to be in Vaikuntha. So the Kumaras cursed these two door keepers and

**Summary:** Lord Narayana pacifies the Kumaras, and they are captivated by his beauty and the aroma of Tulsi, leading them to become devotees.

exactly at the time Lord Narayana arrived at that door to his palace and he wanted to pacify this Kumaras. So the Kumaras, when they saw the beauty of Lord Narayana, they were immediately captivated by that beauty and they fell down prostrate to offer obeisances to the Supreme Lord. Now when they offered obeisances to the Lord's lotus feet, the aroma of the Tursi leaves mixed with chandan entered their nostrils and they experienced a, never before had they had an experience, they never before had. Though they were liberated, they experienced ecstasy both in body and mind by smelling that chandan, Tursi mixed with chandan. That's being described here. Even though they were attached to the impersonal Brahman understanding, that is the only realization they had before this. Now they were elevated to understand the personality courted with his uncommon features. So they became devotees of the Supreme Personality of God after this incident. Next it is described Shukadeva Goswami

#### Shukadeva Goswami, Impersonal Brahman, Pastimes of the Lord, Srimad Bhagavatam

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Although I was fully situated in the transcendental position in impersonal Brahman realization, I was nonetheless attracted to the pastimes of Lord Krishna."
**Summary:** The lecture explains how Shukadeva Goswami, initially situated in impersonal Brahman realization, became attracted to Krishna's pastimes and studied Srimad Bhagavatam.

Swami's mind was carried away by hearing the pastimes of the Lord. So, it is said Shukadeva Goswami also was situated in impersonal understanding of the absolute truth, Brahman realization. But when he heard the pastimes of the Lord from his father Vyasadeva, when Vyasadeva compiled and was revising the Srimad Bhagavatam under the instruction of Narada, that is when Shukadeva Goswami got attracted to the personality of Godhead Krishna. So, Shukadeva Goswami's own words, it is described, Shukadeva Goswami is addressing Pariksit Maharaj, "My dear king, although I was fully situated in the transcendental position in impersonal Brahman realization, I was nonetheless attracted to the pastimes of Lord Krishna. Therefore, I studied Srimad Bhagavatam from my father." Vyasadeva is a statement by Shukadeva Goswami himself. And Suta Goswami also confirms this by offering his respectful obeisances to Shukadeva Goswami. Suta Goswami says, "I offer my respectful obeisances unto Srila Shukadeva Goswami, the son of Vyasadeva, and the destroyer of all sinful reactions. Being full in self-realization and bliss, he had no material desire. Still, he was attracted by the transcendental pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and out of compassion for the people in general. He described the transcendental historical literature called Srimad Bhagavatam." This is compared, this Bhagavatam is compared to the light of the absolute truth. Bhagavatam can enlighten us in the transcendental subject matter of the absolute truth. He described the personality of Godhead, Krishna, and his personal qualities, his personal activities, his personal form, his personal abode, his personal paraphernalia, his personal devotees.

**Key Quote:** "The gopis are completely captivated by the beauty of Krishna's transcendental form."
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by describing how the Gopis, the most beautiful women, are completely captivated by Krishna's beauty and have surrendered themselves to him.

That's what the Bhagavatam is all about. So, this is the way Krishna attracted the four Kumaras. Krishna attracted Shukadeva Goswami. Both of them were situated in impersonal liberation. Next, Lord Chaitanya describes, Lord Sri Krishna attracts the minds of all the gopis in Vrindavan with his beautiful transcendental bodily features. This is a statement by the gopis themselves. They are addressing Krishna, "Dear Krishna, We have simply surrendered ourselves as your maidservants, for we have seen your beautiful face decorated with tresses of hair, your earrings falling upon your cheeks, the nectar of your lips and the beauty of your smile. Indeed because we have been embraced by your arms, which give us courage and seen your chest, which is beautiful and broad, we have surrendered ourselves." The gopis are completely captivated by the beauty of Krishna's transcendental form. Now mind you, Gopis are the most beautiful women in the entire creation. Those Gopis are attracted to Krishna, so no ordinary person, not even any Devata, anybody can attract the Gopis mind. Only Krishna can attract. So that is the speciality of the Gopis, that's how they, they are devotees completely surrendered to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "This means that the Lord possesses transcendental qualities and therefore can attract everyone, including liberated souls."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the Atmarama verse and explains how even liberated souls are attracted to Krishna's transcendental qualities, mentioning examples like the four Kumaras, Shukadev Goswami, and the Gopis.

In this session we will be discussing, continuing the discussion about the Atmarama verse, the 10th verse of the 7th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Just to refresh your memory, the Atmarama verse, which is the famous one, we have been discussing earlier two sessions. This is the third session, I am continuing the discussion on this verse. आत्मा रामाश्यमुनयो निर्ग्रन्था अप्युरुक्रमे कुर्वन्ति अहीतुकिं भक्तिं इत्थं भूत गुणो हरिही. The meaning of this is, all different varieties of Atmaramas, Atmaramas are those who take pleasure in Atma or the spirit self, especially those established on the path of self-realization, though freed from all kinds of material bondage, desire to render unalloyed devotional service unto the personality of Godhead. This means that the Lord possesses transcendental qualities and therefore can attract everyone, including liberated souls. So, we already discussed how different personalities were attracted to Krishna, even though they were situated, some of them were situated in the impersonal liberation. For example, the four Kumaras and Shukadev Goswami. And I also mentioned in the previous session how the Gopis were attracted to Krishna. Now, I am going to talk about the Gopis.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's qualities are so very attractive, because somebody possesses some nice qualities that is attractive, then when we come across such a person, we become attracted to that person."
**Summary:** The speaker continues discussing Krishna's all-attractive nature, quoting Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and highlighting how even the queens of Dwaraka and the goddess of fortune are drawn to Krishna's beauty and qualities.

I am continuing the discussion about the other personalities attracted by Krishna. This is described by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to Sanatana Goswami. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, The queens in Dwaraka, headed by Rukmini, are also attracted to Krishna simply by hearing about his transcendental beauty and qualities. Simply by hearing about his transcendental beauty and qualities. This Atmarama verse is all about Krishna having unlimited transcendental qualities, attributes by which he attracts everyone. That's why he is called all-attractive. Krishna means all-attractive. He attracts everybody without exception. So, here is a statement in the Bhagavatam that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is quoting. O most beautiful Krishna, I have heard about your transcendental qualities from others, and therefore all my bodily miseries are relieved. If someone sees your transcendental beauty, his eyes have attained everything profitable in life. O infallible one, I have become shameless after hearing of your qualities, and I have become attracted to you. So, Krishna's qualities are so very attractive, because somebody possesses some nice qualities that is attractive, then when we come across such a person, we become attracted to that person. That's natural. But here, Krishna's attraction is so very powerful, that nobody else can possess qualities like Krishna to the extent that they may attract somebody more than Krishna. That is not possible. Further, Lord Chaitanya says, Lord Krishna attracts even the mind of the goddess of fortune

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Kalia being subdued by Krishna and the Nagapatnis' prayers, emphasizing the surprising fortune of Kalia to receive the dust of Krishna's lotus feet, a blessing even the goddess of fortune strives for.

simply by vibrating his transcendental flute. There is a statement in the Bhagavatam by the Nagapatnis. O Lord, we do not know how the serpent Kalia attained such an opportunity to be touched by the dust of your lotus feet. Kalia was chastised by Krishna. And because Kalia's wives, the Nagapatnis, were devotees of Krishna, Krishna spared the life of Kalia. Because the Nagapatnis otherwise would have become widowed. So, Krishna, on the request of the Nagapatnis, spared his life. But still, how did he get the dust of the lotus feet of Krishna on his head? What did Krishna do to subdue Kalia? He actually pounded Kalia's hoods. So, in the process, Kalia got the blessings of the dust of the lotus feet of Krishna. So, the Nagapatnis are expressing surprise. He is a very, he has a sinful background. That's how he took the body of a serpent with so much of venom in his body. And unnecessarily such venomous serpents bite others and kill them. Innocent people, innocent creatures. So, it's not a very good birth because of past sinful activities. In spite of that, in spite of possessing such a body, how did Kalia be fortunate enough to get the dust of the lotus feet of Krishna? That is what the Nagapatnis are expressing in their prayers to Krishna. They are telling to get the dust of the lotus feet of Krishna. The goddess of fortune performed austerities for centuries, giving up all of their desires and taking austere vows. Means it's not easy for someone to get the dust of the lotus feet of Krishna on their head. Indeed, we do not know how this serpent Kalia got such an opportunity, which even goddess of fortune, it is difficult to attain. How did Kalia get that? That is the surprise that the Nagapatnis express in their prayers to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "My dear Lord Krishna, where is that woman within the three worlds who would not be captivated by the rhythms of the sweet songs coming from your wonderful flute?"
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Krishna attracts everyone in the three worlds, including young girls, cows, birds, and even trees, highlighting the different relationships people in Vrindavan have with Krishna (motherly, servant, friend, father).

Next, Lord Chaitanya explains, Krishna attracts not only the minds of the gopis and the goddesses of fortune, but the minds of all the young girls in the three worlds as well. How is that? That is another statement in the Bhagavatam. My dear Lord Krishna, where is that woman within the three worlds who would not be captivated by the rhythms of the sweet songs coming from your wonderful flute? Who would not fall down from the past, though chastity in this way. Your beauty is the most sublime within the three worlds. Upon seeing your beauty, even cows, birds, animals and trees in the forest become stunned in jubilation. So, if such creatures like cows and birds can become captivated, what to speak of the girls in the three worlds, the women in the three worlds. So, the women of Vrindavan who are on the level of superior guardians are attracted to Lord Krishna maternally. That means as mother, in a motherly relationship. The men of Vrindavan are attracted as servants, friends and fathers. Mind you, this is the description that everyone is attracted by Krishna. Everyone. Therefore, the term Krishna all attractive applies only to the Supreme Personality of God, Krishna and nobody else. Further, it is described here. The qualities of Krishna captivate and attract everything, living and non-living. Even birds, animals and trees are attracted to Krishna's qualities. This is already mentioned in the previous verse.

#### Hari, inauspiciousness, devotional service, love of Krishna

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "One meaning is that the Lord who is called as Hari takes away all inauspicious things from his devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker begins to explain the meaning of the name 'Hari' in the context of the Atmarama verse, focusing on how Krishna removes inauspiciousness from devotees and steals their minds with ecstatic love.

Now, coming to the word Hari. Although the word Hari has many different meanings, two of them are foremost. In connection with the usage of the word Hari in this verse, ittham bhuta guno hari hi. The Supreme Personality of Godhead who is also called Hari is full of so many nice qualities by which she attracts everyone. This is a reference to the verse in which the word Hari is used. Now, which sense the word Hari is used? One meaning is that the Lord who is called as Hari takes away all inauspicious things from his devotee. Hari means one who takes away, one who steals. So, what does Krishna take away that he is referred to as Hari? He takes away all inauspicious things from his devotees. Isn't it so nice? Of course, this doesn't refer to devotees who are already free from all bad qualities or all inauspiciousness. It refers to devotees who are on the path, just entering the path of pure devotional service and very quickly they become purified by coming in touch with the Supreme Lord Krishna. The second meaning of the word Hari in this context of its usage in this Atmarama verse is that he attracts the mind by ecstatic love for God. He steals away the mind of those devotees who are looking after love of Krishna and by giving them the love, reciprocating them with them in love. He attracts their mind. So, now the name Hari the way it is used in Atmarama verse Chaitanya Mahaprabhu explains When the devotee some or other always remembers the Supreme Personality of Godhead anywhere and everywhere Devotee means he always thinks of Krishna. Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita Devotees who are practiced always think of Krishna. Such devotees what happens? Lord Hari takes away life's four miserable conditions. What are the four miserable conditions?

**Key Quote:** "Krishna says I will protect you from all sinful reactions Do not fear"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on how Krishna, as Hari, takes away the four miserable conditions of life caused by sinful activities, explaining the gradations of sin and quoting the Bhagavad Gita to emphasize Krishna's promise to protect those who surrender, regardless of their past sins, listing illicit sex, intoxication, gambling, and meat-eating as the four basic sinful activities.

of life in this material world? So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport. The four miserable conditions are due to the four kinds of sinful activities known as 1. Pathaka 2. Urupathaka 3. Mahapathaka 4. Atipathaka. What do they mean? Pathaka means preliminary sin and Urupathaka means very great sin and Mahapathaka means greater sin and Atipathaka means the topmost sin. Among sinful activities there are gradations. So, based on the gradations there are four different gradations. Now doesn't matter whether somebody is committing sinful activities which are of lower grade or intermediate grade or very high grade. It doesn't matter. Krishna assures the devotee aham tvam sarva papebhya moksha itshyami mahashu jahan. That means if somebody surrenders to Krishna even if before surrendering he was very very sinful Krishna says I will protect you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear. This is the verse in the Bhagavad Gita aham tvam sarva papebhya moksha itshyami mahashu jahan. Now here Srila Prabhupada particularly explains the word sarva papebhya literally means all sinful reactions. Now here particularly Prabhupada is telling the word sarva papebhya indicates four kinds of sinful activities. Which are the four kinds? The four kinds of sinful activities which are classified as pataka, uru pataka, maha pataka and ati pataka. It doesn't matter how sinful a devotee had been before coming to Krishna consciousness Krishna takes away all the sinful reactions before, rather takes away the sinful reactions all kinds of sinful reactions when the devotee surrenders to Krishna. The four basic sinful activities Prabhupada is reminding us are summarized in the Bhagavad Gita as illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat eating. So Krishna takes away all the sinful reactions. So therefore he is called Hari. I will stop here.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the Atmarama verse and explains how it highlights the greatness of Bhakti and Krishna's ability to attract various types of individuals, even liberated souls, through His transcendental qualities.

In this session, we will continue discussing the same verse, the tenth verse of the seventh chapter of the first canto, Srimad Bhagavatam, the famous Atmarama verse. So today is the fourth part of the meaning of this Atmarama verse as explained by Lord Chaitanya to Srila Sanatana. This verse helps us appreciate the greatness of Bhakti, the process of devotional service. How different varieties of personalities, living beings, some or the other, when they take to devotional service by coming in contact with a pure devotee, by coming in contact with Krishna, by coming in contact with any devotional paraphernalia, they begin devotional service and Krishna attracts them through so many different ways, and that is what is being described here, and they become pure devotees completely dedicated to serving Krishna with love. So the verse is, Atmaramas chamunayo nirgrantha apyurukrame kurvanti ahaitu keem bhaktim ittham bhuta guno hari hi. The meaning of this verse as directly translated, all different varieties of Atmaramas, especially those established from the path of self-realization, though freed from all kinds of material bondage, desire to render self-realization to the service, to the personality of Godhead. This means that the Lord possesses transcendental qualities and therefore can attract everyone including liberated souls.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna says the nature of pure devotional service is such that, even if somebody who begins devotional service is having some contamination in the heart, all that is completely nullified by the fire of devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on how Krishna attracts different individuals and how devotional service purifies the heart, removing sinful activities and contamination.

So in the last three sessions, we had heard the different meanings of the Atmarama verse pertaining to how Krishna attracts by his qualities, even the impersonalists like those situated in impersonal liberation like Shukadev Goswami, like the four Kumaras, Krishna attracts the Gopis, Krishna attracts the Queens of Dwaraka, Krishna attracts all young girls all over the universe, and animals. So nobody is without attraction for Krishna. That's why Krishna, all-attractive, is the suitable, most appropriate name for the Supreme Lord, who is all-attractive to everyone without exception. So continuing the description, the description of the varieties of Atmaramas who become attracted to Krishna and begin to render pure devotional service to Krishna. So here the description is continuing, as all fuel is burnt to ashes by a full-fledged fire, all sinful activities are totally erased when one engages in devotional service to Me. This is a statement from the Bhagavatam 11th canto when Krishna is instructing Uddhava. Krishna says the nature of pure devotional service is such that even if somebody who begins devotional service is having some contamination in the heart, all that is completely nullified by the fire of devotional service.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "When the devotee is freed from all sinful material activities, Krishna attracts his body, mind and senses to perform devotional service to him."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how devotional service removes impediments and ignorance, leading to enlightenment and attraction to Krishna, ultimately causing detachment from the four principles of material success: Dharma, Artha, Karma, and Moksha.

In this way, when all sinful activities are vanquished by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one gradually vanquishes all kinds of impediments on the path of devotional service, as well as the ignorance resulting from these impediments. In the path of Bhakti, these material contaminations are obstacles. Now as one goes on rendering devotional service to Krishna, the heart becomes cleansed automatically without separate endeavour, and impediments are all gone, the obstacles are removed. And when the obstacles are removed, even the ignorance is vanquished. One becomes enlightened from within automatically without separate endeavour. After this, one totally manifests his original love of Godhead through devotional service in nine different ways, hearing, chanting, remembering, etc. When the devotee is freed from all sinful material activities, Krishna attracts his body, mind and senses to perform devotional service to him. See, as long as there is material contamination, we have attraction for so many material things. But when the material contamination is gone, we get attracted to Krishna. And Krishna attracts our total being, our body, our mind, our words, everything completely. Krishna attracts. And thus it is described, Krishna is very, very merciful and his transcendental qualities are very attractive. He is full of so many transcendental qualities. Now further, Lord Chaitanya explains, when one's mind, senses and body are attracted to the transcendental qualities of the Supreme Lord Hari, one gives up the four principles of material success. What are the four principles of material success? Dharma, Artha, Karma, Moksha. Dharma means religious performance. Artha means economic development. Karma means sense gratification. And Moksha means liberation.

**Key Quote:** "Absolute truth is truth in all phases of time, under all circumstances, in all conditions."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the concept of absolute truth (Brahma) and identifies Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the absolute truth that exists in all phases of time.

So, generally people who are pious in this material world, they are interested in four goals of a civilized human being, mentioned in the Shastra: Dharma, Artha, Karma, Moksha. But Bhakti is greater than these four Purusharthas. Bhakti is called the Panchama Purushartha, the fifth goal of a human being, of a living being. So, when a devotee becomes attracted by Krishna and begins to render devotional service, automatically such a devotee loses interest in Dharma, Artha, Karma, Moksha. Those four Purusharthas don't interest the devotee anymore. Completely, the devotee rises above these four Purusharthas. Now, the next set of meanings that Lord Chaitanya explains. The word Brahma indicates the Samambonam, the absolute truth, which is greater than all other truths. In this material world, whatever we know as truth is called relative truth. And Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the absolute truth. What is absolute truth? Absolute truth is truth in all phases of time, under all circumstances, in all conditions. Whereas relative truth is not truth in all phases of time. It is the original identity, Brahma means the original identity, and there can be nothing equal to that absolute truth. So, there is a definition of this absolute truth as Brahma in the Vishnu Purana. It is stated there, I offer my respectful obeisances to the absolute truth, the Samambonam. He is the all-pervasive, all-increasing subject matter for the great yogis. He is changeless, and he is the soul of all, the soul of all souls, the super soul, the supreme soul. Actually, the proper meaning of the word Brahma is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is one without a second, and without whom nothing else exists.

**Key Quote:** "Through all these changes, the changeless reality is Krishna, the Supreme Lord. Only He remains unchanged."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to establish Krishna as the absolute truth, emphasizing His eternality and unchanging nature in contrast to the constantly changing material world and the bodies of living entities.

This is substantiated in so many different parts of the Vedic literature. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is quoting one verse, That absolute truth without a second is Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the Supreme Truth in the past, present and future. That is the evidence of all revealed scriptures. In the Bhagavatam it is stated, Prior to the cosmic creation, only I exist and no phenomena exist, either gross or subtle or primordial. Why do we say Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead? Because Krishna existed as Krishna before the creation even began. Krishna remains through the creation as Krishna. And after the creation, everything is annihilated in this material world. Krishna remains as Krishna. Therefore, Krishna is the Absolute Truth in all phases of time, in all conditions of existence. After creation only, I exist in everything. And after annihilation only, I remain eternally. What about the created beings? Aren't they the same? Aren't they also existing after the creation, through the creation? They exist not in the different bodily forms, not in the different types of material bodies they accept. No. Those are all temporarily given to them according to their desires for enjoyment, according to their karma, according to their association with the gunas, so many things. They keep on changing, changing, changing. Through all these changes, the changeless reality is Krishna, the Supreme Lord. Only He remains unchanged. The living entities are accepting different bodies. Material nature is constantly undergoing change. It is called Shara, constantly changing. And the living entities are simply bewildered by the material influence of the three modes, continuously changing. Whereas Krishna is the unchanging, constant, eternal reality through all these changes

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by defining Atma and Hari as Krishna, and explaining the three paths to attain Krishna: philosophical speculation (jnana), mystic yoga, and devotional service (bhakti), and how the absolute truth is realized differently through each path as Brahman, Paramatma, and Bhagavan.

in the material world. The word Atma indicates the highest truth, Krishna. He is the all-pervasive witness of all and He is the Supreme form. Now the word Brahma indicates the supreme absolute truth and the highest understanding of that truth is Krishna. The word Atma also indicates the highest truth, Krishna, who is all-pervasive witness of everything and He is the Supreme form. And Hari, the word Hari, indicating the personality of Godhead, is the all-pervasive original source of everything. He is therefore the super-soul of everything. Now Chaitanya Mahaprabhu explains there are three ways to attain the lotus feet of the absolute truth, Krishna. There is a process of philosophical speculation, the jnana marga. There is the practice of mystic yoga, that is the ashtanga yoga system. And there is the process of bhakti, the execution of devotional service. Each of these have different characteristics. Now Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says the absolute truth is the same, but according to the process by which one understands Him, He appears in three forms, as Brahman, Paramatman and Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I will stop here. We will discuss more in the next session.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna attracts everyone because he has got unlimited transcendental qualities."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the Atmarama verse and discusses how Krishna's transcendental qualities attract even liberated souls, purifying and enlightening those who engage in devotional service.

In this session, we continue discussing the same verse, the 10th verse of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, the famous Atmarama verse. Suta Vacha Atmaramas Chamunayo Nirgrantha Apyurukrame Kurvanti Ahitu Keem Bhaktim Ittham Bhuta Gunoharihi All different varieties of Atmaramas, especially those established on the path of self-realization, though freed from all kinds of material bondage, render unalloyed devotional service to the personality of Godhead. This means that the Lord possesses transcendental qualities and therefore can attract everyone, including liberated souls. So Krishna attracts everyone because he has got unlimited transcendental qualities. Continuing the discussion from the previous session, in the previous session we heard how Krishna actually purifies anybody who takes to devotional service. So they become free from all sinful reactions, and all their impediments are removed and they are enlightened, and they become attracted to the transcendental form of Krishna, transcendental features of Krishna, transcendental qualities of Krishna, and they become pure devotees, completely dedicated, and they become a creator for Krishna's service.

**Key Quote:** "But through devotional service one realizes Krishna, the personality of Godhead Bhagavan."
**Summary:** The lecture explains the three processes of realizing the Absolute Truth: philosophical speculation (Brahman), mystic yoga (Paramatma), and devotional service (Bhagavan), emphasizing that devotional service leads to the highest realization.

Now, Krishna is realized through three processes, the Absolute Truth. Krishna means the Absolute Truth is realized through three processes: the process of philosophical speculation, the process of performing Ashtanga, you call it a mystic yoga process, and the process of devotional service. So Lord Chaitanya has learned this. So Lord Chaitanya is now explaining, although the words Brahma and Aatma indicate Krishna, their direct meanings refer only to the impersonal Brahma and the super soul respectively. Brahma means impersonal Brahman. Atma means the super-soul in the heart of every living being. So why the distinction is being made now is, because if one follows the path of philosophical speculation, Gyanamarga, the Absolute Truth manifests Himself as impersonal Brahman. That means through the Jnana Marga one cannot realize Krishna simply by following the Jnana Marga. The topmost possible realization of the Absolute Truth through Jnana Marga is only the impersonal Brahman. If one follows the path of Mystic Yoga, Ashtanga Yoga system, he manifests himself as a Supersoul. So through Ashtanga Yoga only the Paramatma can be realized, only the Paramatma. But through devotional service one realizes Krishna, the personality of Godhead Bhagavan. In the Bhagavatam it is explained there are three features: the Absolute Truth, the impersonal Brahman, the localized Paramatma or the Supersoul, and ultimately the personality of Godhead Bhagavan. So among these three features, realization of Bhagavan, the personality of Godhead is the highest realization and that includes the other two realizations of Brahman and Paramatma.

**Key Quote:** "By spontaneous devotional service one attains the original personality of Godhead Krishna and by the Regulative process one attains the expansion of the Supreme personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between spontaneous and regulative devotional service, highlighting that spontaneous devotion in Vrindavan leads to Krishna, while regulative practice leads to expansions of the Supreme Lord.

So now Lord Chaitanya explains there are two kinds of devotional activity: spontaneous and regulative. By spontaneous devotional service one attains the original personality of Godhead Krishna and by the regulative process one attains the expansion of the Supreme personality of Godhead. Krishna is present as Krishna and Krishna is also present in his various forms as Narayana, Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Narasimha, Vamana etc. etc. So many other forms. All are Krishna only, the same Supreme person. But there are still some differences. So Lord Chaitanya says by executing spontaneous devotional service in Vrindavan one attains the original Supreme personality of Godhead Krishna. The nature of devotional service in Vrindavan is that it is spontaneous. Spontaneous means they don't have to follow the rules and regulations. They have somehow attraction for Krishna to a degree that they only think of Krishna all the time. Their heart is completely filled with thoughts of Krishna. Their mind is absorbed in Krishna. They have become mad after Krishna, almost like mad people. They are not mad. They are very intelligent. They are very conscientious. But they are so much absorbed in thought of Krishna. So that is spontaneous devotional service in Vrindavan.

**Key Quote:** "The Supreme personality of Godhead Krishna the son of Mother Yashoda is accessible to those devotees engaged in spontaneous loving service."
**Summary:** The lecture quotes Shukadeva Goswami, emphasizing that Krishna is most accessible through spontaneous loving service, not through mental speculation or austerities.

And Lord Chaitanya quotes a verse from the Bhagavatam. This verse is spoken by Shukadeva Goswami. Shukadeva Goswami tells Pariksit Maharaj after describing one past time of Krishna being bound to Krishna, Krishna being bound by the rope of Mother Yashoda. Krishna submits himself to his devotee Mother Yashoda. So Shukadeva Goswami says the Supreme personality of Godhead Krishna the son of Mother Yashoda is accessible to those devotees engaged in spontaneous loving service, but he is not as easily accessible to mental speculators, to those striving for self-realization by severe austerities, or to those who consider the body the same as the self. So other processes other than spontaneous devotional service cannot help one realize Krishna the Supreme personality of Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "By executing regulative devotional service one becomes an associate of Narayana and attains the Vaikunthalokas, the spiritual planets and the spiritual sky."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that regulative devotional service leads to association with Narayana and attainment of the Vaikuntha planets, while spontaneous devotion is characterized by tears, jubilation, and inherent spiritual qualities.

Now what about regulative devotional service? Regulative devotional service is following the rules and regulations of Bhakti very strictly. By executing regulative devotional service one becomes an associate of Narayana and attains the Vaikunthalokas, the spiritual planets and the spiritual sky. There are two kinds of spiritual planets: One is Goloka Vrindavana, Krishna's personal abode, and the other set of spiritual planets, are the Vaikunthalokas, where the Supreme Lord as Narayana is the predominator, is the Lord of Vaikuntha, Vaikunthapati. Now the explanation further about spontaneous devotional service. Those who discuss the activities of Lord Krishna are on the highest platform of devotional life, and they evince the symptoms of tears in the eyes and bodily jubilation. Very naturally they experience bhava, spiritual emotions. Such persons discharge devotional service to Krishna without practicing the rules and regulations of the mystic yoga system. You see, they possess all spiritual qualities. This is spoken by Brahma, and they are elevated to the spiritual world beyond the material world.

**Key Quote:** "Devotional service, however, is so strong and independent that it can give one all the desired results."
**Summary:** The lecture categorizes devotees based on their desires (desireless, liberation-seeking, materially desiring) and emphasizes that even with ulterior motives, devotional service is powerful enough to grant all desired results.

Now, among devotees, Chaitanya explains, Lord Chaitanya explains, the devotees are divided into three categories: Akama, those who are desireless, means they don't have any material desires. Then there are some who are moksha kama, those who desire liberation, and sarva kama, those who have desire, material perfection. So it is said in the Bhagavatam, one who is actually intelligent, although he may be a devotee free from material desires, a karmi desiring all kinds of material facilities, or a jnani desiring liberation, should seriously engage in bhakti yoga for the satisfaction of supreme peace. That is what the Indian personality has called it. So the meaning of the word udaradhi is buddhiman, intelligent or considerate. Because of this, even for one's own sense gratification, one engages in the devotional service of Lord Krishna. Actually, devotional service is meant for giving us bhakti. Let us say somebody takes to devotional service but their goal is not bhakti. Their goal is some material gain or their goal is liberation. Then what happens? Something very, very interesting happens. The other processes of self-realization cannot yield results unless they are associated with devotional service. Devotional service, however, is so strong and independent that it can give one

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is so kind that when a devotee foolishly desires some material gain, Krishna gives himself to the devotee and he attracts the devotee so very much."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the story of Dhruva Maharaj to illustrate how Krishna, out of kindness, attracts devotees even when they initially desire material gains, ultimately leading them to detachment and pure devotion.

all the desired results. So this is substantiated in the Bhagavad Gita where Krishna says, O best among the Bharatas, Arjuna, four kinds of pious people render devotional service unto me, the distressed, the desirer of wealth, and he who is searching for the knowledge of the Absolute. Now, there is an example of somebody who desires money or wealth and takes to devotional service. Dhruva Maharaj is an example. What happened? He desired to have a kingdom greater than his father's and he was directed by his mother, you worship Vishnu. So he began to worship Vishnu. When merciful Lord Krishna understands that a foolish devotee desires material prosperity, he gratefully gives him shelter of his lotus feet. In this way, he can fend off all his ambitions. That's what happened to Dhruva Maharaj. It is said that Dhruva Maharaj has become a Bhikkhus and has begun to worship Supreme Lord Krishna. That's what happened to Dhruva Maharaj. He began to worship Supreme Lord Vishnu and Vishnu gave him darshan. Now when Vishnu gave darshan, Dhruva thought, I am doing all these austerities to ask from the Lord for what, a kingdom in this material world, that he compared to a piece of broken glass. He is looking for a piece of broken glass, foolishly, by doing devotional service, worshipping Vishnu. But when Vishnu appeared and gave him darshan, then he thought after seeing Vishnu, when I have got diamonds, why will I be interested in a piece of broken glass? So, Dhruva Maharaj told Vishnu, when Vishnu said, yes, what is the boon you want from me? So, Dhruva Maharaj said, when I obtained you, my dear Lord, I am not interested in asking any other benediction from you, I don't want any other benediction. It is like a person who has got diamonds. Why will he be interested? So, Krishna is so kind that when a devotee foolishly desires some material gain, Krishna gives himself to the devotee and he attracts the devotee so very much. The devotee completely forgets or considers the divine insignificant any other material gain that he might have been interested in before he began Bhakti. So this is Krishna's way of attracting a devotee who may not know the real goal of Bhakti but still nevertheless renders devotional service to Krishna even with a desire for some material gain.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses how individuals with pious backgrounds and even those with material motives can gradually purify themselves and attain pure devotional service through the mercy of the Vaishnavas and Krishna.

We continue the discussion. This is a discussion from the previous session on the same verse, Atmarama verse. I will directly go to the other meanings or explanations of the Atmarama verse. It was described in the previous session that four kinds of pious people begin to render devotional service to Krishna because they have a pious background. They are apt to be devoted to Krishna. They are apt to surrender to Krishna. So Lord Chaitanya explains, because they have a pious background, all four types of people are to be considered greatly fortunate. Such people gradually give up material desires and become pure devotees. How does it work? Lord Chaitanya says, one is elevated to the platform of devotional life by the mercy of the Vaishnava, the bona fide spiritual master, and by the special mercy of Krishna. On that platform, one wants to give up all material desires and one gives up the association of unwanted people also. Thus one is elevated to the platform of pure devotional service. Okay. Even though those who begin devotional service with a material motive are considered to be engaged in mixed devotional service, but gradually they give up all material desires, they give up unwanted association and they are elevated to the platform of pure devotional service.

**Key Quote:** "When merciful Lord Krishna understands that a foolish devotee desires material prosperity, he gratefully gives him shelter off his lotus feet."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna, unlike devatas, considers the devotee's ultimate benefit and may not grant material desires if they are detrimental, instead offering shelter at His lotus feet to purify the devotee.

What happens to the platform of pure devotional service? When they come to the platform of pure devotional service, something very wonderful happens. When merciful Lord Krishna understands that a foolish devotee desires material prosperity, he gratefully gives him shelter off his lotus feet. In this way, the Lord covers the devotee's undesirable ambitions. See, another characteristic of Krishna. Whenever Krishna is in a position to fulfill one's desire, he undoubtedly does so, but he does not avoid anything which after being enjoyed will cause one to petition him again and again to fulfill further desires. Sometimes people ask, what is the difference between worshipping a devata for some material benefit and worshipping Krishna for the same material benefit? There is a world of difference. There is a big, big difference. That is what is being said here. If somebody worships a devata for some material benefit, if it is according to scriptural direction he is doing it, then the devata will award the particular benefit without any consideration whether it is good for the person whom he is awarding or not good. Devata will simply award it. That's all. According to, strictly the laws of material nature as stated in the scriptures. Now, when Krishna is worshipped by a devotee, by somebody who wants material benefit, then Krishna considers whether the benediction that he is asking from me, whether it is good for the devotee or not. Krishna has that consideration. If it is not good, Krishna will not award him that particular material benefit. Instead, Krishna purifies that devotee. So, it is said here, when one has other desires other than bhakti, but at the same time such a person engages in Krishna's service, Krishna forcibly gives one shelter at his lotus feet, where one will forget all other desires.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna forcibly gives shelter to such a devotee at his lotus feet. And that will make the devotee forget about all material nonsense, all material benefits."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of asking for poison, the speaker contrasts Krishna's protective kindness with the devatas' willingness to grant material desires, which ultimately lead to further entanglement in the material world.

See, this is Krishna's special mercy. Krishna is so very kind. I am foolishly going and asking Krishna, give me some poison. Actually, what should I be asking from Krishna? Nectar. But I do not know. Poison is actually not good for me. I think poison is something very nice. I am mistaken. Poison is like nectar. So, Krishna, will he simply give poison because you are asking for poison? No, never. What about devatas? You go and ask devata some poison. Will devata give? Yeah, he will give. He never refuses. When you are within the, you are following the scriptural injunctions and it is given the shastras, this devata can avoid this material benefit, some other devata can avoid some other material benefit. These material benefits are simply entangling the person more and more and more. The very cause of all our miseries is material existence, entanglement in material existence. And foolish people, what do they do? They think that if we worship some devata and gets more material benefit, oh, we can become free from all problems. What they don't realize is material benefits are of the nature that they further entangle you to make you suffer more and more and more and more material miseries. Neither the devatas will refuse you some material benefit that you may ask if you follow all the rules, nor you yourself can realize that I am becoming more and more entangled. I am not getting free from this entanglement. I am not able to put an end to my miseries in this material world. Whereas, when somebody worships Krishna and goes and asks for some material benefit, Krishna will forcibly give shelter to such a devotee at his lotus feet, and that will make the devotee forget about all material nonsense, all material benefits. Forget about it. And he becomes... What happens?

**Key Quote:** "Such a devotee actually becomes elevated to Krishna Consciousness and he will only want Bhakti and nothing else."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that by worshipping Krishna and receiving shelter at His lotus feet, a devotee forgets material desires and becomes elevated to Krishna Consciousness, desiring only bhakti. He then introduces the concept of Gyanam Arga and two kinds of worshippers.

Such a devotee actually becomes elevated to Krishna Consciousness and he will only want Bhakti and nothing else. The nectar, nectar of devotion. Bhakti, Rasa, Amrita. Now, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu begins to explain that those who are following the Gyanam Arga, if they come in contact with a pure devotee or some or the other take to devotional, pure devotional service, then they give up their desire for liberation, they give up their desire for any material gain, and they simply become interested in pure devotional service. So, Lord Chaitanya explains, there are two kinds of worshippers on the path of philosophical speculation. One is called a Brahma Upasaka, a worshipper of the impersonal Brahman, and the other is called Moksha Kamshi or one who desires liberation. Two kinds of people on the Gyanam Arga.

**Key Quote:** "When one actually begins devotional service, even for the sake of attaining some Brahman realization, still, one in devotional service is attracted away from the impersonal Brahman."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the three types of worshippers of the impersonal Brahman and explains that even those who begin devotional service with the aim of Brahman realization are ultimately drawn away from it and awarded a transcendental body to serve Krishna directly.

Two kinds of worshippers. Now, among the worshippers of the impersonal Brahman, there are three types of people: the beginner, the one whose thoughts are absorbed in Brahman, and the one who has actually attained liberation by merging into impersonal Brahman. So, three kinds of people who are worshippers of impersonal Brahman. Now, without a tinge of devotional service, simply by following the path of philosophical speculation, one cannot attain the Brahman platform. One cannot be elevated to transcendence, not possible. So, when one actually begins devotional service, even for the sake of attaining some Brahman realization, still, one in devotional service is attracted away from the impersonal Brahman. Such a person is awarded a transcendental body to engage in Lord Krishna's service directly. See what happens with devotional service. When a devotee gets a spiritual body, he can remember the transcendental qualities of Krishna simply by being attracted to Krishna's transcendental qualities. Ittham bhuta guno hari. Krishna is full of transcendental qualities. Any one quality the devotee gets attracted, he becomes a pure devotee engaged directly in devotional service to Krishna. He starts off as an impersonalist worshipping the impersonal Brahman, but then to attain success in that worship, he has to mix some devotional service. So, when he begins to do some devotional service, then all these things happen. He is taken away from the goal of impersonal Brahman and is awarded a spiritual body. In spiritual body, he becomes aware of Krishna's transcendental qualities and gets attracted and becomes a pure devotee directly engaged in Krishna's service.

**Key Quote:** "Even a liberated soul merged in the impersonal Brahman is attracted to the pastimes of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes a statement that even liberated souls are attracted to Krishna's pastimes and emphasizes the importance of hearing about Krishna from pure devotees to experience a revolution in the heart.

So, there is a quotation that supports this particular explanation by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. This quotation is that even a liberated soul merged in the impersonal Brahman is attracted to the pastimes of Krishna. He thus installs a Deity and renders the Lord devotional service. See, the situation of being merged in the impersonal Brahman is very very dull, very unattractive after the initial excitement that is there in the beginning. So, then such a person, it is said, if he is fortunate to hear about the pastimes of Krishna from a pure devotee, then he becomes attracted to the pastimes of Krishna. Krishna's pastimes are supremely attractive to everyone, but one has to hear that from the right source. Then the attraction is very very much powerful and one becomes a pure devotee. Then what about those engaged in mystic yoga practice? The example is given of the Navayogendras. From their very births, the nine great mystic yogis, Navayogendras, were impersonal philosophers of the absolute truth. They knew the absolute truth only as impersonal Brahman. They did not know about the personality of God. But because they heard about Lord Krishna's qualities from Lord Brahma, Lord Shiva and the great sage Narada, all the three are great devotees. Brahma is a great devotee, Shiva is a great devotee, Narada is a great devotee. So, these Navayogendras, they heard about Krishna's qualities from these three great devotees. They also became Krishna's devotees. See, association with devotees in which they hear about Krishna's transcendental qualities. Anything one hears about Krishna from the pure devotees is going to bring about a revolution in the heart.

**Key Quote:** "These Navayogendras, when they heard about Krishna's transcendental qualities from Brahma, Shiva and Narada, even though they were situated in understanding of the Vedic knowledge, understanding of the impersonal Brahman from Vedas, they became attracted to Krishna"
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of the Navayogendras, who were initially impersonal philosophers, to illustrate how hearing about Krishna's qualities from great devotees like Brahma, Shiva, and Narada led them to become devotees of Krishna and seek His association.

So, that is being explained here. In the 11th canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, there is a full chapter, there is a full description of the devotional service of the nine yogendras, Navayogendras, who rendered devotional service because they were attracted by the Lord's transcendental qualities. These Navayogendras, when they heard about Krishna's transcendental qualities from Brahma, Shiva and Narada, even though they were situated in understanding of the Vedic knowledge, understanding of the impersonal Brahman from Vedas, they became attracted to Krishna and they wanted to enter Dwaraka. In this way, they finally ended up in the place known as Rangakshetra, Sri Rangam. They ended up that place. So, I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Among the transcendentalists, there are three different categories of transcendentalists according to the process of transcendental realization they may accept."
**Summary:** Lord Chaitanya explains the Atmarama verse and categorizes transcendentalists based on their chosen path: Jnana Marga, Ashtanga Yoga, and Bhakti Yoga.

We are continuing to describe the Atmarama words as explained by Lord Chaitanya to Srila Sanatan Goswami. This Atmarama word says that all different varieties of Atmarama, all different varieties of self-satisfied personalities, even though they are freed from material bondage, they engage in pure devotional service to Krishna because Krishna is full of transcendental qualities which are very, very attractive. Among the transcendentalists, there are three different categories of transcendentalists according to the process of transcendental realization they may accept. So this was mentioned in the previous session. Those who follow the Jnana Marga, the path of philosophical speculation, they are actually one category of transcendentalists, who desire liberation by merging into the impersonal Brahman. Then the second category of transcendentalists are those who follow the path of mystic yoga, Ashtanga yoga, meditation, and they desire to realize the absolute truth as Paramatma, because they meditate on the form of the Lord, Paramatma in the heart. And the third category of transcendentalists are the devotees, or those who follow bhakti yoga, devotional service, and they directly engage in devotional service to Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Bhagavan feature of the absolute truth.

**Key Quote:** "Because without a devotional service, one cannot get liberation ultimately."
**Summary:** Lord Chaitanya describes how even those desiring liberation engage in devotional service to Krishna, and how association with devotees can lead one to give up the desire for impersonal liberation.

So now Lord Chaitanya is describing the first category of transcendentalists, those who wish to merge into the impersonal, are also divided into three further subcategories: Those desiring to be liberated, those who are already liberated, and those who have realized Brahman. Now Lord Chaitanya further says, there are many people within this material world who desire liberation, and for this purpose, they render devotional service to Krishna. Why is it that those who desire liberation render devotional service to Krishna? Because without devotional service, one cannot get liberation ultimately. So in the Bhagavatam it is explained, those who want to be relieved from the reality, who want to be relieved from the clutches of the material energy, they give up worship of the various devatas, demigods. These demigods have fearful bodily features, ghorarupam, such peaceful devotees who are not envious of the demigods, worship the different forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana. Again it is said, there may be some people who are attached to demigod worship, but if such people associate fortunately with the devotees of the Supreme Lord, then their dormant devotional service and appreciation of the Lord's qualities gradually awakens within their hearts. In this way, they also engage in Krishna's devotional service and give up their desire for liberation and also give up the desire to merge into the existence of the impersonal Brahman. So the association of devotees is a very, very powerful factor for people to understand

the greatness of bhakti. Now the association of devotees is particularly praised in many scriptures. One such scriptural quotation is cited by Lord Chaitanya. This scriptural quotation says, Although there are many faults in this material world, there is one good opportunity. What is that? The association with devotees. Such association brings about great happiness. Due to this good quality, our strong desire to achieve liberation by merging into the Brahman effulgence has become weakened. What happens is somebody has got a desire to attain liberation by merging into the impersonal Brahman, but they associate with devotees and experience in devotional association a different quality of spiritual happiness due to devotional service. Then they give up this desire for liberation because that happiness of devotional service is so much greater and so much a satisfaction and so much nicer that automatically they lose interest in liberation. Now here is another example given by Lord Chaitanya. By associating with the great saint Narada, Saunaka and other great sages gave up the desire for liberation and engaged in Krishna's devotional service. This Saunaka Rishi, was the leader of some great sages who assembled in a holy place called Naimisharanya in order to engage in a thousand year sacrifice. Now in the beginning, their aim was liberation. But after association with the great saint Narada, who was himself a great devotee, these Saunaka Rishis, they gave up the desire for liberation

and became engaged in Krishna's devotional service. Another instance is being mentioned by Lord Chaitanya here. Simply by meeting Krishna or receiving Krishna's special favour, one can give up the desire for liberation. How does that happen? Being attracted by the transcendental qualities of Krishna, one can engage in Krishna's service. Krishna's service should not be mistaken to be something like service rendered to another person in this material world. In material world, service means it is something not so very desirable, but is something which is unavoidable. Just like people render service to get some money, to get some material benefit, to get some favour, to learn something new. So, so many different reasons in this material world, people are engaged in service of another person. But serving Krishna is never to be mistaken like service rendered to another person in the material world. Krishna's service is something which is very, very pleasing to the heart. It is natural. It is due to the strong attraction by Krishna's transcendental qualities which are innumerable. And therefore, Krishna is able to attract different categories of persons who may have attraction for different transcendental qualities of Krishna.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "I have wasted so much time trying to become self-realized through impersonal cultivation."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the experience of someone visiting Dwaraka Dham and being overwhelmed by Krishna's bliss, realizing the futility of impersonal Brahman realization and its inherent difficulties.

This is an instance of somebody who happened to visit Dwaraka Dham, where Krishna was ruling as the king of Dwaraka, Dwaraka Disha. So this personality is describing his experience. In this Dwaraka Dham, I am being attracted by the supreme personality of God, Krishna, who is personified spiritual bliss. See, Krishna is no ordinary person. Krishna is the Supreme Lord who is full of transcendental bliss, spiritual bliss, ānanda-maya. The Vedanta Sutra says, ānanda-mayo abhyāsāt. Krishna is full of ānanda. And simply by seeing Krishna, one can feel that great happiness which is characteristic of Krishna's personality. Simply by seeing him. It's so pleasing to the senses, to the mind, to the heart, seeing Krishna. Then this devotee, this personality who is feeling great happiness by simply seeing Krishna in Dwaraka Dham, he began to think, I have wasted so much time trying to become self-realized through impersonal cultivation. Before one comes to know what is the real nature of Krishna's personality, one may be engaged in Brahman realization, impersonal Brahman realization. But that is so tedious. In the 12th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains, kleśo adhikatarasteśāṁ avyaktāsaktaśetasām. Avyaktā is the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth, the impersonal Brahman. And those who are not having knowledge of Krishna, they engage in such a... meditation or worship or cultivation of knowledge of impersonal Brahman. And that is very, very tedious. kleśo adhikatarasteśāṁ avyaktāsaktaśetasām It is very, very tedious. It is filled with so many difficulties. So therefore this personality in Dwaraka Dham, after just seeing Krishna's beautiful, pleasing, form, transcendental form, became so much filled with happiness, that thought, why was I wasting time trying to become self-realized through impersonal Brahman method?

So like this, different varieties of personalities, even though they may be engaged in self-realization, through other methods than bhakti, they somehow or the other, by contact with a pure devotee, by contacting Krishna, by associating with devotees, by mercy of Krishna, so many different ways, they become attracted to Krishna and they naturally engage in Krishna's service, to reach the perfection of devotion.

**Key Quote:** "Even though somebody may be liberated by some other process other than devotional service, they cannot sustain themselves in liberation without engaging in devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the concept of Atmaramas and explains that even those liberated through other processes cannot sustain liberation without devotional service due to the soul's inherent need for activity, which finds its perfect expression in service to Krishna.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet In this session also, we will continue the discussion of the Atmarama verse. Different varieties of Atmaramas, they get attracted to Krishna, they begin to render devotional service, and they achieve the perfection of devotional service. Now, the important point here is that even though somebody may be liberated by some other process other than devotional service, they cannot sustain themselves in liberation without engaging in devotional service. The nature of the soul is to be always active. The soul cannot be without activity. Though somebody may try to be inactive for some time, very soon that person who is inactive is forced to begin activity. So, the explanation is given here by Lord Chaitanya: those who are liberated by devotional service become more and more attracted by the transcendental qualities of Krishna and engage in his service. Bhakti means devotional service. Prabhupāda did not translate bhakti as devotion. He translates bhakti as devotional service, indicating that bhakti means activity, but not ordinary activity, not material activity. It is completely spiritual activity. What kind of spiritual activity is it? It is service to Kṛṣṇa, serving Kṛṣṇa, and that is

not the same as material service rendered to some material person in this world, no. Now, Lord Caitanya is telling, those who are liberated by the speculative process, philosophical speculation, jñānāmārtha, eventually fall down again due to offensive activities like Sne properties. Now there is a statement in the Srimad Bhagavatam which says this, how those who are not engaged in devotional service of Krishna, even though they are liberated, they fall down. They don't sustain their existence on the liberated platform. So what is that statement in the Bhagavatam? O Lotus-eyed one, this is a prayer offered by the Devatas to Krishna when he was in the womb of Mother Devaki, and the Devatas were offering wonderful prayers to Krishna in the womb of Devaki, Garbhastuti, it's called, 10th canto, 2nd chapter. So there it is said by the Devatas, O Lotus-eyed one, they are addressing the Supreme Lord Krishna. Those who think they are liberated in this life but are without devotional service to you are of impure intelligence. Although they accept severe austerities and penances and rise to the spiritual position, to impersonal Brahman realization, they fall down again because they neglect to worship your lotus feet. There has to be some engagement after liberation. If there is no engagement after liberation, due to inactivity, one becomes very much disturbed in the mind. And eventually, such a person, without taking shelter of Krishna's lotus feet, cannot engage in the spiritual process. This is the statement in the Bhagavatam. One cannot engage in spiritual activity. So what does the person do?

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful...In that state, he attains pure devotional service unto me."
**Summary:** The speaker references the Bhagavad Gita to describe the position of someone on the Brahman platform, explaining that such a person experiences joyfulness and freedom from lamentation, ultimately attaining pure devotional service to Krishna.

The person will come down to material activity and that's called a fall down. Now, in the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna explains what is the position of a person who is transcendentally situated on the Brahman platform. What is the actual position? Krishna says, One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. Brahma bhuta prasamna atma He never laments or desires to have anything. He is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state, he attains pure devotional service unto me. This is a progressive transcendentalist who comes to the Brahman platform and then is able to experience freedom from lamentation and hankering and is able to see with spiritual vision equality of law and living beings even though they may be situated in different bodies. They are ultimately spiritual beings. Such a person, such a person becomes completely joyful and realizes the Supreme Brahman. Brahman realization may also mean that I am of the same quality as the Absolute Truth. I am also Brahman. Aham Brahmasmi. But when one is factually situated on the transcendental platform through gradual elevation through spiritual processes, when one actually comes to the transcendental platform, one is able to realize the Supreme Brahman distinctly, the Lord different from the individual soul, the Supreme Personality of God. And in that state one attains pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord. One becomes a devotee.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "We are originally Krishna conscious beings...Material existence means fear."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses attaining one's constitutional position as a Krishna conscious being through devotional service, leading to a transcendental body and liberation from material bondage, contrasting this with the fear inherent in material existence under the influence of maya.

And what happens? One who has attained his constitutional position by strength of devotional service, what is his constitutional position? We are originally Krishna conscious beings. So that is called our constitutional position. And by strength of devotional service one is able to attain a transcendental body even in this lifetime. Jeevan Mukta. Liberated from material bondage and attains a transcendental form. What is a transcendental form? That is actually our original spiritual form which is actually covered presently by this material body and mind, material mind. So by elevating to the spiritual platform through devotional service one attains a transcendental body. And being attracted by Lord Krishna's transcendental qualities one fully engages in service at his lotus feet. Krishna's lotus feet is the ultimate shelter for everyone. Krishna accommodates everybody. But to aim at the lotus feet of Krishna is possible only by engaging properly in devotional service to Krishna. Then further Bhagavatam explains the position of a person in this material world who opposes Krishna consciousness, due to this material influence one becomes conditioned and fearful due to the influence of maya. Material existence means influence of maya, the material energy. And that influence is such that one becomes fearful. Material existence means fear. Bhayam. It is a concomitant factor of material existence. That means in the material existence under the influence of maya one cannot avoid fear.

**Key Quote:** "Indeed there is no other way to get factual liberation from maya other than executing faithfully bhakti yoga devotional service to Krishna...those who have surrendered unto me...They can easily cross beyond the influence of this material energy."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that liberation from maya is only possible through devotional service to Krishna, quoting the Bhagavad Gita to illustrate that surrendering to Krishna allows one to overcome the influence of material energy.

People sometimes they say I am fearless. I am bold. But that is all under the illusion that I am safe or I am powerful. I am happy. I have got good protection against all dangers etc. But all these are a temporary position. It is a temporary position because maya is constantly changing. Adibhutam charo bhavah. And in this changing situation suddenly some material calamity, natural calamity may afflict a person who is otherwise thinking I am very safe. Or suddenly some enemy may attack. Suddenly something may happen which can change our situation. A person has a heart attack and completely becomes fearful. Now what is to be done? So by executing devotional service faithfully one is liberated from maya. Indeed there is no other way to get factual liberation from maya other than executing faithfully bhakti yoga, devotional service to Krishna. Krishna also says in the Bhagavad Gita in the seventh chapter fourteenth verse he says this divine energy of mind consisting of the three material modes of nature, three guna sarto guna, rajo guna, tamo guna, they are the components of the influence of the material energy called maya which influences us in such a way that we cannot overcome the material influence by our own strength, by our own endeavor, not possible. daivi he sha gunamayi mamamaya duratyaya But Krishna also says those who have surrendered unto me mam eva ye prapadyante maya metam tarantite They can easily cross beyond the influence of this material energy.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Liberation is possible only by devotional service...devotional service unto the Supreme Lord is the only auspicious path...Real liberation is taking shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna and being fixed in devotional service to him."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that true liberation is only attainable through devotional service to Krishna, contrasting it with the fruitless endeavors of speculative knowledge and emphasizing the importance of taking shelter of Krishna's lotus feet.

So the conclusion of all these statements is that one cannot attain liberation without rendering devotional service. Liberation is possible only by devotional service. Technically somebody may think I am liberated by merging into impersonal Brahman or technically somebody may think I am liberated by meditating on Paramatma but factual liberation, real liberation, complete liberation, perfect liberation is possible only by becoming fixed up in devotional service. So there is a statement like that in the Bhagavatam also which says devotional service unto the Supreme Lord is the only auspicious path. If one gives it up simply for speculative knowledge or the understanding that these living beings are spirit souls and the material world is false then such a person undergoes a great deal of trouble. He only gains troublesome and inauspicious actions. His actions are like beating a husk that is already devoid of grain. His labor becomes fruitless. This is a statement by Lord Brahma when he offers prayers to the Supreme Lord Krishna. Somebody may think this material world is false. We have nothing to do with this material world and engages in cultivation of knowledge through spirit. We engage in cultivation of knowledge through speculation. And through this method they may think I have become liberated because I have realized I am Brahman and I have merged myself into the existence of Brahman as the Absolute Truth. So such people they are actually simply undergoing so much of difficulty due to severe austerities. They do not get real liberation by such a process. Real liberation is described in that term, taking shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna and being fixed in devotional service to him. That is real liberation. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** Narada Muni encounters a cruel hunter, Mrigari, and begins to instruct him on the consequences of his actions, specifically the unnecessary pain he inflicts on animals.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udhirayet. In this session also we will continue discussion of the Atmarama verse. Lord Chaitanya tells a very nice story of how a hunter, cruel hunter, a very, very uncivilized person, how he became a great devotee by the association of Srila Narada Muni, the greatest devotee of the Lord. Once upon a time, the great saint Narada, after visiting Lord Narayana in the Vaikuntha, went to Prayag. Prayag is that holy place, Allahabad, where there is a sangam, a confluence of three rivers, Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati. And it's a very, very holy place. And he saw a deer which was lying on the path through the forest, and this deer was pierced with an arrow. It had broken legs, and it was crying out of pain. That arrow had pierced its body, and it was crying out of pain. He went a little ahead and saw another boar which was pierced. It was pierced by a similar arrow. Its legs were also broken. It was also crying out in pain. And further he went, saw a rabbit also, same way it was suffering. With the arrow pierced, legs are broken, it is crying in pain. So Narada Muni, he was pained to see at heart. All these living. All these living beings are suffering so much. Then he saw a hunter hiding behind one tree. He was having so many arrows. And he was ready to kill more animals. This hunter was having a black complexion, a dark complexion. He had reddish eyes. And he appeared very, very fierce. He was like the superintendent of death. He was like the superintendent of death. Yamarath standing there with bow and arrows in his hands to kill so many more animals. Now Narada Muni, he left the path which was there in the forest. And he went to the hunter who was hiding behind a tree to kill more animals. And as soon as Narada Muni approached the hunter, so many animals, they started running away. The hunter, he wanted to chastise Narada Muni with abusive language, that you spoiled my whole arrangement for killing animals. But when Narada Muni came closer to the hunter, due to Narada Muni's divine association or divine presence, that hunter restrained his tongue and did not abuse Narada Muni. He said, oh great saintly person, why are you leaving the general path and you are approaching me in this forest? Simply by seeing you, all the animals I was hunting have now run away. You have disturbed my occupation. So Narada Muni replied to this hunter, I have come to you to clear one doubt that is there in my mind. So Narada Muni asked that hunter, those animals which are half killed, three animals I saw. I saw a deer, I saw a boar, I saw a rabbit. Were you the one who actually shot those arrows and half killed those animals? The hunter replied, yes. Narada Muni inquired from this hunter, why are you not killing those animals completely? You are half killing them by piercing one arrow which does not fully kill them. Why are you doing like this? Then the hunter replied to Narada Muni, my name is Mrigari. Mrigari means I am the enemy of the animals. My father taught me how to kill in this way, half kill animals by piercing one arrow. And this hunter is telling Narada, when I see animals suffer due to pain, then I become very happy. So Narada Muni told this hunter, can I beg from you one thing? The hunter said, yes. What do you want? You want the skin of some animals, tiger skin, deer skin, I can give you. Narada Muni said, no, no, no. I do not want any skin from you. I want to request you that kindly don't half kill animals. You kill them completely, fully kill them. Don't half kill animals. So the hunter asked, what's the difference between half killing and fully killing the animals? So Narada Muni replied that when you half kill the animals, they suffer so much more pain than if you were to fully kill the animals. See, as a hunter, your business is to kill animals. Now that's an offense on your part, killing animals. But if you unnecessarily give them so much more pain by half killing them, you incur very great sin. So this is Narada Muni's divine influence on the hunter.

So then the hunter began to inquire further. So in what way is this greater sin? So Narada Muni said, these animals who are half killed by you, when they are getting unnecessary pain because you have not fully killed them, in your next life, they will kill you and give you so much suffering that is waiting for you. So by the association of Narada Muni, this hunter became convinced, yes, yes, what I am doing is very, very wrong. I have to suffer so much. I've killed so many animals and given them so much pain. So he became afraid. Then he said, you see, I have been taught this killing business from my childhood. Now I have accumulated so much of sin. How am I going to become free from these sinful reactions? See, this is the advantage of holy association, association with a pure devotee. One becomes purified and one becomes enlightened. And this hunter is inquiring, how can I become free from sinful reactions? So Narada Muni said, if you are interested, I will find a way how you can become liberated. But before that, will you do what I say? Hunter said, yes, yes. Narada Muni said, throw away this bow, break it and throw it away. Then I will tell you what next you should do. So the hunter said, if I break my bow, how will I maintain myself? I have no other means of subsistence. So Narada Muni said, don't worry. I will supply you food every day. You don't worry about food, how you are going to get food. You throw that, break that bow and throw it away.

**Key Quote:** "Then you should daily circumambulate tulsi by offering water and you should chant the Hare Krishna mantra continuously."
**Summary:** The hunter follows Narada Muni's instructions, renouncing his possessions, building a cottage, planting a Tulasi plant, and chanting Hare Krishna, leading to his transformation and recognition by the villagers.

So then Narada Muni's assurance, the hunter actually broke his bow and threw it away. Then Narada Muni said that you return home. You distribute whatever riches or wealth you have to brahmanas, to saintly persons. And then you and your wife should leave home taking only some minimum clothes to wear. That's all. Then you go to the river and there you construct a small cottage and grow one tulsi plant in the bank of the river. Then you should daily circumambulate tulsi by offering water and you should chant the Hare Krishna mantra continuously. I will send you sufficient food every day and you take as much as you want. There is no restriction I am imposing. Then after that, Narada Muni, he went to those three animals, pulled out the arrow that was struck in their body and then with his gentle touch, he actually nicely massaged the wounded portion and the animals immediately got up, felt relief and ran away from the place. Then the hunter was impressed. Oh, Narada Muni saved those three animals which were half dead, half killed. So he was understruck. This saintly person is an extraordinary saint. So he paid his respects to Narada Muni, bowed down and went home. Then after going home, Narada Muni of course left that place and went away. Then this hunter exactly followed the instructions of Narada Muni and news spread in the surrounding villages that this hunter, cruel hunter has become a great Vaishnava. He is sitting in front of a tulsi plant, he is chanting holy name and he is watering the tulsi and he has given up this business of killing animals.

**Summary:** Narada Muni and Parvata Muni visit the former hunter, now a devotee, and witness his compassion towards even the smallest creatures, demonstrating the transformative power of devotional service and association with devotees.

So, so many people started coming to see him. They would bring some grains, some fruits, some edibles like that. Then this hunter, former hunter turned devotee, he was wonderstruck. Narada Muni is sending so much for me. And he would, with his wife, he would chant, he would accept little food and he would go on chanting, as instructed by Narada Muni. Then a year passed and Narada Muni was with another saint, Parvata Muni. So Narada, while travelling with Parvata Muni, he said, when he came in the vicinity of Prayag, he said, let us visit one former hunter's place and let me see what he is doing. I instructed him to stop killing animals and chant Hare Krishna. Let us see what he is doing. So as they started approaching the hut, the cottage of that former hunter turned devotee, they could see the hunter is approaching them. And as he was approaching them, he was carefully examining the ground. And what was he doing? There were so many ants which were running here and there on the path. So he took his cloth and gently, you know, moved the ants away from his path so that he will not stamp on the ants and kill them. So seeing this, Parvata Muni was astonished. Then Narada Muni said, My dear hunter, such behavior is not at all astonishing. A man in devotional service is automatically decorated with all good qualities, including non-violence. So then, the hunter received these two saintly persons in a small cottage. He spread out a straw mat for them to sit. And with great devotion, he offered them some water. He washed their feet. And then he drank that water which had washed the feet of these two saintly persons, Narada Muni and Parvata Muni. Then he began to dance, chanting Hare Krishna. Narada Muni realized that this hunter has, former hunter has followed his instructions and become a first class devotee because of chanting Hare Krishna and worshiping Tulasi, and giving up this business of killing animals. So this is an instance of an uncivilized hunter but associated with Narada becoming a great devotee. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the rare birth of a liberated soul like Shukadeva Goswami, explaining that Vyasadeva impressed upon the child the synopsis of Bhagavatam so that the child could be made attached to the transcendental activities of the lord.

Even within the womb of his mother, such a birth is very, very rare. Generally, we take birth because we are forced by the laws of nature to take birth in order to square up our karmic reactions from the previous life or previous lives. But a liberated soul does not have any reaction. So there are higher purposes for which such liberated souls appear in the world. Srila Vyasa Deva knew that the child after his birth would not stay at home. Vyasa Deva is a Trikalanya. He knows past, present and future. So he knew the future. He did not stick with the future. He did not seek the present or future. His very deliverance is an papa and the future of this child was that he would not stay at home. As soon as he would be born, he would just leave home and go away. Therefore, Vyasa Deva impressed upon the child the synopsis of the Bhagavatam so that the child could be made attached to the transcendental activities of the Lord, especially describing the personality of goddess activities, qualities, forms, names, paraphernalia.

who appeared as the son of yasa as a liberated soul, the child was still more educating in the subject of the Bhagavatam by recitation of the actual poems, the actual verses of the Bhagavatam. The idea is that, why is Prabhupada telling this, quoting from the Brahma Vaivarta Purana? The idea is that generally the liberated souls are attached to the feature of impersonal Brahman with a monastic view of becoming one with the Supreme Whole. This is the impersonal Brahman understanding. The aim of such impersonalists is that they want liberation by merging their self into the Supreme Whole as impersonal Brahman. But by the association of pure devotees like Vyasa Deva, even the liberated soul becomes attracted to the transcendental qualities of the Lord. This is what was elaborately discussed in the previous verse, the 10th verse, the Atmarama verse. By the mercy of

And by the mercy of Vyasa Deva, Srila Shukadeva Goswami was able to narrate the epic of Srimad Bhagavatam. And by the mercy of Vyasa Deva, Srila Shukadeva Goswami was able to narrate the epic of Srimad Bhagavatam. The transcendental qualities of the Lord are so attractive that Srila Shukadeva Goswami became detached from being completely absorbed in impersonal Brahman and positively took up the personal activity of the Lord. This we have elaborately discussed in the previous verse. The transcendental qualities of the Lord. The transcendental qualities of the Lord are millions and billions of times more attractive than the features of the impersonal Brahman. The impersonal Brahman understanding is in neutral stage. Lowest is the material conception, where one thinks in terms of material enjoyment, material pleasure, material gain, material paraphernalia, material existence, material pleasures, that is sense gratification, etc. Material enjoyment in upper planets. But none of these are free from the material miseries, fundamental miseries, janma, mrityu, jara, vyadi, dukkha, dopa, etc.

**Key Quote:** "After one comes to know of the personal feature, you will think, why was I wasting time with this impersonal feature?"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth as a neutral stage and explains that realizing the personal feature of the Lord brings more transcendental bliss.

So, above the material conception is the impersonal conception of the absolute truth. And that is the neutral stage where one is free from the material miseries, or material concept of life. But one has not yet perfected the realization of the Absolute Truth to the highest degree. So, if somebody mistakes the Absolute Truth to be only impersonal Brahman, then they cultivate that knowledge and they somehow try to seek satisfaction of realization of the impersonal feature. There is no variety, spiritual variety is lacking. There is no material inebriety or material defect in this realization of the Absolute Truth as impersonal Brahman. But there is no spiritual variety, spiritual variety. So, Srila Prabhupada says, practically he was thrown from the impersonal conception of the Absolute, thinking within himself that he had simply wasted so much time in devoting himself to the impersonal feature of the Supreme. After one comes to know of the personal feature, you will think, why was I wasting time with this impersonal feature? Why do they feel like that? Because he realized more transcendental bliss with the personal feature.

Srila Rupa Goswami says that the happiness derived by merging into the impersonal Brahman, the feature of the Absolute, if the happiness of that merging can be compared to an ocean, then that transcendental bliss derived from realizing the personal feature is billions and trillions of times greater than the personal feature. Billions of times more. I'm sorry, it's the other way round. If the transcendental bliss derived from the personal feature, understanding or realizing the personal feature is compared to an ocean, then the transcendental bliss of merging into the impersonal Brahman is billions and trillions of times greater than the impersonal, not even equal to one drop, it is much, much less than that, very insignificant.

The devotees are always absorbed in thought or remembrance or discussion, either hearing or describing in association with other devotees who similarly relish the personal feature. So therefore, such devotees who relish the personal feature, they don't very much like the impersonalists, and impersonalists who desire to become one with the supreme are unable to evaluate the devotees of the Lord. The impersonalists think these devotees of Krishna, they are sentimentalists because the impersonalists want to eliminate all material variety.

superhuman devotees discuss, "Oh, Krishna, he was crawling on his knees in the yard of Nanda Maharaj and Nanda Maharaj was absorbed in fondling this child." So they think, what have we got to do with some child and some father fondling the child? They think this is all material description. What they don't realize is Krishna as a supreme personality of Godhead, even when he takes birth in this material world, it is transcendental. Janma Karma Chame Divyam. It is not like the birth of ordinary living entities, conditioned souls. It's not like that. Nanda Maharaj, when he appears in this world to participate in Krishna's pastimes, he is totally liberated soul. He's not a conditioned soul. He has no attraction for any material dealings. He has absolutely no attraction for material dealings. Neither Krishna is interested in any material dealings. So Nanda Maharaj's attraction for Krishna is completely transcendental. That is what Srila Prabhupada is telling here. The impersonalists are unable to evaluate the devotees of the Lord. Thus from time immemorial, these two categories of transcendental pilgrims have sometimes been competitors. They like to keep themselves separate from each other because ultimately impersonal and personal realizations don't go together. So, Shukadeva Goswami, he became attracted to devotees after realizing the personal feature and naturally he would keep away from the

See, Suta Goswami began telling the sage Sunaimishanya in the third chapter. After answering their initial six questions, Suta Goswami started telling them, "I see that you are very eager to hear about Krishna. So, best is that I narrate the Srimad Bhagavatam because Bhagavatam is Krishna Katha." Therefore, Suta Goswami said, here he is telling, "I shall begin transcendental narration of the Lord Shri Krishna," and how will he begin such a narration of Krishna Katha by narrating topics of the birth activities and deliverance of King Pariksit, the Raja Rishi, as well as topics of the renunciation of the worldly order by the sons of Pandu. By the Pandavas' renunciation, what is the connection between Pandavas renouncing this world and Krishna Katha? And again, what is the connection between Pariksit's birth activities and deliverance with Krishna Katha?

Only without Krishna, all the supplementary literatures like the Puranas and Mahabharata are simply stories or historical facts, but with Krishna, in connection with Krishna, they become transcendental. The same historical narrations which are in relationship with Krishna become transcendental narrations, and without this Krishna, they are all material facts, material histories, that's all. When we hear the activities of the devotees of Krishna in relationship with Krishna, we at once become transcendental, related with Krishna, immediately the connection, spiritual connection, is established. So, Srimad Bhagavatam is also a Purana. Purana means that which contains a very ancient history. But the special significance of this Purana, Bhagavata Purana, is that the activities of the Lord are central and not just supplementary historical facts.

Birth, activities of Parikshit Maharaj, this is not material description because the central topic is the activities of Krishna. Everything is centered around the activities of Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker addresses the common misconception of skipping to the 10th canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, emphasizing the importance of understanding the preceding cantos as they are all spiritually significant and centered around Krishna.

they are simply material. Now, here is an important point Prabhupada is stressing: "There is a class of less intelligent devotees of Bhagavata Purana who desire to relish at once the activities of the Lord narrated in the 10th canto without first understanding the primary cantos." See, Bhagavatam is presented by Vyasa Deva systematically in 12 cantos. 12 cantos, 1st canto, 2nd canto, 3rd canto. We are in the 1st canto now. Like this, there are 12 cantos. Each canto is very big. Each canto contains several chapters. Each chapter contains several verses. And each verses got so much of depth. We just went through the Atmarama verse. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu gave 61 meanings of the Atmarama verse. Of course, I didn't describe all the 61 meanings, but I described some of them. Like that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu points out there is so much depth in the Srimad Bhagavatam. This is the spotless Purana because it contains narrations of the activities of Krishna which are central to everything discussed in the Srimad Bhagavatam. So, it's not that the 10th canto which specifically describes Krishna's appearance and activities as the original personality of God alone is important. No. Every single canto of Bhagavatam, beginning from the 1st canto, is having spiritual description.

**Key Quote:** "Devotees are never without Krishna. And Krishna is never without devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that all cantos of the Srimad Bhagavatam are equally important and that devotees are always connected to Krishna.

So, Srila Prabhupada clarifies, these people who jump to the 10th canto without reading or hearing or studying the first 9 cantos, they are under the false impression that the other cantos are not concerned with Krishna. That's what these foolish people think. And thus, more foolishly than intelligently, they take to the reading of the 10th canto. They directly jump to the 10th canto. They say, "We have nothing to do with Pandavas and Parikshit and Prithu Maharaj and Pracheya. All that we are not interested. We are only interested in Krishna, Krishna Leela." But actually, these readers are specifically told herein that the other cantos of the Bhagavatam are as important as the 10th canto. That's why, what does Suta Goswami tell the sages in this verse? Suta Goswami says, I am going to narrate the history of the birth, the activities, and deliverance of King Parikshit, as well as the topics of renunciation of the Pandavas. Now, what has that got to do with Krishna Katha? That is what exactly we have to do. We have to understand that devotees are never without Krishna, and Krishna is never without devotees. Neither does Krishna perform activities alone, nor do devotees perform any activity alone without Krishna. So, devotees are always situated in Krishna consciousness, and Krishna is always doing everything in relationship to Krishna. And Krishna is always involved in joint devotion to...

So, Sridhar Prabhupada concludes by telling, Krishna and his pure devotees like the Pandavas are on the same plane, spiritual platform, pure devotional platform. Krishna is not without his devotees. Of all the rasas, Krishna is described as akhila rasamruta sindhu. He is full of varieties of rasas and his ocean of all rasas, and the pure devotees like Pandavas are not without Krishna. They are never without Krishna. So, the devotees and the Lord are interlinked, and they can never be separated, never. Therefore, talks about them all are Krishna Katha, talks about the devotees, talks about Krishna in relationship with the devotees, or talks about the devotees in relationship with Krishna, everything is Krishna Katha.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verses from Srimad Bhagavatam describing the aftermath of the Kurukshetra war, focusing on Duryodhana's death and Ashwatthama's sinful act of killing Draupadi's sons.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Jai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tatho Jaya Mudireyate In this session, we'll be discussing from the 13th and the 14th verses of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Sriman Bhagavatam. Yadam Hrithay Kauravasranjaya Nam Veereshu Atho Veeragatim Gateshu Prakodara Aavidha Gadabimarsha Bhaknor Dande Dhritarashtra Putre Bhartupriyam Draunil Itismapashyan Krishna Sutanaam Swapataam Shri Ramasih Upaharat Vipriyam Evatasya Jugup Siddham Karma Vigarha Yanti Two verses are given together. The meaning of these two verses is also given together by Srila Prabhupada. When the respective warriors of both camps, namely the Kauravas and the Pandavas, were killed on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, and the dead warriors obtained their deserved destinations, and when the son of Dhritarashtra fell down, left behind, and died in the battle, lamenting, his spine broken, being beaten by the club of Bhimasena, the son of Dronacharya Ashwathama, beheaded the five sleeping sons of Draupadi and delivered them as a prize to his master, foolishly thinking that he would be pleased. Duryodhana, however, disapproved of the heinous act, and he was not pleased.

**Key Quote:** "Both these battles are significant because in both the battles, the Supreme Lord is personally present"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the significance of the Kurukshetra and Ramayana battles, highlighting the presence and roles of Lord Krishna and Lord Ramachandra, emphasizing Kurukshetra as a Dharma Yudha.

In the least. So Suta Goswami begins the narration of the Sriman Bhagavatam, beginning with the topics of the renouncement of the Pandavas and the birth activities and deliverance of King Pariksha. So first of all, he is beginning from the point where the end of the Battle of Kurukshetra, that famous battle. In our history of Greater India, there are two famous battles. One is the battle of the Ramayana between Lord Ramachandra and Ravana. And the other is the battle between the Pandavas and Kauravas as described in the Mahabharata. Both these battles are significant because in both the battles, the Supreme Lord is personally present, though in the battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna was not fighting, but his presence is significant. And in the battle of Ramayana, Lord Ramachandra is directly engaged in the battle, playing the role of a Kshatriya. Of course, Krishna was also playing the role of a Kshatriya on the battle when he was present on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. But because he wanted the battle to be a little bit more peaceful, he wanted the battle to go on in a fair manner, nobody could match the strength and the Kshatriya abilities of Krishna because Krishna is a supreme personality.

**Key Quote:** "And those who died seeing Krishna on the battlefield, they attained their Svarupa, their original constitutional position in the spiritual world."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the benefits of dying in a Dharma Yudha, explaining that warriors attain heavenly planets and those who see Krishna attain their original spiritual form.

But here, the description is that Krishna, the fighting was going on for 18 days and whoever was killed on the battlefield, in this battle of Kurukshetra, the dead warriors obtained their deserved destinations. We should always remember this is a Dharma Yudha. It is a battle fought according to religious principles. So in such a Dharma Yudha, whoever dies fighting, a Kshatriya who dies fighting in this battle, whichever party they belong to, it doesn't matter. They will at least be promoted to heavenly planets. Guaranteed elevation in their status in life. And those who died seeing Krishna on the battlefield, they attained their Svarupa, their original constitutional position in the spiritual world. They were directly promoted to the spiritual world. This is what Srila Prabhupada explains in a discourse given on these two verses. So a Dharma Yudha is not at all bad. In fact, it is spiritually beneficial for everyone. And that is exactly what Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita also. While Arjuna at the beginning of the battle of Kurukshetra refuses to fight, Krishna tells him this is a Dharma Yudha and you are a Kshatriya. It is your duty to fight in this Dharma Yudha. Either you die on the battlefield while fighting and you attain minimum the heavenly planets or you enjoy a flourishing kingdom if you win this battle. In either case, there is no loss for Arjuna, for the partners. So here it is described. The warriors who were killed on the battlefield of Kurukshetra attained their deserved destinations. Minimum is promotion to heavenly planets. And others who were fortunate enough to die while dying, they were able to see Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They got their Svarupa.

#### Duryodhana, Bhima, Krishna's Intervention, Dharma, God Conscious Ruler

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's intervention is not partiality on his part. Krishna has got a transcendental objective."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the fight between Duryodhana and Bhima, Krishna's intervention, and the reasons behind Krishna wanting the Pandavas to win, emphasizing the need for a God-conscious ruler.

And in the end, there was a fight between Duryodhana and Bhimasena. So they were fighting with a club in the hand. One on one they were fighting. And Krishna was there present to guide Bhima. Krishna was there to guide Bhima, that this Duryodhana, it's not easy to defeat him or Bhima. It is said that though both were expert in fighting with the club, still Bhima had more bodily strength as compared to Duryodhana. And Duryodhana had better skill in fighting with the club. So actually the fighting would have gone on for many many days, a very long time, had it not been for the intervention of Krishna. We should always remember Krishna's intervention is not partiality on his part. He is not partial to the part of us. Krishna has got a transcendental objective. Krishna wants this battle of Kurukshetra for some very important reasons. One is that the burden of the earth had to be brought down, reduced. And the second reason is that Krishna wants a God conscious Kshatriya, like Yudhishthira to rule the whole world, because the purpose of Kshatriya, because the purpose of this material creation, is that people are guided towards ultimate liberation from material bondage. And a king like Yudhishthira who is Krishna conscious, he is the perfect ruler to guide the citizens towards spiritual emancipation.

#### Bhima, Duryodhana, Unlawful Killing, Duryodhana's Disapproval

**Key Quote:** "Duryodhana however was not at all pleased. Because it is totally unlawful."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the narrative, detailing how Bhima defeated Duryodhana by striking below the waist, and how Ashwatthama's killing of Draupadi's sons was disapproved by Duryodhana.

So Krishna wanted the Pandavas to win this battle. And it was not easy to defeat, for Bhima to defeat Duryodhana. But still when Krishna advised or indicated to Bhima that you have to actually use your club to beat Duryodhana below the waist. Now beating below the waist is against the rules of Kshatriya conduct in Dharma Yudha. But still because Krishna indicated to Bhima, Bhima did that, and Duryodhana fell down when he was hit below the waist, and his spine was broken. And after that of course Duryodhana died. At that time when he had just fallen down due to that fighting, the son of Dronacharya, Ashwatthama, he in order to please Duryodhana, Ashwatthama was fighting on the side of the Kauravas, so he beheaded the sleeping sons of Draupadi. Draupadi had five husbands, the five Pandavas. So she had one son through each of the Pandavas, and she had five sons. So all of them were killed totally unlawfully by Ashwatthama. And he brought those five heads to prove that he has killed them, and he delivered them to Duryodhana. Duryodhana however was not at all pleased because it is totally unlawful, and he disapproved of the sinuous act. That is what this verse describes. He was not at all pleased by this. He condemned Ashwatthama for unlawfully killing the five sons of Draupadi.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by explaining that the narration of Bhagavatam begins where the Bhagavad Gita ends, highlighting the connection to Krishna consciousness and preparing for further verses.

Now this is where the Bhagavatam begins. Narration of Bhagavatam begins. We already have Krishna's instructions to Arjuna, and to Arjuna and to all of us, the Krishna Katha in the form of Bhagavad Gita before the beginning of the battle of Kurukshetra. And the Krishna Katha given in the form of Bhagavatam is beginning from the end of the battle of Kurukshetra. So we will hear the narration of the Bhagavatam, how it is connected to Krishna consciousness, in the further verses. I will stop here.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of the lecture, focusing on Draupadi's grief after the death of her sons and Arjuna's attempt to console her.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 15th and the 16th verses of the 7th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. First, the 15th verse: Mata Shishunam Nidhanam Sutanam Nishamya Ghoram Paritapyamana Tadarudad Vashpakala Kulakshi Tam Santwayan Ah Kiritam Mali. The meaning of these words: Draupadi, the mother of the five children of the Pandavas, after hearing of the massacre of her sons, began to cry in distress with eyes full of tears. Trying to pacify her in her great loss, Arjuna spoke to her thus. So, in these words, Arjuna is referred to as Kiritamali.

**Key Quote:** "When I present you with the head of that Brahmana After beheading him with arrows from my Gandiva bow I shall then wipe the tears from your eyes and pacify you"
**Summary:** The speaker explains Arjuna's vow to Draupadi to avenge the death of her sons by killing Ashwatthama.

And Arjuna is trying to pacify Draupadi. It's natural for the mother who has lost all her five children, not while they were fighting in the battle, but when they were unlawfully killed when they were sleeping. It is totally against Kshatriya conduct. So naturally a mother will feel very much, too much discharge due to the loss of her all five sons. And what Arjuna spoke to Draupadi to pacify her is there in the next, the 16th verse: Tadashuchaste Pramarjami Bhadre Yatكرam Am Comedy밧시 Yad Brahma Bandho Shira Atatayinaha Gandiva Muktair Vishikhair Upahare Thvakramya Yatsnasya Siddhagdha Putra. The meaning of this 16th verse: O gentle lady, here is Arjuna pacifying Draupadi, O gentle lady, when I present you with the head of that Brahmana, after beheading him with arrows from my Gandiva bow, I shall then wipe the tears from your eyes and pacify you. Then, after burning your son's bodies, you can take your bath standing on his head.

**Key Quote:** "That means he's not a Brahmana. He is not qualified as a Brahmana. He doesn't have the qualification of a Brahmana. He is called Brahma Bandhu"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the term 'Brahma Bandhu' and its application to Ashwatthama, emphasizing that birth in a Brahmana family does not automatically qualify one as a true Brahmana.

So these are the words spoken by Arjuna to pacify Draupadi, that Arjuna. He understands that Ashwathama is the son of his teacher Dronacharya. So the consideration that he is the son of his teacher, that consideration is lost when he has behaved in a very wrong way. And Arjuna is specifically referring to Ashwathama, the son of Dronacharya, as Brahma Bandho. That means he's not a Brahmana. He is not qualified as a Brahmana. He doesn't have the qualification of a Brahmana. He is called Brahma Bandhu. These terms are used in the Vedic literature, Dvija Bandhu or Brahma Bandhu. Brahma Bandhu is one who has taken birth in a Brahmana family from a Brahmana father, but he himself does not qualify as a Brahmana, so such a person is called a Brahma Bandhu, or anyone being born in a family of Brahmana, Chhatri, or Vaishya called Dvija, they all have a second birth, but they don't qualify to themselves come to the status of Dvija, so such a person is referred to as Dvija Bandhu. In this case, Dronacharya was a Brahmana, his son Ashwathama behaved not like a Brahmana.

**Summary:** The speaker defines an aggressor (attatayinah) according to scriptures, citing Srila Prabhupada's purport, and states that such an aggressor deserves punishment.

So he is called a Brahma Bandhu, and he is also, he is an aggressor. So that is explained in the purport by Shri La Prabhupada: an enemy who sets fire to the house, one who administers poison, one who attacks all of a sudden with deadly weapons, plunders wealth, or usurps agricultural fields, or entices one's wife is called an aggressor. He is called an attatayinah, an aggressor. Such an aggressor, though he be a Brahmana or a so called son of a Brahmana, has to be punished in all circumstances. Punishment is due to such a aggressor, attatayinah.

**Key Quote:** "Even if somebody is enemy Kshatriya code of conduct is Kshatriya should invite challenge the enemy and they should have a fight in a proper place according to the code of conduct for Kshatriyas"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Arjuna's dilemma in the Bhagavad Gita and the Kshatriya code of conduct, emphasizing that even in enmity, certain actions like setting fire to a house are unjustifiable.

In the Bhagavad Gita also, this reference is made by Arjuna. In the Bhagavad Gita also, this reference is made by Arjuna that even if somebody like Bhishma and Drona may attack me, I don't want to retaliate because they are worthy of my respect, even though they are aggressors, I don't want to retaliate. This is Arjuna's position as described in the first chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. Similarly here, Arjuna is referring to the son of Dronacharya, Aswathama, as Brahma Bandhu and as attatayinah. He is an aggressor and he is not qualified Brahmana. So such an aggressor, who is called an aggressor, now here, different different situations under which somebody may be called an aggressor: an enemy who sets fire to the house. Even if somebody is enemy, Kshatriya code of conduct is Kshatriya should invite, challenge the enemy and they should have a fight in a proper place according to the code of conduct for Kshatriyas. So even if there is some enmity, that doesn't justify setting fire to the house of the enemy, you know, because in that house the other family members are also staying, so they don't deserve to be killed or they don't deserve to be harmed in any way.

**Key Quote:** "Such aggressors according to Shastra have to be punished and there is no sin involved in giving them punishment"
**Summary:** The speaker continues to define different types of aggression and reiterates that punishing aggressors according to the scriptures is not sinful.

That is very important consideration. So how can a Kshatriya who knows the principle set fire to somebody else's house? He becomes immediately an aggressor if he does this, or somebody who administers poison. Enemy is killed in a proper battle, not killed by other methods, administering poison like this, beheading the children who are sleeping so that they don't have an opportunity to defend themselves. So that is not at all acceptable. Administering poison, beheading somebody who is sleeping, this is not acceptable, or somebody who attacks all of a sudden with deadly weapons, that means immediate death, somebody attacks, that is also unlawful, completely unlawful and such a person is an aggressor. One who plunders wealth, there is no provision in Kshatriya code of conduct for taking away forcibly the enemy's wealth, no, they cannot, or enticing one's wife, the enemy's wife, he cannot entice, that is completely wrong for a Kshatriya, it is completely wrong. So such aggressors according to Shastra have to be punished and there is no sin involved in giving them punishment.

**Key Quote:** "There is no question of sin in killing such a Brahmana son who proved to be a villain. This Ashwatthama proves to be totally unqualified for being shown any mercy"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Arjuna was aware of Ashwatthama's Brahmana lineage but still vowed to punish him for his heinous act, comparing Ashwatthama's actions to that of a butcher.

Hmm, when Arjuna promised to behead the aggressor named Ashwatthama, he knew well that Ashwatthama was the son of a Brahmana. It is not that Arjuna was not conscious that Ashwatthama was the son of a Brahmana, he was very much aware, but then he told Draupadi, I am going to cut off the head of this Ashwatthama because that is what he did to the five sons of Draupadi when they were asleep, he cut off their heads. Now here Arjuna is directly going to challenge Ashwatthama and take action against him. Hmm, so Arjuna knows very well Ashwatthama was the son of a Brahmana, still he is promising Draupadi I am going to cut off his head. Hmm, now Prabhupada says here the so called Brahmana acted like a butcher, like butcher kills some innocent animal, the animal cannot even defend itself. Hmm, so similarly this Ashwatthama has killed those five sleeping sons of Draupadi like a butcher only cutting off the head. Hmm, there is no question of sin in killing such a Brahmana son who proved to be a villain. This Ashwatthama proves to be totally unqualified for being shown any mercy.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by highlighting the significance of the discussion in the Bhagavatam and reiterates the principle that even a Brahmana deserves punishment for misbehavior, emphasizing the importance of conduct over birth.

Hmm, so this instance that is described here in the Bhagavatam, in the beginning of the Bhagavatam, the narration begins, Suta Goswami is narrating the history, it is very significant and this discussion will be held in great detail about, is it proper for Arjuna to kill Dronacharya's son, what kind of punishment does he deserve under the circumstances and what are all the different considerations for either punishing him or for excusing him and not giving him certain punishment, so many considerations and all those will be systematically presented by Vyasa Deva, the author of this Bhagavatam very nicely, but in general the principle is even if somebody is a Brahmana, if he misbehaves then he deserves to be punished in accordance with the kind of violation he has done. Hmm, so that is always a important consideration in spite of the person being a son of a Brahmana or being a Brahmana himself. Brahmana has to be very very careful how he conducts himself, so I will stop here.

**Key Quote:** "Arjuna, who is guided by the infallible Lord as friend and driver thus satisfied the dear lady by such statements Arjuna satisfied Draupadi then he dressed in armor and armed himself with furious weapons and getting into his chariot he set out to follow Ashwatthama the son of his martial teacher"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of the verses, focusing on Arjuna's pursuit of Ashwatthama and Krishna's role as an infallible guide, explaining the meaning of 'Achyutaa'.

In this session, we will be discussing the 17th and 18th verses of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. From this chapter, the narration of the Bhagavatam by Suta Goswami begins, and the particular incident that is being discussed in this chapter is the son of Drona punished, Ashwatthama is being punished because he beheaded the sleeping sons of Draupadi, the slave of Drona. So the 17th verse: Iti-priyaam Valgvi chitra jal payi Sasaantva itva chut緊 mithra Soottha Anvaadyravat damshita ugradhanva Kapitvajo guru putram ratvena. The meaning of this verse is: Arjuna, who is guided by the infallible Lord as friend and driver, thus satisfied the dear lady by such statements. Arjuna satisfied Draupadi, then he dressed in armor and armed himself with furious weapons, and getting into his chariot, he set out to follow Ashwatthama, the son of his martial teacher. So Ashwatthama had been rejected even by Duryodhana. Duryodhana did not appreciate this unlawful act of Ashwatthama, and Ashwatthama was actually conscious that his life is in danger, so he had gone away somewhere. So Arjuna, who was having Krishna as his friend and driver, here Krishna is described as Achyutaa, infallible Lord. What is the meaning of infallible? He never falls down from his transcendental position.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of 'falling down' from a spiritual platform and contrasts it with the unwavering transcendental position of the Supreme Lord and his devotees.

unless he is in deep trance state. Like we, the living entities who desire to enjoy materially, we give up that spiritual platform on which we are eternally situated in our relationship with Krishna. We give up that and we come to the material platform, so this is called a fall, a fall down, whereas the Supreme Lord and his pure devotees, they never fall down. Even though they come to the material world, they are always transcendentally situated, whether in the material world or in the spiritual world, or any situation, any time, any place, they are always transiently situated. So Arjuna was guided by the infallible Lord, the Supreme Lord, who is never subject to any deterioration.

**Summary:** The speaker continues the narrative, describing Ashwatthama's fear and flight from Arjuna, drawing a comparison to Brahma fleeing from Shiva.

He, Arjuna, satisfied Draupadi by making significant statements. Now, in order to punish Ashwathama, Arjuna has dressed himself in armor and armed himself with furious weapons, and he got into his chariot, he set out to follow Ashwathama. The 18th verse: The meaning of this verse is: Ashwathama, the murderer of the princess, seeing from a great distance Arjuna coming at him with great speed, fled in his chariot panic-stricken just to save his life as Brahma fled in fear from Shiva. So Arjuna is trying to capture Ashwathama to punish him, but Ashwathama, on seeing that Arjuna is coming to capture him, Ashwathama is himself going in his chariot running away from Arjuna just to save his life.

Ashwathama running away in fear. The comparison is made just as Brahma ran away in fear of Lord Shiva. Now Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport that the word Kaha that is used in the last line of this 18th verse. Now here the word Kaha refers to Brahma. Or if it is read as Yathar Kaha, then Arkaha refers to Surya or the sun god. So both those meanings are taken and explained by Prabhupada. According to the reading matter, either Kaha or Arkaha, there are two references in the Puranas. The Acharyas never speculate. They always refer the Shastra and clarify such matters. So there is a reference for Kaha, and there is also a reference for Arkaha. Arkaha refers to the sun god, and Kaha refers to Brahma. So it is said with respect to Kaha being used in this verse, Kaha means Brahma, who once became elude by his daughter and became a woman and began to follow her. This infuriated Shiva, who attacked Brahma with his trident. Brahma fled in fear of his life. This is described in the Puranas elsewhere, that once Brahma became elude by his own daughter. That is the power of the illusory energy, that such an exalted personality as Brahma, even he became illusioned by the sight of his beautiful daughter. He started following her in order to enjoy with her. So that act of Brahma infuriated Shiva. Shiva became very angry. Shiva is also appearing as the son of Brahma, so he became very angry at Brahma. He became very angry at Brahma, his own father, in terms of the birth Shiva has taken. But he became angry at Brahma and he went to attack Brahma with his trident. Shiva carries one instrument called Trishur. With that he attacks those who are unlawful, those who are unnecessarily giving trouble to saintly persons. So they deserve to be punished. So Shiva became angry against Brahma for the act of Brahma running behind his daughter and Shiva decided to punish this

**Summary:** The speaker provides an alternative interpretation of the verse, referencing the story of the sun god and the demon Vidyunmali from the Vaman Purana, again highlighting Shiva's anger.

person. Brahma began to run away from Shiva fearing his life. Another reference is Arkaha. Arkaha refers to the sun god. So there is a reference to this in the Vaman Purana. Srila Prabhupada quotes from Vaman Purana. There was a demon by the name Vidyunmali who was gifted with a glowing golden airplane which traveled to the back of the sun. So there is this Vidyunmali who is a demon and he received a gift and that gift was a glowing golden airplane. So Vidyunmali decided to utilize this glowing golden airplane by traveling to the back of the sun and night disappeared because of the glowing effulgence of this plane, aeroplane. Aeroplane was very brilliantly shining. So because of that shining of the aeroplane there was no night. So Shiva saw then what happened, sun god, he became angry against this Vidyunmali that you are disturbing the arrangement of day and night. So what did the sun god do? With his rays he melted the plane in which Vidyunmali was traveling. Now Shiva observed this. He became very very angry against sun god. Then Shiva attacked the sun god and sun god in order to escape from his abode. He became very very angry against the sun god and he wore aூbhi one day. Shiva he ran away and fell at Kashi or Varanasi. And the fame and the place became famous as Lolarka. So these type of descriptions are given in the puranas but we have to hear and understand the import of such descriptions with reference to the context in the world, which gives us a lot of information in the world. For example this description of the planet house. In the short description of the sun god has mentioned that the sun god is famous for his Original form.

**Summary:** The speaker connects the stories to the present context, emphasizing the natural instinct to save oneself and the importance of taking shelter of Krishna for true protection.

This description of the sun god is known only as the sun god who was in God in ancient times. There is another description that says in this scripture, to the context in which it is described. Now in this situation, how Ashwatthama is running away from Arjuna, therefore these comparisons are being made. When life is in danger, they'll do anything to save themselves or save their life. That's natural for any human being, but in the course of escaping, whether they really be able to save their life, that is not assured or that's not guaranteed. Of course, the Bhagavatam advises everyone, take shelter of Krishna. Even Bhagavad Gita also advises, take shelter of Krishna. Once somebody takes shelter of Krishna, then they need not fear anyone or anything else, any other danger. No, but it's not easy to approach Krishna. Only pure devotees can approach Krishna, and others have to engage in some confidential service to the Supreme Lord Krishna by which Krishna is attracted to the devotee, otherwise approaching Krishna is not

And so this sort of incidents help us understand that material world elsewhere proper explains every step there is danger and the safest place for us is the spiritual world, the spiritual platform in which there is no danger, there is no difficulty, there is no death, there is no material influence like that.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Ashwathama using the Brahmastra, explaining the context of Arjuna chasing him and Ashwathama's desperation.

Yadasharanam Atmana Aikshata Shranthavajinam Astram Bramma Shiro Mene Atma Tranam Vij atom Jaha. The meaning of this verse is: When the son of the Brahmana Ashwathama saw that his horses were tired, he considered that there was no alternative for protection outside of his using the ultimate weapon, the Brahmastra, or the nuclear weapon. So Arjuna, from the previous few verses, Arjuna when he heard that Draupadi's five sleeping sons were beheaded by Ashwathama, Arjuna pacified Draupadi and told her that, "I am going to punish him and in that way I will actually pacify you." So Arjuna armed himself and he started on his chariot to chase this Ashwathama. Ashwathama saw that Arjuna is coming very, very close and he was going away on his horse, so on his horses, I mean on his chariot which was drawn by horses, now the horses became tired and they would not move any further. Then Ashwathama thought that his life is in danger now, so he considered using the ultimate weapon, the Brahmastra, for

**Summary:** The speaker explains that being a Brahmana is not hereditary but based on qualification, and Ashwathama is referred to as the son of a Brahmana because he lacks the necessary qualities.

like a nuclear weapon. The word vij RT from Bridgeana to Brahmastra allashti in Indian language is equal to three words. So that is the basic time to beforded by dharmayani. Atmajah is significant here because Ashwathama, although the son of Dronacharya, was not exactly a qualified Brahmana. Dvija means Brahmana. Atmajah means the son. So son of the Brahmana. He is not referred to directly as a Brahmana, but he is, Ashwathama is referred to as the son of a Brahmana. Srila Prabhupada explains why is this so? The most intelligent man is called a Brahmana, and it is not a hereditary title. It's not a hereditary title. That means the son of a Brahmana does not automatically become a Brahmana. No. He has to qualify. Ashwathama was also formerly called the Brahmabandhu or the friend of a Brahmana. Being a friend of a Brahmana does not mean that one is Brahmana by qualification.

#### Brahmana, Qualities, Bhagavad Gita, Modern Times

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "A Brahmana naturally is endowed with some characteristics by which he is called a Brahmana."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the qualities of a Brahmana as described in the Bhagavad Gita, contrasting it with the modern misconception of Brahmanas being determined by birth.

Brahmana in the strict sense of the term being used for somebody means the person has got the qualifications of a Brahmana. In the Bhagavad Gita, in the Bhagavad Gita this is mentioned: Shamo Dhamo Tapasyaucham Shanti Rajyavam Evacha Gyanam Vigyanam Astikyam Brahma Karma Swabhavajam. A Brahmana naturally is endowed with some characteristics by which he is called a Brahmana. So nine qualities by which Brahmanas work are specifically enumerated in the Bhagavad Gita in the 18th chapter. Hmm. Here Ashwathama because he is not having the qualifications, therefore he cannot be called a Brahmana. Therefore earlier he was referred to as Brahmabandhu, and in this verse he is referred to as Dvijatmaja, the son of a Brahmana. Earlier he was called the friend of a Brahmana. A friend or a son of a Brahmana, well fully qualified can be called a Brahmana and not otherwise. So somebody to be called as a Brahmana should have the qualification, unlike in modern times. Simply somebody is taken birth in a Brahmana family, therefore they are called Brahman, but that is not correct. That is not the proper way in which somebody should be called as a Brahmana.

Unless one is born as a Brahmana. Unless one is born as a Brahmana. Unless one is born as a Brahmana. Unless one is born as a Brahmana. Unless one is born as a Brahmana. Unless one is born as a Brahmana. Since Ashwathama's decision is immature, he is purposely called herein the son of a Brahmana. He shouldn't have used the ultimate weapon, the Brahmastra, but because he immaturely decided to use that, he is being referred to as Dvijatmaja, son of a Brahmana.

**Key Quote:** "One is identified as a Brahmana or any particular varna, Kshatriya or Vaishya, based on lakshana, based on characteristics."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Vedic system identifies individuals based on their characteristics (lakshana) rather than birth, citing the Bhagavatam.

Son of a Brahmana. So Srila Prabhupada explains in another place that the Vedic system is, one is called as a Brahmana only if he has the lakshana, the characteristics of a Brahmana. And in the Bhagavatam it is clearly declared: Yasyaya lakshanam proktam pumso varna abhivyanjakam, Yad anyatra pi drishyeta, Tattenaiva vinirdhishet. One is identified as a Brahmana, or any particular varna, Kshatriya or Vaishya, based on lakshana, based on characteristics. If a person has the characteristics of a Vaishya, he should be addressed as a Vaishya, or known as a Vaishya. If somebody has the qualities of a Kshatriya, he should be known as a Kshatriya. But without the qualities, without the qualifications, lakshana, characteristics, how can you refer somebody wrongly as a Brahmana or a Kshatriya, whatever. And specifically this verse of the Bhagavatam, the 7th canto, Yad anyatra pi drishyeta, if somebody is born in a Brahmin family, but he doesn't have the characteristics of the qualities of a Brahmana, let's say he has got the qualities of a Vaishya, then Tattenaiva vinirdhishet, he should be designated as a Vaishya because he has got the qualities of a Vaishya, even though he is born in a Brahmana family. That is what the

**Key Quote:** "One must act as a Brahmana. One must have the characteristics of a Brahmana. If he does not have those characteristics, there is no harm in referring him as the son of a Brahmana."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of acting and having the characteristics of a Brahmana, and that referring to someone as the son of a Brahmana is acceptable if they lack these qualities, highlighting the need for training, education, and culture.

verse says. So lakshana means symptoms. One must act as a Brahmana. One must have the characteristics of a Brahmana. If he does not have those characteristics, there is no harm in referring him as the son of a Brahmana, Dujatmaja, because his father is qualified Brahmana. Ashwatthama's father is Dronacharya. Dronacharya is qualified, highly qualified. He was expert, expert Brahmana. So Ashwatthama is not similarly having the characteristics like Dronacharya. Therefore Ashwatthama, it is proper to refer him as Dujatmaja. So here Srila Prabhupada explains, anyone can claim, "My father is a great person," but he cannot pass off as a great man just because he is a son of a great man. No. Simply because his father is very highly qualified, doesn't mean he necessarily would have acquired all the father's qualifications, unless he is trained. Training is required, education is required, culture is required. All that is required. It doesn't simply come off. Automatically there is no such transfer of qualities.

**Key Quote:** "Just like somebody's father is a great heart surgeon. If the son is not qualified as a heart surgeon. How can the son be referred to as a great heart surgeon. It is not proper."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a heart surgeon to illustrate that one cannot claim to be like their qualified father without possessing the same qualities, and explains how Draupadi advised Arjuna to spare Ashwathama's life out of compassion for his mother.

No. From a social point of view, Prabhupada says, we sometimes give respect to somebody just because he happens to be the son of a great person. So we give him respect. That is also okay, giving respect, but he cannot claim that he is like the father. Just like somebody's father is a great heart surgeon. If the son is not qualified as a heart surgeon, how can the son be referred to as a great heart surgeon? It is not proper and it is not to be referred that way. Similarly, even though the father is a great brahmana, the son should not be referred to as a great brahmana. So it will be described in the later portion of this chapter that because he happened to be, Ashwathama happened to be the son of a great personality, Dronacharya, so he was excused from capital punishment. He was excused from being killed. So Arjuna decided not to kill him. Even later on it will be described because he happened to be, the consideration was, Guru putra, he is the son of my teacher. If he dies, this Ashwathama is killed because of the mistake he has done. He deserves to be killed, but if he is killed, his mother, whose Dronacharya's wife, will be unhappy. So it is Draupadi who advised Arjuna, "Don't kill Ashwathama, because then her, his mother, Ashwathama's mother, will be unhappy. She is innocent. She is not at fault." So he spared his life. That is what Draupadi said.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Ashwathama's use of the Brahmastra and its effects, comparing it to a nuclear weapon, and explains how Krishna advised Arjuna to counteract it, contrasting it with the lack of counteraction for modern nuclear weapons.

Now he was running on the back of a horse, but when he saw that Arjuna is coming nearer, he thought that the Brahmastra could be the only way he could protect himself. Now Brahmastra is to be used in a very, very, very extraordinary circumstance. It is the last weapon somebody may use. And Draupadi explains it is similar to the modern nuclear weapon. It releases lot of radiation. When Ashwathama actually, the description will be there later on, Ashwathama releases Brahmastra, there was so much radiation, people were feeling terrible heat, and Arjuna inquired from Krishna, "What is the cause for this terrible heat spreading everywhere?" So Krishna informed, "This heat is due to Ashwathama releasing the Brahmastra." Krishna, Krishna is the supreme lord, the paramatma, the super soul in everyone's heart. He knows. So Krishna informed Arjuna and Krishna also informed Arjuna, "Now you counteract this Brahmastra by releasing another Brahmastra to neutralize." Formerly they had this knowledge, if I throw one kind of weapon, somebody else may neutralize that weapon by throwing another weapon, counteraction. But Prabhupada points out, now they have this nuclear weapon, but there is no system of counteracting it. They do not have any counteraction.

And even Kshatriyas, when they would fight, if one Kshatriya releases a particular weapon, just like a fire weapon, may be counteracted by a water weapon. This is unknown in modern science. It is unknown. There were weapons, not only fire weapons, there were water weapons, there were wind weapons, and there were of course the arrows made of earth, earthly element, like that. There were different kinds of weapons and they were expert in counteracting a particular weapon. And also formerly when a battle is being fought, then if the opposite party, the Kshatriyas killed, that is the end of the battle. There is no more fighting. So that was the system. It was highly regulated, but now modern warfare is not so much based on principles and regulations, but Kshatriyas used to be regulated. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "It can destroy a whole universe that is the kind of power this Brahmastra has."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of Srimad Bhagavatam 1.7.20, focusing on Ashwathama's use of the Brahmastra and its destructive power.

Athopas Prishya Salilam Sandadhetat Samahitah Ajanan Api Samharam Prana Krishra Upasthite. The meaning of this verse as translated by Srila Prabhupada: Since his life was in danger, he touched water in sanctity and concentrated upon the chanting of the hymns for throwing nuclear weapons, although he did not know how to withdraw such weapons. So, the description is that Ashwathama, when he realized his life was in danger after he had beheaded the five sleeping sons of Draupadi, and he wanted to please his master Duryodhana, and Duryodhana was not at all pleased with this act of Ashwathama, and Arjuna, when he learned from Draupadi that Ashwathama has killed her sons, five sleeping sons, then Arjuna vowed to punish this Ashwathama. So, Arjuna started chasing Ashwathama, and Ashwathama was trying to escape, but his horse became tired. On the horseback, his horse became tired, and he realized he can't go any further, and Arjuna is chasing on a chariot, and Arjuna is accompanied by Krishna, who was acting as the Sarathi, the chariot driver of Arjuna. This towards the end of the battle of Kurukshetra. So, this verse describes that this Ashwathama, since his life was in danger, he decided to use the ultimate weapon, the Brahmastra, to protect his son from the evil of the Kurukshetra, and he decided to use the ultimate weapon, the Brahmastra, to protect himself, and he did not have complete knowledge of using this Brahmastra weapon. He knew how to release this weapon, but he did not know how to withdraw it, so he didn't have complete knowledge, and it is, it is like a nuclear weapon. Srila Prabhupada explains this Brahmastra is like a nuclear weapon, it has got tremendous amount of radiation that is generated. And what is the kind of power of this Brahmastra?

**Summary:** The lecture explains the science behind mantra weapons, emphasizing the importance of purification and proper technique.

It can destroy a whole universe, that is the kind of power this Brahmastra has. Of course, this Brahmastra is a weapon that is released by a chanting mantra. This science is unknown in the modern times. This science of utilizing a particular sound to generate an effect. So, how did he release this weapon, this Ashwatthama? He touched water in sanctity. The Sanskrit says that Upasprishya Salilam. Salilam means water. He touched water. And how did he do it? He did it in sanctity. So, there is a certain procedure for using this weapon, which is a mantra weapon. So, chanting the mantra requires that one has to purify oneself by touching water, and then chanting that mantra. Now, the chanting is not simply some casual vibration of the tongue, no, it is the technique of chanting this mantra by a qualified chanter. Now, this is the science that is not known in modern times, but it was, it is there even now, it's there, and it was certainly used in the times of the Battle of Mahabharata, battle of Kurukshetra 5,000 years back. It is described in the Ramayana, it is described in the Mahabharata, described in the Puranas how to use mantra weapons, different kinds of mantra weapons.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Ashwathama's incomplete knowledge of the Brahmastra and the potential consequences of its improper use.

So, mantra weapons were used in those times, and they used to learn how to use it from the expert. You can learn this from the expert provided you follow the instructions. So, this Ashwathama sandhade tatsamahitah, he chanted the hymns. Sandhade means he chanted the hymns. Even when we practice chanting, we should know that Amitabha is with us. So, yeah, the mantra will come in our mind. After it comes in our mind, the mind wants to know what is transformation, whatever is the intention of manifestation, and what is the three things that make the first step, it is coming in our form. So, again the mantra will come into your mind. sound vibration, but here it's also said ajanan api samharam, he did not know how to withdraw this. Samara means to withdraw, he did not know how to withdraw this weapon, but still he decided to use this weapon to save himself, and the reason is prana krishre upasti te, when his life was in danger. Prana krisra means this life was in danger, and in such a situation he decided, even though he did not know the complete usage of this weapon, he decided, even though he did not know the complete usage of this mantra weapon, he did not know completely how to use it, because he was able to release it but not withdraw. So, formally they even knew how to withdraw the weapon after its particular use. Let's say the weapon has to strike one particular target, and then after it has destroyed a particular target, then withdraw the weapon. So, that is the, that is the complete usage, a proper usage of that weapon, but this Ashwatthama did not know how to withdraw. Even if he, let us say, was trying to use it against Arjuna, he should have known how to release it, the weapon, the Brahmastra strikes Arjuna and comes back, but he did not know how to withdraw, so the damage it will do will be much, much, much, much more than the intended purpose.

**Summary:** The lecture criticizes Ashwathama's unscrupulous behavior and contrasts modern gross methods of material manipulation with more subtle ancient techniques.

But still this Ashwatthama was not really a principled person, he was unscrupulous, so he was, because his life was in danger, somehow save himself now, and without even really being bothered about the destruction this can do. So, we'll see in the later verses what all happens. Now, Srila Prabhupada explains the subtle forms in the purport, the subtle forms of material activities finer than grosser methods of material manipulation. Right now in modern times, we only know gross method of using matter. Just like fire weapons, they are fired from a missile or from a gun, and then the ammunition is striking a target, and it is mainly the manipulation of the element called fire, fire weapons. Formerly they used to have water weapons, they used to have wind weapons. So, that is unknown in modern time, they do not have any water weapons or wind weapons, because a fire weapon can be counteracted by a water weapon. So, that is unknown in modern times. Now, there is something beyond even this gross usage of fire weapons or water weapons or wind weapons. That is Prabhupada

**Key Quote:** "Just by chanting the mantra, mantra means the power of sound."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the subtle sound vibration of the Brahmastra with the spiritual sound vibration of the Hare Krishna mantra, emphasizing the importance of chanting purely and learning from an expert.

explains subtle forms of material activities are affected through purification of sound. Just by chanting the mantra, mantra means the power of sound. But, it is chanted by using a particular technique. Prabhupada calls it here purification of sound, just like we are engaged in chanting the Hare Krishna mantra. This Hare Krishna mantra is a spiritual sound vibration. It is not even a subtle sound. It is a mantra of incorrect meaning. A mantra means a purification of sound. This mantra is a spiritual sound vibration. It is not even a subtle sound, it is a mantra is a spiritual sound vibration. It is not even a subtle sound, it is a mantra spiritual sound. Now, spiritual sound is beyond gross and subtle matter, it is beyond gross and subtle matter, but here what is being talked of as the use of Brahmastra is a subtle sound vibration utilized to generate this astra, this weapon, release this weapon, and there is a technique of using another mantra for withdrawing it. That mantra this Ashwatthama did not know. So, Prabhupada tells, if the power of a subtle sound is so much that it can be used to generate a Brahmastra which is equivalent of a nuclear weapon, it is capable of massive destruction, it has got so much destructive power, so then we can hardly imagine what is the power of the spiritual sound vibration of properly chanting Hare Krishna. If you chant Hare Krishna right, you will learn to chant Hare Krishna from Shriyeila Prabhupada who is the expert spiritual master. So, Prabhupada says to chant Hare Krishna effectively, we should learn how to chant offencelessly. We should chant the Hare Krishna mantra avoiding the 10 kinds of offences, dasha with the aparatha wait a while. So, we have to learn, we have to practice, we have to learn and practice how to chant Hare Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "It can nullify millions of lifetimes of sinful reactions that a person might have committed"
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by highlighting the immense spiritual benefits of chanting the Hare Krishna mantra purely, including the nullification of sinful reactions and the attainment of Krishna Prema.

Because you chant Hare Krishna purely, it has the power to nullify all the sinful reactions of your millions of lifetimes, that is the power of chanting Hare Krishna, and that's not the complete power. I'm just telling you one effect of purely chanting Hare Krishna, one effect. What is that? It can nullify millions of lifetimes of sinful reactions that a person might have committed. It doesn't matter how much sinful reactions the person has got, everything, all sinful reactions hundred percent nullified just by once chanting purely. But the real benefit of chanting Hare Krishna is not just nullifying the offense, the sinful reactions, it is actually able to give us Krishna Prema, the highest perfection of spiritual life itself. It awakens our Krishna Bhakti, Krishna Prema, and we are able to establish our loving relationship with Krishna. So that is the real ultimate benefit of chanting Hare Krishna purely.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, only you are competent to instill fearlessness in the hearts of your devotees."
**Summary:** Arjuna's statement highlights that only devotees of Krishna can achieve fearlessness and liberation from material miseries.

In this session we will be discussing from the 21st and 22nd verses of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. So the 21st verse, ततप् प्रादुष्कृतं तेजः प्रचंडं सर्वतोधिषं प्राणापदं अभिप्रेक्ष विष्णुम् जिष्णुर् वाचः। The meaning of these words, विष्णुम् जिष्णुर् वाचः। विष्णु is Lord Krishna, जिष्णु is Arjuna. So Arjuna began to address Krishna upon seeing that glaring light spreading in all directions and he thought his own life is in danger. The next words, the 22nd words, अर्जुन वाचः। What did Arjuna tell Krishna? कृष्ण कृष्ण महाबाहो भक्तानाम् अभयन्दुष्कृष्ण। त्वमेको दह्यमानाम् अपवर्गोशि संसृतेः। The meaning of these 22nd words. अर्जुन वाचः। Arjuna said, ओ मैं लोड श्री कृष्ण। कृष्ण कृष्ण महाबाहो। यु अर्जुन वाचः। तुम्हे को दह्यमानाम् अपवर्गोषि संसृतेः। Therefore, only you are competent to instill fearlessness in the hearts of your devotees. Everyone in the flames of material miseries can find the path of liberation in you only.

**Key Quote:** "All others who are not devotees, who are not devotees of Krishna, they are always in a situation where any time there can be fearlessness."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the four characteristics of material existence: eating, sleeping, fearing, and mating, emphasizing the constant presence of fear for non-devotees.

So, by Arjuna's statement, we can understand what is the position of a devotee. Only a devotee is fearless in this material world. All others who are not devotees, who are not devotees of Krishna, they are always in a situation where any time there can be fearlessness. There is no cause for fear of some danger, due to some danger, material danger. And Krishna is the unlimited Supreme Lord. Therefore, only Krishna can give complete protection to anyone who takes shelter of him. But who takes shelter of Krishna, it's only his devotees. Non-devotees, they may think that they are safe, or they have some different arrangements for their safety, for their protection. But actually, in this material world, there are four characteristics of material existence. There are four characteristics of material existence: Ahara, Nidra, Bhaya, Maithunam, Jaa. Everyone is in need of food for their subsistence. Ahara, Nidra, they are required to take some rest, sleep. And Bhaya, there is always fear due to some danger, one form or the other. So many different kinds of dangers are there in this world. And Maithunam, the demand for sex, sex indulgence.

**Summary:** Krishna is the giver of fearlessness to his devotees, as Arjuna experienced during the Kurukshetra war.

So, these four things are common for all living beings who have taken birth in this material world under the laws of karma. So, that fear factor is always there. But Krishna is Bhaktanam Abhayankara. He is the giver of fearlessness. He awards fearlessness to whom? To those who take his shelter, his devotees. Everyone in the flames of material miseries can find the path of liberation in you only. So, Shrida Prabhupada explains, Arjuna was aware of the transcendental qualities of Lord Sri Krishna as he had already experienced them during the Kurukshetra war in which both of them were present. Even though Krishna was not fighting in that battle, he agreed to become Arjuna's chariot driver, to guide Arjuna. And the Pandavas, of course. Not just Arjuna alone, all the Pandavas.

**Key Quote:** "Because the Pandavas had Krishna as their guide, they were able to cross this most dangerous ocean."
**Summary:** Shankaracharya's analogy of the Kurukshetra battlefield as a dangerous ocean illustrates how Krishna's guidance enabled the Pandavas to overcome the Kauravas' superior strength.

So, Arjuna had already experienced how in spite of big, big generals on the opposite side. This is very nicely described by Shankaracharya. He says, Bhishma Drona, Tata Jayadrata Jala, Gandhara Neelotpala, Shalya Grahavati, Kripenavahini, Karnena Velakula, Ashwathama Vikarana Ghoramakara, Duryodhana Avarthini, Soktirna Kalu Pandavai Rananadi, Kaivartaka Keshavaha. The Pandavas, in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, they did not have much strength, military strength as compared to the Kauravas. Of course, Bhima and Arjuna were very, very, very powerful fighters. They were maharathis. But on the opposite side, on the Kaurava side, there were so many maharathis. And among them, Bhishma and Drona, the topmost. Among all those present at that time, the topmost maharathis were on Kaurava's side, Bhishma and Drona. And not only that, Karna and Ashwathama, Vikarna, Duryodhana. So, in this verse, it is listed all these great fighters. Maharathis, chariot fighters, single-handed, they could face thousands of other warriors. They could kill in a combat, military combat. So, in spite of so much of strength on the Kaurava side, because the Pandavas had Krishna as their guide, they were able to cross this most dangerous ocean. Shankaracharya compares the battlefield to an ocean. And the Pandavas, they had to cross this dangerous ocean full of all kinds of sharks, all kinds of whirlpools, all kinds of crocodiles. Imagine, a person has to cross a water body, which is like an ocean. The vastness of the army strength of the Kauravas. In spite of that, because Krishna was their guide. Therefore, they crossed without being vanquished by the Kaurava army.

**Summary:** Arjuna's experience confirms Krishna's role as the source of fearlessness for devotees, who are always protected by the Lord.

So, Arjuna has already got experience how Krishna protected the Pandavas very nicely. Therefore, Arjuna's version of Lord Krishna is authoritative. Krishna is almighty and is especially the cause of fearlessness for the devotees. Krishna is the cause of all fearlessness for the devotees. A devotee of the Lord is always fearless. There's another song written by Govinda Das Thakur. He says, my dear mind, always sing the glories of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Nanda Nandana. Krishna has got many names of which this name Nanda Nandana, the beloved son of Maharaj Nanda. Shri Nanda Nandana, Abhaya Charanaravindare. Because, his lotus feet is the cause of fearlessness. One who takes shelter of Krishna's lotus feet can be fearless in this material world. So, here Prabhupada says, a devotee of the Lord is always fearless because of the protection given by the Lord.

**Summary:** Material existence is compared to a forest fire, which only Krishna's mercy can extinguish.

Material existence is something like a blazing fire in the forest. What does Arjuna say here? That, Tvam eko dahyamananam. Material world is sometimes compared to a forest fire. Supposing somebody is in the middle of a forest. And suddenly, there is a forest fire. And that fire spreads very, very, very quickly because, especially if it is summer, and the wood is dry, the trees, it will spread very quickly. And what if a person is caught up in the middle of a forest fire? Every direction he sees, he sees a blazing fire. So, is there a possibility he can escape? Yes, only one possibility. Only if there is a big rainfall which pours down heavily from the sky and then extinguishes this forest fire. See, it is not easy to extinguish a forest fire. Only a huge rainfall from a dense rain cloud which pours down completely extinguishes the forest fire. Then a person is safe. So, Krishna alone can extinguish this forest fire of material existence. Only Krishna can extinguish.

**Summary:** The spiritual master, like Krishna, rescues conditioned souls from the suffering of material existence, showering mercy like rainfall to extinguish the fire.

And he extinguishes by the mercy of rainfall. Same, similar prayer we offer to the spiritual master. samsara-davanala-lidha-loka-tranaya-karunya-ghanaghanatvam The spiritual master comes to this world, just like Krishna comes, to rescue the conditioned souls who are suffering in the blazing fire of material existence. Material existence is like filled with so many miseries. That is the nature of material existence. Therefore, it is also said, manashashtanindriyani prakrutisthani karshati In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says living entities are simply engaged in a struggle for existence. So, that struggle for existence can be put to an end immediately if we take shelter of lotus feet of Krishna, who can actually shower. Or the lotus feet of Krishna's representative, the bona fide spiritual master, the pure devotee spiritual master, Srila Prabhupada. Take shelter of Prabhupada's lotus feet. Vande gro Sri Charanaravindam. So, we take shelter. Take shelter of Prabhupada's lotus feet. Then Prabhupada also can bring down the shower of mercy of Krishna, because he is always in touch with Krishna. So, he can bring down the mercy rainfall, which will extinguish this blazing fire of material existence.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of taking shelter of Krishna, as Arjuna did, to be saved from the dangers of material existence.

So, we should actually take shelter of Krishna. Like Arjuna is teaching us through this prayer. Arjuna thought his life was in danger when he suddenly saw. Actually, this was the Brahmastra that was released by Ashwatthama to protect himself. But Arjuna did not know that, that the cause of that radiation suddenly he saw is spreading everywhere. And his own life in danger. He did not know what is the cause. So, he is addressing Krishna. Only you can protect me. You can save my life. Where is this? He is going to ask him the next words while addressing Krishna. Where is this radiation coming from? My dear Lord, I do not know. Please, can you tell me? And of course, Arjuna has taken shelter of Krishna completely as a devotee. But we should also learn how to take shelter of Krishna and thereby be saved from the dangers of material existence. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

These are words spoken by Arjuna. Arjuna is seeing suddenly a radiation emitting from some source, and it is spreading all over the sky. And he is inquiring from Krishna, what is this radiation that is spreading? Now, before he actually puts forward his actual question, as a devotee, he is helping us understand who is Krishna, or what is Krishna's position. So he is describing that Krishna's position is that of the supreme personality of Godhead. What does that mean? So he has stated in this specific description here, Adhyaha Purusha Sakshat Sakshat Eeshwaraha.

**Key Quote:** "As far as the absolute truth is concerned, 1 plus 1 equal to 1, 1 minus 1 is also equal to 1"
**Summary:** The speaker explains Krishna's position as the original personality of Godhead and how He expands Himself without diminishing His potency, using the analogy of absolute truth.

Prakriteparaha, like that. So Srila Prabhupada explains elaborately in the purport what is Krishna's position. So the first point here is Krishna is the original personality of Godhead. Original because every other form of God is an expansion of Krishna's original form. That's why Krishna is called original personality of Godhead. And he expands himself all over the creations. Krishna expands, therefore Krishna is present everywhere throughout the creation because he expands himself. Expansion means his power is not diminished. His original form is all powerful. The expanded form is also all powerful. Now this is difficult for us to understand, but Srila Prabhupada says in a very simple way, as far as the absolute truth is concerned, 1 plus 1 equals 1. 1 minus 1 is also equal to 1. That means the Supreme Lord is present with all his potencies. When he expands into another form, then the original form has all the potencies. The expanded form also has all the potencies. So when he expands into another form,

**Key Quote:** "Simply by surrendering to the lotus feet of Krishna, we become free from the influence of maya"
**Summary:** The speaker quotes the Bhagavad Gita and Chaitanya Charitamrita to explain how surrendering to Krishna frees one from maya and ignorance, using the analogy of the sun dispelling darkness.

The expanded form also has equally got all the potencies. So this is only possible for the Supreme Lord because he is the absolute truth. Now Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport. First of all, Prabhupada quotes the Bhagavad Gita. He says, the Lord states in the Bhagavad Gita that the one who surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Lord can get released from the clutches of nescience. Ma mevaye prapadyante maya metam tarantite. So simply by surrendering to the lotus feet of Krishna, we become free from the influence of maya, because of which we get out of the clutches of ignorance, nescience. So further, Srila Prabhupada is quoting the Chaitanya Charitamrita and saying Krishna is just like the sun, and maya or material existence is just like darkness. Krishna suryasama mayahoy andhakar. Wherever there is light of the sun, darkness or ignorance at once vanishes. So therefore, it is now explained here, the best means to get out of the world of ignorance is suggested here.

**Key Quote:** "From him all other personalities of Godhead expand"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that all other personalities of Godhead expand from Krishna, differentiating between Swamsa (the Lord himself) and Vibhinamsa (separated expansions like living beings).

What is that best means? That the Lord is addressed herein as the original personality of Godhead. From him, all other personalities of Godhead expand. From him, from the original personality of Godhead, Krishna, all other personalities expand. The all pervasive Lord Vishnu is Lord Krishna's plenary portion or expansion. Vishnu, who is all pervading in this material world, he is an expansion of Krishna. As I told earlier, Krishna expands means Krishna as the original person always remains without any diminishing potency. The Lord expands himself in innumerable forms of Godhead and living beings. Even we living beings are expansions of the Lord, but we are called Vibhinamsa. We are separated expansion. And the forms of the Supreme Lord as Vishnu Tatva, Rama, Narasimha, Varaha, they are called Swamsa.

**Key Quote:** "Sri Krishna is the original primeval Lord from whom everything expands"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna is the source of everything, including all energies, and quotes the Bhagavad Gita to support this point.

Swamsa means the Lord himself with all his potencies expands in many forms. So the Lord expands himself in innumerable forms of Godhead and living beings along with his different energies. Now, at any time, the Lord is never without his energy. Energies are always present eternally as the energy, and the Lord is always present as the Lord. And the Lord is always the controller of all the energies. But Sri Krishna is the original primeval Lord from whom everything expands. So that original form from whom everything expands is Krishna. Krishna says this in the Bhagavad Gita, Aham sarvasya prabhavo Matta sarvam pravartate. Krishna says, I am the source of all, everything in existence, and therefore from me only everything emanates. That's what Krishna says.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the all-pervasive feature of the Lord is a partial representation and that Krishna, as the Supreme Lord, is beyond the actions and reactions of material nature.

Matta sarvam pravartate. The all pervasive feature of the Lord experienced within manifested world, this world we are talking about, the all pervasive feature of the Lord is also a partial representation of the Lord. It's a partial representation because the original personality of Godhead is actually the Supreme Lord himself. Therefore, Paramatma is included within him. Paramatma is included within the Bhagavan feature. Within the Vishnu Tatva, Paramatma feature is included. He is the absolute personality of Godhead. He means here Krishna. Krishna is the absolute personality of Godhead. He has nothing to do with the actions and reactions of the material manifestation. In this material world, constantly there is some interaction between the gunas, producing actions and reactions both. But Krishna is not within this material nature. He is far above the material creation.

**Key Quote:** "Light exists independent of darkness, but darkness is absence of light"
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of darkness and light to explain that Krishna is full of bliss and transcendental variegatedness, independent of material existence.

Darkness is a perverse representation of the sun, and therefore the existence of darkness depends on the existence of the sun. When we say darkness exists dependent upon the sun means when the sun is shining in the sky, there is no possibility of darkness. When the sun goes out of our vision, then there is darkness. But even that darkness, when the sun is gone to the other side, still that darkness can immediately be dispelled as soon as the moon rises. The sun sets on the horizon and the moon rises. Now that moonshine can immediately dispel the darkness. So that is to be also understood, that existence of darkness depends on sun or light, but existence of light doesn't depend on darkness. Light exists independent of darkness, but darkness is absence of light. This has to be carefully understood. The sun is never without any trace of darkness. Similarly, the absolute personality of Godhead beyond the material existence is always full of bliss. He is not only full of bliss, but also full of transcendental variegatedness. He is full of spiritual variety. Transcendence is not at all static,

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna is independent of material nature and its modes, yet He controls the material energy through His representatives.

But full of dynamic variegatedness. And Krishna is also distinctly different from the material nature. It is the material nature which is complicated by the interactions of the three gunas. Therefore, Krishna being totally independent of this material modes or material existence, he is independent of that. Therefore, Krishna is absolute. Krishna has many, many energies, and through these energies only he creates, maintains, destroys the whole material world. He does that. In Krishna's personal abode, there is no creation, there is no matter, there is no material defects. That is particularly explained in the Bhagavad Gita specifically, that Krishna is free from all these material energy, material manifestation. Krishna is free, completely free from that. But Krishna is also simultaneously controller of this material energy. By his omnipotence, he simultaneously is aloof from this material energy, and he also controls it through his representatives, the three directors of the gunas. He controls through them.

**Key Quote:** "The personality of God is Sri Krishna out of his causeless mercy."
**Summary:** This segment explains that Krishna incarnates out of causeless mercy, not influenced by material qualifications, and cannot be attracted through material means.

This session will be discussing from the 24th verse of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Sa eva jeeva lokasya maya mohita cheta saha vidhatsye svayena viryena shreyo dharmadi lakshanam. The meaning of this verse is, and yet, though you are beyond the purview of the material energy, you execute the four principles of liberation, characterized by religion, and so on, for the ultimate good of the conditioned souls. This is a very important verse which explains when Krishna incarnates, if somebody looks at Krishna, they may be unable to recognize him as the Supreme Lord because he appears like another ordinary person. He appears like another created being, but he is not. He is not a created being. He is not an ordinary person. He is the Supreme Lord. That we explained by Prabhupada in the purport. Prabhupada says, "The personality of God is Sri Krishna. Out of his causeless mercy..." Krishna's mercy is described as causeless. That means there is no material cause for that mercy. There is no material cause. So therefore, to attract the attention of Krishna, or to get Krishna's mercy, we cannot do that. We cannot expect to get that mercy by having some material qualification, having some material opulence, having some material power, or having some material punya. We cannot expect to get any mercy from the Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "If you want his mercy, you have to render devotional service."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that Krishna is pleased by devotional service and taking shelter of a pure devotee, highlighting the transcendental position of both the Lord and His devotees.

No. So it is explained here, then why is it called the Supreme Lord? It is called causeless. It is causeless because the Lord does not consider any material attributes when he has to shower his blessings or mercy upon somebody. He is simply pleased by devotional service. If you want his mercy, you have to render devotional service. If you want his mercy, you take shelter of the pure devotee who is himself under the complete shelter and protection of the Supreme Lord. So these are all secrets of Bhakti revealed in the scriptures like Bhagavatam. So here it is told by Prabhupada, "The personality of God is Sri Krishna. Out of his causeless mercy, descends on the material world without being influenced by the material modes of nature." Krishna comes down from the spiritual world. He comes to this material world, but he is never influenced by the material modes of nature. That means he is not subject to Sattva Guna, or Rajya Guna, or Tama Guna, or any combination. No. Then he is always transcendentally situated, Shuddha Sattva. Even the pure devotees who are coming from the spiritual world, even they are transcendentally situated. They are also transcendentally situated. That is the position of the devotee.

**Key Quote:** "He descends out of his causeless mercy only to reclaim the fallen souls."
**Summary:** This segment explains that Krishna is beyond the material world and descends out of causeless mercy to reclaim fallen souls who desire material enjoyment.

That is also the position of the Lord. So Srila Prabhupada further says, "Krishna is eternally beyond the material manifestation." Material manifestation means material creation, material planets, material universe, or universes, because there are many material universes. So material universe, all these are actually beyond. He is beyond this material world, even though he comes to this material world and appears to be like an ordinary person engaged in some ordinary activities. Apparently he looks like he is also under the modes, but he is never under the modes. He is never influenced by the material energy. He is not affected by the three gunas. He descends out of his causeless mercy only to reclaim the fallen souls. See, this is the reason why he comes. He has got a specific purpose. What is that? To reclaim the fallen souls. That means the fallen souls have come to this material world because of having a desire to enjoy materially. That's all. Therefore Krishna comes to save them, to rescue them.

**Key Quote:** "The lord comes to reclaim the fallen conditioned souls."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how the illusory energy captivates fallen souls, leading them to make plans for material enjoyment, and how the Lord arranges for them to take shelter of His lotus feet and become spiritually enlightened.

Because even if we make plans for enjoying in this material world, we will always be unsuccessful. We are not meant to achieve success through some different methods suggested in the scriptures. No, we are not meant to do that. All those different aspects of illusion in this material world, because of which somebody thinks, "I can enjoy, I can become the lord," that is due to the influence of the illusory energy. And accordingly, the Supreme Lord also makes his arrangement for someone to actually take shelter of his lotus feet and also become free from the influence of the material energy, come out of the illusory influence. So then one becomes actually spiritually enlightened, and then spiritual awakening happens. Of course, these all go step by step, but the fact is the Lord comes to reclaim the fallen conditioned souls. He wants to take them back to his personal abode. So therefore, it is described here, these fallen souls are captivated by the illusory energy. They are completely captivated by the illusory energy. They are making so many plans, and they even think that they are safe within this material world. They forget what is the real nature of the material world.

**Key Quote:** "The supreme lord who incarnates for the sake of reclaiming the fallen conditioned souls, He is very very kind to these fallen souls."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the Lord's kindness in incarnating to reclaim fallen souls and making arrangements for them to turn their attention towards Him, glorifying Srila Prabhupada and previous acharyas for the same mission.

So the Supreme Lord who incarnates for the sake of reclaiming the fallen conditioned souls, he is very, very kind to these fallen souls. So he makes so much of arrangements so that somehow the souls will turn their attention towards the Lord, who is present in our heart as Paramatma, who comes from time to time in the form of incarnation visible to the common people. Like that, the Lord has got so many different ways in which he actually has made arrangements to reclaim the fallen conditioned souls. We say that Premadwani, that Jai Om Vishnupad Paramahamsa Parivrajakacharya His divine grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. We are glorifying Srila Prabhupada because Prabhupada has come for the same purpose. Prabhupada has come for reclaiming the fallen conditioned souls. So we glorify the previous acharyas. They also come to this world for the same purpose. We glorify the river Ganga. Why? Because Ganga's appearance in this material world is for the purpose of purifying the conditioned souls so that they become eligible to go back to the spiritual world. You see, same mission. River Ganga, river Yamuna, Ganga mai ki jai, Yamuna mai ki jai. Then Bhakti Devi ki jai, Tursi Devi ki jai. Tursi has appeared in this world again for the same purpose for which the Lord comes to reclaim the conditioned souls.

**Key Quote:** "By seeing Tursi, one becomes purified in the heart."
**Summary:** This segment explains how Tulsi assists in reclaiming conditioned souls through purification, and how the material energy influences them to seek enjoyment in material nature under false pretenses.

How does Tursi assist the Lord in this reclaiming the conditioned souls? That simply by seeing Tursi, one becomes purified in the heart. Then what is the result of purification? One can easily take to devotional service and prepare oneself to go back to God. Like that, all the different personalities mentioned in the Prema Dvani are actually assisting the Lord in his mission of reclaiming the fallen conditioned souls. Now, the conditioned souls, they are attacked by the material energy. Attacked means they are influenced. Material energy influences, the illusory energy influences them. So under the influence, they simply want to enjoy material nature. Under false pretext, they make big, big plans for enjoying, exploiting the resource of material nature. But material nature cannot be the source of pleasure, the source of enjoyment, never, because by its inherent characteristic, material energy is actually illusory energy, always presenting something which looks like real, but actually is not real. That is an illusion.

**Key Quote:** "Our real enjoyment is in the spiritual world."
**Summary:** This segment highlights that material energy presents illusion, and real enjoyment lies in the spiritual world with Krishna, emphasizing the importance of faith in the Acharya for purification and liberation.

So Prabhupada says, "The living entity is unable to enjoy in this material world because in essence the material energy is simply presenting illusion, presenting illusion." Our real enjoyment is in the spiritual world. Our real enjoyment is spiritual. Our real enjoyment is in association with Krishna. We belong to Krishna. So therefore, when we understand these facts, we develop faith in the words of the Supreme Lord. We develop faith in the words of the Acharya, and when we take shelter of the Acharya, then we are easily able to purify ourselves and become eligible to get out of this illusory energy, to go to the spiritual world in our eternal position, eternal existence, full of bliss and knowledge, like the Lord is situated, full of bliss and knowledge.

**Summary:** This segment explains that everyone is originally a servant of Krishna but forgets this truth when desiring material enjoyment, and the Lord's all-merciful nature is exhibited when He comes to reclaim fallen souls.

Further also, Prabhupada says, "Originally everyone is a servant of Krishna, but one forgets this truth when one desires to enjoy the material world, and when one thinks of enjoying, though there is lot of promise, but actually only one in illusion will think this material world as real, as something really enjoyable." No, it is never enjoyable. It is never real. So it is said here, "The all-merciful nature of the Lord is exhibited when he simply comes for the sake of reclaiming the fallen conditioned souls." So that is the way the Lord displays his all-merciful nature.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 25th, 26th, and 27th verses of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. So the 25th verse is as follows: Tathayam Chavataraste Bhuvabhara Jehirshaya Svanam Chananya Bhavanam Anudhyanaya Chasasya Sakrit. The meaning of this verse is: Thus you descend as an incarnation to remove the burden of the world and to benefit your friends, especially those who are your exclusive devotees and are wrapped in meditation upon you.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord is everyone's father, aham bijapratapitah that's what Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, he is the seed-giving Father of all living entities."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the Lord's relationship with all beings, emphasizing that while He is equal to everyone, He is more inclined towards His devotees, who are considered His kinsmen.

These are words spoken by Arjuna. Arjuna has seen a glare in the sky, a radiation, and he wants to ask Krishna what is the source of this radiation, and before that, he is offering prayers. So in this prayer, this particular prayer Arjuna is offering, he is describing Krishna's descent as Avatara. You descend as an incarnation to remove the burden of the world. When the world is overburdened by the miscreants, those who are law-breakers, when the world is overburdened by those who are the leaders of God, then and are wrapped in meditation upon you, the devotees are entirely dependent upon Krishna for everything. They have no other dependence. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, it appears that the Lord is partial to his devotees. It appears like that, but actually, the fact is, He is not partial, but the fact is, everyone is related with the Lord. Everyone has got a relationship with the Lord. It's not just the devotees alone who have a relationship. He is equal to everyone. That is the meaning of Supreme Lord. He is equal to everyone, yet he is more inclined to his own men and devotees. He is more inclined to his own men, that is, who are his own men? Devotees. The Lord is everyone's father, aham bijapratapitah. That's what Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita. He is the seed-giving Father of all living entities. So therefore, it is described here by Srila Prabhupada, the Lord is everyone's Father, no one can be his father, and yet no one can be his son. This relationship, what we understand in the material world, somebody's father or somebody's son, that kind of relationship doesn't apply to Krishna. So,

**Key Quote:** "This is his transcendental pastime, it is pastime, this is Leela and it has nothing to do with mundane ideas of relations, fatherhood or anything like that."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that Krishna's relationships and pastimes are transcendental and should not be understood through a material lens, as the Lord is above the modes of material nature.

Srila Prabhupada further explains, his devotees are his kinsmen and his devotees are his relations. This is his transcendental pastime, it is pastime, this is Leela, and it has nothing to do with mundane ideas of relations, fatherhood, or anything like that. Materially, we know somebody is my father, somebody is my son, somebody is my friend, somebody is my relative. Those kind of material ideas should not be carried in our mind when we try to understand Krishna's incarnation or descent in this world. As mentioned above, the Lord is above the modes of material nature. He is always transcendental to the modes. And thus there is nothing mundane about his kinsmen and relations in devotional service. Nothing material. Everything is completely transcendental. So therefore, it is described as a transcendental pastime.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces verse 26, focusing on Arjuna's question about a dangerous effulgence and highlighting the importance of offering prayers before addressing the Lord, even for intimate friends.

The 26th verse is. Now Arjuna is stating what is the problem, that the meaning of this verse. O Lord of Lords, he has addressed Krishna as Deva Deva. He is the Lord of Lords. Krishna is Lord of Lords. How is it that this dangerous effulgence is spreading all around? Where does it come from? I do not understand it. So this is what Arjuna's question is to Krishna. Suddenly Arjuna has seen this dangerous effulgence spreading everywhere, and he does not know the source. So he is asking Krishna, please tell me what is the source of this? So Srila Prabhupada says in the Purport, anything that is presented before the personality of Godhead should be so done after due presentation of respectful prayers. That is the proper etiquette. Krishna is not an ordinary person. So before one wants to ask anything, one has to offer prayers to the Lord. That is the standard procedure. And Shree Arjuna, although an intimate friend of the Lord, is observing this method for general information. Arjuna is actually a very, very close friend of Krishna, but still, he's following the etiquette that a devotee should follow when addressing the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces verse 27, explaining Krishna's response about the Brahmastra released by Ashwathama, comparing it to a modern nuclear weapon and emphasizing its creation through subtle sound (mantras).

prayers had to be offered. The 27th verse, Shri Bhagavanuvacha, now the Lord's response to Arjuna's question. Shri Bhagavanuvacha, Vethedam Drona Putrasya Brahamam Astram Pradarshitam, Naivasam Veda Samharam Pranabhadha Upastite. The meaning of this 27th verse, the supreme personality of God had said, know from me that this is the act of the son of Drona. He has thrown the hymns of nuclear energy, Brahmastra, and he does not know how to retract the glare. He has helplessly done this being afraid of imminent death. When Arjuna started chasing Ashwathama and Ashwathama's horses became tired, then Ashwathama thought that his life is in danger, and just to save himself, he resorted to the ultimate weapon, the Brahmastra, which should normally not be used under such circumstances. But he did not care for the rules, regulations. He simply decided how to release that Brahmastra. Regarding the Brahmastra, Srila Prabhupada explains, the Brahmastra is similar to the modern nuclear weapon manipulated by atomic energy. The atomic energy works wholly on total combustibility, and so the Brahmastra also acts. So, in terms of the effect, the Brahmastra is similar to the nuclear weapon. It creates an intolerable heat similar to atomic radiation, this Brahmastra. But the difference is that the atomic bomb is a gross type of nuclear weapon, whereas the Brahmastra is a subtle type of weapon

produced by chanting hymns. How was this Brahmastra produced? Simply by chanting mantra. And Srila Prabhupada says, further, it is a different science. And in the days gone by, such science was in the land of Bharatvarsha, but I'm sorry, the subtle science of chanting hymns is also material. This Brahmastra is released by a subtle method of chanting a mantra, but it is a material phenomenon. Even though it is a subtle science of chanting hymns, which is a material effect, it has yet to be known by the modern material scientists. Modern-day material scientists do not know how to manipulate subtle sound and produce such a Brahmastra. They do not know. Subtle material science is not spiritual, but it has a direct relationship with the spiritual method, like in spiritual method mantras are chanted, and even subtle material science takes help of chanting of mantra, but still, this is completely material, this chanting for the sake

**Key Quote:** "A chanter of hymns knew how to apply the weapon as well as how to retract it see that is the special thing about this the science of subtle sound that they knew how to release it and how to withdraw it also retract it that was perfect knowledge"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts spiritual chanting with the material use of mantras for weapons, emphasizing that true knowledge includes both application and retraction, which Ashwathama lacked, making his use of the Brahmastra improper and irreligious.

whereas the chanting of mantras for spiritual purposes is completely transcendental to all material, to transcendental to gross and subtle matter, just like we chant Hare Krishna, it's completely spiritual. It is not a material phenomenon. It's a transcendental vibration. It has got a spiritual effect. Then further, Sri Aparvapa says, a chanter of hymns knew how to apply the weapon as well as how to retract it. See, that is the special thing about this, the science of subtle sound, that they knew how to release it and how to withdraw it also, retract it. That was perfect knowledge, but the son of Dronacharya, Ashwathama, was the one who knew how to release it and how to withdraw it also, retract it. That was perfect knowledge, but the son of Dronacharya, Ashwathama, who made use of the subtle science did not know how to retract. That was mentioned earlier itself, that he did not know how to retract. He applied it being afraid of his imminent death, and thus the practice is not only improper but also irreligious. So Ashwathama has improperly used this Brahmastra, and it is also described here as

irreligious. It is against the principles of religion. As the son of a Brahmana, he should not have made so many mistakes. It all began with what? Ashwathama beheading the sons of Draupadi while they were sleeping, totally irreligious, totally against all the codes of Dharma Yudha, but after that, he realized that Arjuna is going to actually punish him for it, so he tried to escape, but he could not escape, and now he is trying somehow to save himself by this Brahmastra, so he made so many mistakes, and for such gross negligence of duty, he was to be punished by the Lord himself. Krishna himself would punish this Ashwathama. So this is the description here is in these three verses. Now Arjuna has come to know it is Ashwathama who has released the Brahmastra, and Krishna is now going to direct Arjuna to actually retract that Brahmastra which was released by Ashwathama because Ashwathama did not know how to retract it.

So Krishna will now instruct Arjuna to do it. See, Arjuna was having proper knowledge of this Brahmastra, how to use, how to release, and how to retract both. Now Arjuna is going to retract the Brahmastra. That's the next few verses describing this entire incident. There are a lot of lessons to be learned from this particular incident being described here in the beginning of the Bhagavatam when Suta Goswami is narrating the events leading to Pariksit meeting with Shukadev Goswami where he inquired about this subject matter of Bhagavatam.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the context of Suta Goswami narrating the Bhagavatam to the sages, highlighting their eagerness to hear about Krishna and the events following the Battle of Kurukshetra, specifically the actions of Ashwatthama.

That is the beginning of the first chapter of this canto opening. So the topics have been developed up to this point that the sages of Naimisha Ranya were very eager to hear about Krishna. Therefore, Suta Goswami decided that he is going to speak the... narrate the Bhagavatam which he heard from Sukadeva Goswami when Sukadeva Goswami was speaking to Parikshit Maharaj. So that will come in the second canto. But in the first canto when Suta Goswami says because you are very interested in hearing about Krishna let me narrate the Srimad Bhagavatam to you which is exclusively describing Krishna... recommends for those who want to develop their Krishna consciousness very very quickly, then you should hear or read or study these two scriptures Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam. So, in the Bhagavatam the opening of the description of the topics of Krishna begin with the end of the Battle of Kurukshetra. And what happened this incident particularly that the sleeping sons of Draupadi were beheaded by Aswatthama, the son of Dronacharya. And it is stated that the sleeping sons of Draupadi were beheaded by Aswatthama, the son of Dronacharya, and it is totally against the principles of Dharma Yuddha. So, now when Arjuna came to know about it, he wants to punish this Ashwatthama. So, Arjuna has chased Ashwatthama. Ashwatthama's horses have become tired when he tried to escape and he raised the Brahmastra. He doesn't know how to retract it. And now, Arjuna has asked Krishna, what is the source of this intense radiation that is spreading everywhere? What is the source of this? What is the cause of this? And Arjuna, of course, has offered nice prayers to Krishna. And now Krishna is replying

**Key Quote:** "O Arjuna, only another Brahmastra can counteract this weapon. Since you are expert in the military science, subdue this weapon's glare with the power of your own weapon."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Krishna's instructions to Arjuna regarding the Brahmastra released by Ashwatthama, emphasizing Arjuna's expertise in military science and the power of the Brahmastra.

in this 28th verse, The meaning of this verse is, O Arjuna, only another Brahmastra can counteract this weapon. Since you are expert in the military science, subdue this weapon's glare with the power of your own weapon. In the previous verse, Krishna had explained the source of this radiation as the Brahmastra released by Ashwatthama in order to save his life, his own life. And Krishna also informed Arjuna, this Ashwatthama doesn't know how to retract this. So, it's very dangerous, this radiation of the Brahmastra he has released. So, only another Brahmastra can counteract this radiation. So, only another Brahmastra can counteract it, because he does not know how to retract it. So, you should actually subdue that weapon, that Brahmastra released by Ashwatthama by releasing another Brahmastra, because you know the science. So, Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport, For the atomic bombs, there is no counterweapon to neutralize the effects. We have heard of atomic bomb, and particularly at the end of the Second World War, America bombed Japan, and there was so much of destruction, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, so much. And the after effects were horrible. But this Brahmastra, even though it has the power to neutralize the effects, it has the power to neutralize the effects. So, it is a very powerful weapon. Like an atom bomb, of course, the power of Brahmastra is many millions of times more than that of the atom bomb. But Brahmastra can be targeted at a very specific target, can be released to destroy a particular target only. That is the complete science of this bomb. So, it is a very powerful weapon.

So these are all Upavedas and they are highly developed branch of different Vedas. So these are all Upavedas and they are highly developed branch of different sciences. So Dhanurveda, Arjuna knew Dhanurveda, he had studied that under Dronacharya. A Kshatriya should know this Dhanurveda, should learn this because for maintaining law and order, this violence is required and it has to be very, very carefully utilized. Kshatriyas were very responsible. The Brahmanas, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas were very, very responsible, very intelligent in their own fields and they were trained up, they were trained up in a Gurukul to properly learn and also responsibly utilize this knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "Hearing this from the personality of Godhead, Arjuna touched water for purification and after circumambulating Lord Sri Krishna, he cast his Brahmastra weapon to counteract the other one."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts atomic bombs with Brahmastra, emphasizing the ability to counteract the latter, and describes Arjuna's actions following Krishna's instructions, as narrated by Suta Goswami.

The lay of knowledge to really know the truth. So, Atomic Bombs, it's very rude. Once it is released, there is no counteraction to neutralize the effect of that. But by certain signs, the action of a Brahmaswara can be counteracted. And those who were expert in military science in those days, could counteract the Brahmaswara, those who were expert in military science, Arjuna was expert. This how to release the Brahmastra he did not know how to counteract it or how to retract it he didn't know whereas Arjuna he knew completely how to use the Brahmastra so therefore Krishna is instructing Arjuna you should counteract this Brahmastra released by Swarthama by releasing another Brahmastra Srila Prabhupada says the son of Dronacharya did not know the art of counteracting the weapon and therefore Arjuna was asked to counteract it by the power of his own weapon Arjuna was asked to do it because Arjuna knew how to do it so this Dhanurveda is a very very advanced science of using weapons and it is a subtle science because simply by chanting a mantra after sanctifying oneself by touching water one can actually release different types of astras against different targets and very very specific and precise in fact the astra will go and search out for the target wherever the target is so that is the power of the astra this weapon which is released by mantra it is This unknown, this science is unknown, yet unknown to the modern scientists. They do not know this. And in the 29th verse, Suta Goswami is narrating this to the Sages of Nainisharanya. Suta Goswami is telling what happened next. Shrutva Bhagavata Proktam Falguna Paraviraha Falguna refers to Arjuna. Sprishtva Apahatam Parikramya Brahamam Brahmastram Sandadhe The meaning of this 29th verse, Sri Suta Goswami said, Hearing this from the personality of Godhead, Arjuna touched water for purification and after circumambulating Lord Sri Krishna, he cast his Brahmastra weapon to counteract the other one. So, Arjuna, following Krishna's direction, instruction, he did exactly what Krishna told him. Krishna told him, release another Brahmastra to counteract the one released by Ashwathama. So, Arjuna did that.

**Summary:** The speaker praises the wealth of knowledge in the Vedas and Puranas, highlighting the power of the Brahmastra and Krishna's guidance to Arjuna to neutralize its effects, ending with a thank you and Hare Krishna.

Now, Srila Prabhupada also praises, the wealth of knowledge in the Vedas and Puranas. Every branch of knowledge relevant for human society is there in the Vedas and Puranas. And it is perfect knowledge coming from the perfect source, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Originally, the Vedas and Puranas were handed down to Brahma at the beginning of creation. Tene Brahma hrudaya adikavaye muhyantiyat surayaha In the beginning of Bhagavatam, it is described, Brahma received this knowledge and it is coming down in parampara. So, this knowledge is perfect knowledge. See how now, Arjuna is going to counteract that Brahmastra, that Brahmastra was released by. Because, the Brahmastra's power is that it can destroy a whole universe. Not just this atomic bomb, at most it can destroy one planet. But, a Brahmastra can destroy the whole universe. Millions of planets it can destroy. So, it is, if he has released it without aiming at any specific target, this foolish Ashwatthama, then Krishna is actually telling Arjuna, counteract it and neutralize the effect of the Brahmastra. So, that no damage will be done at all. That is the idea. Nobody will be harmed by that when Arjuna counteracts it and retracts both of them. And that's what will be described in the next verse.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the location of Vyasa Deva's ashram and introduces the fourth verse, explaining that Vyasa Deva saw Krishna and His external energy in meditation.

Vyasa Deva concentrated his mind in that transcendental place of meditation. If you remember, in the previous session, we discussed about that place, Samyaprasa, where Vyasa Deva's Ashramam Prasadeva place gave ashram was located on the western bank of the river Saraswati, and the place is the most suitable for spiritual activities. So there, Vyasa Deva sat down for concentrating his mind in meditation on the supreme Lord. Text number four, the fourth verse in the same chapter, seventh chapter, first canto of Bhagavatam: Bhakti Yogena Manasi Samyak Pranihi. The meaning of this verse is thus: he fixed his mind perfectly, engaging it by linking it in devotional service or bhakti yoga without any tinge of materialism, and thus he saw the absolute personality of Godhead along with his external energy which was under full control. What did Vyasadeva see or have vision of in the meditation? He was able to see both the Supreme Lord Krishna along with Krishna's external energy, Maya, which was under full control, tadapashrayam, under full control. So, Srila Prabhupada has given a very

long introduction to this verse. Perfect vision of the absolute truth is possible only by the linking process of devotional service. Yoga means a linking process. Right now, our present condition is we are forgetful of our relationship with the supreme, of our link with the Supreme Lord Krishna, so to reestablish that forgotten relationship or revive that lost connection is the process of yoga. Among the different process of yoga, to have complete vision of the Absolute Truth as the Supreme Personality of God, Krishna, is only possible by Bhakti. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita, Bhaktiamam Abhijanati. Only by Bhakti we can have vision of Krishna or know Krishna or realize Krishna. There is no other process. This also confirmed in the Bhagavad Gita. One can perfectly realize the Absolute Truth only by the process of devotional service, and one can enter into the kingdom of God by such perfect knowledge. This is what Bhagavad Gita says: Bhaktiamam Abhijanati Yavanyas Chasmi Tatvatah. Tatomam Tatvatah Vishatetad Anantaram. One can enter into the kingdom of God, kingdom of Krishna, after perfectly getting knowledge about the Absolute Truth as the Supreme Personality of God, Krishna.

But this realization of the Absolute Truth as impersonal Brahman or localized Paramatma does not permit a the transcendentalist to enter into the kingdom of God. Shri Narada advised Vyasa Deva to become absorbed in transcendental meditation on the personality of Godhead and his activities. Specifically, Narada instructed Vyasa Deva that the activities of the Supreme Lord, Haricharya, are completely transcendental, enlivening to the Self, and they can bring about complete satisfaction of the Self while they can enlighten anyone about the Absolute Truth as the Absolute Personality of Godhead, the highest realization of the

Absolute Truth. So, Srila Vyasa Deva did not take notice of the effulgence of Brahman because that is not absolute vision. The realization of the Absolute Truth as Bhagavan includes realization of the Absolute Truth as Brahman and Paramatma. Bhagavan is complete realization, whereas Brahman or Paramatma is incomplete realization. This is explained in beginning of the Bhagavatam itself. The absolute vision is the personality of Godhead, as is confirmed in the Bhagavad Gita, Vasudeva Sarvamiti. In the Bhagavad Gita, this is explained. In the Upanishads also, it is confirmed that Vasudeva, the personality of Godhead, is covered by glowing golden, glowing Hiranmayena Patrena, veil of impersonal Brahman. In the Isha Upanishad, it is stated Hiranmayena Patrena satyasya Api hitam. Syajnibayurapha dē sister maya Krishnye alternates the Nairanbur-kirtan is removed by the mercy of the Lord. The real face of the absolute is seen.

Similarly, the Supreme Lord Krishna, his effulgence, personal effulgence is the Brahmajyoti. That Brahmajyoti doesn't enable anybody who is focused on the Brahmajyoti alone to be able to see the Supreme Lord Krishna. The absolute is mentioned here as Purusha or person, Apashyat Purusham Purnam, Purna Purusha, the supreme or the perfect or the complete personality. The absolute personality is mentioned in so many Vedic literatures and in the Bhagavad Gita

**Summary:** The speaker introduces Krishna's energies, focusing on the internal and external energies, and explaining that the external energy keeps living entities in ignorance.

the Purusha is confirmed as eternal original person. In 10th chapter, it is said very clearly, it is described in the Bhagavad Gita. The absolute personality of Godhead is the perfect person. Why is this being described in so detail? It's because the subject of the Bhagavad Gita is the perfect person. Why is this being described in so detail? It's because the subject matter of the Srimad Bhagavatam is Krishna, the supreme personality of Godhead, who is the absolute personality, the absolute truth in the highest realization or highest aspect of the absolute truth. The complete perfect aspect of the absolute truth. Now that Supreme person Krishna has manifold energies. She has many, many, many varieties of energies, out of which the internal, external, and marginal energies are specifically important. Three categories of energies are very important. The energy mentioned here is the external energy, as will be clear from the statements of her activities. Energy is feminine. The Supreme Lord is the only masculine personality. Energy is feminine. And how do we know that the energy is specifically the external energy? By the statement of her activities that we described in the next few verses. The internal energy is there along with the absolute person as moonlight is there with the moon. Internal energy is always feminine. This is the Supreme Lord. The external energy is compared to darkness because it keeps the living entities in the darkness of ignorance.

**Key Quote:** "The external energy is the inferior energy. It is responsible for ignorance."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the two types of Maya, the external (inferior) and internal (superior/spiritual), explaining their effects on living beings.

The word apashrayam suggests that this energy of the Lord is under full control. This maya is the external energy which is the cause of the living beings to be in the darkness of ignorance. And when one realizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then one comes to the light of knowledge, spiritual knowledge, transcendental knowledge. The internal potency or superior energy is also called maya, but it is spiritual maya. There are two kinds of maya or energies of the Supreme Lord. The external energy is the inferior energy. It is responsible for ignorance. And the superior energy, the spiritual energy, yoga maya, is actually always of the characteristic of knowledge, spiritual knowledge, spiritual enlightenment. This energy, internal energy or spiritual energy is exhibited in the absolute realm, in the spiritual world. When one is under the shelter of the internal potency, the darkness of ignorance, material ignorance is at once dissipated. Just like when you are in a dark room, you come to light, immediately darkness is dispelled. Light dispels darkness immediately. There is no possibility of darkness when there is light. Even those who are atma, rama or fixed in trance, take shelter of this maya, spiritual energy, internal energy. So, devotional service or bhakti yoga is the function of the internal energy.

**Key Quote:** "Devotional service or bhakti yoga is the function of the internal energy."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing that devotional service is a function of the internal energy and that realization of Krishna leads to unlimited transcendental bliss, ending with Hare Krishna and copyright information.

This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita: Mahatma Anastumam Partha Daivim Prakritimashritaha Bhajanti Ananya Manaso Gyatva Bhutadim Avyayam. Ananya Manaso Bhajanti. They engage in devotional service under the influence of the internal energy or the divine energy of the Supreme Lord, which is a spiritual energy. One under the shelter of the spiritual energy engages in devotional service. Such internal energy is even superior to the spiritual bliss attainable in the conception of impersonal Brahman. The impersonal Brahman is subordinate to the personality of Godhead. Similarly, the bliss derived by realizing the impersonal Brahman is very insignificant compared to the ocean of transcendental bliss by realizing the personality of Godhead, Krishna, the absolute personality of Godhead, Krishna. That is going to be elaborated in the Srimad Bhagavatam. This is the main subject of the Bhagavatam, Krishna. And realization of Krishna is realization of the unlimited transcendental bliss under the shelter of the spiritual potency of Krishna. I will stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "But the heat produced by the Brahmastra can destroy the whole cosmic situation."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the power of the Brahmastra described in the Srimad Bhagavatam and compares it to atomic energy, emphasizing its capacity for cosmic annihilation.

In this session we will be discussing from the 30th and the 31st verses of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Samhatya Anyonyam Ubhayoho Tejasi Sharasamvrute Aavrtya Rodhasi Khamcha Vavridhate Arka Vaknivat. The meaning of this verse is, this is the 30th verse. When the rays of the two Brahmastras combined, a great circle of fire, like the disk of the sun, covered all outer space and the whole firmament of planets. Arjuna has released the counteracting Brahmastra and the rays of the two Brahmastras combined. It was a great circle of fire, like the disk of the sun. So Prabhupada describes this in the purport. The heat created by the flash of a Brahmastra resembles the fire exhibited in the sun globe at the time of cosmic annihilation. Cosmic annihilation means the entire material existence itself is annihilated. The radiation of atomic energy is very insignificant in comparison to the heat produced by a Brahmastra. The atomic bomb explosion can at most blow up one globe. But the heat produced by the Brahmastra can destroy the whole cosmic situation.

**Key Quote:** "That no planet therefore is without living beings as less intelligent people tend to think."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the effects of the Brahmastra's heat on all planets, comparing it to the Samvartaka fire at the time of annihilation, and asserts that all planets are inhabited by living beings.

The 31st verse. Dhrishtva stratejas tu tayo ho tri lo kaan pradahan mahat. Dahya mana praja sarva saam vartakam amamsata. The meaning of this verse, the 31st verse. This verse. All the population of the three worlds was scorched by the combined heat of the weapons. Everyone was reminded of the Samvartaka fire which takes place at the time of annihilation. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport to his 31st verse. The three worlds, three lokan, three worlds are the upper, lower and intermediate planets of the universe. In the universe there are many planets but it is divided into three divisions. Upper, lower and the middle intermediate planets. Although the Brahmastra was released on this earth. The heat produced by the combination of both weapons covered all the universe. And all the populations and all the different planets began to feel the heat excessively and compared it to that of the Samvartaka fire. At the time of annihilation there is a big fire. That will be explained a little later by Srila Prabhupada further. But here he is telling that the combination of both the weapons produced excessive heat and everyone in all the planets began to feel the heat. So the conclusion is being made that no planet therefore is without living beings as less intelligent people tend to think. Less intelligent people they think that only the earth planet is having intelligent human beings. Other planets, they sometimes say there is no life or they say there are no intelligent people. But that's not correct. According to the understanding we get from the Vedas, the perfect knowledge source, there is life on all the planets. There is life on all the planets and there are intelligent beings on all planets.

**Key Quote:** "This fire will take place on account of the heat increase in the atmosphere."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the Samvartaka fire, describing the conditions leading to universal annihilation, including increased solar heat and the subsequent burning of everything to ashes.

The radiation heat of the radiation when both the brahmastras combined increased many fold because one weapon was released by Ashwatthama, another was released by Arjuna to counteract that first brahmastra on the instruction of Krishna. The heat was so terrible, the human oprajasa. All the inhabitants came to learn that. Inhabitants of the different planets, they felt the great heat produced by the two Brahmastras and what did they feel it like? Samvartakam amamsata, the Samvartaka fire, they felt it is like the Samvartaka fire that is explained in the shastra at the end when there is annihilation to take place, there will be no rainfall, everything would be dry. There will be a great fire all over the universe that's called Samvartaka fire, and everything will be ablaze. This fire will take place on account of the heat increase in the atmosphere. There will be no rising or falling. This fire will take place on account of the heat increasing of the Sun. The Sun is actually like a ball of fire but because it is such a great distance from the earth we don't feel it like a blazing fire, we don't feel like that except in summer sometimes it becomes too hot but that is for a short duration and that is also something which you can tolerate but at the time of universal destruction what happens it is said that the present temperature the Sun will be increased twelve times so naturally there will be fire everything we ablaze in all the planets sometimes we have experience that there is a fire that will cause a fire, forest fire and especially in summer when everything is dry in the forest and the forest fire spreads very rapidly and then the animals which are trapped they will all be burnt alive the forest fire because whichever direction they go they see only fire so they cannot escape they'll be burnt similarly the fire will take place when the annihilation is supposed to happen and everything will be burnt to ashes this is the way the annihilation happens and after that there will be rain and PremierắngMagé Ngũi and that rain

**Key Quote:** "And by the grace of the Lord, another creation will begin afterwards."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the cyclical nature of destruction and creation, highlighting Arjuna's ability to retract the Brahmastras due to his knowledge of the science, preventing widespread destruction.

doislọ शर्द बत हम रै अगर अगर शर्द बत H Porter dieseगु अуш्छों अदमानित गर्म से उपदों withstand all the damage done the damage to ashus. Eивается we are burning ashes this is the way the annihilation happens and after that there will be rain and torrents non-stock the marin Ongment strata in, and that rain also. So it is described the intensity of the rain is like trunk of the elephant is falling water falling down is like huge trunk of an elephant and everything will be covered with water that is called pralaya. And by the grace of the Lord, another creation will begin afterwards. So this destruction that happens is cyclical. Creation, maintenance and destruction. This cyclically happens. But here, even though the combined heat of the two Brahmastras was like the Samvartaka fire, it was actually highly controlled. It is completely controlled. It was not intended for any destruction to take place. They just felt the heat for a moment because after this, it is described in the 32nd verse that Arjuna, at once, he retracted both the Brahmastra weapons as Lord Krishna desired. Arjuna did that. So he did not allow this heat to spread or this radiation to spread. He retracted both the Brahmastras and he knew the science perfectly. Arjuna knew the science and therefore he was able to retract both the Brahmastras by the knowledge of how to use that Brahmastra.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of learning from a qualified guru, particularly in the pursuit of Brahmavidya (spiritual knowledge), contrasting it with material knowledge and highlighting its significance.

Properly, it has to be learned. This Ashwatthama, he had not properly learned this. Therefore, the scripture's advice: if you want to learn a particular branch of knowledge, you have to approach a proper guru, one who is actually well versed in the knowledge. And among all the branches of knowledge, the most important branch of knowledge is called Brahmavidya, Radhyatmavidya, Atmavidya. So Atmavidya, and that is what Krishna is speaking in the Bhagavad Gita. At the end of every chapter of Bhagavad Gita, Vyasa Deva concludes by telling, Iti Srimad Bhagavad Gita Su Upanishad Su Brahmavidyaya. Brahmavidya. So Krishna is speaking the most important branch of the Vedic knowledge, that is Brahmavidya or Brahma Jnana, the spiritual science. Now all this Dhanurveda, everything is material knowledge. But this Brahmavidya, spiritual science, what is spirit? It is completely different from the matter and spirit is the basis for everything material. Matter has got its origin. Of course both matter and spirit are originally energies of the Supreme Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between material and spiritual energy, explaining how material energy manifests into the 24 elements and how living entities are spiritual beings, emphasizing the core teaching of the Bhagavad Gita.

He has many varieties of energies of which matter and spirit are two categories of energy. Matter means this material energy coming from material energy. The beginning of the creation material energy is differentiated by the glance of Mahavishnu into 24 elements and these 24 elements combined in different proportions and different combinations give rise to different objects, material objects, our own body, gross and subtle body, and then the different planets and the varieties of living conditions. Everything is made possible by the differentiation of material energy into the 24 elements and the combinations of the 24 elements. But spirit is different. Spirit is another energy, particularly the spirit, spiritual energy in the form of the living entity. Jeeva bhutam mahabaho yayedam dharyate jagat. The living entities belong to the category of spiritual energy and they are also spiritual. Every living being is a spiritual being, not the body. And that is the whole teaching of the Gita. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

Prajopadravam Alaksya Lokavyatikaram Chatham Matamcha Vasudevasya Sanjahararjuno Dwayam. The meaning of this verse: thus seeing the disturbance from the general populace and the imminent destruction of the planets, Arjuna at once retracted both Brahmastra weapons as Lord Sri Krishna desired. So Arjuna asked Krishna, when he saw the radiation in the sky spreading everywhere, what is the source of this radiation? Then Krishna explained how Ashwathama had released that Brahmastra out of fear for his own life and he did not know how to retract it. So it was very dangerous. And Srila Prabhupada explains that Brahmastra is like a nuclear weapon of modern times, but it is much, much more powerful. A Brahmastra can destroy an entire universe. So therefore, seeing the imminent destruction of the planets, Krishna actually advised Arjuna to retract both the Brahmastras by counteracting what Ashwathama had released, by Arjuna releasing his own Brahmastra simply to counteract, that's all, and retract both of them.

**Key Quote:** "Ultimately it all rests on the supreme will of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the power of atomic weapons is insignificant compared to the will of the Supreme Lord, who ultimately controls everything.

So exactly what Arjuna did, he at once retracted both the Brahmastra weapons and there was no more danger from that Brahmastra which Ashwathama had released. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "The theory that the modern atomic bomb explosions can annihilate the world is childish imagination." Why? Because Srila Prabhupada says, first of all, the atomic energy is not powerful enough to destroy the whole world. Secondly, ultimately it all rests on the supreme will of the Supreme Lord. Because without His will or sanction, nothing can be built up or destroyed. This we have heard many times, that ultimately everything is under the supreme control of the Supreme Lord. And unless He wills that there should be destruction of the entire world or the entire planet or the entire universe, till then it cannot be destroyed by anybody else. Not possible. So it is foolish also to think that natural laws are ultimately powerful. Yes, there are nature's laws working, but these laws are not blind. They are directed ultimately by the Supreme Lord. Krishna says this in the Bhagavad Gita, Mayadhyakshena prakritihi suyatesa characharam. Mayadhyakshena prakritihi suyatesa characharam. Mayadhyakshena prakritihi suyatesa characharam. By my superintendence, this material nature is working. It is Krishna's superintendence ultimately that is the basis for material nature to work. The laws are there, but the laws have got the law maker and that is the Supreme Lord, and the law enforcer, that is also the Supreme Lord. So without the Supreme Lord's sanction, without the Supreme Lord's enforcement, nothing will happen in this world. So therefore, natural laws are not ultimately powerful.

**Key Quote:** "Unless the Lord wills, it is not possible for anyone to destroy the entire world."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to emphasize the supreme power of the Lord and the insignificance of human power in comparison.

It is the supreme will of the Supreme Lord. So further Srila Prabhupada says, "Material nature's law works under the direction of the Gita as confirmed in the Bhagavad Gita." The Lord says there that natural laws work under His supervision. The words I quoted, Mayadhyakshena prakritihi suyatesa characharam. The world can be destroyed only by the will of the Lord and not by the whims of tiny politicians. After all, everyone in this world is a very, very insignificant person when compared to the supreme power of the Supreme Lord. So everybody is under control of the Supreme Lord and in front of the Lord's power, the power we possess is very, very insignificant. However powerful a person may appear to be in relationship with other persons, but ultimately, in comparison with the Supreme Lord's power, everyone is simply insignificant. So, as Srila Prabhupada says here, unless the Lord wills, it is not possible for anyone to destroy the entire world. Lord Sri Krishna desired that the weapons released by both Drauni and Arjuna—Drauni is Ashwathama, Dronacharya's son—Drauni and Arjuna be withdrawn, and it is carried out by Arjuna at once. So Krishna just instructed Arjuna and Arjuna did accordingly. That is Krishna's will. Similarly, there are many agents of the all-powerful Lord and by his will only can one execute what he desires, what Krishna desires.

So, Krishna has got many, many agents. The Devatas are all agents of Krishna only. Vishnubhaktas vruto daiva. All Devatas are Vishnubhaktas. So, according to Vishnu's order, Vishnu's instructions, Vishnu's directions, the Devatas are working perfectly. There is no reason to think that some insignificant person of this world can destroy the entire planet.

**Key Quote:** "Arjuna, his eyes blazing in anger, like two red balls of copper, dexterously arrested the son of Gautami and bound him with ropes, like an animal."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Arjuna's anger and his act of arresting Ashwatthama, explaining that it was part of his duty (dharma).

That never can happen. In the thirty-third verse, it is described, the meaning of this thirty-third verse is, "Arjuna, his eyes blazing in anger, like two red balls of copper, dexterously arrested the son of Gautami and bound him with ropes, like an animal. Pashumrashanayata." So, Arjuna was very angry against this Ashwatthama because Ashwatthama had killed the five sleeping sons of Draupadi. So, Arjuna was very angry against this. He was so angry against Ashwatthama. And therefore, Arjuna's description here is, his eyes blazing in anger like two red balls of copper. He was so angry, his red eyes had become so red. And Arjuna arrested this Ashwatthama. He did not kill him immediately. He arrested him. And how did he arrest him? He bound him up with ropes like an animal. Generally a human being is not bound up by ropes like that, but here the treatment meted out to Ashwatthama by Arjuna is justified by Srila Prabhupada in the purport. Srila Prabhupada says, "Ashwatthama's mother Krippi was born in the family of Gautama, so she is referred to as Gautami, and Ashwatthama is referred to as Gautami Sutam. The significant point in this shloka is that Ashwatthama was caught and bound up with ropes like an animal. According to Sridhar Swami, Arjuna was obliged to catch this son of a Brahmana like an animal as part of the ritual, as part of his duty, Dharma." So the Acharyas are explaining that Arjuna was just doing his duty.

**Key Quote:** "It was not wrong on the part of Arjuna to bind Ashwatthama with ropes like an animal."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to justify Arjuna's actions and introduces the next verse where Krishna will speak to Arjuna.

It was not wrong on the part of Arjuna to bind Ashwatthama with ropes like an animal. This suggestion by Sridhar Swami is also confirmed in the later statement of Sri Krishna. Later on Krishna also will tell the same thing. Ashwatthama was a bona fide son of Dronacharya and Krippi, but because he had degraded himself to a lower status of life, it was proper to treat him like an animal and not as a Brahmana. It is proper for Arjuna to have treated Ashwatthama in that way. And the 34th verse: Shibiraya Nini Shantam Rajwa Baddhwaripum Balat Praha Arjunam Prakupito Bhagavan Ambujekshanaha. The meaning of this 34th verse is, after binding Ashwatthama, Arjuna wanted to take him to the military camp. The personality of God is Sri Krishna looking on with his lotus eyes, spoke to angry Arjuna. So Arjuna wants to take him to the camp, their own military camp, but before that Krishna is now going to speak to Arjuna. And Krishna is described as looking on with his lotus eyes, and Arjuna, he was very angry. His eyes were red, two red hot balls of copper.

**Key Quote:** "Because Krishna is absolute, both his anger and pleasure are the same."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the difference between Arjuna's anger and Krishna's anger, emphasizing Krishna's transcendental nature and his concern for his devotees.

That's already described. In the Purport, Srila Prabhupada says that both Arjuna and Lord Sri Krishna are described here in angry mood, but Arjuna's eyes were like balls of red copper whereas the eyes of the Lord were like lotuses. What does this mean? This means that the angry mood of Arjuna and that of the Lord are not on the same level. Why? Because the Lord is transcendence and is absolute in any stage. Krishna is not affected by some moods or some influence of some event. He is unaffected under all circumstances at all times in all places. So he is transcendently situated, always, eternally. His anger, that is Krishna's anger, is not like the anger of a conditioned living being within the modes of qualitative material nature. When we become angry, we are influenced by the modes of material nature, Rajoguna, Tamoguna. Because Krishna is absolute, both his anger and pleasure are the same. His anger is not exhibited in the three modes of material nature. It is only a sign of his bent of mind towards the cause of his devotee, because that is his transcendental nature. Krishna felt for Arjuna because Ashwatthama had beheaded the sleeping sons of Draupadi. Draupadi is also Krishna's devotee. So Krishna was feeling for his devotee. Therefore, even if Krishna is angry, the object of anger is blessed. He is unchanged in all circumstances. This is Krishna's position. He is unaffected by any situation. He is always transcendently situated.

#### dharma, brahmana, qualification

**Verse References:** SB 1.7.35
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "That simply by birth in a Brahmin family, without qualification, nobody can become a Brahmana."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of verse 35, focusing on the term 'Brahma Bandhu' and emphasizing that being born in a Brahmin family does not automatically make one a Brahmana; qualifications are necessary.

The 35th verse: Mainam Partharhasitratum Brahma Bandhum Imamjahi Yosav Anagasa Suptan Avadheen Nishi Balakan. The meaning of this verse is: Lord Sri Krishna said, "O Arjuna, you should not show mercy by releasing this relative of a Brahmana, Brahma Bandhu, for he has killed innocent boys in their sleep." Krishna is justifying punishing Ashwatthama appropriately because Ashwatthama has killed innocent boys in their sleep. He is not observing the rules of Dharma Yudha. And he is being referred to as Brahma Bandhu, relative of a Brahmana. He is not a Brahmana. By his actions, he has proved otherwise. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The word Brahma Bandhu is significant." Ashwatthama being referred to as Brahma Bandhu is significant. A person who happens to take birth in the family of a Brahmana, but is not qualified to be called a Brahmana, is addressed as the relative of a Brahmana and not as a Brahmana. This is a very, very important point to be understood, that simply by birth in a Brahmin family, without qualification, nobody can become a Brahmana. Nobody can be called as a Brahmana. Brahmana is only if they are qualified, only if they have characteristics and qualities of a Brahmana.

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The son of a high court judge is not virtually a high court judge."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a high court judge's son to further illustrate that qualification, not just birth, is essential for being considered a Brahmana.

As described in the Shastra. Prabhupada gives an example: "The son of a high court judge is not virtually a high court judge, but there is no harm in addressing a high court judge's son as a relative of the honourable justice." So, Brahma Bandhu, because he is son of a Brahmana, he can be addressed as Brahma Bandhu. Therefore, as by birth only, one does not become a high court judge, so also, one does not become a Brahmana simply by birthright, but by acquiring the necessary qualifications of a Brahmana. So, qualifications are very important. In modern times, there are some people who claim to be Brahmana just by birth in the Brahmin family, but they don't have the qualifications. In the Bhagavad Gita, these qualifications are described, nine different qualifications: Shamo Damo Tapas Shoucam Shanti Rarjam Mevacha Gyanam Vigyanam Astikyam Brahma Karma Subhavajam. A Brahmana naturally works by these qualities: control of mind, control of senses. Shamo Damo Tapas Shoucam, Tapa is austerity, and Shoucam is cleanliness. Like that. So, a Brahmana has to have qualification. As the high court judgeship is a post for a qualified man, so also the post of a Brahmana is attainable by qualification only.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Shastra enjoins that even if good qualifications are seen in a person born in a family, other than that of a Brahmana, the qualified man has to be accepted as a Brahmana."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the shastras state that a person with Brahmanical qualities should be accepted as a Brahmana regardless of birth, and conversely, one born in a Brahmin family without the qualities should not be considered a Brahmana.

This is the Shastric injunction, but it is not understood properly or not enforced properly in modern times. The Shastra enjoins that even if good qualifications are seen in a person born in a family other than that of a Brahmana, the qualified man has to be accepted as a Brahmana. Yesiyal lakshanam proktam. That whatever the qualities that are seen in a particular person, irrespective of his birth in some family. Let's say somebody is born in a Vaishya family, but the person displays all qualities of a Brahmana, he has to be accepted as a Brahmana. That's what it is telling. The Shastras say like that. Similarly, if a person born in the family of Brahmana is void of Brahmanical qualification, he must be treated as a non-Brahmana, or in better terms, a relative of a Brahmana, Brahmabandhu. So, without qualification, nobody should be addressed as a Brahmana. And, there is sometimes protest by the so-called Brahmanas. If somebody born in a Vaishya family is referred to as a Brahmana because the person is qualified as a Brahmana, the others will protest. Lord Shri Krishna, the supreme authority of all religious principles, the Vedas, has personally pointed out these differences. Krishna actually explains this in several places, in several occasions, in stances, that only by qualification, we can call somebody a Brahmana.

**Key Quote:** "A person who knows the principles of religion...does not kill an enemy who is careless, intoxicated, insane, asleep, afraid or devoid of his chariot."
**Summary:** The speaker begins to explain verse 36, outlining the principles of religious warfare, stating that a Dharmavit (one who knows dharma) does not kill an enemy who is incapacitated or defenseless.

Or refer to somebody as a Brahmana. And a Brahmana, actually, even if he is qualified, he has to behave and conduct himself like a Brahmana. He should display those qualities which are mentioned in the scriptures. So, he is a Brahmana. Now, Krishna is about to explain the reason for referring to Ashwatthama as a Brahmabandhu in the next few shlokas. So, the 36th shloka is again spoken by Krishna: mattham pramatham unmattham suptam bhaatam kalam striyam jadam prapannam viratham bhitham naripum hanti dharmavit. The meaning of this 36th verse is that a person who knows the principles of religion, such a person is called dharmavit, does not kill an enemy who is careless, intoxicated, insane, asleep, afraid or devoid of his chariot. viratham, devoid of chariot; afraid, bheetham; asleep, suptam; then mattham, mattham means careless and pramatham intoxicated, unmattham insane. That's the shastric injunction. Nor does a person who knows the religious principles kill a boy, a woman, a foolish creature or a surrendered soul. Boy is balam, a woman is striyam, then jadam, one who is foolish and prapannam, one who is surrendered soul.

**Key Quote:** "Formerly battles were fought on the principles of religion and not for the sake of sense gratification."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the principles of Dharmayuddha (religious war), emphasizing that battles were formerly fought according to religious principles, not selfish desires, and highlighting Ashwatthama's violation of these principles.

So, there are strict principles by which a follower of religious principles conducts himself. So, Shri La Prabhupada explains in the purport, "An enemy who does not resist is never killed by a warrior who knows the principles of religion." Somebody may be designated as enemy, but if he if he is not ready for fighting or he does not resist when attacked then he should not be killed. Formerly battles were fought on the principles of religion and not for the sake of sense gratification. Religious principles, Dharmayuddha, Dharmavit, one who knows the principles of religion. Formerly it was fought like that. If the enemy happened to be intoxicated, asleep, etc. as above mentioned, he was never to be killed. Just like this Ashwatthama, he killed the sleeping sons. So, that somebody is sleeping, you should not kill them, even if they belong to enemy party. These are some of the codes of religious war, Dharmayuddha. Formerly war was never declared by the whims of selfish political leaders. It was carried out on religious principles free from all vices, no bad habits, no irreligious behaviour. So, that way Dharmayuddha used to take place in the former times. Violence carried out on religious principles is far superior to so called non-violence.

**Key Quote:** "Violence carried out on religious principles is far superior to so called non-violence."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the concept of violence versus non-violence, explaining that violence performed according to religious principles is superior to wrongly applied non-violence, using the example of Buddha's incarnation to stop indiscriminate animal killing.

Srila Prabhupada concludes this purport by telling one very important thing. Sometimes people think non-violence is to be practiced and followed, but that is got a specific situation where that non-violence has to be applied. When Buddha invented, people were indiscriminately killing animals in the name of Vedic sacrifice. So, that is when Buddha incarnated and he wanted to stop this animal killing. And the genuine followers of the Vedas of our scriptures they recognized and understood yes, animals should not be unnecessarily killed. So, a person who knows religious principles actually is always careful not to kill even the enemy when they are sleeping, when they are when they are without a chariot. If he is a chariot fighter, he has to be on a chariot. If he is without a chariot, they will never attack such a person. And in the course of a war, children and women are never, never, never killed. This is very, very important.

So, we come to know through all these instances described here how in former times the society was very, very highly developed and advanced in following all such religious principles. And these principles are very, very very practical to follow. It is not simply some theory alone. At least 5000 years back, there was strict adherence to the principles of religion by the followers of Dharma, especially the Brahmans, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas used to follow all the religious principles. They never would violate, generally, they never would violate. And therefore society was well organized and very, very peaceful. And the Kshatriyas always protect the citizens against attack by the Brahmans. Some foreign king or foreign person did not allow that the citizens were attacked. So therefore, the principles of religion were followed very strictly

in the former times. And when somebody engages in violence, these principles, when it is done, it is actually beneficial for everyone. It is never degrading anyone. And non-violence wrongly applied means there could be sinful reactions. That's what Krishna tells Arjuna in the fourth chapter of Bhagavad Gita.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the justification for capital punishment, arguing that it can prevent a murderer from suffering more severe consequences in hell.

So, Srila Prabhupada elaborately explains this in the purport: A life for a life is just punishment for a person who cruelly and shamelessly lives at the cost of others' lives. So much discussion nowadays is going on that punishment is not justified, capital punishment is to a for a murder, for a murderer. If the laws of the land punish him by giving him a punishment where he'll be able to become free from the reaction when is punished properly, appropriately, political morality is to punish a person by a death sentence in order to save a cruel person from going to hell. The punishment in hell is much, much, much, much more severe than just this death sentence now, because he has committed a murder or he has killed somebody unjustly. So instead of pardoning him and making him suffer in hell in future, it is better that he be punished now.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the idea that punishment purifies a person from their sins, potentially leading to promotion to heavenly planets.

That a murderer is condemned to a death sentence by the state is good for the culprit, because in his next life, he will not have to suffer for his act of murder. See, people sometimes say, I can't remember what all I did in my previous life. Why am I made to suffer now? That's because you have to suffer. You have done the mistake and you did not atone for it, nor you received punishment for the mistake you did. So neither you atoned nor you received punishment. Therefore, in the next life, you have to suffer the reaction. Such a death sentence for the murderer is the lowest, lowest possible punishment offered to him. You see, lowest possible punishment. And it is said in the Smriti Shastras that men who are punished by the king on the principle of life for a life are purified of all their sins. See, they became purified, even though they might have committed a very, very grievous sin of killing another person unjustly. So much so that they may be eligible for being promoted to the planets of heaven.

**Key Quote:** "Even the killer of an animal is to be considered a murderer...Animal food is never meant for the civilized man whose prime duty is to prepare himself for going back to Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Manu, stating that even killing an animal is considered murder and that animal food is not meant for civilized people focused on spiritual advancement.

So they are completely freed from the reaction of having committed that sin if they are punished appropriately. Now, something very, very important. Srila Prabhupada says, Here, according to Manu, the great author of civic codes and religious principles, Manu is a lawgiver for mankind. Even the killer of an animal is to be considered a murderer, killer of an animal. Nowadays, people are killing animals so much because animal food is never meant for the civilized man whose prime duty is to prepare himself for going back to Godhead. In a civilized society, when there is plenty of vegetables, fruits, grains, milk, why should people kill animals for food? That is the point being made here. Animal food is never meant for the civilized man. And especially civilized human beings are meant for preparing themselves to go back to Godhead. That is a precious opportunity in this human form of life. So Manu says that in the act of killing an animal, there is a regular conspiracy by the party of sinners and all of them are liable to be punished as murderers, exactly like a party of conspirators who kill a human being combinedly. Just like the state law, if a murder happens, it's not just the person who actually killed is punished. Even the others who may be hatching a conspiracy to kill and they engage somebody to kill. Even the conspirators are equally guilty of this murder. That is the state law. Similarly, in killing of an animal, all those who are responsible directly or indirectly for that animal killing will all actually be liable to be punished.

**Key Quote:** "He who gives permission, he who kills the animal, he who sells the slaughtered animal, he who cooks the animal, he who administers distribution of that foodstuff, animal flesh, and at last he who eats such cooked animal food are all murderers."
**Summary:** The speaker lists the six types of people involved in animal killing who are all considered murderers according to scriptures.

Now here, Prabhupada is quoting Manu that who are all liable to be punished when an animal killing happens? He who gives permission, he who kills the animal, he who sells the slaughtered animal, he who cooks the animal, he who administers distribution of that foodstuff, animal flesh, and at last he who eats such cooked animal food are all murderers. Six kinds of persons involved in animal killing are all murderers.

**Key Quote:** "Six types of people are liable to be punished when animal killing happens in a civilized human society...Because no one can create a living being despite all advancement of material science. And therefore, no one has the right to kill a living being by one's independent wills."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the culpability of those involved in animal killing, emphasizing that since humans cannot create life, they have no right to take it.

Even though actual killing is done by one person. But the others, I'll read this again. He who gives permission to kill the animal, somebody is rearing an animal, he actually sells that animal for animal slaughter. Or he may not sell it, but he says, Oh, now this animal is of no use to me. You may take it and you may do whatever you want. You can even kill it. No. He is not absolved of that sin of animal killing. So the person who gives permission, the person who kills the animal, obviously he is liable to be punished. He who sells the slaughtered animal, after the animal is killed, that flesh is sold for those who want to eat meat, animal flesh. He who cooks the animal, somebody is going to cook that meat, because human beings don't eat raw flesh, unlike tigers and lions and all those carnivorous animals, human beings eat cooked flesh. So somebody is cooking that flesh. And those who administer distribution of this cooked meat, somebody is engaged in distributing it. And at last, the person who eats cooked animal food are all murderers. Six types of people are liable to be punished when animal killing happens in a civilized human society. All of them are liable to be punished, by the laws of nature. Why? Because no one can create a living being despite all advancement of material science, and therefore, no one has the right to kill a living being by one's independent wills. We cannot create life, so we cannot kill.

#### Animal Sacrifice, Revival, Restrictions, Slaughterhouses

**Key Quote:** "For the animal eaters, the scriptures have sanctioned restricted animal sacrifices only...just to restrict the opening of slaughterhouses."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses animal sacrifice in yajnas, explaining that it was traditionally performed with the ability to revive the animal and that scriptures only sanction restricted animal sacrifices to prevent widespread slaughterhouses.

So, we should also understand, if an animal is sacrificed in a yajna, then that animal being sacrificed, it will be revived. After the sacrifice, the animal which was killed will be revived. It will be given a new life. How? By brahmanas who know how to chant mantras and actually give new life to a dead animal. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu explains, in a sacrifice, when an animal is killed for the sake of the sacrifice, such animal is given a new life. So, therefore, Srila Prabhupada says, in modern times, when they are killing animals, they are not reviving the animal, they don't know how to give new life, so they are liable to be punished. They cannot kill animals like that. For the animal eaters, the scriptures have sanctioned restricted animal sacrifices only. See, animal sacrifice is restricted. And such sanctions are there just to restrict the opening of slaughterhouses, just so that people don't systematically kill animals in a slaughterhouse. To prevent that, Shastras give a concession that under highly restricted conditions, an animal flesh eater may sacrifice an animal in a suitable animal sacrifice. It is not meant for encouraging animal killing. This animal sacrifice sanctioned in the scriptures is never meant for animal killing.

**Key Quote:** "The procedure under which animal sacrifices are allowed in the scriptures is both good for the animal sacrificed and also good for the animal eaters."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that animal sacrifice, when performed according to scriptural guidelines, benefits both the animal (by promoting it to a human form) and the meat-eater (by saving them from grosser sins).

The procedure under which animal sacrifices are allowed in the scriptures is both good for the animal sacrificed and also good for the animal eaters. That's the way the scriptures are advising the animal sacrifice to be performed by meat eaters. It's good for the animal in the sense that the sacrificed animal is at once promoted to the human form of life after being sacrificed. After being sacrificed at the altar, when the rules are followed for animal sacrifice, the animal is immediately promoted to the human form of life. It doesn't have to wait for gradual evolution to the human form. And the animal eater is saved from grosser types of sins eating meat supplied by organized slaughterhouses. One is never meant to purchase flesh from a slaughterhouse. No. If at all they want to eat, the sanction is there for animal sacrifice to be performed, and in that way, one may under restricted conditions indulge in meat eating.

**Key Quote:** "These slaughterhouses Srila Prabhupada describes here are ghastly places for breeding all kinds of material afflictions to society, country and the people in general."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by condemning slaughterhouses as sources of sinful reactions that lead to calamities and suffering in society, emphasizing the link between sinful activities and natural disasters.

Not otherwise. These slaughterhouses, Srila Prabhupada describes here, are ghastly places for breeding all kinds of material afflictions to society, country, and the people in general. When there is a slaughterhouse, there is a wholesale sinful reaction that the country, the society, the people in general have to suffer. So it is very, very dangerous to have a slaughterhouse. It's not good for the society. The material world is itself a place always full of anxieties, and by encouraging animal slaughter, the whole atmosphere becomes polluted more and more. How does it become polluted? By war, pestilence, famine, and many other unwanted calamities. Calamities are because people become sinful in this society. Otherwise, there will be no calamities. So there is a link between some calamity and natural calamity and the sinful activities indulged in by the people in general. So they are linked up. It is not something accident or by chance something happened. No. There is no chance, there is no accident in this world. That's what the scriptures explain. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Furthermore I have personally heard you promise Draupadi that you would bring forth the head of the killer of her sons."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains verse 38 of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on Arjuna's promise to Draupadi regarding Ashwatthama.

In this session, we will be discussing the 38th and the 39th verses of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 38th verse: Pratishrutam Chabhavata Panchalyei Shunvatomama Aharishye Shrastasya Yaste Maanini Putraha. The meaning of this verse is Krishna is telling Arjuna, "Furthermore, I have personally heard you promise Draupadi that you would bring forth the head of the killer of her sons." This was what Arjuna had told Draupadi when Draupadi informed Arjuna that Ashwatthama had killed her five sleeping sons. So what was it that Arjuna had promised? In the 16th verse of the same chapter, Arjuna had said, "O gentle lady, when I present you with the head of that brahmana, after beheading him with arrows from my Gandiva bow, I shall then wipe the tears from your eyes and pacify you. Then, after burning your sons' bodies, you can take your baths standing on his head." Arjuna was very angry, angry at the act of Ashwathama killing, beheading, just cutting off their head when they were sleeping, the five sleeping sons of Draupadi, totally against all principles of Dharma Yudha. And so if Arjuna had promised to Draupadi, that's what Krishna is reminding Arjuna, "I personally heard you promise Draupadi that you will bring forth the head of the killer of her sons."

**Key Quote:** "an enemy who sets fire to the house administers poison attacks all of a sudden with deadly weapons plunders wealth or usurps agricultural fields you or entices one's wife is called an aggressor such an aggressor though he be a Brahmana or a so-called son of a Brahmana has to be punished in all circumstances"
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's purport is explained, defining an aggressor and justifying the punishment of Ashwatthama, even though he is the son of a Brahmana.

Now Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "An enemy who sets fire to the house, administers poison, attacks all of a sudden with deadly weapons, plunders wealth, or usurps agricultural fields, or entices one's wife is called an aggressor. Such an aggressor, though he be a Brahmana or a so-called son of a Brahmana, has to be punished in all circumstances." So there's no question of sparing an aggressor; he has to be punished. When Arjuna promised to behead the aggressor named Ashwathama, he knew well that Ashwathama was a son of a Brahmana. Arjuna was quite aware who Ashwathama is; he's the son of Dronacharya, son of the teacher of Arjuna. But because the so-called Brahmana acted like a butcher, a butcher simply cuts off an animal which is meant for slaughter, so this Ashwatthama acted like a butcher. Therefore, Ashwatthama was taken as such, and there is no question of sin in killing such a Brahmana son who proved to be a villain. So there is no sin involved in killing an aggressor.

**Summary:** The speaker explains verse 39, where Krishna instructs Arjuna to kill Ashwatthama, emphasizing his crimes and degradation.

Krishna says, the meaning of this 39th verse: "This man is an assassin and murderer of your own family members. Assassin and murderer. Not only that, but he has also dissatisfied his master. He is but the burnt remnants of his family. Kill him immediately." So this is Krishna's instruction to Arjuna, that Krishna is telling, this Ashwatthama, he is a murderer of your own family members. He also dissatisfied his master. Who was Ashwathama's master? It was Duryodhana, and when Ashwathama revealed to Duryodhana that I have killed, and Duryodhana couldn't understand. This Ashwatthama has not fought against them and killed them in a fair battle. He has killed them while they were sleeping. So Duryodhana did not approve of this heinous act at all. Duryodhana was totally dissatisfied with this. He said, "You have not done the right thing." So therefore, Ashwathama is described as the burnt remnants of his family. He has completely degraded himself. Shamelessly has degraded himself. Therefore, Krishna tells Arjuna, "Kill him immediately. He deserves this kind of punishment." So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada

**Key Quote:** "Although Dronacharya joined the enemy camp, the Pandavas held him always in respect and Arjuna saluted him before beginning the fight."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's explanation of Dronacharya's respect and Arjuna's duty, even on opposing sides of the battlefield, is discussed.

explains, "The son of Dronacharya is condemned here as the burnt remnants of his family." How is Ashwathama the burnt remnants of his family? That's explained by Prabhupada. "The good name of Dronacharya was very much respected. Although Dronacharya joined the enemy camp, the Pandavas held him always in respect, and Arjuna saluted him before beginning the fight. There was nothing wrong in that way, fighting on the opposite sides." Arjuna is obviously on the Pandavas' side, but Dronacharya, he is the teacher of Arjuna. He is on the side of the Kauravas, the enemy side, but still Arjuna never lost any respect for Dronacharya, neither Dronacharya was having any inimical feeling towards Arjuna. That is explained by Srila Prabhupada. In another discourse, Prabhupada says, "Dronacharya, the teacher of Arjuna, is on the opposite side of the Pandavas, so Dronacharya had to be respected, and Arjuna did that." How did he do that? Before fighting with Dronacharya, Arjuna first of all threw one arrow on his lotus feet, indicating, "I am paying my obeisances to my teacher, my guru. This is called etiquette, my dear sir." Prabhupada explains, "You have taught me this fighting science, Dhanur Vidya, now it is being used against you because it is my duty to fight in this Dharma Yudha, so I offer my obeisances as a Kshatriya standing in the battlefield." How did Arjuna offer obeisances to Dronacharya? By shooting one arrow at the feet of Dronacharya. And Dronacharya also, he is a military teacher, he is standing ready for fighting against the enemy on the battlefield, and he is not ready to fight against the enemy on the Kaurava side, so what did Dronacharya do? He threw another arrow touching the head of Arjuna, "My dear boy, become blessed. I mean you have my blessings." That was Dronacharya indicated to Arjuna, and Srila Prabhupada explains, "This is duty."

**Key Quote:** "Fighting in a Dharma Yudha is a duty of a Kshatriya."
**Summary:** The concept of Dharma Yudha is explained, highlighting the duties of a Kshatriya and the blessings received in such a battle, followed by a discussion of cultural purification (Samskara).

"You are given blessings to kill me. Will anybody bless another person that you kill me? No, but this is in the matter of performing duty of fighting Dharma Yudha." This is called the Dharma Yudha. Why? Because in a Dharma Yudha, whether one is victorious or one is killed, either case, it is not fair to kill one or one is not, they are elevated to a higher status in their next life. That's why Dharma Yudha is duty. Fighting in a Dharma Yudha is a duty of a Kshatriya. That's what Krishna explains, sorry, Krishna explains in Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna, "Swadharmam, it is your Swadharma as a Kshatriya to fight in this Dharma Yudha." The disciple is fighting, touching the feet of Dronacharya. "It is my duty." And disciple is telling the teacher, "Please give me your blessing to fight." And Dronacharya, he is telling, "Yes, you have my blessings to fight in this Dharma Yudha." So continuing the purport of Srila Prabhupada, "But the son of Dronacharya degraded himself by committing acts which were never done by the dvijas or the twice-born higher castes." Who are the twice-born higher castes? The dvijas or twice-born higher castes belong to the first three varnas: Brahmana, Kshatriya, and Vaishya. They are the first birth from their parents, and there is a second birth. How is the second birth possible? By accepting the spiritual master as the father and Vedas as the mother. Veda Mata, Guru Pita. During the second birth, which is meant for beginning the learning of the Vedas, they go to Gurukul. In the Vedic culture, they are sent to Gurukul to be trained up. Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas. They are trained up by a qualified teacher, qualified Brahmana. This is called cultural purification, Samskara. It is called Samskara. It is cultural purification. Human life is meant for purification. So even by performing Samskaras, this purification happens.

**Key Quote:** "By birth from parents everyone is born a Shudra. But by spiritual initiation one becomes a Vidya."
**Summary:** The lecture continues with the importance of spiritual initiation and contrasts the act of killing in Dharma Yuga with the heinous murder committed by Ashwatthama, reiterating the justification for his punishment and concluding the discourse.

The scriptures declare, Janmana Jayate Shudra Samskarat Vijam Uchyate. So by birth from parents, everyone is born a Shudra, but by spiritual initiation, one becomes a Vidya. That initiation happens when one goes to a Guru and submits to the Guru, "I am your disciple. Please accept me as your disciple and train me, teach me Vedic knowledge." So continuing the purport, "Then murder by killing the five sleeping sons of Draupadi." This is murder. This is not like Kshatriya fights in a Dharma Yuga and kills the enemy. It is not like that. In that, there is no sin. It is not to be considered as murder, fighting in a Dharma Yuga. But here, the sleeping sons of Draupadi were killed by Ashwathama. And by this act of killing the sleeping sons of Draupadi, this Ashwathama dissatisfied his master Duryodhana. Duryodhana never approved of the heinous act of killing the five sleeping sons of the Pandavas. Now Duryodhana also was fighting the battle of Kurukshetra following the principles of Dharma Yuga. This is explained earlier by Krishna. Suptam means sleeping. One who is sleeping is not to be killed. So therefore, Ashwathama became an assaulter of Arjuna's family members, and thus he was liable to be punished by Arjuna. And therefore, Krishna tells Arjuna, "Now you must actually kill this aggressor Ashwathama. You should kill him."

Arjuna was a great soul, undoubtedly, which is proved here also. In many instances in the Mahabharata, it is clearly established the Pandavas who are pure devotees of Krishna. The Bhagavatam says any pure devotee is full of all good qualities, yes.

**Key Quote:** "Arjuna justified not killing ashwathama even though ashwathama deserved the death of krishna but he was not killed by krishna even though ashwathama deserved the death of krishna but he was not killed by krishna even though ashwathama deserved the death of krishna to be killed"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how Arjuna will justify his decision not to kill Ashwatthama, despite Ashwatthama's degraded actions and Krishna's encouragement to punish him.

All good qualities that have been found in demigods are fully present in a pure devotee. So Arjuna is proved in this particular incident, as we will see towards the end of this chapter, how Arjuna justified not killing Ashwatthama, even though Ashwatthama deserved the death of Krishna, but he was not killed by Krishna, even though Ashwatthama deserved the death of Krishna, but he was not killed by Krishna, even though Ashwatthama deserved the death of Krishna to be killed. Now Arjuna is being encouraged personally by the Supreme Lord Krishna to kill the son of Dronacharya, this Ashwatthama, who is a murderer of Arjuna's family members, but Arjuna considers that the son of his great teacher should be spared, for he happens to be the son of Dronacharya, even though he is an unworthy son. He has degraded himself. Arjuna, Ashwatthama has degraded himself. Why? Because Ashwatthama has done all sorts of heinous acts whimsically for no one's benefit. What did he gain by doing this?

**Summary:** The speaker questions the appropriate punishment for Ashwatthama and highlights the difficulty in performing one's duty as a devotee, requiring careful consideration of the situation.

Ashwatthama did not gain anything. He could not please his master. He didn't do the right thing. He was an aggressor, assassin, murderer, breaking the principles of kathriya conduct in a dharma yudha. So he's definitely punishable. But what punishment? That is the question. Krishna told Arjuna, "You should kill him. He should not spare his life." But Arjuna is thinking, "How can I kill the son of my teacher whom he held in respect?" Now Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "Lord Sri Krishna encouraged Arjuna outwardly just to test Arjuna's sense of duty." Arjuna's sense of duty, what is his duty? In every circumstance, a devotee performs his duty. In every circumstance, in doing duty is the only thing that is difficult in doing the duty of your devotee.

Duty, there is always a consideration, how should I act in my position in terms of doing my duty. Now Arjuna should not simply let go Ashwatthama. Arjuna has to punish as a matter of duty. At the same time, in doing the duty, he has to consider what kind of punishment does this son of the teacher of Arjuna deserve? What kind of punishment does he deserve? Does he deserve the punishment of being killed or some other punishment? There is no doubt that he has to be punished as a matter of duty. Arjuna has to punish Ashwatthama. But what kind of punishment? That is elaborately discussed in the rest of the chapter. It is not that Arjuna was incomplete in the sense of his duty, nor was Lord Sri Krishna unaware of Arjuna's sense of duty.

Krishna knew Arjuna is aware of his duty and he will act responsibly. This is the difference between a devotee and a non-devotee. A non-devotee under all circumstances acts responsibly. A non-devotee may or may not be responsible in all his actions, because a non-devotee under the influence of the glaring material energy is carried away sometimes and will fail in properly doing his duty or fail in taking responsibility. That we have to note. So unless one is a devotee of Krishna,

Krishna when he descends, he descends with his pure devotees, and the pure devotees teach by their exemplary actions, as much as Krishna himself teaches by his instructions and by his actions which he performs in his role. When he does a, plays a role, then Krishna performs his duties or activities perfectly, just to teach us. Now Srila Prabhupada gives the example of pure devotees who were put to test by Krishna and they came out successful. The gopis were put to such tests as well. Not only Arjuna is being tested by Krishna now, earlier the gopis also were put to such tests. Prahlad Maharaj was also put to such a test. All pure devotees come out successful in their respective tests by the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates how Hiranyakashipu became angry with Prahlad for chanting the name of Vishnu and tortured him for it.

So, Prahlad Maharaj appeared as the son of Hiranyakashipu. And when Hiranyakashipu came to know this son Prahlad of his is actually chanting the name and glorifying Vishnu, so he became, Hiranyakashipu became very angry against Prahlad. Said, "Don't ever utter even the name of my enemy." Why did Hiranyakashipu consider Vishnu as his enemy? Because Vishnu had killed Hiranyakashipu, Hiranyakashipu's elder brother. So therefore Hiranyakashipu thought Vishnu is my enemy. And he just told Prahlad, "Don't ever utter." But Prahlad as a devotee, he would always chant the name of the Supreme Lord because he is a devotee. Devotee always chants the names of the Supreme Lord. So Hiranyakashipu became more and more angry and he tried to stop his son, but he could not, to the extent that Prahlad was tortured by his father Hiranyakashipu just because Prahlad was chanting the holy name of the Supreme Lord. That's all.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam describing Draupadi's reaction to Ashwatthama being brought before her after he murdered her sons.

Om Agyana Timiran Dhasya Gyanan Janishalakaya Chapsharun Miritam Yena Tasmai Shri Gurave Namaha Nama Om Vishnupadaya Krishna Preshtaya Bhutale Shri Mate Bhaktivedanta Swamin Nithinamine Namaste Saraswate Deve Gauravani Pracharine Nirvishesha Shunyavadi Pachatyade Shatarine Jaya Shri Krishna Chaitanya Prabhu Nithyananda Shri Advaita Gadadhara Shiva Sadi Gauravhakta Vrinda Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasa Tato Jaya Mudeerayet.

The meaning of this verse is: Sri Suta Goswami said, this is Suta Goswami speaking, Draupadi then saw Ashwathama who was bound with ropes like an animal and silent for having enacted the most inglorious murder. Due to her female nature and due to her being naturally good and well behaved, she showed him due respects as a brahmana.

**Key Quote:** "Draupadi then saw Ashwatthama who was bound with ropes like an animal and silent for having enacted the most inglorious murder due to her female nature and due to her being naturally good and well behaved she showed him due respects as a brahmana"
**Summary:** The speaker explains Draupadi's behavior of showing respect to Ashwatthama despite his heinous crime, contrasting it with Arjuna's treatment of him as a culprit.

So this verse is describing when Ashwatthama was brought bound up by Krishna, sorry, bound up by Arjuna. Both Krishna and Arjuna had gone in Arjuna's chariot, Krishna as the charioteer, chasing Ashwatthama who was trying to run away after having enacted the most inglorious murder. Ashwatthama had killed the five sleeping sons of Draupadi, and it was condemned even by his master, Ashwatthama's master, Duryodhana, because Duryodhana was fighting the battle on religious principles. So what are the Pandavas? So in such a battle, to kill somebody who is just sleeping, that is already explained earlier, it is not proper to kill somebody who's sleeping like that even though the person is on the enemy camp. It doesn't matter. Now here, Ashwatthama was bound with ropes like an animal, but what is Ashwatthama's position? Ashwatthama was bound up because he did not behave like a Brahmana. He did not behave like a Brahmana even though he is the son of a Brahmana, son of Dronacharya, son of the Acharya, teacher, military teacher of Arjuna, and he deserves to be respected as such, but he behaved in a most degrading manner. He degraded himself, so therefore Arjuna bound him up. But when he was brought in front of Draupadi, she showed him due respects as a Brahmana. See the difference in the way Draupadi looks at Ashwatthama and the way Ashwatthama is actually looked at by Arjuna after his having committed the most inglorious murder. So Srila Prabhupada explains...

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of Vedic culture and the training of the upper classes in proper behavior and etiquette.

in the purport, Ashwatthama was condemned by the Lord himself. Krishna told Arjuna he doesn't deserve to be respected as such, but he deserves to be excused because he has committed the most inglorious murder, has degraded himself, and even Ashwatthama was treated even by Arjuna just like a culprit, not like the son of a Brahmana or teacher. But then when the same Ashwatthama was brought in front of Srimati Draupadi, although she was very much aggrieved for the murder of her sons, the murderer was present before her, and in spite of all this, she could not withdraw the due respect generally offered to a Brahmana or the son of a Brahmana.

**Key Quote:** "women as a class are no better than boys and therefore they have no discriminatory power like that of a man so according to vedic civilization because of the mild nature of a woman she must be protected she must be protected"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the Vedic perspective on women, emphasizing their mild nature and the need for protection to guide them towards goodness.

of the members, especially the members of the upper three classes, because they trained up, the Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas are trained up in proper behavior, proper etiquette, in the right, in the necessary skill to be acquired for them to do their profession, to earn their livelihood by their profession, by properly getting trained and acting responsibly in the society. So that is not there in the present time so much. It's not there. Whatever little culture remains, we still see in this great country, Bharatvarsha. We still see the remnants of the culture, but actually the training that should really happen is not happening. So Shrila Prabhupada says in the purport that Draupadi knew that Ashwatthama was actually a murderer, and she herself was directly affected. All her five sons were killed most ingloriously by Ashwatthama. In spite of that, she did not withdraw the due respect that is offered to such a brahmana or a son of a brahmana according to the very culture, according to the way she is trained up in the culture. Now it is also explained this is due to her mild nature as a woman. Their mild nature, women as a class are no better than boys, and therefore they have no discriminatory power like that of a man. So according to vedic civilization, because of the mild nature of a woman, she must be protected. She must be protected. So if they are protected, they can be led to goodness very easily, and if they are not protected, they can be polluted very easily also. That is a position of a woman.

**Key Quote:** "just like a child if you mold the character of a child from the very beginning then such a child can grow up to be a great personality either a man or a woman"
**Summary:** The speaker highlights the importance of training and character development from a young age, emphasizing that everyone is born into ignorance and needs guidance.

Just like a child, if you mold the character of a child from the very beginning, then such a child can grow up to be a great personality, either a man or a woman. If you train a woman from the very beginning how to become chaste and faithful to the husband, they can become a very good mother, a very good asset in the family, because the whole family life is especially meant for begetting good children. So unless the woman is chaste and faithful to the husband and is trained up, it will not be possible to beget good children. So this point of training, whether man or woman, both have to be trained. Janmana jayate shudra samskara vijam ucyate. This is also very important. Man or woman, by birth, nobody is generally qualified. I mean, generally, I mean somebody who's born under the force of karma, they are getting a body, a material body because of their past karma, so they have to be trained up. It doesn't matter even though they are born in a brahmin family, doesn't matter, but they have to be trained up. Untrained means they remain shudra, they remain ignorant, they remain ignorant, they remain purified, they remain into the transcendental. That is the number ignorant. By birth, everybody is born into ignorance. That is explained in the Bhagavad Gita.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the Vedic system of training for both men and women, emphasizing the ultimate aim of connecting with Krishna through yoga.

So everyone is born into ignorance, but they can be trained up. So that is a whole system in the Vedic culture to train up whether man or woman, everybody has to be trained up. So Srila Prabhupada says there is sufficient information in the Vedic literature how a man should be trained up, how a boy should be trained up, how a girl should be trained up, so that in future they may become happy, and what is that ultimate aim of life? How to become connected with Krishna as spirit soul. It doesn't matter whether you are a man or a woman, matter whether somebody is born as the son of a Shudra or a daughter of a Vaishya, it doesn't matter. They can be trained up. Everyone, every human being at least, can be trained up to understand the ultimate aim of life is to become connected with Krishna. That's called yoga. That specific science of yoga is taught by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. In the fourth chapter, Krishna says, imam vivasvate yogam proktavanaham avyayam. Krishna is telling, I taught the science of yoga to vivasva, and now I am going to teach you. He is telling Arjuna that same science of yoga. So that science of yoga is that actually each one of us, every spirit soul, every living being is connected with Krishna, and that connection is called yoga, and therefore ultimately one has to learn about who am I, who is Krishna, what is my relationship?

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of chanting Hare Krishna in Kali Yuga as the most effective way to cleanse the heart and attain knowledge and devotion.

This is what Chaitanya Mahaprabhu teaches as the fundamentals of the Vedic knowledge. There are so many departments and so many details, but we should learn this fundamental thing. You should not miss out this ultimate aim to connect with Krishna. So therefore Srila Prabhupada says that in this Kali Yuga, to get into the details of all these different divisions or branches of knowledge is not practically possible. There is no time, there is no inclination, there is no proper gurukul system to teach all those details according to the candidate, according to the circumstances. No, simply Chaitanyama would taught, chant Hare Krishna, chant Hare Krishna, and then by chanting Hare Krishna, all the knowledge will be revealed within the heart, and the heart becomes cleansed. By chanting Hare Krishna, all that knowledge will be rehealed and everything will become first-class when one becomes a devotee by chanting Hare Krishna. I will stop here. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

Did Arjuna not know that Ashwatthama is a Brahmana and he's a son of Dronacharya, Arjuna's own teacher, military teacher? Now Prabhupada explains, Ashwatthama arrested, sorry, Arjuna arrested Ashwatthama knowing perfectly well that he was a son of Dronacharya. Krishna also knew him to be so, but both of them condemned the murderer without consideration of his being the son of a Brahmana. This is exactly according to revealed scriptures that a teacher or spiritual master is liable to be rejected if he proves that he is the son of a Brahmana.

**Summary:** The speaker defines the role of a Guru and Acharya, emphasizing the importance of living by example and assimilating scriptures, and reiterates that Ashwatthama's actions warranted rejection from his position, contrasting Krishna and Arjuna's view with Draupadi's.

himself unworthy of the position of a guru or spiritual master. This is what the scripture is saying. The Guru is offered very high respect, but if he proves himself unworthy of the position of a guru. Now the position of the guru is very, very exalted. Guru is also called an acharya or a guru or a person who has actually assimilated all the essence of shastras and he also helps his disciples to adopt the ways of the scriptures. That is the position of guru, especially in the spiritual matters. This is specially applicable in spiritual matters when you say acharya, one who teaches by example, one who has assimilated the essence of the scriptures, one who teaches his disciples whatever that essence of the shastra is by personally training, instructing, giving very good instructions, and the disciple also is actually surrendered to the spiritual master and inquires from him about this wisdom, serves him in a submissive mood, he makes inquiries. So all this is there, but now in the case of Ashwatthama, here it is said Ashwatthama failed to discharge the duties of a Brahmana or teacher, why? Because he committed the most inglorious murder and therefore he was liable to be rejected from the exalted position of a Brahmana. On this consideration, both Lord Sri Krishna and Arjuna were right in condemning Ashwatthama. Both Krishna and Arjuna, they didn't treat Arjuna, Ashwatthama as a Brahmana, why? Because Ashwatthama had fallen down from his position and he was liable to be rejected as a Brahmana, but for Draupadi the matter was

considered not from the angle of shastric vision, but as a matter of custom. It is customary to offer the same respect that is offered to the father is offered to his son, especially when the father is a teacher, a brahmana, deserves all respects. So the son is also offered similar respect, that is a custom. Why? Because people generally accept the son of a brahmana as a brahmana. But the shastras say the son of the brahmana, if he is not qualified as a brahmana, he should not be accepted as a brahmana. You see, a lakshanam proktam. This is the verse in the Bhagavatam. Whatever the symptoms that are displayed by a person irrespective of the family in which he is born, irrespective of whose son he is, if he displays the symptoms of a shudra, he should be accepted as a shudra. In terms of social interaction, what is the respect that is due? What is the respect that is due? The respect that is due to a brahmana who is qualified is different. The respect that is due to a shudra who is not qualified as a brahmana but having the symptoms of a shudra is different. So Draupadi accepting Ashwathama who has degraded himself, behaved in the most degrading manner in killing Draupadi's own sons in a most inglorious way. He is a murderer. He is a criminal. So he should not be treated like a brahmana.

**Key Quote:** "Arjuna did not kill him. And Draupadi did not even withdraw the respect. This is a very, very advanced culture in human society, very advanced culture."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights the Vedic culture's emphasis on proper respect, noting that while Krishna urged Arjuna to kill Ashwatthama, Arjuna refrained due to respect for his guru's son, and Draupadi maintained her respect, showcasing an advanced cultural understanding.

So Srila Prabhupada is explaining elsewhere that in the Vedic culture, they know how to offer respect to the proper persons. They know how to offer respect. You consider Arjuna's position. Krishna told Arjuna after Ashwathama was arrested by Arjuna, Krishna told Ashwathama, 'Kill him. He doesn't deserve to actually be excused for this most inglorious murder he has committed.' But Arjuna did not kill him. Arjuna could have killed him, but he did not kill him. Why? Because Arjuna thought he is a murderer. Why? Why? Because Arjuna is a son of the brahmina. The son of my guru. So as son of guru, of course, he is not a brahmana. Son of a brahmana is not a brahmana when he is not behaving according to the brahmanical standard. So he is considered Brahma bandhu. He is a relative of a brahmana. He is a son of the brahmana. But son of a Brahmana, Arjuna did not kill him. Similarly, Draupadi, considering that he is a son of a Brahmana, she actually being very soft hearted, Vamasvabha, previous verse explained that Vamasvabha. She did not withdraw the respect that is due to Ashwatthama as the son of Dronachali. So the important point is that Arjuna did not kill him and Draupadi did not even withdraw the respect.

Why have you bound him up like an animal? He deserves respect because he is the son of the teacher, military teacher.

A devotee of the Lord can tolerate all sorts of tribulations personally. A devotee of the Lord can tolerate all sorts of tribulations personally.'

Personally, Draupadi is affected very, very, very badly. Her all the five sons have been killed in a, in a very, very bad manner, beheading when they're sleeping. So in spite of that, she's tolerant because she's a pure devotee, and in spite of so much tribulation, a devotee tolerate such tribulations and never are unkind to others, even to the enemy. Draupadi did not show any, any, any consideration, had don't have any consideration that he is enemy and he is unjustly killed my sons in a proper battle, Dharma Yudha, while fighting against each other. If they are killed, whoever is killed, it is not improper, but here they are not given a chance to defend themselves, you then attacked. So that is in spite of this, Draupadi being a pure devotee of the Lord. So the scriptures say a pure devotee is decorated with all good qualities of saintly behavior. This is automatic when somebody becomes a devotee. Yasyaasti bhaktir bhagavati akinchana sarvair gunaistatra samasate surah.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam about Dhanurveda, the Vedic military science, and how it involves controlling weapons with Vedic hymns, a science lost in modern times.

Sarahasyo Dhanur Vedaha Savisargo Pasamyamaha Astra Gramascha Bhavata Shikshito Yad Anugrahat. The meaning of this verse is, it was by Dronacharya's mercy that you learnt the military art of throwing arrows and the confidential art of controlling weapons. Sarahasyo Dhanur Vedaha. So Shri La Prabhupada explains in the purport, Dhanur Veda or military science was taught by Dronacharya with all its confidential secrets of throwing and controlling by Vedic hymns. This is unknown in modern times. Control a weapon after releasing it by mantra, sound. Gross military science is dependent on material weapons but finer than that is the art of throwing arrows saturated with Vedic hymns which act more effectively than gross material weapons like machine guns or atom bombs. See the difference? That art, or the science, is lost now. It's not there. The control is by Vedic mantras or the transcendental science of sound. Vedic mantras, they are not ordinary sounds. The sound can be used to direct a weapon, to control a weapon.

**Key Quote:** "He could pierce his target with his arrow by only hearing the sound without seeing the object."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Maharaj Dasaratha and his mastery of Shabda Vedi, the art of hitting a target by sound, and how he accidentally killed a Brahmachari named Shravan Kumar, leading to negative consequences.

To target a particular person when you release a weapon. That is lost now. That science is lost. So in the Ramayana, it is said that Maharaj Dasaratha, the father of Lord Sri Rama used to control arrows by sound only. He could pierce his target with his arrow by only hearing the sound without seeing the object. So Srila Prabhupad explains, it is called Shabda Vedi. Just like I cannot see where is a bird, but the bird is chirping. And by Shabda Vedi, I can release an arrow. It will go wherever the bird is by the dint of the sound the bird is making. And it will go and kill that bird. So, this is called Shabda Vedi. Now Maharaja Dasharatha used it. He knew this science and he used it. And once he made a mistake of instead of killing an animal in the forest, he killed a boy, one Brahmachari. It is described in the Ramayana. Because that Brahmachari had come, he was taking his parents on a pilgrimage and they were old. He was carrying them in a palanquin and when they were thirsty on the way, so he stopped and he went to fetch water. So, he went looking for a water source and he found a pond with clear water. So, when he dipped that pot in the pond to get water, it made sound and this Dasharatha, was actually hiding. And when he heard that sound, he thought here is some animal that has come to drink water in the pond. So, he released an arrow aimed at whoever was actually making that sound while fetching water or drinking water. And the arrow went and actually pierced that Brahmachari. His name was Shravan Kumar. That is described in the Ramayana. And Shravan Kumar almost immediately was killed by the arrow released by Dasharatha. Then Dasharatha, after having released the arrow, when he heard a human being is crying out, then he went and saw, Oh, I have killed a Brahmachari. He never intended to kill a Brahmachari. No. But he mistook by the sound of that pot he was trying to fill. He mistook that sound to be the sound of an animal drinking water. And because he knew the science without seeing the target, He actually shot the arrow, Shabda Vedi, and it went and pierced that target. The Brahmachari who made that sound while filling the pot.

**Key Quote:** "So I have come to give you water. Then they were ecstatic. They were extremely aggrieved because only his son, they were dependent on him."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of Dasharatha, explaining how the Brahmachari's parents cursed him, leading to his grief and death due to Rama's exile, but ultimately, Dasharatha was blessed to have the Supreme Lord as his son.

So when he came and saw, he was very, very repentant. Then just before that boy died, he said, my parents are waiting nearby. They are elderly. They are in a palanquin. So kindly give them water. They are very thirsty. So this Dasharatha, and saying this, he died. Dasharatha took that pot of water and actually went to give that water to nearby. He saw a palanquin and two elderly people. Obviously, the parents of that Brahmachari, Shravan Kumar, were sitting. And he went and tried to give them water. They asked, who are you? He said, I am actually a king. And I had come for hunting. And I am very sorry to inform you that by mistake, instead of killing an animal, I killed your son. So I have come to give you water. Then they were ecstatic. They were extremely aggrieved because only his son, they were dependent on him. And they cursed this Dasharatha that even Dasharatha would die being aggrieved by the loss of his son. And what happened? Because of that curse, Dasharatha, at the time of coronation of Lord Ramachandra, his eldest son, he was obliged to his youngest queen, Kaikeyi, that she demanded that Rama be banished, sent to the forest in exile, 14 years. And that her own son, Bharata, be enthroned as the king. And because Dasharatha was bound by a promise to this queen, Kaikeyi, he had to actually fulfill that promise. And then even though he was reluctant, when Rama came to know that his father had promised his stepmother, so he agreed to actually fulfill that demand of his stepmother. Because he wanted to keep his father's promise intact. He did not want to break that promise. So Rama was, he went away to the forest. And Dasharatha could not tolerate that his son was actually banished just when he was about to be coronated. And in that grief he died. Of course, because Rama is no ordinary son, dying while constantly thinking and calling out his name, that was good for Dasharatha. Because Rama is the Supreme Lord. So that was his blessing that he got the Supreme Lord as his son. And therefore, even if, whatever be the case, he was actually fortunate. But still, Dasharatha did commit a grave mistake by not properly utilizing the Shabda Vedi. So they knew this science.

**Key Quote:** "The Vedas ultimate goal is to know or understand Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the Upavedas, including Dhanurveda, Ayurveda, Sthapatyaveda, and Gandharvaveda, emphasizing that the ultimate goal of the Vedas is to understand Krishna and our relationship with Him.

And that's how Arjuna was taught all this by Dronacharya. The science called Dhanurveda. It is one of the Upavedas. Dhanurveda, Ayurveda, Sthapatyaveda, Gandharvaveda. The science of dance and music. The science of architecture. That's how they used to build beautiful temples. Nice Gopurams, nice Vimanam. Very intricately carved, exact dimensions, etc. So all these sciences are there in the Vedas. Upaveda. It is subsidiary. Because the main subject matter of the Vedas is Brahmavidya, Atmavidya. Spiritual science. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, Adhyatmavidya Vidyanam. So, don't be carried away by some subsidiary subsidiary subject matter of the Vedas. Because the main aim of the Vedas Vedaischa Sarvair Ahameva Vedyam. The Vedas ultimate goal is to know or understand Krishna. So this is very important. As I mentioned earlier in a previous session, that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu teaches us the main teaching of the Vedas is Who am I? Who is Krishna? And what is my relationship with Krishna? This is the ultimate goal of life. To re-establish our lost relationship with Krishna in devotional service. In devotional service.

**Key Quote:** "They are not carried away by those skills."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of the Pandavas to illustrate how even with worldly achievements, pure devotees remain focused on Krishna consciousness and detachment, ultimately renouncing everything to return to the Lord.

So that way, if somebody learns even a subsidiary subject matter in the Vedas, they understand the ultimate goal is not merely the use of that particular skill or that subject matter. Just like the Pandavas. They won the battle of Kurukshetra. But they ruled for very short time. Because they were ruling because it was Krishna's instruction to them. Because they were divine natured. So they should be ruling the people. Because they are divine natured. Not demoniac natured persons like Kauravas. So they were ruling. But when they came to know that Krishna has actually departed for his personal abode. Immediately they retired. Immediately they retired and went on Mahaprasthana. They renounced. Of course before renouncing they handed over charge of ruling to the grandson, Arjuna's grandson Parikshit Maharaj. So Yudhishthira handed over charge to Parikshit Maharaj. And all the five Pandavas they went away. Mahaprasthana. They keep walking while remembering the Supreme Lord. And in that consciousness of remembrance of the Lord they will quit the body. Whenever it is time to quit the body. They keep walking, walking, walking. So they are conscious of the ultimate goal is to prepare oneself to quit the body while remembering the Lord. And therefore when they learnt that Krishna has gone back to his abode and Narada had told you remain here on the earth till Krishna is here. And after that you go back to Krishna. Because they are all belonging to Krishna. They are associates of Krishna. Personal associates. So they go back to Krishna. They came for the sake of participating in Krishna's pastimes as Krishna's assistants. And they go back. This is the position of a pure devotee. So as pure devotees they never forget they teach us by their exemplary behavior. What is the proper goal in spite of studying these other subjects. They are not carried away by those skills. I will stop here.

#### Dronacharya, Ashwatthama, Draupadi's argument, Vedic Culture
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/Cgn6KZhkQxY?t=53
**Verse References:** SB 1.7.45
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So in either case, Ashwathama was a representative of Dronacharya, and therefore killing Ashwathama would be like killing Dronacharya."
**Summary:** The speaker explains verse 45, focusing on Draupadi's argument against killing Ashwatthama, emphasizing that Ashwatthama represents Dronacharya.

In this session we will be discussing from the 45th and the 46th verses of the 7th chapter of 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 45th verse is Saesha Bhagavang Dronaha Praja Rupena Vartate Tasyatmano Urdham Patnyaste Nanvagad Veerasu Kripi. The meaning of this verse is, He that is Dronacharya is certainly still existing, being represented by his son. His wife Kripi did not undergo a sati with him because she had a son. Gravapati is explaining the reason why Ashwatthama should not be killed. She is coming up with so many different arguments that here she is saying that she is not a good person. She is telling Dronacharya he died in the battle but he is still existing because he is represented by his son, Praja Rupena Vartate, and Dronacharya is referred out of respect by Draupadi as Bhagavan Dronaha, Saesha Bhagavata Dronacharya is referred out of respect by Draupadi as Bhagavan Dronaha, Saesha Bhagavata. So it is explained by Srila Prabhupada in the purport, the wife of Dronacharya, Krippi, is a sister of Krippacharya, a devoted wife, who is according to the revealed scripture, the better half of her husband, is justified in embracing voluntary death along with her husband, if she is without issue. But in the case of the wife of Dronacharya, she did not undergo such a trial, because she had her son, the representative of her husband. So Srila Prabhupada explains, a widow is a widow only in name, if there is a son of her husband existing. So in either case, Ashwathama was a representative of Dronacharya, and therefore killing Ashwathama would be like killing Dronacharya. That was the argument.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces verse 46, highlighting the importance of respecting respectable families and avoiding actions that cause grief.

The argument of Draupadi against the killing of Ashwathama. Draupadi was against killing Ashwathama. The 46th verse. The meaning of this verse is, O most fortunate one, who knows the principles of religion, it is not good for you to cause grief to glorious family members, who are always respectable and worshipful. So Srila Prabhupada says, in the purport to this 46th verse, A slight insult for a respectable family is sufficient to invoke grief. Therefore, a cultured man should always be careful in dealing with worshipful family members. So Srila Prabhupada has explained elaborately these two verses in a discourse he had given earlier.

#### Guru, Dronacharya, Bhagavan, Opulence, Krishna

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The original Bhagawan is Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Dronacharya's position as Guru and the meaning of 'Bhagavan,' ultimately defining Krishna as the supreme Bhagavan possessing all opulences.

Now, the point explained. The point explained by Prabhupada, especially with reference to these two verses, is that what is the position of Dronacharya in the life of the Pandavas. Dronacharya is accepted as Guru by the Pandavas. They were trained up by Dronacharya. And Dronacharya, especially as required by the Pandavas. As regards Arjuna, Dronacharya taught all the secrets. And already Draupadi has pointed out, It is only by the mercy of Dronacharya that you learnt all the secrets about Dhanur Vidya or Dhanur Veda. So Draupadi is not an ordinary woman. You should always remember this. She knows everything about religious principles. And therefore she is teaching the assembly of respectable learned persons how the spiritual master should be respected. She herself is referring to Dronacharya as Bhagawan Drona. Anyone who is extraordinarily powerful is addressed as Bhagawan. Sometimes Narada is addressed as Bhagawan. Sometimes Lord Shiva is addressed as Bhagawan. They are all extraordinarily powerful personalities. The original Bhagawan is Krishna. The definition given by Parashara Muni in the Shastra is who is Bhagawan. One who possesses the sum total of all the wealth and the other opulences. Six opulences. Sum total of all the six opulences possessed by Krishna, Bhagawan Krishna. He is the supreme Bhagawan. But there are others who are not exactly in the position of Krishna as supreme. But they are also having certain extent the same qualities as Krishna. The qualities of Bhagawan they have. So in that sense they also can be addressed as Bhagawan. Because they are extraordinarily powerful compared to other persons. But they are not having Samagra Aishwarya. They are not having the sum total of all the wealth. So that position possessing the sum total of all the wealth is held only by one person. Krishna. Nobody else can equal him.

#### Praja, Father-Son Relationship, Vedic Culture, Widow
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/Cgn6KZhkQxY?t=497
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Dronacharya is still present in the form of his son Ashwathama."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of 'Praja' (offspring) and the father-son relationship in Vedic culture, emphasizing that a son represents the father, and a woman with a son is not considered a widow even if her husband is deceased.

Nobody else can excel him. So she is telling he is extraordinarily powerful personality, Dronacharya. Saesha Bhagawan Drona. Praja roopena vartate. He is still existing. Praja. In the form of Praja. Praja means offspring, son or daughter. So one who is born of the father is called Praja. Now without father there is no possibility of any birth taking place, either son or daughter. So one who gives birth, Prajayate. Praja is the product of the body of the father. That's what Prabhupada explains. The father's body is actually present in the form of the son or daughter, Praja. The Shastra says, Yatha yoni yatha bijam. Father is the bijam. The seed is given by the father. And just like you sow a seed in the ground, then a huge tree comes up. So the seed itself is generated by the tree. But that seed again grows up to be a tree. So the seed is tree later on. Similarly, the seed is put by the father in the womb of the mother, implanted. And when you sow a seed in the ground, you take care for it to properly grow. Similarly, the seed is sown in the womb of the mother, and the mother takes care of the seed and becomes a big body and comes out. So this is the process of birth. In one sense, the seed and the tree there is no difference. Similarly, there is no difference between the son and the father. No difference. The seed of the father and the father himself, there is no difference. So Dronacharya is still present in the form of his son, Ashwathama. So according to Vedic culture, this is very important to understand. A woman who has got a son, even if her husband is dead, she is not considered a widow. Widow, which actually means a woman who doesn't have a husband, who has lost her husband, husband is dead. But if the husband's representative is there, the son, then the woman is not a widow.

#### Wife, Better Half, Absolute Truth, Draupadi's Argument

**Key Quote:** "So in the same way, the wife is considered the better half of the husband, Ardhangini."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the concept of the wife as the 'better half' and connects it to the absolute truth, reiterating Draupadi's argument that killing Ashwatthama is equivalent to killing Dronacharya.

So in English also it is said, the wife is considered half the body. In Sanskrit also. In English, better half. So where is this concept coming from? So Prabhupada explains, this concept is coming from the absolute truth. The ultimate source of everything is the absolute truth, Krishna. So we have finished that. Now, we have to 1962. We have done this. Now, we have to specifically explain. To understand we completely understand it in abstract language. Why as we have heard it coming. Up grilled. Hannah and zyangorji. Yes this tradition is also like it was before. These ideas. So Radha and Krishna have combined in the form of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. So in the same way, the wife is considered the better half of the husband, Ardhangini. And the son is there. In so many ways, Draupadi is trying to convince, don't think Dronacharya is dead and gone. Dronacharya is still existing. So killing the son of Dronacharya means killing Dronacharya. So do not do this. This is Draupadi's argument.

**Key Quote:** "Being a Vaishnavi, being a devotee, a pure devotee, not just a devotee, a pure devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of acting in a way that glorifies the family, adhering to religious principles, and highlights Draupadi's compassion and devotion as a Vaishnavi, considering the grief that killing Ashwatthama would cause his mother, Kripi.

And one should act in such a way that the action will always be glorified in the family. Now Pandava's family is a very respectable family. So Draupadi is telling also, if you know the principles of religion, you will not perform any action which will bring down the glory of the family. You should not do such an action. So therefore, you should take care in dealing with the family members of Dronacharya, especially Krippi. So there will be further reasons given by Draupadi why Ashwathama should not be killed in the next two verses. Now Draupadi is a Vaishnavi. That will be explained in the next verse. She is a great devotee. Earlier also Prabhupada had mentioned in the Purport that she is a pure devotee. Therefore, even though she is aggrieved because of the loss of her sons, she is thinking not just of her own problem. She is thinking how Krippi will be put into so much of grief. She has already lost her husband. Further, if you kill Ashwathama, she is going to be put into so much more grief. So Draupadi has all such considerations. Being a Vaishnavi, being a devotee, a pure devotee, not just a devotee, a pure devotee. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

See how very considerate is Draupadi. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada said that, sympathetic good lady as she was, Srimati Draupadi did not want to put the wife of Dronacharya in the same position of childlessness, both from the point of motherly feelings and from the respectable position held by the wife of Dronacharya. From two perspectives she is saying, that why should she suffer like me? And also, she is a respectable lady as the wife of the Guru, so why should she be made to suffer?

**Key Quote:** "The Kshatriyas had become very puffed up, very proud, and they were not doing their duties properly as Kshatriyas."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the story of Parashurama and his annihilation of miscreant Kshatriyas, relating it to Draupadi's plea to Arjuna.

The Kshatriyas had become very puffed up, very proud, and they were not doing their duties properly as Kshatriyas. So he decided to kill all these miscreant Kshatriyas. So he simply took one chopper, Parashu. He is called Parashurama. His name is Rama, but he is called Parashurama because he took one axe. Parashu means axe, and simply went around the world 21 times, Trisaptaha, and simply went on chopping the heads of all these miscreant Kshatriyas. 21 times he went around the world to get rid of all these miscreants. So the rage of the Brahmanas is very dangerous for the lower persons, especially the Kshatriyas. So that is exactly what Draupadi is pointing out here. Don't enrage them. She is telling Arjuna, don't enrage them. They don't deserve to be treated the way you are thinking of punishing Ashwathama.

**Key Quote:** "Draupadi is sympathetic to Krippi because Draupadi is a Vaishnavi. This is the attitude of all Vaishnavas, all pure devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Draupadi's compassion stems from her being a Vaishnavi, highlighting the quality of 'Para Dukha Dukhi' and using Prabhupada's preaching as an example.

And Srila Prabhupada explains further, in addition to the purport, he has given a very nice discourse on these two verses. He says in this discourse that Draupadi is sympathetic to Krippi. Why? Because Draupadi is a Vaishnavi. This is the attitude of all Vaishnavas, all pure devotees. What is that? Para Dukha Dukhi. Vaishnava is having some special qualifications. One of them is Para Dukha Dukhi. On their own account, they are never unhappy, but they are Dukhi, they are unhappy only if others are unhappy, others are put into distress, then they become distressed. They can't tolerate seeing others suffer. This is the quality of a Vaishnava. Just like Prabhupada, he took so much trouble travelling all over the world and preaching Krishna Consciousness. Why? Because he could not tolerate to see the suffering of the conditioned souls. And how can their suffering be relieved? Only by Krishna Consciousness. That's why he was so painstakingly untiring in his efforts he put for preaching Krishna Consciousness to all sections of people all over the world.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Look at the character, to give an example, Prahlad Maharaj. He was harassed by his father, who was a demon, Hiranyakashipu was a demon."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the example of Prahlad Maharaj and his devotion despite the torture inflicted by his demoniac father, Hiranyakashipu.

So here now, Prabhupada is explaining, look at the character. To give an example, Prahlad Maharaj. Prahlad Maharaj says, Naivodhvijeparaduratyavaitaranyas Tvadvirya Gayana Mahamruta Magna Chittaha Shochetato Vimukachetasa Indriyartha Mayasukhayabharam Udvahato Vimudhan. Prahlad Maharaj, before explaining what is quoted about Prahlad, that he was harassed by his father, who was a demon. Hiranyakashipu was a demon. Prahlad was a devotee. Now, just because Prahlad was just chanting the name of the Supreme Lord, as a devotee, it's natural, but Hiranyakashipu became very, very angry at Prahlad, his own son, small boy, five year old boy, just because he is chanting the name of the Supreme Lord. That enraged Hiranyakashipu to what extent? He became angry is that he actually tortured this boy, Prahlad, tortured the boy. And because Hiranyakashipu was torturing Prahlad, therefore the Supreme Lord, he cannot tolerate. The devotee is tolerant, devotee is tolerant, but Supreme Lord Krishna, he never tolerates even a little insult done to his devotee. So the Supreme Lord appeared in the form of Narsimha, and he, Narsimha, killed this Hiranyakashipu. Now, after that, Narsimha Deva, he blessed Prahlad, very pleased with his devotion, and he said, you have undergone so much trouble for my sake, now you ask me any benediction that you want.

**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of Prahlad Maharaj, focusing on his humility and his expression of satisfaction through chanting the glories of the Lord.

Prahlad is telling in his prayers to Lord Narsimha, my dear Lord, I am born in a family which is filled with these qualities of Rajoguna and Tamoguna. Asuras, they are influenced by these two lower qualities, Rajoguna and Tamoguna. Rajas Tamo Bhava Asuras, they are influenced by these two lower qualities, Rajoguna, Tamoguna, and Devatas, they are influenced by Sattva Guna. So as compared to those influenced by Sattva Guna, these Rajoguna Tamoguna people, they are very much carried away by wealth, power, by position, etc. So Prahlad is telling Lord Narsimha Deva, since I have taken birth in this Asura family, please don't allure me by offering me some benediction. And Prahlad is also telling, actually, I have learned how to be fully satisfied and happy simply by singing the glories of your Lordship, Tvad Veerya Gayana Mahamrita Magna Chitta. The glories of the Supreme Lord, when chanted, and that nectarian glories of the Supreme Lord, as enumerated by pure devotees, is capable of fully immersing a devotee's mind. A devotee, when he hears, or he hears that nectar, he is able to immerse himself completely, and that way he is always situated in a happy condition.

**Key Quote:** "Like I have been put into so much grief by loss of my sons in the death of my sons, she need not cry constantly like me. So don't punish Ashwatthama."
**Summary:** The speaker returns to the initial theme of Draupadi's compassion, explaining her plea to not punish Ashwatthama in order to spare his mother, Kripi, the grief she herself experienced.

On his personal account, there is no one who is not happy because of that. Now she is thinking, what about Kripi? Ashwatthama is the one who actually beheaded the five sleeping sons of Draupadi, but she didn't kill this Ashwatthama in retaliation or in terms of punishment. Why? Because like I have been put into so much grief by loss of my sons, in the death of my sons, she need not cry constantly like me. So don't punish Ashwatthama the way you have bound him up and you are having some plan to succeed. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Sut Goswami is describing the incident, the first incident from where Bhagavatam begins, the narration of the Bhagavatam begins by Sut Goswami."
**Summary:** Sut Goswami narrates the story of Ashwatthama's actions and Arjuna's pursuit and capture of him, setting the stage for Draupadi's reaction.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session we will be discussing from the 49th and the 50th verses of the 7th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. The 49th verse: Sutavvacha Dharmam Nyayam Sakarunam Nirvyalikam Samam Mahat Raja Dharmasuto Ragnaha Pratyanandat Vachodvijaha. Sut Goswami's address, addressing the sages of Naimisharanya, addressing them as vijaha, O brahmanas. King Yudhishthira fully supported the statements of the queen which were in accordance with the principles of religion and were justified, glorious, full of mercy and equity and without duplicity. So, Sut Goswami is describing the incident, the first incident from where Bhagavatam begins, the narration of the Bhagavatam begins by Sut Goswami. The son of Dronacharya, Ashwatthama, he beheaded the five sleeping sons of Draupadi and Draupadi was very much aggrieved and Arjuna decided to punish this Ashwatthama. So, Arjuna went chasing, and Ashwatthama released a brahmastra just to save his life but under Krishna's guidance Arjuna was able to neutralize that brahmastra and he anyway, Arjuna was able to capture this Ashwatthama.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Draupadi was very conscious, this Ashwatthama, even though he is an aggressor, atatai, still, he is the son of Dronacharya."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Draupadi's compassion for Ashwatthama, considering his father Dronacharya's position and the potential suffering of Ashwatthama's mother, and King Yudhishthira's support of Draupadi's statements.

He bound him like an animal and brought him to his own camp and presented him to Draupadi. Draupadi was very conscious, this Ashwatthama, even though he is an aggressor, atatai, still, he is the son of Dronacharya. And who is Dronacharya? Dronacharya is the teacher who taught Arjuna and all the Pandavas for that matter. Particularly Arjuna was taught all the secrets of Dhanur Vidya, Dhanur Veda. So Draupadi always remembered that the Pandava family has to be always grateful to Dronacharya. So considering Dronacharya's position and also Dronacharya was killed in the battle, and Dronacharya's wife, Ashwatthama's mother had become a widow. Widow means she had lost her husband. She is not a widow because her son is still surviving. So she had become, she had lost her husband. So Draupadi did not want Krippi to suffer the same way she was suffering the loss of her sons. So therefore it is described here, Draupadi particularly reasoned and told Arjuna not to kill Ashwatthama as a punishment for whatever Ashwatthama had done. So Asutu Goswami is telling King Yudhishthira fully supported the statements of the queen Draupadi.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Dharmya means they are in accordance with the principles of religion."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of 'Dharmya' and contrasts human life, which should be guided by Dharma, with animal life, which is primarily focused on bodily needs.

Now what is described about the statements of Queen Draupadi, very nicely it is told here. Dharmya means they are in accordance with the principles of religion. This is very important, that should become conversant with the principles of religion and conduct themselves accordingly. They should be conversant with the principles of religion. The difference between human life and animal life as described in the scriptures is that human life is not just meant for satisfying the demands of the body. These four demands of the body are there whether animals or humans. This is the material platform, bodily platform that when we have got this body there is the need of aahara. We have to take food so many times a day to maintain the body. Nidra, rest, sleep is required to rejuvenate this body and bhaya, one has to defend oneself against so many dangers, so many problems, so many threats. One has to defend oneself and maithuna, one has to procreate. There is sex life, and the sex life is meant for procreation, for creating progeny. So these four demands are there of the body, whether animals are humans. Samanya metad pashubhi narana, but there is one extra special function of the human being that's called Dharma, the principles of religion. That is called Dharma, the principles of religion.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Dharma is the eternal, inseparable, intrinsic nature of something."
**Summary:** The speaker defines Dharma not as a sectarian faith but as the intrinsic nature of something, using examples like fire, rivers, and sugar, and then states that the Dharma of a human being is to render service, specifically to Krishna.

Now religion should not be understood as some sectarian system of faith. Many times Srila Prabhupada explains this because that is a misconception in the society in general among the people, that when you say Dharma, immediately they take it like some kind of faith, some system. No, it is not a system of faith. Dharma is the eternal, inseparable, intrinsic nature of something. Like the Dharma of fire is heat and light. Wherever there is fire, there has to be heat and light. You cannot have fire where there is no heat. You cannot have fire where there is no light. Not possible. It is intrinsically the quality of fire. So Dharma of fire is heat and light. Dharma of a river is to flow. River means it keeps flowing, flowing, flowing till it reaches the ocean. So then only it is called a river, Nadi. And similarly, Dharma of sugar is the sweet taste of sugar. So you cannot have sugar which is not sweet in taste. Then it is not sugar. Sugar means it should be sweet in taste, and it gives that sweet taste to whatever you mix sugar with. It gives the sweet taste, right? So that, like that, what is the Dharma of a human being? Human being has got Dharma. What is the Dharma of the human being? So that is explained in the scriptures. Dharma of the human being is to render service, to render service. So one should render service to Krishna.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "If the human being is not engaged in service of Krishna then he is forced to serve illusion and the consequence of serving illusion is misery."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that if one does not serve Krishna, one is forced to serve illusion, leading to misery, while serving Krishna leads to transcendental bliss.

Otherwise, one will be forced to serve illusion in different ways. So every living being in this material world and particularly every human being, if the human being is not engaged in service of Krishna, then he is forced, he or she, whoever it may be, is forced to serve illusion in different ways. Somebody may think, I am master. I am not the servant of anyone. But then he may think like that, but actually he is servant of lust. He is servant of his senses. He is servant of greed, anger, so many things. That means when there is anger, he has to satisfy the demand of anger. When there is lust, lusty desire, he cannot resist fulfillment of their lusty desire. So one is forced to be the servant of illusion if one does not engage in service of Krishna. This is the whole, this is the perfect and proper understanding of Dharma. So an intelligent person will think if mine intrinsic quality or nature is to serve, why should I serve the illusory energy and in exchange for the service of the illusion, what do we get? Only misery. You can see that the person who is not engaged in service of the illusory energy and in exchange for the service of the illusion, what do we get? Only misery. Illusory energy only keeps giving us misery after misery after misery. Sometimes there is some respite or break from misery and we think that is some kind of happiness. So relief from misery is considered or thought of as happiness in this material world for all those who are busy serving illusion. Of course people do not know that they are busy serving illusion. They are in ignorance. That's another quality, nature of being in the material world. Everybody is ignorant of this fact that I am servant. If I don't serve Krishna then I am forced to serve illusion and the consequence of serving illusion is misery, but if somebody serves Krishna then there is only transcendental bliss.

**Key Quote:** "The transcendental bliss and Krishna consciousness in serving Krishna is totally different experience you just have to taste it once then you really understand what is real happiness."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the experience of serving Krishna, describing it as a path to sacchidananda (eternal life, full knowledge, and bliss), contrasting it with the miseries of serving illusion.

Eternal life, full knowledge, sacchidananda. That is the experience of serving Krishna. Krishna is a supreme sacchidananda. We as spirit soul, we are also tiny sacchidananda and that nature, that spiritual nature, sacchidananda nature is possible to be experienced only when we are engaged in serving Krishna. And serving Krishna is very very pleasing to our heart. It is extremely pleasing to the heart. It is very, it is very nice, it's very nice, unlike serving illusion. Serving illusion, there is some promise or hope of enjoyment because our nature is to always be happy. So we seek happiness while we are busy serving illusion, but we really don't get happiness. The result of serving illusion is misery: adi bhautika, adhyatmika, adidaivika klesha. Klesha means misery, three variety, three kinds of miseries and plenty of it everywhere around you. You see in this world everybody is suffering one of these three kinds of miseries due to the body and mind, due to forces of nature and due to other living beings, always harassed by these miseries. Sometimes there is some break or relief or sometimes under the influence of illusion we ignore or we learn to somehow put up with some miseries. We put up with some miseries, but that is not really our position, that's not real happiness. The transcendental bliss and Krishna consciousness in serving Krishna is totally different experience.

You just have to taste it once then you really understand what is real happiness. Ramante yogino anante satyanande chidatmani iti ramapade naso param brahmabhidiyate. That yogis, yogis means here specifically bhakti yogis, the devotees, they know there is transcendental bliss in chanting the name of the Supreme Lord Rama Krishna, that they experience unlimited bliss by such chanting. So you are invited to experience that bliss by chanting Hare Krishna. Thank you very much.

In the previous session, I began discussing the 49th verse of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Bhagavatam. I could not complete it. I will continue. I will complete it in this session, the same 49th verse. I will read once again the 49th verse just for refreshing your memory. Suta Vacha Dharmam Nyayam Sakarunam Nirvyalekam Samam Mahat Raja Dharmasuto Ragnya Pratyanandad Vachodvijaha. The meaning of this verse is Suta Goswami is speaking to the Sayyiduna Misharanya, the Brahamanas. O Brahamanas, he is telling, he is addressing them and speaking to them. King Yudhishthira fully supported the statements of the queen. Who is the queen here? Draupadi, Queen Draupadi, which were in accordance with the principles of religion, Dharmam, and were justified, Nyayam, and were full of mercy, Sakarunam, Nirvyalekam, without duplicity. Sakarunam, Nirvyalekam, without duplicity. Samam, full of equity and Mahat, they were glorious.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Yudhishthira knew the principles of religion and supported Draupadi's plea to spare Ashwathama, and discusses the importance of Dharmashastra and its relevance in Kali Yuga.

So, King Yudhishthira fully supported Queen Draupadi's statements which were having all these wonderful characteristics. So, in the Purport, Srila Prabhupada says that Maharaja Yudhishthira was a son of Dharmaraja. So, he knew exactly what are the principles of religion and he supported Draupadi who was justified in telling Arjuna, don't kill Ashwathama even though he is a murderer of the five sons of Draupadi. Don't kill Ashwathama. So, what was the justification? That we have discussed earlier that Draupadi was making the statement or telling Arjuna, don't kill Ashwathama because she was conversant with the principles of religion. So, religion means here Dharma. Dharma means the eternal principles of our religion. That is what I mean by Dharmashastra. It is the intrinsic nature of service. So, such service has to be guided by the scriptural injunctions. So, there is Dharmashastra, how to conduct ourselves while we are living in this world for maintaining ourselves as well as for ultimate liberation from this material bondage. Everything is explained in Dharmashastra.

**Key Quote:** "Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has instructed everyone you study these two scriptures Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the principles of Dharma are summarized in the Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam, and emphasizes the importance of devotional service to Krishna over serving illusion.

Of course, now in Kali Yuga, we don't have time to study all the varieties of Vedic literature, especially the Dharma Shastras. There are 20 Dharma Shastras: Manu Smriti, Yajna Valkya Smriti, Parashara Smriti, like that, 20 great sages, they have compiled and every facet of human life, how one should actually conduct oneself, is explained there. But people have no time to study that, neither they are inclined to follow that. It is very difficult in Kali Yuga. Therefore, the principles of Dharma have been summarized in two scriptures, in two scriptures, the Bhagavad Gita and the Srimad Bhagavatam. These two scriptures, so Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has instructed everyone, you study these two scriptures, Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam. Both are called Krishna Katha, Krishna Katha. Bhagavad Gita spoken directly by Krishna, explaining the principles of Dharma very, very simple way, in a concise way, and Bhagavatam allows elaborately explains what is Dharma, Bhagavata Dharma. Bhagavatam explains what is real Dharma, Bhagavata Dharma, the principles of devotional service to Krishna. As in the previous session we discussed, we, our intrinsic nature or quality is to serve, so if we don't serve Krishna, then we will be engaged in serving illusion.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes surrendering to Krishna and engaging in devotional service, particularly chanting Hare Krishna, as the easy way to practice Dharma in Kali Yuga.

Are we forced to serve illusion? So better than serving illusion, you take up devotional service to Krishna and that is what is told by Krishna also in the Bhagavad Gita, sarva dharmaana parath ajaam am ekam saranam vajah aham tvam sarvapah aqua bhyamoksas sa vimash latcha. Even in the ninth chapter Krishna says Sekharo Worthy to see at Josh كل everything should be done as an offering to Krishna and if one doesn't want to complicate, one thinks that matters are too complicated if everything has to be done as service to Krishna, simply surrender to Krishna, simply surrender to Krishna and then engage in those activities which are meant for simply serving Krishna in a very, very simple way as taught by the Sri Chaitanya Maha, Sri Chaitanya Maha who taught us simply chant Hare Krishna, that is the easy way you of practicing Dharma especially in Kaliyuga, harer nama harer nama harer namaiva kevalam kalau nastyaiva nastyaiva nastyaiva gathiranyatha.

**Summary:** The speaker returns to the discussion of Draupadi's plea to Arjuna, explaining that it was based on principles of dharma, justice, and especially mercy towards Krippi, Ashwathama's mother.

So here, Dhropadi is telling Arjuna not to kill Ashwathama based on principles of religion, Dharmyam Nyayam. It is fully just. It is in accordance with principles of justice, principles of justice because Ashwathama happened to be the son of Dhronacharya and Dhronacharya was the teacher of Arjuna and Pandavas. So, he taught Arjuna all the secrets. So, Arjuna and the Pandavas should always be indebted to Dhronacharya, guru. Guru, whatever he teaches, one is indebted to the guru. That debt cannot be cleared. The debt cannot be repaid. No. So, in accordance with the codes of justice, Nyayam Sakarunam and full of mercy, mercy not because Ashwathama was deserving to be Dhronacharya and this scenario was included also, he was telling Arjuna to kill Dhronacharya with this excuse. Now, Ashwathama did not deserve to be ismus. I cannot mourn for the leaders that were removed but by killing it Ashwathama, Arjuna would put adultery the mother of Ashwathama, the wife of Dronacharya into so much of grief, grand mother live n recipes the mother of Ashwatama she would not undergo sati she was without any record simply because JS her son whose華 she was just the surviving descendant as per 핵 proteomeきた a survivor after the battle of Kurukshetra in which Dronacharya died in the battle so she did not undergo sati so if she is living just because of her son then by killing the son you want to put her into so much of grief so therefore Sakarunam full of mercy towards Krippi not showing mercy on Ashwatthama showing mercy on Krippi you should spare the life of Ashwatthama she is

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Draupadi's lack of duplicity and her compassion for Krippi, emphasizing the shared experience of motherhood and grief.

living for his sake, that's all. Then Nirvyalikam, without duplicity. She was not trying to do some kind of, it is called Krippi, this duplicitous behavior is sometimes required for somebody who's in politics, that in order to save some situation, they may externally tell something, but they have some other idea in the heart. So, such duplicitous behavior sometimes is required for somebody in politics, but here Draupadi is not speaking in a duplicitous way, Nirvyalikam, without duplicity, without duplicity. She actually feels for the grief of a mother because she has lost her sons and she is experiencing so much of grief. She doesn't want Krippi also to experience that kind of grief just because her son has done something foolish, he has done a big mistake, he's done a big crime actually, but why should she suffer when she is already undergoing grief because her husband died in the battle? So, why should she suffer like Draupadi or suffer more than what she is already undergoing? Why? It is not justified, particularly because she is the wife of the teacher of Arjuna. So, Arjuna should actually spare the life of Ashwathama, Nirvyalikam samam and it is full of equity. That is Draupadi is considering, I am a mother, I am experiencing grief now, same way Krippi will also experience grief. So, she can understand that if this is one of the people who are going to suffer this kind of anguish, then the next person should be the one who has been causing the grief and that is Draupadi who is the wife of Arjuna who has done a huge every other woman other than one's own wife as mother paradareshu dhara means wife all other women other than one's own wife as mother

#### material misery, identification with the body, spiritual identity, external energy, remedy

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "that we are not this body but we are spirit soul for the spirit soul there is no death there is no birth there is no disease there's no old age there's no suffering there are no miseries"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that suffering arises from identifying with the material body due to the influence of external energy, obscuring our true spiritual identity, and introduces the concept of a remedy.

of material nature thinks of himself as a material product and thus undergoes the reactions of material miseries. This is the explanation of what is explained in the Bhagavad Gita, that we are not this body, but we are spirit soul. For the spirit soul, there is no death, there is no birth, there is no disease, there's no old age, there's no suffering, there are no miseries. Why are we experiencing whatever we are going through? We go through suffering that is due to the external energy, the inferior energy of the Lord, the material energy. So that material energy, although transcendental, the living entity is transcendental to the three modes of material nature. The influence of the external energy makes the living being think that he is a product of material nature, he is a material product, and in that way, he undergoes the reactions of material miseries. Now, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada elaborately explained this point because the central point for our understanding that we are not the body, we are spirit soul, this is very, very important to understand. And then there is also, as Prabhupada explains, the root cause of suffering by the materialistic living beings is pointed out. What is the root cause of suffering? This influence of the external energy because of which I think I am a material product. And the remedial measures which are to be undertaken, what is the remedy for this? And also the ultimate perfection to be gained, all three are mentioned in this particular verse.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "even though we are transcendental we are beyond this material body our existence is beyond this material body still the imprisonment is by the influence of the external energy"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the transcendental nature of the soul, its imprisonment within the material body by external energy, and the resulting 'unholy contact' leading to material miseries.

Let us see how these three things are actually mentioned in the verse and explained wonderfully. The Living Being by Constitution is transcendental to material engagement. Engagement means we are trapped inside this body. We means each one of us, spirit soul. Spirit soul is trapped in this body. Body is like a cage. It is like a bird is locked up in a cage. Same way, we are locked up in this body, but he is now imprisoned by the external energy, and therefore he thinks himself one of the material products. Even though we are transcendental, we are beyond this material body, our existence is beyond this material body, still the imprisonment is by the influence of the external energy, and that influence makes us think that I am a material product. And due to this unholy contact, what is unholy contact? The contact of matter and spirit, the pure spiritual entity suffers material miseries under the modes of material nature. I am pure spirit, each one of the living beings is pure spirit, but the contact with this external energy creates a situation where I think, due to the influence of external energy, I think I am a product of matter and this body, and that is the cause for suffering material miseries.

**Key Quote:** "the living entity misunderstands himself to be a material product it is a case of misunderstanding"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that identifying as a material product is a misunderstanding and a perversion of our natural way of thinking, feeling, and willing.

The living entity misunderstands himself to be a material product. It is a case of misunderstanding. It is totally a phenomenon because of misconception, misunderstanding, misidentification. These are the terms used in everywhere in the scriptures. This means that the perverted person is a material product of matter, and this is a case of misunderstanding. The perverted way of thinking, feeling, and willing under material conditions is not natural for him. We think materially, we feel only in terms of matter, thinking, feeling, willing, we act materially. All this is only simply under material conditions. It is the way we think, feel, and live. It is the way we think, feel, and live, and this is not natural. This is not our original situation. This is not our situation as Spirit Soul, but Sheila proper says he has his normal way of thinking, feeling, and willing.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "the present conditional state actually is due to the influence of the external energy which means that the illusory energy takes the initiative while the supreme lord is aloof"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the roles of the absolute truth, illusory energy, and the Supreme Lord, explaining that the illusory energy takes the initiative in conditioning the soul, while the Lord remains aloof, allowing for reformation.

absolute impersonal Brahman, that is completely wrong because the absolute truth is never under any influence of the energy, never. Whereas the living being who is not the absolute truth can come under the influence of the illusion. This cannot be because the living entity has his own way of thinking in his original unconditional state also. The original state is a unconditional state. It is not a state in which there is an influence of these external energy. The present conditional state actually is due to the influence of the external energy, which means that the illusory energy takes the initiative while the supreme lord is aloof. Whose energy is it, this external energy or material energy? It is supreme lord's energy, Krishna's energy, and the supreme lord, even though he is a supreme controller, he is always aloof from the external energy. And as a tiny spirit soul, every living being in this material world is conditioned. Conditioned means influenced to act in a material way, that is a conditioning. The Lord does not desire that a living being be illusioned by external energy. He is always aloof from the external energy, and as a tiny spirit soul, every living being external energy, it's not the Lord's desire that we should be illusioned, but the external energy aware of this fact still accepts a thankless task of keeping the forgetful soul under illusion by her bewildering influence. That is why, why, why should the external energy do this task of keeping the forgetful soul in illusion? That is explained. The Lord does not interfere with the task of the illusory energy because this influence of the illusory energy is necessary for reformation of the conditioned soul. What does the need for reformation the conditioned?

**Key Quote:** "still one who surrenders under the lotus feet of the Lord is set free by the order of the Supreme Lord"
**Summary:** Using the analogy of a father disciplining his child, the speaker explains that the Lord allows the illusory energy to act for the reformation of the conditioned soul, and that surrender to the Lord's lotus feet is the path to liberation.

soul desires independent of the external energy of the soul. So this is why the Lord is not interfering. Independent energy and then they may think they are independently enjoying while the fact is they are completely under the control of the illusory energy. So to reform the conditioned soul, this is necessary. Prabhupada gives an example, an affectionate father does not like his children to be chastised by another agent, but he puts his disobedient children under the custody of a severe man just to bring them to order. So similarly, and all of it, the all affectionate Almighty Father Krishna, he desires relief for the conditioned soul, and what kind of relief? Relief from the clutches of the illusory energy. The Supreme Lord for this purpose, he descends from his kingdom upon the kingdom of the illusory energy and personally gives relief in the form of Bhagavad Gita. Krishna speaks the Bhagavad Gita for helping us to get relief from the influence of the illusory energy. So what does it say in the Bhagavad Gita? He suggests that although the ways of illusory energy are very stiff to overcome, very difficult to overcome, still one who surrenders under the lotus feet of the Lord is set free by the order of the Supreme Lord. You can get out of this form of change, out of this form of change by overcoming illusory energy, still we can surrender and then the lotus feet of the Lord is set free by the order of the Supreme Lord. We can get out of it. sübh i milti vayya prapadyante maya met Santos myself I must meditate it well and then I wenig cast drainage now upon myself I have passed through έχει ram beer to achieve themetics I have suffered the sticking of bondage multiple timesbsp.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that surrender is the remedy for suffering, and that the ultimate goal is not just liberation from illusory energy, but reinstatement in our original position of loving devotional service to Krishna.

this illusion simply by surrendering to the lotus feet of Krishna, that's all. This surrendering process is the remedial measure for getting relief from the bewildering ways of the illusory energy. So first thing is why the suffering? Because under the influence of the illusory energy, we are thinking in terms of I am a material product, I identify with this body, and the body undergoes so many changes, and then I think I am suffering while actually I am aloof from the body. Then what is the remedial measure for this? Surrender to the lotus feet of Krishna. And then finally, the highest perfection to be achieved is not merely that I become free from the influence it gives energy, no. There is a original position in a loving devotional relationship with Krishna, the supreme lord in his personal abode as his loving devotee, that is a perfection to be attained. So it is not just relief, it is relief and reinstating in our original constitution.

Draupadi. Thirapanti. Tell Arjuna not to kill Ashwatthama.

That means Draupadi is being also supported not only by Yudhishthira but Nakula, Sahadeva and Satyaki. Satyaki is the chariot driver of Krishna. He belongs to the Yadu dynasty. And Arjuna agreed with Draupadi. Yes, what Draupadi is telling is correct, even though Arjuna wanted to kill Ashwatthama. And even Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the son of Devaki, he also agreed with Yudhishthira who was supporting Draupadi's decision. And the ladies and all others unanimously agreed with the king. Now kindly note, here practically everyone is mentioned except one person, that is Bhima.

**Key Quote:** "Bhima however disagreed with them and recommended killing this culprit who in an angry mood had murdered sleeping children for no purpose and for neither his nor his master's interest."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains verse 51, highlighting Bhima's disagreement and his reasons for wanting to kill Ashwatthama, emphasizing the heinous nature of Ashwatthama's actions and their lack of purpose.

In the 51st verse we will see why Bhima's name is not mentioned. The 51st verse. Now about Bhima, what is being said here. The translation of this 51st verse: Bhima however disagreed with them and recommended killing this culprit who in an angry mood had murdered sleeping children for no purpose and for neither his nor his master's interest. See Bhima's reasoning. Bhima disagreed with everyone else. For what reason? Because Ashwatthama is a culprit. He has committed a crime. And what kind of crime? In an angry mood he had murdered sleeping children, the five sons of Draupadi. And he had done it for no purpose. What was his gain by doing it? His specific gain, nothing. And for neither his nor his master's interest. It is not even in his interest that he had killed the five sleeping sons of Draupadi. Neither Duryodhana was pleased with this act of Ashwatthama, because as soon as Ashwatthama killed them, he took the five heads which had been chopped off and presented them to Duryodhana thinking that Duryodhana will be pleased. But Duryodhana was not at all happy about it. He thoroughly disapproved of this and said this is totally abominable. So Duryodhana did not approve it at all. Ashwatthama was fighting on the side of Duryodhana. So he thought, Duryodhana will be pleased. But Duryodhana was not at all pleased by it. So for whose interest had he done it? That's what Bhima is questioning. For whom? For whose sake? It was not his interest. It was not his master's interest. And what other purpose can simply be somebody killed like that? By whom? By Ashwatthama who is fighting in a Dharma Yudha on religious principles. It is totally against all rules.

All religious principles. And even if let us say somebody violates a religious principle, for whose benefit is it being done? Nobody's benefit. And he had done it in an angry mood. When somebody becomes angry, then they lose their sense of discrimination. Anger actually makes a person lose his intelligence. So Bhima is pointing out that this Ashwatthama, he deserves to be killed because he is a culprit.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces verse 52, describing Krishna's reaction to the conflicting views of Bhima and Draupadi and setting up Krishna's upcoming advice to Arjuna.

Don't spare his life. And then the 52nd verse, it describes when Bhima said this, then the reaction of Krishna. The 52nd verse, nishamyabhimagaditam draupadyascha chaturbhujah alokyavadanam sakhyuh idamahasannivah The meaning of this verse is chaturbhujanam the four armed personality or the personality of Godhead chaturbhujaha After hearing the words of Bhima, Draupadi and others, Bhima and Draupadi's words are contradictory. Chaturbhujah, the personality of Godhead, saw the face of his dear friend Arjuna and he began to speak as if smiling. Now, what is Arjuna's position? That's what Krishna is considering. Arjuna has captured this Ashwatthama, brought him to his own camp and he had bound him up like an animal because he was a culprit. He had arrested him. But now Draupadi is telling Arjuna don't kill him. And she gave a reasoning. And Yudhishthira fully supported Draupadi and everyone except Bhima did support Draupadi. But Bhima disagreed. So what is Arjuna supposed to do? Bhima is not agreeing to let go this Ashwatthama to be excused. And Draupadi is telling don't kill him. What is Arjuna supposed to do? So, Krishna is looking at Arjuna, his friend, his dear friend and Krishna is now going to speak something very very significant to Arjuna. And Krishna is also smiling because he can understand the dilemma Arjuna is having that on the one hand Draupadi is telling don't kill and Bhima is telling he should be killed.

#### Krishna, Narayana, Vaikuntha, Krishnaloka, Chaturbhuja

**Verse References:** SB 1.7.52, BG 11.08
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna only expands as Narayana."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why Krishna is referred to as Chaturbhuja (four-armed) in this verse, drawing on Shridhara Swami's commentary and discussing the relationship between Krishna and Narayana, as well as the spiritual realms of Vaikuntha and Krishnaloka.

And Arjuna had taken a vow to kill. All that will be mentioned by Krishna. So in the purport Srila Prabhupada says Lord Sri Krishna has two arms. Krishna is Vibhujan. And why is he designated as four armed? Chaturbhujaha. Krishna is being referred to as Chaturbhujaha in this verse specifically. Why? That is explained by one of our Acharyas, Shridhara Swami. So, Prabhupada is quoting Shridhara Swami. Shridhara Swami is telling both Bhima and Draupadi held opposite views about killing Ashwatthama. Very clear. Bhima wanted Ashwatthama should be killed. And Draupadi said don't kill him. So opposite views of Bhima and Draupadi. Bhima wanted him to be immediately killed. Whereas Draupadi wanted to save him so Srila Prabhupada says quoting Shridhara Swami we can imagine Bhima ready to kill while Draupadi is obstructing him. And in order to prevent both of them the Lord discovered another two arms. Originally the primeval Lord Sri Krishna displays only two arms. Vibhujarupa. Manusham roopam. That's what is described in Bhagavad Gita. But in his Narayana feature he exhibits four hands. In his Narayana feature he resides with his devotees in the Vaikuntha planets. While in his original Sri Krishna feature he resides in the Krishnaloka planet and far far above the Vaikuntha planets in the spiritual sky. This is explained elsewhere that beyond this material universes is the spiritual sky. And in that spiritual sky there are many many spiritual planets. Now the spiritual planets are called Vaikuntha Loka free from all anxiety. It's the abode of the pure devotees, the pure devotees of the Supreme Lord. In all the Vaikuntha planets the Supreme Lord is present as the predominating deity in his form as Narayana, four handed form Narayana. But above the Vaikuntha planets among all the spiritual planets one particular planet is called Krishnaloka. It's also called Goloka Vrindavana. In that planet alone the Supreme Lord is present as Krishna in two handed form and Krishna is the predominating deity of Krishnaloka. Of course Krishna and Narayana are one person, the Supreme personality you have got it. But still there is distinction also.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes the session by reiterating Arjuna's dilemma and Krishna's sympathetic understanding, preparing for the next verse where Krishna will offer guidance. The lecture ends with a thank you and Hare Krishna.

So here if Sri Krishna is called Chaturbhuja there is no contradiction because Krishna only expands as Narayana. If need be Krishna can display hundreds of arms as he exhibited in his Vishwaroopa shown to Arjuna. He can display any number of arms. Therefore one who can display hundreds and thousands of arms can also manifest four arms whenever required. So this is the explanation given by Sridharaswami. Krishna only displayed two more arms in this situation. So therefore the Supreme Lord is now sympathizing with Arjuna that Arjuna is in a dilemma. He is getting contradictory suggestions. Draupadi telling Arjuna don't kill him. And Bhima is telling he must be killed because he is a culprit. For no purpose he has killed the sleeping sons of, murdered not just killed, murdered the sleeping sons of Draupadi. Neither his interest nor his master's interest is being served by this killing. So he deserves to be killed. This is Bhima's opinion. And what is Arjuna supposed to do? So Krishna is looking at Arjuna and he is sympathizing therefore he is also smiling at Arjuna. Now Krishna is going to speak to Arjuna something. That we will see in the next verse. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker translates and explains the verses, focusing on the dilemma faced by Arjuna regarding Ashwatthama, who is both a brahmana's son and an aggressor, highlighting conflicting duties and promises.

Two verses given together, 53 and 54. Now, the translation of these two verses as given by His Divine Grace AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada: the personality of goddess Shree Krishna said, Shree Bhagavanu Vacha, a friend of a Brahmana is not to be killed, Brahma bandur nahantavya, but if is an aggressor, he must be killed, atatai vadar vadha arhanaha. If he is a atatai, if he is an aggressor, he must be killed. All these rulings are in the scriptures, amnatam, according to rulings of the authority. Both these are given in scriptures, and Krishna is telling Arjuna, you must act accordingly. You had to fulfill your promise to your wife. What does Arjuna's promise to his wife Draupadi? That I shall cut off the head of this ashwar dhamma and bring it for you to pacify you, to punish him so that he may not be able to do it again suitably because of the inglorious murder he has committed. And now Krishna is also telling Arjuna, you must also act according to the satisfaction of Bhima Sena and me. So Bhima directly told that this ashwar dhamma should be killed. Now Krishna also, when ashwar dhamma was captured and arrested by Arjuna, Krishna also just told Arjuna, if you are an Canting and you must come to Bereich Arjuna Krishna had told Arjuna, you must kill this fellow because he is an aggressor, even though he is the son of a brahmana, but as an aggressor, even if we be a brahmana, still they should be killed, what to speak of a brama bandhu. At the same time, now Krishna is telling and next time he is a brahma friend so he will kill Arjuna and his wives until he is gone. You have to act according to the rulings of the Shastra, and you have to fulfill your promise to your wife. And what is Draupadi's suggestion? Don't kill him. To satisfy Draupadi, Arjuna should not kill. And for satisfying Bhima, he should kill. So what is he supposed to do? Kill or not kill?

#### dharma, scriptural injunctions, renunciation, duty, contradictions

**Key Quote:** "Whenever somebody tries to refer the scriptures, then in certain circumstances, to apply the scriptural injunction, it is difficult."
**Summary:** The lecture explores the difficulty in applying scriptural injunctions, using the example of a sanyasi's duties and the apparent contradictions within the scriptures.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says that Arjuna was perplexed because Ashwatthama was to be killed as well as spared according to different scriptures cited by different persons. This is a fact. Whenever somebody tries to refer the scriptures, then in certain circumstances, to apply the scriptural injunction, it is difficult. In the 18th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, it is explained that for somebody who is a sanyasi, who is in the renounced order of life, there are no duties to be performed. No duties to be performed because he is completely renounced. He is simply engaged in devotional service to Krishna, exclusively dedicated for that. That is the meaning of renunciation. At the same time, Shastra says that activities which are of the nature of yajna, dana and tapa should never be given up under any circumstances. For a civilized human being, in all stages, one should never stop performing sacrifice because sacrifice is specifically activity meant for pleasing the Supreme Lord. So, in that way, we can understand sacrifice should never be given up. Though, material activities, or material duties even, a sanyasi has got no material duties. A brahmachari has got duties, a grihasta has got duties, a vanapurasta has got duties, but a sanyasi has no material duties. So, it is difficult to understand whether a sanyasi should perform any activities, or not do any activities at all. So, like this, in the scriptures, there are injunctions which seemingly are contradictory in certain circumstances, in certain situations where one has to apply. Different people will give different circumstances, cite different shastras and give different rulings.

**Key Quote:** "Brahmabandhu should not be killed. Aggressor, even if he is a brahmana, he has to be killed. An aggressor, when he is standing without any weapon, he should not be killed. So what is Arjuna supposed to do?"
**Summary:** The speaker returns to the dilemma of Arjuna and Ashwatthama, highlighting the conflicting scriptural injunctions regarding killing a brahmana, an aggressor, and an unarmed aggressor.

Just like here, it's happening. Bhima is telling you must kill, because Bhima is citing the shastra only. And Draupadi is telling, don't kill. And she has given her reasoning. So here, Prabhupada is telling, as a brahma bandhu, or a worthless son of a brahmana, Ashwatthama was not to be killed. Brahma bandhur nahantavya. This is the ruling of the shastra. Brahma bandhu, because son of a brahmana. Even though he is not a brahmana, but he is son of a brahmana still, he should not be killed. But he was at the same time, this Ashwatthama was an aggressor. According to the rulings of Manu, an aggressor, even though he be a brahmana, and what to speak of a brahma bandhu, unworthy son of a brahmana, such an aggressor is to be killed. This is what Manusmriti says. Dronacharya was certainly a brahmana in the true sense of the term, but because he stood in the battlefield, he was killed. He was fighting. A dharma yudha. In the battle he got killed. So when, because Dronacharya was on the side of the Kauravas, and obviously he was killed by the Pandavas. But such killing of Dronacharya was justified because Dronacharya was engaged in battle. But although Ashwatthama was an aggressor, now look at this complication. As an aggressor, it is said in the Shastra, aggressor, even if he is a brahmana, he is to be killed. So, even though Ashwatthama was an aggressor, he stood without any fighting weapons. He stood without any weapons. He was bound up. He didn't have any weapons with him. The ruling is that an aggressor, when he is without weapon or chariot, cannot be killed. Now look at this. Brahmabandhu should not be killed. Aggressor, even if he is a brahmana, he has to be killed. An aggressor, when he is standing without any weapon, he should not be killed.

**Key Quote:** "But the lesson for us to be learnt from this is that in order to, even if one is conversant with the scriptural injunctions, it is not easy to apply the injunctions in different circumstances."
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the complexity of applying scriptural injunctions and the necessity of seeking guidance from a bona fide spiritual master to navigate such dilemmas.

So what is Arjuna supposed to do? Besides all this, now these were all perplexities for Arjuna. And besides all this, to further complicate matters, Arjuna had to keep the promise he had made before Draupadi just to pacify her. As soon as Draupadi began crying after learning that her five sons had been all killed by Ashwatthama, she was crying, and Arjuna just to pacify her had said, I am not going to spare this Ashwatthama. I am going to cut off his head and bring that head for you in order to pacify you. So he has to, he had made a promise. Kshatriya's promise cannot be an empty promise. And he also had to satisfy both Bhima and Krishna, who advised killing Ashwatthama. So Arjuna has promised Draupadi, I will kill him. Bhima and Krishna have advised Arjuna to kill Ashwatthama. The Shastra says, a Brahmabandhu should not be killed. Aggressor has to be killed. But an aggressor without any weapons should not be killed. So what is Arjuna supposed to do? Certainly very, very, very perplexed in situation. This dilemma was present before Arjuna and the solution was awarded by Krishna. Now how Krishna awards the solution is going to be explained in the next verse. But the lesson for us to be learnt from this is that in order to, even if one is conversant with the scriptural injunctions, it is not easy to apply the injunctions in different circumstances. It is not so simple. Always. In some cases it is very simple. But in some situations or circumstances it is not so simple. So therefore Shastra says, in order to learn the scriptures and more importantly in order to learn how to apply the scriptural directions or injunctions in one's own personal life, one has to approach a bona fide spiritual master.

**Key Quote:** "We have to actually seek solution to our perplexities by approaching a bona fide spiritual master."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating the importance of surrendering to a spiritual master for guidance, drawing a parallel to Arjuna's surrender to Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, and highlighting the spiritual master's role in guiding individuals towards their duty while avoiding sin and progressing in Krishna consciousness.

One has to approach a bona fide spiritual master. The beginning of the Bhagavad Gita, Arjuna first says, I am not going to fight in this battle. How can I kill my own kinsmen? How can I kill Bhishma and Drona, my respectable superiors? For the sake of a kingdom I am going to kill them? Never. But at the same time, Arjuna understands this is a Dharma Yudha and it is a duty of a Kshatriya like Arjuna to fight in this Dharma Yudha. So considering these two aspects, Dharma Yudha, Arjuna should fight, it is his duty to fight and somebody like Bhishma and Drona who are respectable superiors should not be killed. So Arjuna is confused about his duty and Arjuna, what does he say? Now I am confused about my duty and therefore I surrender to you my dear Lord Krishna. Kindly instruct me what is to be done in these circumstances. And this is exactly what is taught in the Bhagavad Gita. We have to actually seek solution to our perplexities by approaching a bona fide spiritual master. A bona fide spiritual master is situated completely in Krishna consciousness and he is able to direct everyone perfectly in such a way that they are able to do their duty at the same time not commit any sin and also make advancement for ultimate liberation in Krishna consciousness. So this is the special position of a bona fide spiritual master. Therefore one has to actually approach a bona fide spiritual master and learn from him and seek his guidance in all such situations. Hare Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "A devotee like Arjuna is able to take help of his intelligence because he is Krishna conscious."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Arjuna used his intelligence, guided by Krishna consciousness, to resolve a complex situation involving Ashwatthama, highlighting the importance of Krishna's direction.

The fifty-fifth verse, Suta Vacha. Now, Suta Goswami is describing this whole incident, narrating this historical incident to the sage Suna Misharanya, he is telling, Arjuna ha sahasa agnyaya here hardam athasina manim jahar murdhanyam Drijasya sah murdhajam Drijasya ah sah murdhanyam Drijasya such mood adjust sitting Arjuna hot To the entrance of Arizombur, it is'll give you Аthas participants that the adoration of thegers is where the meaning of this verse, The meaning of this verse is that, verses. Just then Arjuna could understand the motive of the Lord by his equivocal orders and thus with a sword he severed both hair and jewel from the head of Ashwatthama. Equivocal means ambiguous. Krishna said that you have got two contradictory things to be settled and you have to act appropriately. So Arjuna could understand what is Krishna's motive in giving him such an ambiguous order. You have to satisfy both Bhima and Draupadi. You should keep your promise. You should act according to the rulings of the scriptures. So what did Arjuna do? With his sword he cut off the hair and the jewel from the head of Ashwatthama. So in the purport Srila Prabhupada says contradictory orders of different persons are impossible to carry out. Therefore a compromise was selected by Arjuna by his sharp intelligence. This is where the intelligence is, one takes help of one's intelligence. Of course here we have to understand taking help of intelligence means intelligence directed by the super soul seated on the heart. Super soul is Krishna, Paramatma. And a devotee like Arjuna is able to take help of his intelligence because he is Krishna conscious. He is Krishna conscious therefore he is able to take help of his intelligence and understand what is Krishna's direction in this regard. What should he do? Now we should not think that we can also simply take help of our intelligence under all circumstances and do whatever is according to our judgement using our intelligence, whatever the help whatever is right we should do that that seems like a common sense thing to do but we should also understand that if we are not 100% Krishna conscious we are unable to properly utilize our

**Key Quote:** "The Supreme Lord as Paramatma directs the intelligence according to our desires according to our karma and according to our position whether we are devotee or non-devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on how Paramatma (Krishna as the Supersoul) guides intelligence based on an individual's desires, karma, and whether they are a devotee or not, explaining how even good intentions can be thwarted by past karma.

intelligence the way Paramatma or Krishna directs it why because the Supreme Lord as Paramatma directs the intelligence according to our desires according to our karma and according to our position whether we are devotee or non-devotee for a devotee Krishna one was 10% Krishna conscious Krishna directly gives perfect instructions from within the heart through the intelligence directly Krishna gives instructions for somebody's a non-devotee Krishna is neutral he's neutral as Paramatma he actually considers any living being who is not Krishna conscious ordinary people in this world most people Krishna will as Paramatma consider what is the desire of the particular person then what is his karma based on which what he deserves and accordingly Krishna will direct the intelligence for the person to do in a particular act in a particular way now Now supposing somebody actually desires to do something which is correct, then if his karma is to not do things right, because of his previous sinful activities, then the direction will be given to do something wrong and not the right thing. So he will not get the correct direction through the intelligence, even though he wants to do something right. You see, his desire is to do things right, but his karma is to do something wrong. And therefore, the intelligence will work in doing something wrong. Now consider the other case. Somebody doesn't actually know what is to be done, whether it is right or wrong. But his karma is that he should do the right thing. His karma is that he should be doing the right thing because he is a pious person. He doesn't have sinful reaction of doing the wrong thing. So then he is given the proper direction by the intelligence because of his karma.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore the real way to ensure that we always do the right things and never do any sinful activity, never commit any mistake in our life, is to become completely Krishna conscious."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain how Paramatma considers desire and karma according to the laws of nature, emphasizing that becoming fully Krishna conscious is the only way to ensure righteous actions and avoid mistakes due to our tiny, influenceable nature.

And his desire is to do the right thing. And he is not sure what to do. He is seeking direction. So when we seek direction, we refer our intelligence. So he is directed to do the right thing. So Paramatma will always consider the desire, the karma, and it is according to the laws that are working, laws of nature. There is no partiality. There is no partiality on the part of the Supreme Lord. It is like a programmed machine. It works regardless of who operates, according to the program, according to the way it is designed. It will work. So when we are not Krishna conscious, we cannot always be sure, even if we want to do the right thing. We can't always be sure we will be able to do the right thing. Therefore the real way to ensure that we always do the right things and never do any sinful activity, never commit any mistake in our life, is to become completely Krishna conscious. That is the only way, because we are very, very tiny as spirit soul, individual spirit soul. We are very tiny. We are subject to influence.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "If you want to do the right things, you should actually rise above the gunas."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the influence of the illusory energy and the three modes of nature (gunas) on our actions, stating that to consistently do the right thing, one must rise above these gunas by engaging in pure devotional service, referencing the Bhagavad Gita.

Of the illusory energy. And under the influence of the illusory energy, if the mode of goodness is acting, then there is knowledge and proper direction, enlightened state. There is proper direction to do the right things. In the mode of passion, we are confused. In the mode of ignorance, we always do the wrong things. So these gunas are always interacting and producing so many effects. Sometimes sattva guna dominates, sometimes raja guna dominates, sometimes tamma guna dominates. So it is very, very difficult under the influence of the gunas to always do the right thing. There is no guarantee. So therefore the shastras say if you want to do the right things, you should actually rise above the gunas. How can you rise above the gunas? How can you be situated without influence, without being affected by the influence of the gunas? You should come to the spiritual platform, above the material platform of the three gunas. And to come to that spiritual platform is possible only if you engage in pure devotional service. This is told in the Bhagavad Gita: mam chayo avyabhicharena bhakti-yogena sevate sagunan samatityaitaan brahma bhuyaya kalpate.

**Key Quote:** "Arjuna did not kill him but at the same time he cut his hair from his head deprived him of his wealth his jewel was taken away and driving him from his residence he was driven out of the of the camp so these are prescribed punishments and Arjuna gave those proper punishments"
**Summary:** The speaker concludes the discussion of the verses by explaining how Arjuna's actions towards Ashwatthama fulfilled both Draupadi's request and Bhima's suggestion, representing a proper punishment according to scripture, and ends with the Pandavas performing rituals for the dead, marking the end of the chapter.

So here Arjuna, he separated the jewel from the head of Ashwatthama and also cut off his hair. Now this was as good as cutting off his head and yet his life was saved for all practical purposes. See how Arjuna actually was able to satisfy both Draupadi's request to save his life and Bhima Sena's suggestion that Ashwatthama should be killed. So certainly Ashwatthama is twice born because he is indicated here as Dvija. Dvija. Saha murdha jam. Dvija. He is twice born. And he is twice born, but he fell down from his position and he is dead and therefore he was properly punished. So the 56th verse, Vimuchya. Rashana- meatballs. Baal-a-hatya-hatam-prabham. Tejasaa-Maniina-heenam-sibiraan-nirayaa-payatt. He had already lost his bodily luster due to infanticide and now moreover having lost the jewel from his head he would lose even more strength he was unbound and driven out of the camp. 57th verse wapanam dravina adhanam sthanan niraya nirya panam tatha eshahi brahma bandhunam badho nanyo asti dai hi kaha cutting the hair from his head depriving him of his wealth and driving him from his residence are the prescribed punishments for the relative of a Brahmana there is no injunction for killing the body so Arjuna did not kill him but at the same time he cut his hair from his head deprived him of his wealth his jewel was taken away and driving him from his residence he was driven out of the camp so these are prescribed punishments and Arjuna gave those proper punishments the last words are 58th verse of this chapter the closing words putra shoka tura sarve Pandava sahakrishna swanam nutanam yatkrityam chakrur nirharana adhikam the meaning of this verse the last verse thereafter the sons of Pandu and Draupadi overwhelmed with grief performed the proper rituals for the dead bodies of their relatives so they undertook the duty of performing the rituals for the departed souls that is the end of this chapter thank you very much Hare.

**Key Quote:** "This is the perfect remedy for the suffering of the conditioned souls: the process of devotional service."
**Summary:** The lecture begins by discussing Vyasadeva's vision of the Lord and His energies, highlighting devotional service as the perfect remedy for the suffering of conditioned souls, emphasizing hearing and chanting as the beginning of this process.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 6th verse of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: अनर्थो पशमं साक्षाद भक्ति योगं अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अजानतो विद्वाम्स चक्रे सात्वत सम्हिताम. अनर्थो पशमं साक्षाद भक्ति योगं अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे लोकस्य अधोक्षजे. थे, इस वर्क में हम impactful 的 बार जो कहते है कि, स्थित पत्र वर्क में, वैकुल पर पत्र विशेष निर्मण हो रही या बीम करती है Monte है वर्क में अपने वेसिड युद की वर्क है कि वो अक्सर वर्क हाथवटि में स्कूल है. यह it is complete and perfect in all respects, so when it is described that Vyasadeva saw the personality of Godhead, it is qualified; he saw the all-perfect personality of Godhead. Now, Srila Prabhupada further explains, what does it mean? This statement suggests that the complete unit of the personality of Godhead includes his parts and parcels also. The Lord is always complete, and he is never without his parts and parcels. He saw therefore, what all did he see? He saw therefore his different energies, namely the internal energy, the marginal energy, and the external energy. The Lord is always with his energies, so Vyasadeva, when he saw the Lord, he saw his different energies also. He also saw his different plenary portions and parts of the plenary portions, namely his different incarnations also. Even though the Supreme Lord is one, one and only Supreme Personality of Godhead, but he is not a limited person. He has many different forms of incarnations, plenary portions, parts of plenary portions, and Vyasadeva also specifically observed the unwanted miseries of the conditioned souls who are bewildered by the external energy. This was explained in the previous verse, and here the remedial measure is given, and at last he saw the Lord, and here the remedial measure is given, and at last he saw the Lord, and at last he saw the Lord, and at last he saw the remedial measure for the conditioned souls, namely the process of devotional service. This is the perfect remedy for the suffering of the conditioned souls. What is it? It is the process of devotional service. This devotional service is a great transcendental science and begins with the process of hearing and chanting, and begins with the process of hearing and chanting the name, fame, glory, etc. of the Supreme Personality of Godhead: shravanam, kirtanam, vishnom. This is the beginning of the process of devotional service.

#### devotional service, sincerity, causeless mercy, mitigation of miseries

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Bhakti is something that is bestowed by the Supreme Lord when the Lord is fully satisfied with the sincere efforts of the devotee."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that devotional service should not be mechanical but involve the full mind and spirit, highlighting the importance of sincerity and the causeless mercy of the Lord in bestowing love of God, and noting the immediate mitigation of material miseries as a benefit of devotional service.

Revival of the dormant affection or love of Godhead does not depend on the mechanical system of hearing and chanting. Generally, people, when they do something repeatedly, the process tends to become mechanical, just like routinely we do so many things very mechanically. But the process of devotional service is never a mechanical process because it is the full involvement of the mind, because it is the full involvement of the mind, the full involvement of the spirit soul, of the spiritual personality, 100% involved in this process, then only the process is effective to the extent of achieving perfection. Even if somebody does devotional service in a mechanical way, there is benefit, there is a benefit, but it is not sufficient to take us to perfection. So Shrila Prabhupada says this transcendental process, it solely and wholly depends on the causeless mercy of the Lord. Bhakti is something that is bestowed by the Supreme Lord. When the Lord is fully satisfied with the sincere efforts of the devotee, he may endow him with his loving transcendental service. So the complete perfection comes after the devotee has rendered devotional service with all his efforts, sincerely trying to please the Lord, and when the Lord is pleased, he bestows the perfection of love of God. But even with the prescribed forms of hearing and chanting, that is just one has begun, there is at once mitigation of the superfluous and unwanted miseries of material existence. The effect on the heart of the chanting and hearing is immediately felt even by the beginner before he is able to even make advancement. Immediately, what is the immediate effect? The mitigation of material miseries. This is very important to understand, and it is a very great encouragement for anyone that immediately they begin to feel the benefit of this process.

#### knowledge vs. devotion, purification, material contamination, spiritual satisfaction

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Devotion helps us to awaken knowledge within our heart."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the path of knowledge with the path of devotion, stating that devotion is independent of knowledge and helps awaken it, and emphasizes the need for purification from material contamination accumulated over lifetimes to experience transcendental love, explaining that material miseries are superfluous and the material body is unwanted.

Such mitigation of material affection does not wait for development of transcendental knowledge. This is what the impersonalists think, that unless there is knowledge, there is no progress in spiritual life. That is for the jnana process. Bhakti process does not depend on development of transcendental knowledge. So the Prabhupada says, rather knowledge is dependent on devotional service for the ultimate realization of the supreme truth. So knowledge is dependent on devotion, but devotion is independent of knowledge. Devotion helps us to awaken knowledge within our heart. So the process of devotional service, it directly acts on the contaminated consciousness to purify, but the devotee has to sincerely engage in the process and patiently engage in the process and patiently wait for complete purification. The complete purification takes some time because we have been associating with this material world for a very, very, very long time, millions of lifetimes, and we have accumulated so much of this material contamination life after life after life after life after life. In ignorance, we have been simply engaging in sense gratification, so that has to be cleansed away before we can actually experience the transcendental love in reciprocation with the Supreme Lord. Before that, we have to cleanse the heart. These material miseries are described as superfluous. Superfluous means they are actually not giving any benefit for us. They are simply useless stuff. That's why they are called un-earth. In fact, un-earth means unwanted, something which is unwanted. Un-earth, this body itself, material body itself is un-earth, it itself is un-earth. But in the material conception, we think we cannot exist without the body. Why? Because the body is the means for our sense gratification, for our material enjoyment. That material enjoyment, yes, we can have to whatever extent we can get some material pleasure by the means of the body, but as spirit soul, we are not meant to enjoy materially. Neither material pleasures give any satisfaction for the soul.

#### soul's satisfaction, material vs. transcendental happiness, temporary vs. eternal bliss

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Material pleasure is simply a sensation, and it is a temporary thing... and it eventually leads to miseries only; whereas transcendental happiness is completely pure bliss and it is never momentary."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the soul's true satisfaction, contrasting material pleasures, which are temporary and lead to misery, with transcendental happiness, which is pure, eternal bliss experienced through transcendental senses, referencing the Bhagavad Gita to support this point.

The Bhagavatam raises this point: what ensures that there is complete satisfaction for the soul? The satisfaction of the soul, of the real self, that is to be considered. The satisfaction of the soul is never possible by any material pleasure, material means, material methods, material pleasures, material arrangements. It never even touches the soul in any way. So therefore, people who are seeking real happiness, they are frustrated when they make different arrangements for enjoying materially, or they seek material happiness, and they never are satisfied within their heart, never are satisfied. So this point is explained in the Bhagavad Gita: yehi samsparishya ja bhoga dukha yonaya evate aadyantavan takaunteya nateshu ramate budhah. One more verse that explains what is the nature of transcendental happiness: sukham aatyantikam yatta buddhikrahyam atindriyam. You see, this transcendental happiness is an experience of boundless transcendental joy which is experienced with transcendental senses, atindriyam, not with this material senses. These material senses are useless for experiencing any any spiritual happiness or transcendental happiness. So material pleasure is simply a sensation, and it is a temporary thing. It is also called chapala sukha, momentary happiness, and it eventually leads to miseries only, whereas transcendental happiness completely pure bliss, and it is never momentary. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Pariksit Maharaj, who listened to Shukadev Goswami speak the Srimad Bhagavatam for seven days without interruption, to illustrate the power of attentive hearing and absorption in the subject matter.

See how effective Srimad Bhagavatam is. Simply you have to hear, this is called giving oral reception. You have to give oral reception, means you have to hear attentively. And simply you have to do that. What did Pariksit Maharaj do? He simply sat and heard Shukadev Goswami speak for 7 days and nights continuously. That's all he did. He didn't do any gymnastics. But he was hearing with complete attention. He was fully absorbed in the subject matter. So much so that Shukadev Goswami said, "Do you want to take a break?" He said, "No. There is no need for any break because through my ears I'm drinking the nectar of the words of the Srimad Bhagavatam spoken by Shukadev Goswami." So that nectar makes one indifferent to thirst, hunger, sleep, all these things cannot disturb a person who's completely immersed.

**Key Quote:** "Material life means constant lamentation and everyone is after the mirage of illusory things."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Srimad Bhagavatam extinguishes the fire of lamentation, illusion, and fear, which are the primary symptoms of material disease, and quotes Srila Prabhupada on the effectiveness of the ear as a sense.

It extinguishes the fire of lamentation, illusion and fearfulness. This is explained by Srila Prabhupada in the purport. Prabhupada says, "There are various senses of which the ear is the most effective ear. This sense works even when a man is deep asleep. One can protect himself from the hands of an enemy while awake, but while asleep, one is protected by the ear only. The importance of hearing is mentioned here in connection with attaining the highest perfection of life, namely getting free from three material pangs. Everyone is full of lamentation at every moment. Material life means constant lamentation and everyone is after the mirage of illusory things. The whole material creation is a creation of the illusory energy, and so many objects are there which bewilder the mind and people are simply running after this mirage. Mirage means something, a phenomenon or a death. In a desert, there is no water, but it appears like there is a body of water at a distance and one chases that body of water and never gets any water because there is no real water there in that mirage. Similarly in this material world, so many objects seem to be promising so much of happiness, but actually none of those objects can give us any real pleasure. And thirdly, he is always afraid of his supposed enemy, Shoka, Moha, Bhaya, these are three material pangs, which everyone in this material world who is born under the force of karma."

**Key Quote:** "As soon as you hear from a pure devotee, the actual message of the Bhagavatam, immediately it relieves you from these three material pangs, immediately, you feel relief."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the symptoms of material disease (lamentation, illusion, and fear) and emphasizes the importance of hearing about Krishna from a pure devotee to experience relief from these pangs.

These are the primary symptoms of material disease, Bhavaroga, it is called Bhavaroga, the disease of repeated birth and death. Everyone is affected by this disease in this material world and the primary symptoms, just like if somebody has got a viral infection, then they have a symptom called fever or some body pain, vomiting, loose motion, whatever, like that, what is the symptom of this material disease that is described as these three symptoms: Shoka, Moha, Bhaya. Shoka is lamentation, Moha is illusion and Bhaya is fear. And it is definitely suggested here in that simply by hearing the message of Srimad Bhagavatam, one gets attachment for the supreme personality. Krishna is very, very attractive, but you have to hear about Krishna from the pure devotee, because the pure devotee presents factually the actual personality of Godhead, not some speculated theory or some mental concoction, no, real Supreme Lord is presented by the pure devotee.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the ultimate goal of devotional service (Bhakti) is to develop genuine love for Krishna, which cannot be achieved through other methods like Jnana, Karma, or Yoga.

And as soon as this is affected, the symptoms of the material diseases disappear. As soon as you hear from a pure devotee, the actual message of the Bhagavatam, immediately it relieves you from these three material pangs, immediately, you feel relief. And that is the most encouraging part of the Bhagavad Gita. The process of Bhakti, Srila Vyasadeva saw the all perfect personality of Godhead and in this statement, the all perfect personality of Godhead Shri Krishna is clearly confirmed. The ultimate result of devotional service is to develop genuine love for the first Supreme personality. We have love for Krishna, but this is awakened only by this process of Bhakti. It cannot be awakened by the process of Jnana, Karma or Yoga. No material methods are possible to be practiced in order to awaken our genuine devotion or genuine love for Krishna. Love is a word which is often used in relation with man and woman. And love is the only word that can be properly used to indicate the relation between Lord

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Love is the only word that can be properly used to indicate the relation between Lord Krishna and the living entities."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the relationship between Krishna and the living entities as one of love, comparing it to the affection between male and female, with Krishna being the Parama Purusha (supreme male) and the living entities being Prakriti (feminine).

Krishna and the living entities. Why is that? Because the living entities are described as Prakriti in the Bhagavad Gita: Apareyam itasthu anyam prakritim viddhime paraam. Material energy is described as Apara Prakriti, living entities are described as Para Prakriti. So, we are Prakriti. Prakriti is feminine. The Lord is always described as the Parama Purusha, the supreme male personality. Thus, the affection between the Lord and the living entities is something like the affection between the male and the female in this material world. See why this is being said is because we have experienced what is the kind of affection that exists between a male and a female. So the term love of God, love of God is quite appropriate. If you understand from this perspective, we are feminine in terms of being Prakriti and the Lord is the supreme male. So the relationship is one of love.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Hearing about him means immediate contact with him."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that loving devotional service begins with hearing (Shravanam) about the Lord, and because Krishna is absolute, hearing about Him is the same as being in direct contact with Him, removing material affections.

That is how Prabhupada explains in this purport. Loving devotional service to the Lord begins with hearing about the Lord. Shravanam. This process for executing devotional service is hearing. There is no difference between the Lord and the subject matter heard about him. This is the absolute nature of Krishna. His descriptions are identical with his personality. The Lord is absolute in all respects and thus there is no difference between him and the subject matter heard about him. Therefore, hearing about him means immediate contact with him. The Lord is an absolute in all respects and thus there is no difference between him and the subject matter heard about him, by the process of vibration of the transcendental sound, the sound which is emanating from the lips of the pure devotee. When the devotee, pure devotee describes the Supreme Lord Krishna, that sound is a transcendental vibration and the transcendental sound is so effective that it acts at once by removing all material affections mentioned above. Everything is completely cleansed away by the powerful sound of the description of the Supreme Lord. As mentioned before, a living entity develops a sort of complexity by material association and the illusory engagement of the material body is accepted as an actual fact. We are entangled in this world and we accept this illusion as something which is real. Why is it called illusion? Illusion means something which is not real you accept as real, something which is not fact you accept as fact and the actual fact is rejected as something which is not real. This is the whole basis of illusion.

**Key Quote:** "By hearing the subject matter of Srimad Bhagavatam this false complexity of materialism is removed and real peace in society begins."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of animals being attracted to each other to illustrate how illusion works and explains that hearing the Srimad Bhagavatam removes the false complexities of materialism, leading to peace and love.

Under such false complexity, the living beings under different categories of life and become illusion in different ways. The way the illusory energy works is different for different living entities. Just like a dog, male dog is attracted to a female dog, a male pig is attracted to a female pig. Now from our perspective, the pig may be a very ugly creature or a filthy living in a filthy place in a gutter eating stool, abominable existence, but the evil energy of illusion is such that the soul in a male pig's body is attracted to the female pig's body simply to enjoy sex life, you see. Same thing happens even in bird society, animal society, even in human society also the same thing happens in the whole nature of the Universe by treating what is called happens. So Srila Prabhupada says, "Even in the most developed stage of human life, the same illusion prevails in the form many isms and divides the loving relation between the Lord and the living entities, thereby it divides the loving relation between man and man, between one living, one human being, another human being, but by hearing the subject matter of Srimad Bhagavatam, this false complexity of materialism is removed and real peace in society begins which politicians aspire for so eagerly in many political situations." So peace is the prerequisite for love, there is no possibility of love without peace.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that the Srimad Bhagavatam is the only literature that perfectly describes the Supreme Lord, and attentive hearing of it cleanses the heart, removes misconceptions, and awakens love for Krishna.

As long as our mind is agitated, disturbed, there is no possibility of love, experiencing love. So the Srimad Bhagavatam is the only literature which gives us perfect description of the Supreme Lord which is identical with the Lord and such contact with the Lord through simply hearing attentively will ensure that our heart becomes cleansed of all these misconceptions, all the wrong understanding, all the material complexities are removed and love is at once awakened. So that is the process, that's how it works. I'll stop here, thank you very much.

The meaning of this verse is: The great sage Vyasadeva, after compiling the Srimad Bhagavatam and revising it, taught it to his own son Shri Shukadeva Goswami, who was already engaged in self-realization.

**Summary:** This segment discusses Shukadeva Goswami's unique position as a liberated soul from birth, explaining why he didn't undergo traditional Vedic studies.

If you remember, the beginning of the Bhagavatam, it is explained Shukadeva Goswami walked away from home without caring to undergo any samskaras, including the Upanayana samskara. He just ignored because only after Upanayana one approaches a bona-fide spiritual master to learn the Vedas, to learn the scriptures, to learn the spiritual knowledge, but Shukadeva Swami just didn't care for any of those formalities. Why? Because he was already engaged in self-realization. He was a liberated soul by birth. It's very, very, very rare somebody is born liberated. Generally, everyone is born as a conditioned soul. The very reason for birth is that one is conditioned by material energy or material nature, but Shukadeva Swami was a liberated soul by birth, so he didn't have to

That's the question that will be raised in the next words, but here Srila Prabhupada is the one who explains about the significance of Vyasadeva compiling the Bhagavatam and teaching it to his own son. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "Srimad Bhagavatam is the natural commentation on the Brahma Sutras compiled by the same author, natural commentary on the Brahma Sutras." If you are aware, the Brahma Sutras or the Vedanta Sutras are the most scholarly presentation by Vyasadeva. The essence of the Vedas is given in the Upanishads. The essence of the Upanishads is given in the Vedanta Sutra or the Brahma Sutra. So Brahma Sutra is like the cream of the cream, and that Brahma Sutra is not easy to understand even for learned Vedic scholars. So Vyasadeva himself wrote a commentary on this Vedanta Sutra in the form of Srimad Bhagavatam, and it's called natural because the author of both the Vedanta Sutra and its commentary, the Srimad Bhagavatam, is the same person, Srila Vyasadeva.

**Key Quote:** "Material bondage means we have lost our freedom natural freedom which is there in our spiritual existence."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of material bondage, explaining how it limits our natural freedom and subjects us to the laws of material nature.

Material bondage, material bondage means we have lost our freedom, natural freedom, which is there in our spiritual existence. We are bound up by this body. We are bound up by the laws of material nature. Just like I cannot eat whatever I want, anytime I want, as much as I want. I cannot eat. If I don't obey or follow the laws of material nature, then overeating causes indigestion, or eating the wrong thing, it infects some part of the body, and we get diseased, and we suffer in so many ways due to diseases. So like this, we have lost our natural freedom because material bondage, and what is this proof of material bondage? This very material body. Every body, material body, is a limitation. The soul is completely free to travel anywhere in the whole creation, but being bound up by this body, we cannot just go anywhere and everywhere, and the means of travel also is fixed according to the body, is it not? Birds can fly, human beings cannot fly unless they use a machine called an aeroplane, or they use some yogic siddhi, otherwise they cannot fly. The aquatics can live in the water, but they cannot live on the land. We live on the land, but we cannot live in water.

**Summary:** The speaker addresses the age of the Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining how Srila Prabhupada arrives at the figure of five thousand years based on descriptions within the text and the beginning of Kali Yuga.

This mundane scholars, they have their own empirical methods of determining how old is some scripture or how many years back something was spoken about. History itself, there are so many opinions according to their own theories, but from the text of the Bhagavatam, it is very clear that this Bhagavatam is compiled before the disappearance of King Pariksit and after the departure of Lord Krishna. So this is all described in the Bhagavatam itself very clearly. When Maharaj Pariksit was ruling the world as the king of Bharata Varsha, he chastised the personality of Kali, Kali Purusha. That is described in the first canto of the Srimad Bhagavata. According to revealed scriptures and astrological calculation, the age of Kali is in its five thousandth year now. Five thousand years have already passed since Kali Yuga began. Therefore, Srimad Bhagavatam is compiled not less than five thousand years ago.

**Summary:** This section discusses the order in which Vyasadeva compiled the Vedic literatures, including the Puranas, Mahabharata, and Srimad Bhagavatam, highlighting the importance of the Bhagavatam's description of Krishna's activities.

See how Shila Prabhupada is arriving at this figure of five thousand years old based on the description in the Bhagavatam itself. Mahabharata was compiled before Srimad Bhagavatam, and the Puranas were compiled before Mahabharata. Vyasadeva is the one who compiled all this. So he compiled the Puranas, then he compiled the Mahabharata, then he compiled the Srimad Bhagavatam. That is an estimation of the date of compilation of the different Vedic literatures, especially the Puranas, Mahabharata, and Bhagavatam are very important because they describe the activities of the personality of the Srimad Bhagavatam called Krishna. The activities of the person is very rarely found in very literature. Lot of description is there about the impersonal feature, but that is the subordinate aspect of

**Summary:** The lecture concludes by explaining that the Srimad Bhagavatam is a science for following the path of nivritti marga (the path of liberation), contrasting it with pravritti marga and emphasizing its role in curing material disease.

the synopsis of Srimad Bhagavatam was given before the detailed description under instruction of Narada. Narada gave the synopsis of Bhagavatam to Vyasadeva, and Vyasadeva expanded that and presented the Srimad Bhagavatam for our understanding in an elaborate way. Srimad Bhagavatam is the science for following the path of nivritti marga. That's why it was said, nivritta niratam munihi. Shukadeva Swamy was liberated soul is the path of liberation. The path of pravritti marga was condemned by Narada. Narada, while instructing Vyasadeva, he said this pravritti marga simply increases, aggravates the diseased condition, whereas nivritta marga relieves one of the disease, material disease, and also on the path of liberation, one becomes freed from all the material miseries that was described in the previous two verses. So this path of nivritti marga is the natural, sorry, the path of pravritti marga is the natural inclination for all conditioned souls. The theme of the Srimad Bhagavatam is the cure of the materialistic disease of the human being or stopping completely the pants of material existence.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces Shounaka's question about why Shukadeva Goswami, already self-realized, undertook the study of the vast Shreemad Bhagavatam, and begins to explain the concept of sense gratification.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 9th verse of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Shreemad Bhagavatam: शाउनकव वाच. Now, after सूतकव स्वामी said that व्यास देवा taught the Shreemad Bhagavatam to his own son, immediately शाउनकव interrupts सूतकव स्वामी and asks a very, very important question. Kindly hear this question very attentively: शाउनकव वाच सवै निवृत्ति निरतहा सर्वत्रो पेक्षको मुनिही कस्यवा ब्रहतीम एताम आत्मा रामस समभ्यसत. The meaning is Shri Shounaka asked सूतकव स्वामी, "Shri Shukadev Goswami was already on the path of self-realization, and thus he was pleased with his own self, आत्मा रामा. Why did he take the trouble to undergo the self-realization, the study of such a vast literature? भागवत्म is no small literature, 18,000 verses. Why did he undergo the trouble when he was already on the path of self-realization?" So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, "For the people in general, the highest perfection of life is to cease from material activities and be fixed on the path of self-realization." फहा कि first काथवित है कि Cease for material activity means that these material activities are activities which are aimed at sense gratification. Sense gratification means the senses are always demanding some pleasure, some pleasing object of the senses. For the eyes, it is a beautiful form; for the ears, it is some melodious music or some praise. For the tongue, it is some palliative beauty. For the tongue, it is some palliative beauty.

**Key Quote:** "Srimad Bhagavatam is a post-graduate study even for the atmarama's who have to surpass all the studies of vedic knowledge."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Srimad Bhagavatam is beyond material enjoyment and even liberation, making it a postgraduate study for Atma-ramas, those who are self-satisfied.

Soul pleasure of the self. Atma means self, and arama means to take pleasure. Everyone is searching after the highest pleasure, but the standard of pleasure of one may be different from the standard of another. Of course, everybody wants pleasure, but the standard may not be the same. Therefore, the standard of pleasure enjoyed by the karmis, the materialistic persons, is different from that of the atma rama's, the transcendentalists. The atma rama's are completely indifferent to material enjoyment in every respect. Why is Srila Prabhupada mentioning this? Because he is trying to explain what is the need for Shukadeva Goswami to undertake study of this vast literature when he was already self-satisfied. What is the impetus? So, Srila Prabhupada says atma rama's are indifferent to material enjoyment. They are not interested in material enjoyment. Srila Shukadeva Goswami had already attained that stage. What stage? The stage of atma rama, taking pleasure in the self or the soul, and still he was attracted to undergo the trouble of studying the great Bhagavatam literature. So, there is an important conclusion here from this stage that Srimad Bhagavatam is stronglyуетing the atma rama's behavior. This means that Shrima Bhagavatam is a post-graduate study even for the atmarama's who have to surpass all the studies of Vedic knowledge. Atmarama's are not interested in any materials stuff, so why would they study Bhagavatam? Because Bhagavatam has got nothing to do with material sense enjoyment. It's completely transcendentalized.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on why Shukadeva Goswami, being already liberated, would not be interested in literature focused on material enjoyment or liberation, highlighting Srimad Bhagavatam's unique position.

any material 3000 years ago by the Lebensberger brothers and sisters who have been studied as cousins so that is anotherrowal to Srimad bhagavatam i am sorry , with that let me we are pretty much she nugget now called the third Mahajantik tathik Ekamika the philosophy was that Lily honest to her ego essentially completely transcendental and not only that it is transcendental it is not merely a transcendental literature which will award liberation those who are already liberated again they won't take interest in some literature which describes how you can get liberation that is the Vedanta philosophy Vedanta philosophy is meant for people who want to get out of material bondage and put an end to the repetition of birth and death and thereby put an end to all material miseries by becoming liberated by following the process of self-realization as described in the Vedanta philosophy or Vedanta literature but Shukadeva Goswami is already liberated so Shukadeva Goswami will be neither interested in material sense enjoyment nor will he be interested in that literature which describes how to get liberation both these kinds of literature are not meant for persons like Shukadeva Goswami so therefore somebody who is already liberated is not interested in certainly not interested in any material enjoyment or material sense pleasures and certainly not also interested in literature which teaches how you can get liberation then what kind of literature will such a person study that is described here as Srimad Bhagavatam that's why Srila Prabhupada uses the term

**Key Quote:** "If you were to be able to get an ocean of spiritual happiness then that ocean of spiritual happiness cannot equal even one drop of devotional happiness."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts spiritual happiness with devotional happiness, emphasizing the latter's superiority and its presence in Srimad Bhagavatam, and describes the characteristics of a pure devotee who is uninterested in liberation, seeking only to serve Krishna.

happiness is much, much, much, much more than spiritual happiness. What is the comparison? But there is something to say is that if you were to be able to get an ocean of spiritual happiness, then that ocean of spiritual happiness cannot equal even one drop of devotional happiness. There is a comparison in the book, that is something. So, devotional happiness is the happiness that is the happiness derived by devotional service to Krishna when Krishna reciprocates the devotees and service devotional service. So, that is billions and trillions of times more than any spiritual happiness also. So, that happiness is what is there in the Bhagavatam, that devotional happens. And there are so many examples given in the Bhagavatam how different great devotees, pure devotees, they experience this bliss of devotional happiness. And such pure devotees who experience devotional happiness, they deride even the conception of liberation. One great devotee, Billamangal Thakur, he says, "Ever since I am engaged in devotional service and I'm experiencing devotional happiness, I don't care for liberation, but liberation comes and waits as my maid servant, how can I serve?" So, this is the position of a pure devotee, that a pure devotee is uninterested in liberation. Certainly, a pure devotee is never interested in any material happiness. A pure devotee is not even interested in any kind of liberation. There are five kinds of liberation, but a pure devotee is not interested in any of the kinds of liberation. He is simply interested in serving Krishna because that is the source of unlimited transcendental bliss called the devotional happiness. So, Bhagavatam is filled with that. Simply by sitting and hearing Srimad Bhagavatam from the proper source, one has access to this devotional happiness. We get a glimpse of that when we begin Sankirtana. In Sankirtana, there is some kind of experience of happiness which one has never experienced before, and that is very, very, very unique. But that is only a brief glimpse we get in the beginning of our Krishna Consciousness. We have to cleanse our heart and become fixed up in devotional service to be

In this session, we are going to learn about... We are beginning a new chapter in the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, the 8th chapter.

The meaning of this verse, the first verse of this 8th chapter of the first canto of Bhagavatam: Suta Goswami said, "Thereafter the Pandavas, desiring to deliver water to their dead relatives who had desired it, went to the Ganges with Draupadi.

**Summary:** The speaker summarizes the events of the previous chapter, leading to the Pandavas' journey to the Ganges to perform rituals for their deceased relatives.

So the previous chapter described how the five sleeping sons of Draupadi were actually beheaded by Ashwatthama. And in order to punish Ashwatthama, there was a very big description of the effort involved and the actual suitable punishment that is to be given to him as an aggressor, as a Brahma Bandhu, as the son of the military teacher to whom the Pandavas were very much indebted, like that. So in the end, Ashwatthama's life was spared, but Draupadi lost her five sons. So the Pandavas, desiring to deliver water to the dead relatives, they had to do the last rituals, the final rites, for the departed souls. So they went to the Ganges with Draupadi.

**Key Quote:** "Today it is the custom in Hindu society, To go to the Ganges or any other sacred river, To take bath when death occurs in the family."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the ritual of bathing in the Ganges after a death in the family is presented, emphasizing its historical roots and connection to the Dharmashastras.

So Srila Prabhupada explains this particular ritual. Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "Today it is the custom in Hindu society to go to the Ganges or any other sacred river to take bath when death occurs in the family." Death is an inevitable part of life. That life is an inevitable part of life. That life in this body has always got a beginning and an end. So the end of life in this body is called death. And according to Bhagavad Gita, the real person inside the body, the soul, quits the body or is forced to quit the body at the time of death, at the end of this life. So when death occurs, it is the tradition and custom to go to some sacred river and take bath. And moreover, it is described here by Srila Prabhupada, each of the family members pours out a pot full of the Ganges water for the departed soul and walks in a procession with the ladies in the front. So those of you who are familiar with this custom, the rituals that are performed, one of the important rituals is called Dharmodaka, offering water. Udaka means water, offering water for the departed soul according to the particular described method in the Dharmashastras. The Pandavas also followed the rules more than 5000 years ago. So these customs and traditions and the particular rituals mentioned in Dharmashastra are not something new that has been invented now. It has always existed in human society, and it was followed by the Pandavas 5000 years ago because this is a historical record, the Srimad Bhagavatam's historical record of what happened 5000 years back when the Pandavas and Kauravas were present on this earth.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights Lord Krishna's presence among the Pandavas as their cousin, explaining the family relationship through Kunti and Vasudeva.

Now the most important point here is Lord Krishna. Who is Lord Krishna? The supreme personality of God. Being a cousin of the Pandavas, was also amongst the family members. So Krishna, how was he a cousin of the Pandavas? The Pandavas' mother, Kunti, was the sister of Krishna's father, Vasudeva. Vasudeva and Kunti were brother and sister. So therefore, Vasudeva's son, Krishna, and Kunti's sons, the Pandavas, were cousins. That's how it is described. Krishna, being a cousin of the Pandavas, was also amongst the family members. Now Krishna, what role he is going to play, will be described in a verse a little later. He was also there present in this while this ritual was being performed.

Of this eighth chapter of the first canto, of the next verse, the following verse: Te niniyodakamsarve Vilapya cha Vrishampunah Aplutaharipadapja Rajapuuta Sarigjale.

This is very significant. They were taking bath in the Ganges River. Now what is a special thing about the Ganges River? We all know it is very, very sacred, it's very holy, it's sanctified. Why that is being mentioned here in the Bhagavatam in this verse? It is because the water of the Ganges is mixed with the dust of the lotus feet of Lord Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Lord Krishna's Vamana avatar, focusing on his request for land from Bali Maharaj and his subsequent expansion to cover the universe.

So the Bhagavatam itself describes a pastime of Lord Krishna in his incarnation as Vaman Dev. When Vamana wanted to restore the kingdom of the heavenly planets to Indra, the son of Aditi, Aditi prayed to the Supreme Lord Vishnu and said, "My sons have lost their kingdom, kindly restore it to them." So the Lord, being pleased with the worship of Aditi, agreed to simply become her son, appear as her son, and that was the incarnation of the Lord as the son of Aditi. His name was Vamana. Vamana incarnation of the Lord is Vamana. He appeared as a small dwar brahmachari boy. That was the form in which he appeared. That's why Vamana, Vamana means a dwarf in some script. And then this Vamana went to Bali Maharaj, who was ruling the heavenly planets, having conquered the heavenly kingdom, and on behalf of the asuras, Bali Maharaj is ruling. So he, and Bali Maharaj is performing sacrifices. So Vamana, disguised as a brahmachari boy, the Supreme Lord Vishnu disguised as a brahmachari boy, he simply went to that arena, sacrificial arena of Bali Maharaj, and asked him, "I want a donation, three paces of land measured according to my footstep." So Bali Maharaj initially was hesitant to give that small quantity of donation, which he thought, small boy doesn't have experience asking donation. So, Bali Maharaj said, "I can give you so much donation, why are you asking for just three steps of land?" Then Vaman Dev said, "I should be satisfied with what is the bare minimum necessity," and he spoke very brilliantly telling that there is no end to greed. And anyway, Bali Maharaj thought this Brahmachari boy is speaking very intelligently, very nicely. So, he actually agreed to give that donation, and what did Vaman Dev do? He expanded himself to cover the entire universe in two steps. And, when he stretched out his leg to cover the upper portion above the earth, all the planets, until the covering of the universe, the first step. Then the toe of his foot pierced the coverings of the universe. That's very significant because the universe is covered by seven layers. Each layer being...

And that water, as it came into the universe, through the hole created by Vamana piercing the shell of the universe, that water washed the lotus feet of Vamandev, who is Vishnu, who is the Supreme Lord. And that is called Ganga."
**Summary:** The lecture concludes with an explanation of the origin of the Ganges, its spiritual potency due to washing the lotus feet of Vamana, and its ability to purify individuals and benefit departed souls.

So, like that, 4 quadrillion miles, like that the thickness of the layers. So, all those layers, the Supreme Lord pierced by merely pushing his toe into the shell of the universe. And what happened? Because these universes are situated in the Karna ocean, causal ocean. So, the water from the Karna ocean leaked inside this universe. And that water, as it came into the universe, through the hole created by Vamana piercing the shell of the universe, that water washed the lotus feet of Vamandev, who is Vishnu, who is the Supreme Lord. And that is called Ganga. So, therefore, here it is said, the water of the Ganges is sanctified because it is mixed with the dust of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. So, therefore, Ganga Jal is spiritually potent. It is spiritually potent because it contains the dust of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord Krishna. And that's the reason why anybody takes bath in the Ganges. People swim in the Ganges River. They are completely purified of all sinful reactions. When they offer that Ganges water to the departed soul, the departed soul also is actually benefited in several ways. Actions are actually cleared away when the soul is offered Ganga Jal, because the Ganga Jal is sanctified water because of being mixed with the dust of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. So, I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "O my Lord, you are all powerful...please do me this favor"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 10th verse of the 8th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on Uttara's prayer for the protection of her unborn child.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 10th verse of the 8th chapter. This is the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. From the previous session, the prayer offered by Uttara continues to Lord Krishna. This is the 10th verse: Abhidhravati Maam Eesha Sharastata Yaso Vibho Kamam Dahatum Maam Natha. Maam Eesha Sharastata Yaso Vibho Kamam Dahatum Maam Natha. Maam Eesha Sharastata Yaso Vibho Kamam Dahatum Maam Natha. Garbho Nipat Pyatam. So this is another part of the prayer offered by Uttara to Lord Krishna. So the translation of this verse is: O my Lord, you are all powerful. A fiery iron arrow is coming towards me fast. My Lord, let it burn me personally if you so desire, but please do not let it burn my embryo. Please do me this favor, my Lord. So Uttara is praying for the protection of the child in her womb because a fiery iron arrow is fast approaching her embryo, and she is praying that let it burn me personally, I don't mind, but let it not burn the child in the

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's purport is discussed, explaining the context of Uttara's situation after Abhimanyu's death and the concept of 'sati' for chaste wives.

womb. Now Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport very nicely. This incident took place after the death of Abhimanyu, the husband of Uttara. Abhimanyu, as I mentioned in an earlier session, died in the battle of Kurukshetra. Abhimanyu's widow, Uttara, should have followed the path of her husband, but because she was pregnant and Maharaj Parikshit, the great devotee of the Lord, was lying in the embryo, she was responsible for his protection. She was pregnant when Abhimanyu died, so she did not die along with the husband. She did not follow the sati procedure. For a chaste wife, when the husband dies, then the wife cannot bear the separation from the husband. The fire of separation is much more intense and intolerable than the fire of the burning funeral pyre of the husband. Therefore, a wife is not allowed to be separated from her husband, because the husband is not allowed to be separated from her wife. A chaste wife who is without children, she generally dies along with the husband's funeral. That's called sati, and by such an action, she elevates herself, which elevates her consciousness. That is a symbol of chastity.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Uttara's qualities and lineage, emphasizing her role as a mother and a student of Arjuna, highlighting her fortunate position.

Now here, Uttara should have followed her husband, but because she was pregnant, she did not do so. And who was in the womb? It was not an ordinary child, it was Maharaj Pariksit, a great devotee of the Lord, and as a mother, she is responsible for his protection. The mother of a child has a great responsibility in giving all protection to the child, and therefore Uttara was not ashamed to express this frankly before Lord Krishna. She very frankly admitted that I want to protect my child, kindly save this child. Uttara was the daughter of Maharaj, a great king. Her father was also a great king, the wife of a great hero. Abhimanyu was a great hero, fought valiantly in the battle of Kurukshetra. She was his wife, a student of a great devotee, and later she was a mother of a good king also. Student of a great devotee when Pandavas were incognito, living incognito in Virata's kingdom. Uttara was the daughter of King Virata. So she was Arjuna disguised himself as a dance teacher and Uttara became the student of Arjuna. So therefore a student of a great devotee, Arjuna is that great devotee. And later she was a mother of a good king also. That is Parikshit Maharaj. Arjuna became the emperor of the world and so later on she was the mother of the great king.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 11th verse, explaining Krishna's understanding of Ashwatthama's use of the Brahmastra to eliminate the Pandava lineage.

She was fortunate in every respect. So that is the position of Uttara that is being glorified here. Now the next verse describes what is the response of Krishna. The eleventh verse. So, the meaning of this eleventh verse, Suta Goswami is speaking. Having patiently heard her words, Lord Shri Krishna, who's always very devotees, Bhaktavatsala, could at once understand that Ashwatthama, the son of Dronacharya, had thrown the Brahmastra to finish the last life in the Pandava family. If you remember, this Dronacharya's son, Ashwatthama, had tried to throw a Brahmastra to save his own life earlier when Arjuna was chasing him, and Krishna directed Arjuna to neutralize the Brahmastra so that it would not do any harm. Now again, he has thrown a Brahmastra to finish the last life of the in the Pandava family.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's purport is further discussed, emphasizing the Lord's inclination towards devotees for the well-being of everyone and the importance of reinstating living beings in their original position as loving devotees of Krishna.

This only surviving descendant of the Pandavas. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says the Lord is impartial in every respect, but still he is inclined towards the Lord. The Lord supports his devotees because there is a great necessity of this for everyone's well-being. Devotees are meant for the well-being of everyone in the world because devotees do the greatest welfare activity. There are many people who are engaged in different kinds of welfare activity, but which welfare activity is the best? That which reinstates every living being in his or her original position as the loving devotee of the Supreme Lord in his personal abode. We all belong to Krishna. There is no reason for us to suffer in this material world other than our foolishness of becoming forgetful of Krishna or being rebellious, envious of Krishna, trying to compete with Krishna, trying to assume Krishna's position or trying to be independent of Krishna. So many different reasons can be cited why living beings in this material world who don't belong to this world, who belong to Krishna's personal abode, they are away from Krishna due to various

reasons and all foolish, all foolish reasons. So the Lord takes compassion and he personally comes and he instructs, he speaks the Bhagavad Gita, he sends his representatives and those representatives are being mentioned here. Because there is a great necessity of Krishna's pure devotees in this world for everyone's well-being. That's a great necessity. The Pandava family was a family of devotees and therefore the Lord wanted them to rule the world. See devotees rule the world then there is well-being for everyone because the devotees see everyone as part and parcel of Krishna. They don't see them in terms of their external body. Oh so and so is this particular resident or national or some particular person belonging to particular state or community or caste or no that's not the way a devotee sees other living beings. A devotee sees all living beings as part and parcel of Krishna. This is what is told in the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna is described in the Bhagavad Gita as surdasarvabhutana and the devotees are described as surdasarvadehina. Same meaning. Sarvadehina means all living beings in different forms of bodies. Sarvabhutana means all devotees. Sarvabhutana means all different living beings in different forms of bodies. Same meaning. So the Lord is the best well-wisher of all living beings. Similarly his pure devotees are also the best well-wishers of all living beings. So both the Lord and his pure devotees

are similarly the well-wishers. That was the reason he vanquished the rule of the company of Duryodhana and established the rule of Maharaja Yudhishtira. It's not a question of just competency in ruling. Duryodhana was competent to rule. We can't say he was incompetent, but Duryodhana was lacking that devotion. Therefore Duryodhana was typically having different kinds of feelings in his heart for different categories of people. So and so is my enemy. So and so is my friend. So and so is my well-wisher. Somebody else is my competitor. All kinds of this enviousness. A mentality of differentiation based on externals without looking into the core of the heart that every living being belongs to Krishna. A non-devotee himself doesn't know that he belongs to Krishna. So how will he understand others connection with Krishna. He will never understand by himself if he continues to be in material existence. So therefore to bring about the welfare of all the citizens, all the people of this world, Krishna vanquished the rule of the company of Duryodhana and established the rule of Maharaja Yudhishtira. He also wanted to protect Maharaja Pariksit who was lying in the embryo for the same reason. The successor to Yudhishtira is Pariksit Maharaj, the only surviving descendant in the entire Pandava era. He did not like the idea that the world should be without the Pandavas, the ideal family of devotees. Apandavam idam kartum. Apandavam. This Ashwathama wanted to finish off the last life in the Pandava family so that the world will be without any descendants of the Pandavas, but Krishna did not like that because he wanted pure devotees to rule the world and continue to successively rule. Their descendants who are also pure devotees should successfully rule the world. That's what Krishna wants. And even preaching Krishna consciousness is the only way to do that.

**Key Quote:** "Brahmastra is a fine weapon, which works on mantra the subtle sound vibration and only a trained person can actually release such a Astra by simply using a mantra ashwatthama discharge the brahmastra simply to kill the Pandavas"
**Summary:** The speaker compares the Brahmastra to nuclear weapons, highlighting its precision and lack of indiscriminate harm compared to atomic bombs.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Jai Vanarottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udhirayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 12th verse of the 8th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Taryevatha Munishreshtha Pandava Panchasayakan Atmanobhimukhan Deeptan Alaksya Astrani Upadaduhu. The meaning of this verse: all foremost among the great thinkers, munis, referring to Saunaka, seeing the glaring Brahmastra proceeding towards them, the Pandavas took up their five respective weapons. There was a description earlier that Uttara saw a fiery iron. She saw a fiery iron arrow coming towards her very fast, and she sought shelter of Lord Krishna to protect the embryo, to protect the child in the womb, in her womb. Now here the description is that not only that Astra was released by Ashwatthama to kill the child in the womb, but also it was aimed at killing the five Pandavas. So in the proportiona Pravapara explains, the Brahmastras are finer than the nuclear weapons. This has been discussed earlier. Brahmastra is a fine weapon, which works on mantra, the subtle sound vibration, and only a trained person can actually release such a Astra by simply using a mantra. Ashwatthama discharged the Brahmastra simply to kill the Pandavas, namely the five brothers headed by Maharaja Yudhishtira, and their only grandson was lying within the womb of Uttara, so the target of this Brahmastra which was released by Ashwatthama were six personalities: the five Pandavas and the only surviving descendant of the Pandavas, the grandson of Arjuna, that is Pariksit in the womb of his mother Uttara. Therefore, the Brahmastra, more effective and finer than the atomic weapons, was not as blind as the atomic bombs, even though a comparison is made here that the Brahmastra is something like a nuclear weapon or atomic bomb, but actually it is not blind. When a nuclear bomb is dropped somewhere, it kills so many people, including the innocent people who have nothing to do with war

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the Brahmastra's ability to specifically target individuals, making it impossible to hide from.

who are not any party to any particular fight between some people. So the damage done by atomic bomb or by nuclear weapons is too much, and what is very bad about it is that even the innocent people are unnecessarily killed. So it is said here, when the atomic bombs are discharged, they do not discriminate between the target and others. Atomic bombs don't discriminate; mainly the atomic bombs do harm to the innocent because there is no control. This is a fact. Innocent people are killed in huge numbers. The Brahmastra is not like that, not like the atomic bomb or not like the nuclear weapon. This Brahmastra marks out the target and proceeds accordingly without harming the innocent, so it's much finer. It is directed towards a specific target, and the astra will go searching for the target wherever the target may be. There is no possibility that somebody can hide themselves and protect themselves when a Brahmastra is released against them. No possibility of hiding and protecting, not possible, because it will search out wherever the target is.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the Brahmastra's reliance on mantra and the specific targeting of the Pandavas and Uttara's child by Ashwatthama.

So our understanding should be that Brahmastra is a very, very, very fine weapon. It is based on the appropriate mantra, and only qualified people or trained people can actually use such weapons, fine weapons, and it has got a very, very specific target or targets even, just like here, this Brahmastra released by Ashwathama, and the second time he is releasing the Brahmastra ever since the incident of killing the five sleeping sons of Draupadi. Since that incident, second time now Ashwathama is releasing the Brahmastra, and this time the target was specifically the five Pandavas

and the child in the womb of Uttara, the grandson of the Pandavas, Pariksha. The 13th verse, the meaning of this 13th verse: the Almighty personality of God is Shri Krishna, having observed that a great danger was befalling his unalloyed devotees who were fully surrendered souls, at once took up his sudarshan disc to protect them. Now you see the reaction of the Lord. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport elaborately, the Brahmastra, the supreme weapon released by Ashwatthama, was something similar to the nuclear weapon, but with more radiation and heat. This Brahmastra is the product of a more subtle science, being the product of the finer sound, a chapter recorded in the Vedas. In the Vedas, there are different mantras for different purposes, but the important aspect of mantras is all of them are sound vibrations which have got very, very specific purposes

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the Hare Krishna mantra with destructive mantras and emphasizes the importance of devotees' complete dependence on Krishna for protection.

purpose for being utilized in a particular way. Now the Hare Krishna mantra is also a mantra in the Vedas. It is mentioned in the Kali Santarana Upanishad, but this mantra, Hare Krishna mantra, is not meant for any destructive purpose. It is especially meant for self-realization, God realization, and therefore it is very, very, very special, this Hare Krishna mantra. Srila Prabhupada further says, "The advantage of this weapon is that it is not blind like the nuclear weapon." This was already discussed in the previous verse, because it can be directed only to the target and nothing else, so no harm to anybody else except the target. Ashwatthama released the weapon just to finish all the male members of Pandus family. Therefore, in one sense, it was more than dangerous than the atomic bombs because it could penetrate even the most protected place and would never miss the target. So there is no, as I explained in connection with the previous words, there is no possibility of missing the target or somebody hiding from this Brahmastra. That's not possible. Go searching for the target. Knowing all this, Lord Shri Krishna at once took up his personal weapon to protect his devotees who did not know anyone other than Krishna. See, ananya vishayatmana, that means the devotees who are totally dependent on Krishna, they have no other means of protection, though they may be very powerful warriors. The Pandavas are powerful warriors, but still as devotees they are simply dependent upon Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights Krishna's promise to protect his devotees and the unlimited power he possesses to do so.

Knowing very well that all their powers are ultimately limited. Nobody can have unlimited power except the Supreme Lord, so to depend on the Supreme Lord is the most intelligent thing to do because the Lord can give complete protection against any danger, and the Lord is quite capable of doing that because he has got unlimited power, unlike the others who are always powerful by limitation. Now in the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna has clearly promised that his devotees are never to be vanquished. Kaunteya pratijaanihi na me bhakta pranasyati, my devotees are never vanquished. This is what Krishna declares in the

**Summary:** The speaker explains how Krishna's actions are based on the degree of devotional service and the complete dependence of pure devotees like the Pandavas.

Bhagavad Gita. So devotees are always protected by Krishna when they actually learn to depend for protection upon the Supreme Lord only, exclusively on the Supreme Lord, and not any other means of protection. The Supreme Lord Krishna behaves in a way that is completely different from that of any other Lord according to the quality or degree of the devotional service rendered by the devotees. Now Krishna has got so many devotees and their devotional service is of different levels. Now here the word ananya vishayatmanam is significant. What does it mean? The Pandavas was cent percent dependent on the protection of the Lord, although they were all great warriors themselves. See the characteristic of pure devotees, they completely depend on Krishna even though they may be great warriors themselves. Now as far as the Supreme Lord is concerned, sometimes he neglects even the greatest of warriors, and sometimes he vanquishes all of them. As far as the Supreme Lord concerns, sometimes he negulates even the greatest of warriors and sometimes he vanquishes all of them.

But when the Lord saw that his devotees, his pure devotees, sent person dependent devotees, the Pandavas, there was danger for their life by the Brahmastra released by Ashwatthama, the Lord personally took up his own weapon at the risk of breaking his own vow. Krishna taken above, I will never take any weapon, but he thought it proper to actually take the weapon, his sudarshan chakra, in order to protect his devotees. He is known as bhaktavatsala, that means he is very, very affectionate to his devotees and he'll protect them at all costs because they are dependent on his centaurs.

**Key Quote:** "For the sake of his devotees, he is prepared to do anything and everything to protect them."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of depending on Krishna alone for protection and highlights Krishna's willingness to do anything for his devotees.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 14th verse of the 8th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. अन्तस्थ सर्वभूतानाम् आत्मा योगेश्वरो हरिही स्वमायया आवुरुनोद गर्भं. The meaning of this verse is, the Lord of Supreme Mysticism, Yogeishvara Harihī, Shri Krishna, resides within everyone's heart as the Paramatma. As such, just to protect the progeny of the Kuru dynasty, he covered the embryo of Uttara by his personal energy. So what all is Shri Krishna doing? For the sake of his devotees, he is prepared to do anything and everything to protect them. So therefore, Shastras say, always depend on the Supreme Lord and nobody else. Even Krishna declares in the Bhagavad Gita, "You surrender to me alone, exclusively. Take my shelter exclusively." Because only Krishna is dependable for everyone. And nobody is his enemy. Nobody is his friend. He is the well-wisher of everyone.

Surdam Sarvabhutana. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, "The Lord of Supreme Mysticism, Yogeshwaro Harihi, can simultaneously reside within everyone's heart or even within the atoms by his Paramatma feature, his plenary portion." This Paramatma feature is a very special feature of the Supreme Lord in the material world only. Paramatma feature is the expansion of the Lord who has entered into the heart of every living being within this material existence and also entered into every material atom. So this Paramatma feature is a very, very special feature. Now it is mentioned here that Krishna is present as Paramatma in the heart of everyone. So therefore, it is said here, from within the body of Uttara, the mother of Pariksit, and Uttara had prayed to Krishna, "Please protect the child in my womb." So from within the body of Uttara, Lord Krishna covered the embryo to save Maharaj Pariksit and protect the progeny of Maharaj Kuru, of whom King Pandu was also a descendant. Kuru tantave, for the progeny of Maharaj Kuru. Pariksit is described as the progeny of Maharaj Kuru because this Pariksit was the only surviving descendant of the Pandavas

**Summary:** This segment details the lineage of the Kuru dynasty, the distinction between Kauravas and Pandavas, and Dhritarashtra's desire for his sons to rule.

and even the only surviving descendant of the Kuru dynasty, because all others were vanquished in the battle. All the hundred sons of Dhritarashtra were killed in the battle. So there was no, and their children and their grandsons of Dhritarashtra, all of them were killed. So therefore, to save the only remaining descendant of the Kuru dynasty, the Supreme Lord from within the body of Uttara, covered the embryo. Now, in doing so, he engaged his personal energy. His personal energy is his internal potency, non-different from him, and that internal potency is supremely powerful, as powerful as Krishna himself. So nobody can do any harm when the Supreme Lord, by his personal energy, covers or protects somebody. In his own sense, the supreme authority doesn't matter. The Supreme Lord can do nothing, but He can change people in his own way. For example, if you take the Kuru dynasty of Viparaj, for example, the way it is called in the holy Gita, if you look at the rosary, the rosary of Viparaj, the rosary of Kuru, the rosary of Viparaj, the rosary of the Supreme Lord, the rosary of Viparaj, everything is changed. That is also a special thing. But though the Kurus, or they should be called the present generation of Kurus of the Kuru dynasty, but when there were some differences between the two families, the sons of Dhritarashtra were known as Kurus, where the sons of Pandu were known as Pandavas. See, this was particularly Dhritarashtra

making a distinction. It is explained in the first opening verse of the Bhagavad Gita itself, in the first chapter, first verse: Dharmakshetre Kurukshetre Samaveta Yuyutsavaha Mamaka Pandavas Jaiva Dhritarashtra, making a distinction between his own sons, and they are referred to as Kauravas, descendants of Kuru dynasty, but the Pandavas, they are also descendants, but they are not identified as descendants, they are separated from the family lineage. And this always was Dhritarashtra's plan. Somehow or other, he could not become the Emperor because he was born blind, so he wanted his sons to succeed in becoming the Emperor's reward. But Krishna had a different plan. Krishna wants his devotees to be ruling the world, only then people will get real benefit of a Krishna conscious ruler like Yudhishtira or Parichit. Since the sons and grandsons of Dhritarashtra were all killed in the battle of Kurukshetra, the last son of the dynasty is designated as the son of the Kurus, even though Parichit is the grandson of the Pandavas. And when the battle was going on, the Pandavas were identified as Pandavas, and Kauravas were the sons of Dhritarashtra were identified as Kauravas, the sons of Pandu were identified as Pandavas. They both are actually descendants of the Kuru dynasty, but now the last son of the dynasty, that is Parichit, is designated as the son of the Kuru's, Kuru tantave, for the progeny of Maharaja Kuru.

**Key Quote:** "So the strength of the Supreme Lord is supreme strength. And no weapon or no other force can actually work against the protection of Vishnu or Krishna."
**Summary:** This segment explains how Krishna neutralized the Brahmastra weapon to protect Pariksit, emphasizing the supreme strength of the Lord.

Because all these sons and grandsons of the Dhritarashtra were killed in the battle, the 15th verse: yadyapi astram brahma shiraha to amogham cha apratikriyam vaishnavam teja asadya samashamyan brahudvaha. The meaning of this verse says, "Oh Shanaka, although the Supreme Brahmastra weapon released by Ashurthama was irresistible and without check or counteraction, it was neutralized and foiled when confronted by the strength of Vishnu, Lord Krishna." So several times this has been explained that the Brahmastra weapon is irresistible. Nobody can counteract a Brahmastra weapon except by another Brahmastra, and that also by one who is trained how to utilize the Brahmastra and how to counteract another Brahmastra. They should learn that specifically. Otherwise, it is irresistible and it is without any check or counteraction. But when this Brahmastra, which is very, very powerful, a subtle weapon, it was neutralized and foiled by the strength of Vishnu. The Supreme Lord Krishna personally covered the womb of Uttara and neutralized this Brahmastra, so it could not do any harm to the child Pariksit in the womb of Uttara, even though the target was fixed when Ashwatthama released. So in spite of the target being fixed and Brahmastra being irresistible, it was neutralized and foiled by the strength of the Supreme Lord Krishna. So the strength of the Supreme Lord is supreme strength, and no weapon or no other force

can actually work against the protection of Vishnu or Krishna. Now in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "In the Bhagavad Gita it is said that the Brahmajyoti or the glowing transcendental effulgence is resting on Lord Sri Krishna." This is explained in the 14th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, the 27th verse: Brahmano hi pratishta aham. Krishna says, "I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman." Brahmajyoti, that is the effulgence emanating from the transcendental body of Krishna, and it covers the entire spiritual sky. It is the transcendental energy of the Supreme Lord, and that Brahmajyoti is the source of the entire material creation. Actually, it is sourced from Krishna, but through the Brahmajyoti. In other words, the glowing effulgence known as Brahmatejas is nothing but the rays of the Lord, just as the sun rays are rays of the sun disc.

**Key Quote:** "Everyone else is dependent on Krishna. But Krishna is not dependent on anyone else. Krishna is always independent. Krishna is absolute."
**Summary:** This segment reiterates that the Brahmastra cannot surpass Vishnu's strength and emphasizes Krishna's independence and absolute nature.

So this Brahmatejas which is described here: yadyapi astram brahma shiraha tu amogham cha apratikriyam vaishnavam teja asadya. Vaishnavam means in relation to Vishnu. This Brahmastra is actually materially irresistible, but it cannot surpass the supreme strength of Vishnu or Krishna. The weapon called Brahmastra released by Aswatthama was neutralized and foiled by Shri Krishna by his own energy. That is to say, he did not wait for any other's help because he is absolute. See, this distinction we should always note between the Supreme Lord and anyone else. Everyone else is dependent on Krishna, but Krishna is not dependent on anyone else. Krishna is always independent. Krishna is absolute. This distinction eternally exists between the Supreme Lord Krishna and everyone else in the entire creation, even in the spiritual world also. Nobody is equal to Krishna. Nobody is greater than Krishna. Asamordhva. So this is an eternal fact.

**Summary:** This segment clarifies the difference between the impersonal Brahman and the personal feature of Krishna, emphasizing that the individual soul (Anu Atma) is a tiny part of the Supreme Lord.

In fact, those who do not know about the personal feature of the absolute truth, they wrongly think that the impersonal feature, the Brahmajyoti or the Brahman feature of the absolute truth, is the same as the identity of the living being, the tiny living being, Anu Atma. That's what they think, which is completely wrong. Anu Atma is a tiny particle, a portion of the Supreme Lord, and the Supreme Lord is always supremely powerful, unlimitedly powerful, the source of everyone and everything, and his energy can never be equal with anything else. So that is being explained here.

Here, Ashtariya, Maya, and Achyuta, two different qualities of the Supreme Lord are described, because we think that he is a person like us, or he is a person a little more powerful than us. No, he is supremely powerful, he is unlimitedly powerful, he can never be compared with anybody else, he is incomparable, and he is absolute. He always is in that position of having the supreme power, always, eternally, it's a fact. So, therefore, this point, nothing is impossible for the Supreme Lord, but all his actions are wonderful for us, and thus he is always beyond the range of our conceivable limits.

This will be explained in a future verse, which is a prayer offered, a series of prayers offered by Queen Kunti. That's the main subject of this chapter, prayers by Queen Kunti, but we're going to start discussing that from the next session, the prayers of Queen Kunti and the series of prayers, wonderful prayers. So, these prayers expressed by self-realized pure devotees clearly helps us understand what is the nature of the Supreme Lord. So, one of the things mentioned here is, the Supreme Lord's actions are always beyond the range of our conceivable limits. The Lord is the all-powerful, all-perfect personality of Godhead, all-powerful, all-perfect. There's no trace of any defect or any inebriety. The Lord is the Supreme Lord. The Lord is 100% perfect. Here, the Lord is referring to Krishna. Krishna is 100% perfect, whereas others, namely Narayana, Brahma, Shiva, the demigods, and all other living beings, possess only different percentages of such perfection. This is analyzed by the Goswamis of Vrindavan, the disciples of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, that only Krishna is 100% perfect.

**Key Quote:** "Pure devotion is completely independent of everything else."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's description of Kunti as a chaste devotee due to her unalloyed devotion, emphasizing the independence of pure bhakti from karma and jnana.

And there will be a series of prayers Kunti will offer to Krishna. In the purport, it is explained by Srila Prabhupada, Kunti is described here as a sati, or chaste, due to her unalloyed devotion to Lord Sri Krishna. This term is used by Prabhupada many times in the Bhagavad Gita. Unalloyed devotion. Unalloyed means it is 100% pure. There is no admixture of karma or jnana in such bhakti. Pure devotional service is described by Srila Prabhupada Swami as anyabila ashita shunyam jnana karmadi anavratam. jnana karmadi anavratam. It is unmixed with any jnana or karma, because karma and jnana without bhakti is never successful. Any pious activity anybody may do, if it is not mixed with a little bhakti, it will always be incomplete, unsuccessful, imperfect. Same thing with transcendental knowledge. Unless that is mixed with a little bhakti, it is always imperfect, incomplete. So, both karma and jnana are dependent on bhakti for a person to achieve perfection. But bhakti, which is pure bhakti, is independent of karma and jnana. Bhakti is never dependent on karma or jnana. Pure devotion is completely independent of everything else. So, therefore, Kunti is described as the most, the chaste lady, sati.

A chaste devotee of the Lord does not look to others, namely any other living being or demigod, even for deliverance from danger. Typically, in the material world, we have got different sources for prayer, depending on the type of protection, depending on the type of danger, or depending on the type of problem we may face, or depending on the type of facilities we may have. We have so many sources of protection. We may have so many different dangers. The material world is always filled with dangers. Padam padam yat vipadam. But, for a pure devotee of Krishna, Krishna is the only protector. And, Krishna is the only protector means such a devotee never depends on another living being or another demigod. Never. So, this is very, very significant. Nobody else in the material world, other than a pure devotee, depends exclusively on Krishna. So, this is what we should learn from the Bhagavatam and from the lives of great devotees. And, from Krishna's own instructions, we should learn this, that we have no guarantee of 100% protection except when we learn to completely depend on Krishna. So, if at all you want full protection, under all circumstances, you should learn to depend on Krishna exclusively.

**Key Quote:** "One should look for all help from Krishna alone, who is competent always to save his devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the Pandava family as an example of complete dependence on Krishna, explaining the reciprocal relationship and warning against seeking imperfect help from other sources.

Now, Krishna is there and also so many other people are there to protect me. No. So, Srila Prabhupada says here, that was all along the characteristic of the whole family of the Pandavas. It's not just true of Kunti. It's true of all the family members of the Pandavas, Pandava family. They knew nothing except Krishna, and therefore the Lord was also always ready to help them in all respects, in all circumstances. See, Krishna is always reciprocally giving protection or offering some help. If I depend completely on Krishna, then Krishna will protect me and help me always under all circumstances. But, if I am not so much completely dependent on Krishna, then Krishna will say, depending on who you want to take protection from, take protection from that source. And that is not guaranteed to protect us in all circumstances, other sources. So, therefore, one should not look for imperfect help from imperfect living beings or from demigods, but one should look for all help from Krishna alone, who is competent always to save his devotees. So, that is the conclusion.

**Key Quote:** "O Krishna, I offer my obeisances unto you because you are the original personality and are unaffected by the qualities of the material world. You are existing both within and without everything. Yet, you are not the original personality. You are invisible to all."
**Summary:** Explanation of the 18th verse of the 8th chapter, focusing on Kunti's understanding of Krishna as the original personality, present everywhere yet invisible to many.

So the 18th verse. The meaning of this verse is, Shri Mati Kunti said, O Krishna, I offer my obeisances unto you because you are the original personality and are unaffected by the qualities of the material world. You are existing both within and without everything. Yet, you are not the original personality. You are invisible to all. So, Kunti's 1st prayer in the series of prayers, she is offering obeisances to Krishna as she knows Krishna is not just her relative. Krishna is not just her brother's son, not just her nephew. But, Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the original personality who is always transcendentally situated, unaffected by material qualities, even when he descends to this material world. And one more thing she is telling here, Krishna exists both within and without everything, inside everything, outside of everything. Now, this is not easy. This is not easy to comprehend. And, she is also telling, in spite of you being present inside everything and outside of everything, still, you are not visible to everyone. You are invisible to all.

**Key Quote:** "Shri Mati Kunti Devi was quite aware that Krishna is the original personality of Godhead, although he was playing the part of her nephew."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing that Krishna's supreme position remains unchanged even when he incarnates and plays a specific role.

So, Srila Prabhupada has written an elaborate purport for this. Let us try to hear from Prabhupada what he says. So, Prabhupada begins his purport by telling, Shri Mati Kunti Devi was quite aware that Krishna is the original personality of Godhead, although he was playing the part of her nephew. See, Krishna when he incarnates, he plays the part of a particular person and yet he remains the supreme personality of Godhead under all situations and circumstances. His absolute position, supreme position does not change even though he may appear to be like Krishna, younger than Kunti Devi, subordinate to somebody else, but his supreme position is unchanged because he is the original personality of Godhead. And Prabhupada further says, such an enlightened lady could not commit a mistake by offering obeisances to her nephew. Generally the etiquette is, they should not commit a mistake. The younger ones offer obeisances to the elders. But here Kunti, elderly lady, she is offering obeisances to somebody who is younger, many many years younger. So why? That is because Krishna is no ordinary person. He is the original personality of Godhead. Devi is addressing Krishna as the original Purusha beyond the material cosmos. We are all created beings within this material world, whereas Krishna exists beyond this material creation. He is beyond this material creation. And even beyond the material creation, though there are many many many liberated souls, devotees, Krishna is the original Purusha, original personality, original Lord. So that is Krishna's actual position.

#### Transcendental Nature, Infallibility, Maya

**Key Quote:** "Although all living entities are also transcendental, they are neither original nor infallible."
**Summary:** Distinction between Krishna and other living entities, highlighting Krishna's original nature, infallibility (Achyuta), and control over Maya.

Now Srila Prabhupada says one very important thing here. Although all living entities are also transcendental, they are neither original nor infallible. We are also part of the spiritual world. We belong to the spiritual world. We are all transcendental entities, but we are not original. So we have our source in Krishna. Krishna is always our eternal controller, and we are eternally controlled. And one more point is, we are not infallible like Krishna. Krishna is called Achyuta. Achyuta means one who never falls down from his transcendental position, one who never comes under the clutches of Maya. How is that? Krishna is the controller of Maya, of the illusory energy. Eternally he is the controller, so he will never come under the clutches of Maya. So Krishna is called infallible, means one who never falls down into this material existence.

#### Transcendental Birth, Incarnation, Control

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Even when he appears to take birth, He is merely coming from the spiritual world to give darshan to all of us."
**Summary:** Explanation of Krishna's transcendental birth (Janma karma chamaya divyam) and how it differs from the birth of ordinary living entities who fall under the influence of material nature.

So even when Krishna comes, he may appear to take birth like the son of Vasudeva and Devaki, but his birth is transcendental. Janma karma chamaya divyam. In the Bhagavad Gita this is explained in the fourth chapter, ninth verse. Janma karma chamaya divyam. Divyam means transcendental birth. What is the meaning of transcendental birth? That even when he appears to take birth, he is merely coming from the spiritual world to give darshan to all of us in the material world. He becomes visible. That's all. He is always present as the Supreme Lord. In that same position he appears. He incarnates. He takes birth in the same position. His position doesn't change. Now as opposed to Krishna, who never changes his position, the living entities are apt to fall down under the clutches of material nature. Whenever a living being who actually belongs to the spiritual world wants to independently enjoy, wants to materially enjoy, or wants to try to become independent of Krishna's control, such a living being is forced to come under the clutches of material nature. Krishna is not like that, never. He is always the Lord. He is the Lord of all living entities. He is the Lord of the material nature. He is the Lord of the spiritual nature. He is the Lord of Vaikuntha. He is the Lord of this material creation. He is the Lord of everyone and everything, always, eternally.

**Key Quote:** "He is the chief eternal among so many eternals. All the living entities are eternal. But Krishna is the chief eternal."
**Summary:** Krishna's position as the chief eternal (Nithyo Nithyanam) and supreme controller (Eeshwara), as described in the Vedas and Brahma Samhita.

So that is Krishna's position. In the Vedas, therefore, he is described, Krishna is described as, the chief among all living entities. Nithyo Nithyanam Chetanus Chetananam. In the Upanishad, Kathopanishad, this is stated. He is the chief eternal among so many eternals. All the living entities are eternal, but Krishna is the chief eternal. He is the supreme eternal being. And Chetanus Chetananam, he is the supremely conscious being among so many conscious living entities. That is Krishna's unique position. Now, Krishna is also addressed as Eeshwara. Eeshwaram Prakriteparam. Eeshwaram. Eeshwara here refers to controller. Now, the living beings also may have some position of control, just like Surya, Chandra, Indra, Varuna, Vayu, but they are not supreme Eeshwara. Supreme Eeshwara is only one. That is Krishna. Eeshwaraha, Paramaha, Krishna, Sachidananda, Vikraha. In the Brahma Samhita it is said, Param Eeshwara, Supreme Eeshwara. And Krishna is also, Eeshwara means the controller. He is the ultimate controller. He is the controller of all controllers. There is nobody above him. There is nobody equal to him. Asamordhva. This is Krishna's position.

**Summary:** Explanation of Krishna's presence within everyone's heart as the Supersoul (Param Atma), and how He is the source of remembrance, knowledge, and the ultimate goal of Vedic knowledge.

Now, Krishna was present before Kunti Devi and all the others who had assembled to see him off. But, Kunti knew that, even though he is present in front of her, he is also seated in her heart. He is also seated in everybody's heart as a super soul. So, in the Bhagavad Gita this is confirmed. Kunti Devi is telling, you are present within everyone, and also you are present outside of everyone. So, how is it possible to understand this? That is explained by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, 15th chapter, 15th verse. Sarvasya Chaham Rudi Sanni Vishto. I am seated in everyone's heart as the Param Atma, super soul. And, only due to Krishna do we get remembrance, knowledge, and gratefulness. Matthaha Smritir Gyanam Apohanamcha. And, through all the Vedas, I am to be known. Vedaischa Sarvair Ahameva Vedyam. The Vedas, so many subject matters are discussed in the Vedic literature, but the aim is to know who is Krishna, who is the ultimate source of everything, who is the ultimate controller of everyone and everything. And, that is declared as Krishna. And, Krishna is the compiler of the Vedas, and he is the knower of the Vedas. So, this is the unique position of Krishna.

#### All-Pervading vs. Localized, Surrender, Recognition of Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna is both he is all-pervading is also localized but in spite of being present every day he is standing before the Kunti Devi"
**Summary:** Discussion on how Krishna is both all-pervading and localized, and how only surrendered souls can truly recognize Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Hmm. Kuntidevi experienced that, even though Krishna was present outside, still, when the child in the womb of Uttara was in danger of being attacked by a Brahmastra released by Ashwathama, Krishna immediately entered the womb of Uttara to save the child from the attack of Ashwatthama's Brahmastra. So Kunti Devi actually herself was puzzled, is Krishna all-pervading or is localized? What do the meaning of all-pervading? He is present everywhere, but actually localized means he's in a specific place, particular place, just like he's standing in front of Kunti them in Hastinapura is present in front of Kunti. So easy localized or easy all-pervading? So the answer is Krishna is both. He is all-pervading, he is also localized. But in spite of being present every day, he is standing before the Kunti Devi saying you would be some 20, 30 minutes everywhere. In spite of being present within everything, in spite of being present outside, just like I can see you or you can see me, like that everybody when Krishna incarnated could have seen Krishna, but still he reserves the right of not being exposed to persons who are not surrendered souls. Those who are not surrendered, when they see Krishna, they see him as another ordinary person. They seem as another ordinary person. They cannot recognize, oh, here is the supreme personality of God. So how is it that they're not able to recognize that? We expand in the next words. So I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

#### Krishna's Transcendence, Deluding Energy (Maya), Spiritual vs. Material Energy
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/Grd67ulwNlQ?t=70
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna is beyond the range of our senses to perceive. Krishna's form is completely spiritual."
**Summary:** This segment explains how Krishna is beyond the perception of our limited senses due to His spiritual nature and how He is covered by deluding energy (Maya), both material and spiritual, which bewilders living entities.

The meaning of this verse is, being beyond the range of limited sense perception, you are the eternally irreproachable factor covered by the curtain of deluding energy. You are invisible to the foolish observer, exactly as an actor dressed as a player is not recognized. So, some words which are maybe not easily understandable, let me try to explain them in a little more easily understandable way. Being beyond the range of limited sense perception. With sense perception, sense perception means with our senses, we are seeing, hearing, smelling, touching, tasting, perception, we are perceiving. We are getting knowledge from outside through these five senses. Krishna is beyond this range of our senses to perceive. Because Krishna's form is completely spiritual. So, these eyes cannot see spiritual form. These ears cannot hear spiritual sound. You see, that's why Krishna's personality is totally spiritual. And therefore, he is beyond the range of limited sense perception. Krishna is also described as the eternally irreproachable. In your case, Krishna is the irreproachable factor. Irreproachable means faultless. Krishna is eternally faultless. Whereas, one of the qualities of every living being is, the living being being very, very limited. Every living being being very limited is prone to commit mistakes. This is one of the characteristics of every living being. Even though, such great personalities like big big devatas, they also sometimes commit mistakes, so nobody is eternally faultless except Krishna. So, therefore Krishna is described here as eternally irreproachable factor, eternally faultless, and he is also covered by a curtain of deluding energy, maya javanika chanam. Maya javanika means curtain. Maya means of the curtain made up of the deluding energy. Deluding energy means that energy which bewilders us. Krishna is covered by a curtain of deluding energy. Krishna has got two kinds of energies which bewilders us. One kind of energy is the material energy which bewilders us, the maha maya. And another kind of energy Krishna has got which is called yoga maya, the spiritual energy that is also bewildering for every every living being. Both the spiritual energy which is personal energy of Krishna and Krishna's material energy, both are bewildering for the living entities. Of course, those who are pure devotees, they are never bewildered by the material energy.

#### Yogamaya, Devotees vs. Non-devotees, Illusion, Actor Analogy

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "invisible to the foolish observer to those who are enlightened spiritually krishna is not invisible"
**Summary:** This segment discusses how Krishna is covered by Yogamaya, making Him invisible to foolish observers, and uses the analogy of an actor in a drama to illustrate how Krishna's true identity is concealed from those lacking spiritual knowledge.

And those who are non-devotees, they are subject to the bewilderment by even the material energy. Now, the bewilderment by the spiritual energy, Yogamaya, is meant for devotees to engage in pure devotional service of Krishna. And the bewilderment of non-devotees due to the material energy is facilitating the non-devotees to be able to think falsely that they are independent, they are the lord, or they are controllers, or to think that there is no God, or to be ignorant about Krishna. All this is the effect of the bewilderment due to the material energy only upon non-devotees. So, here Kunti Devi is telling Krishna is always covered by the curtain of Yogamaya. Now, how is it that Krishna is always covered by the curtain of Yogamaya? Invisible to the foolish observer. To those who are enlightened spiritually, Krishna is not invisible. They are able to see Krishna very clearly always because Krishna is always present, eternally present. But those who are foolish people who don't have spiritual knowledge, who don't have spiritual enlightenment, for them Krishna is always invisible. Now the example is given by Kunti Devi here, even when Krishna incarnates, foolish people cannot see him as the supreme lord. Now, why is it like that? Kunti Devi says, just like an actor who is dressed in a particular drama for playing a particular role in a drama, he is not recognized by the people who is the person who is playing this role. Of course, this is understandable if you go back in time

**Key Quote:** "people will who are watching that particular drama they will not be able to say who is this person who is dressed like a king even though that person may be known to the people who are watching"
**Summary:** The speaker continues the actor analogy, explaining how people may know the actor outside the play, but not recognize him in his role, similarly, people fail to recognize Krishna in His various incarnations.

that formerly when there used to be a drama performance on the stage, a dramatic artist, a dramatic actor, he will have a makeup and he will speak, move, etc., exactly as what the role demands. Supposing an actor has to play the role of a king, he will dress up like a king, he will talk like a king, he will walk like a king, his voice will be very deep like that of a king, even though in ordinary life he will be just another ordinary person. So, he is using his acting skill to play a role of a king. And when he actually appears on the stage, people who are watching that particular drama, they will not be able to say who is this person who is dressed like a king, even though that person may be known to the people who are watching the drama outside the stage. They may be known to him. Uh, the actor may be known to them. Okay, they may have actually seen a text, they may have recognized that somebody who's dressed like a king, but they cannot recognize who is this person who is dressed like us. Exactly like that, Krishna when he appears as the son of Vasudeva or his Rama, Narsimha, Varaha, people who are don't have spiritual enlightenment, foolish observers, they cannot recognize here is God, they cannot have greatest. So, in the purport, Sri Lakravapalyee explains

#### Krishna's Supremacy, Less Intelligent Persons, Putana Example

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So, the ordinary people, they think Krishna is another ordinary man. No, Krishna is not another ordinary person. He is the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** This segment quotes the Bhagavad Gita to emphasize that less intelligent people mistake Krishna for an ordinary man, and then uses the story of Putana to illustrate Krishna's extraordinary power even as an infant.

Somebody stated in the Bhagavad Gita that less intelligent persons mistake Krishna to be an ordinary man. He says, avajananti mamurha manushin tanum ashritam. Bhagavad Gita 9th chapter, 11th verse. Krishna says that. So, the ordinary people, they think Krishna is another ordinary man. No, Krishna is not another ordinary person. He is the Supreme Lord. He is never without his power. He is never without his opulences. He is never minus the opulences. No. Kunti is now confirming this point that is described in the Bhagavad Gita. Less intelligent persons, who are the less intelligent persons? Those who rebel against the authority of Krishna. They are the less intelligent persons. They are called asuras. Asuras generally want to go against the authority established by the Supreme Lord in this world, in the material world. When the Lord appears as Rama, Narasimha, Varaha, Vamana, any of the transcendental incarnations of the Lord, or even as Krishna, then he performs so many activities which are impossible to be performed by any person of this world, by any human being, or even any devata. They cannot perform. Now, in the tenth canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam, it is clearly explained that Krishna exhibited extraordinary power even when he was lying on the lap of his mother Yashoda as a small child, infant, not child, infant, just born. Say about ten days after Krishna took birth, he was attempted to be killed by one Putana. But when Putana came to breastfeed Krishna with her breast milk, she had severe deadly poison on her breast. And Krishna, he sucked out her life. When she tried to feed him poison through her breast milk, Krishna sucked out her life air. So, it is not possible for anybody of this world to suck out another person's adult's life air, prana, suck out the prana. And instantaneously, Putana died. Instantaneously.

#### Krishna's Superhuman Activities, Govardhan Hill Lifting, Bhagavad Gita Instructions, Authority of Great Personalities

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Exactly like that, Krishna picked up the huge Govardhan hill and held it up like an umbrella to protect the residents of Vrindavan."
**Summary:** This segment describes Krishna's superhuman activities, such as lifting Govardhan Hill, delivering the Bhagavad Gita, and being accepted as the Supreme Lord by various authorities, reinforcing Kunti's assertion of Krishna's supremacy.

Now, when he was a small boy, seven years old, playfully he lifted the Govardhan hill on his little left finger. Now, as easily as a child picks up a mushroom, small mushroom, a child, sometimes children when they play in rainy season, there are mushrooms growing. They pick up that mushroom and hold it like an umbrella. Krishna apparently was holding the Govardhan hill on his little left finger as an umbrella for protecting the residents of Vrindavan when there was a torrential rain sent by Indra. But he did it as effortlessly as a child picks up a small mushroom and can effortlessly hold it. Exactly like that, Krishna picked up the huge Govardhan hill and held it up like an umbrella to protect the residents of Vrindavan. So, these type of superhuman activities of Krishna are described in the tenth canto of the Bhagavatam. And even the activities of Lord Rama, Lord Varaha, Lord Narasimha, they are all described in the authentic scriptures. Now, Krishna has also delivered marvelous instructions. In the Bhagavad Gita, he spoke to Arjuna 45 minutes. When the battle was about to begin, Arjuna became bewildered. And Krishna removed his illusion by speaking Bhagavad Gita and enlightening Arjuna and through Arjuna all of us. So, that is only possible for Krishna. That cannot be done by anybody else. So, and Krishna is accepted as a very very great personality, the supreme personality by such authorities as Vyasa, Devala, Asita, Narada, Madhvacharya, Ramanujacharya, Shankaracharya, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Jeeva Goswami. All great personalities, they have accepted Krishna as the supreme lord. So, therefore, Kunti's asserting that Krishna is the supreme lord is perfectly accurate.

Tathā paramahamsānām munīnām amalātmanām bhakti-yoga-vidhānārthaṁ kathaṁ paśye mahi-striyahā The meaning of this verse is: You yourself descend to propagate the transcendental signs of devotional service unto the hearts of the advanced transcendentalists and mental speculators who are purified by being able to discriminate between matter and spirit.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna descends to propagate the transcendental signs of devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that even intelligent people who can discriminate between matter and spirit may not understand Krishna without devotional service, which is propagated by Krishna and his pure devotees.

So, Kunti Devi is actually a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, she is able to recognize Krishna as not just her relative, but as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In spite of Kunti Devi being able to recognize Krishna, she is helping us understand that those who are not devotees, they cannot recognize Krishna. They are not able to identify, here is the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So, therefore, in this particular verse, Kunti Devi is saying, Krishna descends to propagate the transcendental signs of devotional service. And such knowledge is even required to be given to the advanced transcendentalists, to very, very intelligent people who are purified by being able to discriminate between matter and spirit. See, there are two things in this world, matter and spirit. All living beings are spirit. So, they belong to the solar system, this category of spiritual energy, and everything else that we see around us, all material things, they are made of matter, material energy. So, there is a very, very big difference between matter and spirit, and it's not easy to discriminate like that. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita, the difficulty for an ordinary person to discriminate between matter and spirit. Only the very, very intelligent people who are able to analyze every single thing, what is its fundamental nature, whether it is matter or is it something different than matter, which is something which is not matter, spirit. So, if even the most intelligent people who can discriminate between matter and spirit, even they are unable to understand the personality of Godhead because they are not conversant with devotional service, the science of devotional service, so such science of devotional service is propagated by Krishna himself

**Key Quote:** "even for the greatest philosopher Krishna remains the supreme unknown"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how even great philosophical speculators cannot access the Lord and that Krishna is beyond the thinking power of even the greatest philosophers.

when he descends in this world or by Krishna's pure devotees who also descend for the same purpose, just like Prabhupada has come to teach us the actual science of devotional service. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu came for the same purpose. Chaitanya's pure devotees come for the same purpose. So now Kunti Devi is considering the position of ordinary people, how can they understand or know Krishna perfectly? So now, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains even the greatest philosophical speculators cannot have access to the region of the Lord. Lord here means the supreme Personality of Godhead. Why? Why is it so? Because it is said in the Upanishads that the supreme truth, the absolute personality of Godhead, is beyond the range of the thinking power of the greatest philosopher, avaam manasa kochara. Even if the Upanishads describe who or what is the absolute truth in so many words, still even for the greatest philosopher, Krishna remains the supreme unknown.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is knowable only by one who has got Krishna's mercy"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna is knowable only through his mercy and that women, in general, have an advantage because they readily believe in the Lord's superiority and offer obeisances without reservation.

Krishna remains like that. So therefore, Srila Prabhupada says Krishna is unknowable by great learning or by the greatest brain. Then Krishna is unknowable even by the greatest learned person. Then what is the way to know Krishna? That is explained by Srila Prabhupada as Krishna is knowable only by one who has got Krishna's mercy. That's the only way to know Krishna. Krishna has to reveal himself when he shows his mercy upon a particular person. Only then such person on whom Krishna's mercy is being showered, such a person can know Krishna by revelation. Others may go on thinking about him for years together, yet he is unknowable. This is a fact. So this fact is corroborated by the Queen, Queen Kunti, who is playing the part of an innocent woman. Kunti Devi as a pure devotee has nothing to do with this material world. All pure devotees belong to the spiritual world. Then why are pure devotees here in this world? They are here to actually show us the way of devotional pure devotion is served by their own actions, by their own words. Kunti Devi as a pure devotee is now describing Krishna, Krishna's position. So, Srila Prabhupada says there are some categories of people who in this material world are not able to speculate and think very deeply, analyze things in an intelligent way, they don't have that capability. So, it is mentioned by Srila Prabhupada in the purport here, women in general are unable to speculate like philosophers, but they are blessed by the Lord because they believe at once in the superiority and all mightiness of the Lord. See, this is one advantage women have over men in general. Of course, this is speaking women as a class. So, they are not as intelligent as great philosophers in order to speculate who or what is the absolute truth, but they have a special quality. What is that? They believe at once in the superiority and all mightiness of the Supreme Lord. And therefore, women in general, they offer obeisances to the Supreme Lord without any reservation.

**Key Quote:** "If somebody bows down to Krishna without reservation, yes, my dear Lord, you are the Almighty."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of bowing down to Krishna with sincerity and notes that women often participate more in religious functions, highlighting the effectiveness of simple acceptance over showy religious fervor.

Now, this is a very important qualification for somebody to actually know and understand Krishna's personality. If somebody bows down to Krishna without reservation, yes, my dear Lord, you are the Almighty. You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I bow down to you. So, Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, So, that fourth point, You bow down to me, offer your obeisances to me. That is being pointed out by Srila Prabhupada. Women very easily, they agree to bow down to the Supreme Lord Krishna because he is the Almighty Supreme Lord. And because of this reason, Srila Prabhupada says, The Supreme Lord is so kind that he does not show special favor only to a great philosopher. As is mentioned in the verse, he knows the sincerity of purpose. Therefore, it is observed generally that in any religious function, women assemble in great numbers as compared to men. And this is not true just in some particular place or some particular sect of some religion, no. In every country and in every sect of religion, it appears that the women are more interested than the men in such religious functions where there is an assembly of religious minded people. This simplicity of acceptance of the Lord's authority is more effective than showy insincere religious fervor. Men may try to show off. We are great religionists. Or they may try to speculate or try to analyze or try to reason out. But it's not easy for them to understand Krishna. Krishna is beyond the range of understanding of even the most learned or greatest philosophers. But when women bow down with sincerity to the Supreme Lord, then Krishna reveals himself to such sincere souls without any discrimination. Without any discrimination. For Krishna, every living being is important as a spirit soul, as his own part and parcel. Krishna does not see the external bodily features.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna reveals himself to such sincere souls without any discrimination."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna sees the soul within the body and that sincere souls, especially women who readily bow down, can easily receive Krishna's mercy and understand him.

Krishna does not see that. And why these different bodies? Only because the particular soul who is interested in enjoying this material world is given a particular body suitable for the enjoyment. So whether it is a body of a woman or a man or a devata or an animal or a bird or an insect or a reptile or whatever, 8,400,000 different varieties of bodies. But these are just meant for accommodating the desires to enjoy in this world. But as Krishna is concerned, he sees every living being within the body, whatever be the external form. He sees the living being who is actually a spirit soul, spiritual by nature, completely different from the body. Krishna sees the soul. And that is also the vision of pure devotees. They see living beings as spirit souls trapped in a body, trapped in a misconception that they are seeking some material enjoyment in different ways. So it is important that to understand Krishna is easily accessible for the sincere soul who follows Krishna's instructions, the instructions of the devotional literature in simply approaching the Deity form of the Lord and just bowing down, Krishna, you are the Supreme Lord and I offer my respectful, sincere obeisances to you just because you are the Supreme Lord and you deserve the greatest respect in this world. So just this alone is enough for Krishna to reveal himself as the Supreme Personality of Godhead to a sincere soul. And in this regard, women are fortunate because without wasting time in trying to speculate and differentiate between matter and spirit and trying to philosophize, they simply bow down and they are recipients very easily of Krishna's mercy by which they can understand Krishna. I will stop here.

**Key Quote:** "Now every name referred to by Queen Kunti is very meaningful."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam 1.8.21, focusing on Queen Kunti's prayers and the significance of the names used to address Krishna.

Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya, Narayanam Namaskritya, Naram Chai Vanarottamam, Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session we will be discussing from the 21st verse of the 8th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, continuing the prayers by Queen Kunti. Krishnaaya Vasudevaya Devaki Nandanayacha, Nanda Gopakumaraya Govindaya Namo Namaha. The meaning of this verse is, Let me therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto the Lord, who has become the son of Vasudhara, Vasudeva, the pleasure of Devaki, the boy of Nanda, and the other cowherd men of Vrindavan, and the enlivener of the cows and the senses.

#### Krishna's names, Vasudeva, Devaki Nandana, Nandagopakumaraya, Govinda, Cows and senses

**Key Quote:** "Govinda means one who is enlivener of the cows and the senses."
**Summary:** The lecture elaborates on the meanings of Krishna's names as used in the verse, including Vasudeva, Devaki Nandana, Nandagopakumaraya, and Govinda, emphasizing Krishna's role as the enlivener of cows and senses.

Now every name referred to by Queen Kunti is very meaningful. So, Krishnaaya, the Supreme Lord Krishna, who is Vasudevaya, he has appeared as the son of Vasudeva, therefore he is called Vasudeva. So, Kunti is identifying this personality who has appeared as the son of Vasudeva, and therefore called Vasudeva, he is actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna. Krishnaaya Vasudevaya Devaki Nandanayacha, he is also identified as the son of Devaki, Devaki. He appeared as the son of Devaki and Vasudeva, Devaki as his mother and Vasudeva as his father. So, therefore Devaki Nandana, another name for Krishna. He is the same Supreme Lord who has appeared as the son of Devaki and Vasudeva. He is not an ordinary person, his birth is not ordinary, it is transcendental. Then, Nandagopakumaraya, Nandagopakumaraya, Nandagopakumaraya, Nandamaharaj was the king of the cowherd men in Vrindavan. So, Krishna also appeared as the son of Nandamaharaj and Yashodhamayi, as the cowherd woman, wife of Nandamaharaj in Vrindavan. So, he is also identified as Nandagopakumaraya, Kumara means a small boy, five-year-old boy. So, Krishna appeared as a cowherd boy also, as the son of Nanda and Yashoda. And, he is Govindaya Namo Namaha, Govinda. Govinda means one who is enlivener of the cows and the senses. This Go, the word Go means the senses, Go also means the cows. So, the cows and senses are enlivened by Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "No material position is, or material assets are qualification for understanding Krishna."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how the senses are enlivened by contact with Krishna and emphasizes that material qualifications are insufficient for understanding Krishna.

Whenever the senses come in contact with Krishna or the cows, when they are in touch with Krishna, they become enlivened. That's why Krishna as the cowherd boy is always tending the cows. That's a very, very special thing. A very, very special relationship of love between Krishna and the cows. Or, between Krishna and the devotees whose senses are very nicely engaged in devotional service to Krishna because of which the senses become enlivened. So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport that the Supreme Lord, as has been explained in the previous verse by Kunti Devi, is unapproachable by any material assets. Whatever be the material qualification of any person in any position in this material world, those material assets are useless when it comes to understanding the personality of Krishna. I may be a very great philosopher, but that doesn't qualify me to know and understand the personality of Krishna. I may be the most charitable, beneficent person, that doesn't qualify me to understand Krishna. I may be a very powerful devata, that doesn't qualify me to understand Krishna. No material position is, or material assets are qualification for understanding Krishna.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "He comes in His original form just for the sake of showing special mercy upon His pure devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna appears out of unbounded mercy to devotees and to diminish the disturbances caused by demoniac persons, ultimately protecting the devotees.

Then how can Krishna be understood? He is understood when out of His unbounded and causeless mercy He comes down to this earth as He is. He comes in His original form. When we say Krishna, He appears in His original form. Not that He is assuming a human-like form. No. He is coming in His original form. His original form resembles a human-like form. But it is not a human form. It is not a material form. It is not a human form. And He does so just for the sake of showing special mercy upon His pure devotees. Pure devotees. Krishna wants to show His causeless mercy. Unbounded. That means there is no limit to how much mercy He showers on His pure devotees. Unlimited mercy. And also He appears to diminish the upsurges of the demoniac persons. These demons, they become too much troublesome. They want to create havoc in the life of religious people or saintly persons or law-abiding citizens. These demoniac persons, they are law-breakers. They are against God in general. They are sometimes too materialistic or they are atheistic or they are openly against God, like that. So all such demoniac persons when they become too much of a disturbance and they create too much trouble for the saintly persons, for the devotees, then Krishna appears and Vinashaya Chidushkrutam He destroys, He kills them and protects the devotees.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, Krishna is more merciful than Rama."
**Summary:** This section compares Krishna's incarnation to other incarnations, particularly Rama, highlighting Krishna's greater accessibility and mercy, especially in Vrindavan where everyone can approach and serve Him.

Now, Srila Prabhupada says, Queen Kunti specifically adores the incarnation or descent of Lord Krishna above all other incarnations. Krishna appears in many, many different incarnations: Rama, Varaha, Narsimha, Vamana, etc. But among all the incarnations of the Supreme Lord, the one and only Supreme Lord, the incarnation in His original form as He is, the incarnation of Krishna is the topmost. Why? Because in this particular incarnation, Krishna is very easily approachable by everyone. So Prabhupada compares in the incarnation of Rama, He remained a king's son and from His very childhood, He became a king's son. But in the incarnation of Krishna, although He appeared as the son of a king, son of King Vasudeva, He at once left the shelter of His real father and mother, Vasudeva and Devaki, and went to the lap of Yashoda Mai to play the part of an ordinary cowherd boy in the holy land of Vrindavan. And that Vrindavan has become sanctified because of Krishna performing His childhood pastimes there, which are very, very, very pleasing to all devotees. Therefore, Krishna is more merciful than Rama. The incarnation of Krishna is more merciful than the incarnation of Rama. Why? In Vrindavan, everyone is a devotee of Krishna. Everyone can approach Krishna. Not only the parents of Krishna, Yashoda Mai and Nanda Maharaj, but the cowherd boys, the cows, the peacocks, the birds, the bees, the river Yamuna, the trees, the plants, the insects, every creature in Vrindavan is able to directly approach Krishna and actually render service to Him. In whatever way they can, they render service in their own way. And Krishna accepts it very, very mercifully. That is Krishna's greatness. So therefore, the scriptures declare Krishna's incarnation is the topmost because He is easily approachable

**Summary:** The lecture discusses Kunti's affectionate relationship with Krishna and contrasts it with the greater fortune of Nanda and Yashoda, who experienced Krishna's childhood pastimes, further explaining the concept of Krishnaloka and Gokula Vrindavan.

by everyone. Now, Srila Prabhupada also points out Krishna was very kind to Kunti's brother Vasudeva because he appeared as the son of Vasudeva. Now, because he appeared as the son of Vasudeva, Kunti was able to have that affectionate relationship with Krishna as being Krishna's aunt, father's sister. So, Kunti is able to address Krishna in paternal affection. She has all different kinds of relationships between the Supreme Lord and the devotee. So here, Kunti is able to affectionately address Krishna as her relative. But, Nanda and Yashoda are more fortunate because they could relish the childhood pastimes of Krishna which Vasudeva, Devaki, Kunti, they could not relish. They could not relish the childhood pastimes of Krishna. And among the childhood pastimes of Krishna, of course, all the childhood pastimes of Krishna and Vrindavan are very special. They are described by Srila Prabhupada here as prototypes of his eternal pastimes in original Krishnaloka. Krishna has got his personal abode in the spiritual world. That's called Chintamani Dhamma, Vrindavan Dhamma, Goloka Dhamma, different names, same abode of Krishna, Krishnaloka. But that Krishnaloka, eternally Krishna's pastimes is covered by or going on. And Krishna sometimes comes to this world to display those pastimes, the replica of those pastimes he enacts in this earthly planet, in the tract of land called Rajabhoomi, Rajabhoomi, Gokula Vrindavan. So there are two Vrindavans, Goloka Vrindavan in the spiritual world and Gokula Vrindavan on this earth planet. But Gokula Vrindavan is not material. It is completely spiritual. Though ordinary eyes see it as a material, another material place, but actually it is not

a material place. Now Krishna comes to Gokula Vrindavana with all his spiritual entourage and paraphernalia. Now Krishna's mother, Yashoda Mai, she also belongs to Krishnaloka. But she also comes. Nanda Maharaji belongs to Krishnaloka but he also comes. The covered boys, Shridham and Madhumangala, all the covered boys, they belong to the spiritual world but they also come with Krishna. That is for Krishna to display his wonderful, loving pastimes with all his devotees. And Krishna is inviting us, come, join me, come with me to Krishnaloka and enjoy pastimes like these covered boys are enjoying with me, like the covered men and covered women, the eternal associates are enjoying. You also come. That is why Krishna comes to display and to attract us. And Krishna invites so many ways. So it is up to us to actually accept this invitation and actually prepare ourselves to just, what is the preparation? Become devotees. Manmana abhava madbhakto madhyaji ma namaskuru Chant Hare Krishna. Become devotee of Krishna and go to Krishnaloka. Never again to come to this world which is filled with miseries. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet In this session we will be discussing from the 22nd verse of the 8th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam.

**Key Quote:** "All such classes of people are unfit by intelligence to understand transcendental subject matter concerning the spiritual name, fame, attributes, forms, etc. of the supreme absolute truth."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's purport, explaining the specific marks on the Lord's transcendental body that distinguish Him from other spiritual beings, and discusses the limitations of certain classes of people (women, shudras, and dvijabandhus) in understanding transcendental knowledge.

In the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, Here are some of the specific symbolical marks on the spiritual body of the Personality of Godhead, which distinguishes his body from the bodies of all others. We often hear the Supreme Lord has got transcendental spiritual form, Satchidananda vigraha, but his spiritual form is distinctly different from the spiritual form of the other devotees in the spiritual world. All the inhabitants have spiritual form, all the devotees spiritual word, only the Supreme Lord and his devotees, nobody else is there, everyone is devotee, but specifically there are some marks on the transcendental form or body of the Lord which distinguish him from the spiritual bodies of all others. So what are those specific marks are being described, four of them are described in this words, these marks are all special features of the body of the Lord, even though there is similarity in the form of the Lord and the living beings, the spiritual form, you're talking with the spiritual form, not the material form, these spiritual forms are similar, but still there are differences. The Lord may appear as one of us, but he is always distinct by his specific bodily features. These features of the Supreme Lord distinguish him from the other living entities. Krishna's original form is a form which looks like a human form, but it is not a human form, it is completely transcendental original form of the Supreme Lord. Srimati Kunti claims herself unfit to see the Lord because of her being a woman, in a previous shloka she stated so Katham pasye mahi sriyeha this was the prayer by Queen Kunti in her previous verse this is claimed because women, superderas, that is thedes i worker-class people and the vizha Bandhu's, who are the vizha Bandhu's, the wretched descendants of the hierarchy classes, they don't come up to theまだ dika qualities or qualifications of the twice born, though they are taken birth in such a family. All such classes of people are unfit by intelligence to understand transcendental subject matter concerning the spiritual name, fame, attributes, forms, etc. of the supreme absolute truth.

**Key Quote:** "So, the archamurthi, the archavigraha, the transcendental form of the deity who descends on the material world just to distribute favors to the fallen souls."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami clarifies that the inability of certain groups to understand the Vedas refers to their limited intelligence in grasping transcendental subjects, and explains how the Lord descends as the archavigraha (deity form) to bestow mercy upon all fallen souls.

Now, this is a very, very specific description here. When it is said, sthreeshudra dvijabandhunam trai na sruthi gochara that sthreeshudra and dvijabandhu are unable to understand the sruthi, the Vedas. What does it mean? It means that they don't have sufficient intelligence to understand the transcendental subject matter concerning the spiritual name, spiritual form, spiritual attributes, qualities of the supreme absolute truth, Krishna. That is the sense in which it is said. That is a specific point that is made. Such persons, although they are unfit to enter into spiritual affairs of the Lord, can see him as the archavigraha. Archavigraha means the worshipable deity form, the archamurthi in the temples, especially in the temples. So, the archamurthi, the archavigraha, the transcendental form of the deity who descends on the material world just to distribute favors to the fallen souls. So, this archamurthi or archavigraha or the deity form is an incarnation of the supreme Lord in the material world who appears in a form which we can see with ordinary eyes, the deity form. So, the Lord descends or comes down to this material world to distribute favors to the fallen souls, including the above-mentioned women, shudras and vijabandhus. He comes specifically for favoring these people who are unfit, who don't have sufficient intelligence, who do not take interest in spiritual subject matter, who are in that sense unfortunate, but even they can become fortunate by simply visiting the temple and having darshan of the Lord. Because such fallen souls cannot see anything beyond matter, the Lord condescends to enter into each and every one of the innumerable universes as the garbhodaka shayi vishnu who grows a lotus stem from the lotus-like depression in the center of his transcendental abdomen. And thus Brahma, the first living being in the universe, is born. See, the Lord's mercy upon us is that he personally comes. Here condescends means he agrees

to come down to our level. We are in a lower level. We are in the material world. We are fallen souls. But he comes down. Though he has nothing to do with this material world, he doesn't belong to the material world. He belongs to the spiritual world. He is always in transcendence. But even when he comes down, he is unaffected by the material energy. He remains in transcendence. That is very, very important to understand, to note. So, he comes down personally. And he sends his pure devotees like Srila Prabhupada also, who also come down, who don't belong to this world. They belong to the spiritual world eternally. But they come down for the sake of delivering the fallen souls. The Lord also comes down for delivering the fallen souls. Therefore, the Lord is known as Pankajanabhi. The depression in the center of his transcendental abdomen, which is like a lotus. That is why he is called Pankajanabha. The Pankajanabhi Lord accepts the Archavigraha. His transcendental form in different elements, namely a form within a mind, a form made of wood, a form made of earth, a form made of metal, a form made of jewels, a form made of paint, a form drawn on sand. So, when he said form made of earth, it could be either clay form, or it could be a stone form. So, all these different elements, from these elements, a particular specific form is either carved out, or cast in the case of a metal, or chiseled from wood, a block of wood, just like Jagannath Baldev Subhadra. From neem wood, the forms are made, or the marble forms of Radha Vrindavan Chandra, or the metal form of Radha Krishna Chandra. These forms are specifically made according to Agama Shastra, according to the scriptures, which describe how to make the form of the Lord. All such forms of the Lord are always decorated with garlands of lotus flowers, especially lotus, because lotus is the most beautiful flower among all the flowers. And as soon as we see lotus, we should remember Krishna. We should remember Krishna. That's why he is always garlanded

with lotus flowers. He has got a depression, lotus-like flower depression in the center of his transcendental abdomen. And it is said here by Srila Prabhupada, there should be a soothing atmosphere in the temple of worship to attract the burning attention of the non-devotees who are always engaged in material wranglings. Material wrangling means that the mind is absorbed in material affairs. And they are completely, in that sense, materialistic. But even their attention can be attracted towards Krishna simply by the soothing atmosphere in the temple where the beautiful deity form of the Lord is always nicely decorated with beautiful flower garlands, especially lotus garlands. The meditators worship a form within the mind. Therefore the Lord is merciful even to the women, shudras and vijabandhus, provided they agree to visit the temple and worship the different forms made for them. Such temple visitors are not idolaters. Idolaters means those who worship idols. They are not supposed to worship idols. Idol means an imaginary form of the Lord. Whereas deity is the Lord himself incarnating in the form of the deity. That means the Lord is personally present. A deity is a Sakshat Bhagawan in his transcendental form. Whereas idol is an imaginary form. So there is a difference between idol and deity. All the great Acharyas establish such temples of worship in all places just to favor the less intelligent. And one should not pose himself as transcending the stage of temple worship while one is actually in the category of shudras and women or less. All people who are neophyte devotees are not conversant with the science of Krishna consciousness should visit temple and actually worship the Lord, bow down before him and actually have darshan of the Lord and that way become very easily Krishna conscious. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna could not be killed as soon as he was born by Kamsa."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the story of Devaki's imprisonment by Kamsa, the prophecy of Krishna's birth, and Vasudeva's efforts to protect Krishna.

Muhur Vipadganath So in the purport, Shri La Prabhu Par explains, Devaki the mother of Krishna and sister of King Kamsa was put into prison along with her husband Vasudeva because the envious king was afraid of being killed by Devaki's 8th son. Who is Devaki's 8th son? Krishna. So there was a prophecy at the time of Devaki's marriage that the 8th son of Devaki will be killing Krishna. So just because of this prophecy, immediately Kamsa wanted to kill Devaki immediately. And it is at the time of her marriage, his own sister, just because there was a prophecy, an unseen voice from the sky. This is the nature of the demoniac. Demoniac people are always envious. Kaleena Kamsena by this envious king Kamsa. This king Kamsa, he killed all the sons of Devaki who were born before Krishna. Six children. Six children who were born. But Krishna escaped the danger of child slaughter because he was transferred to the house of Nanda Maharaj, Lord Krishna's foster father. So Krishna could not be killed as soon as he was born by Kamsa, because Vasudeva was in anxiety about protecting Krishna. And Krishna instructed Vasudeva that, that you actually transfer me because you are always in anxiety about the protection of your children, which is natural for every parent.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna bestows more favor upon a devotee who is in greater dangers."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Kunti's situation as a widow with young children in Dhritarashtra's palace, the dangers faced by the Pandavas, and how Krishna's grace is especially potent for devotees in helpless situations.

Now as regards Kunti Devi, Shraddha Prabhupada says, Kunti Devi along with her children were also saved from a series of dangers. Kunti Devi, she was a widow when her children were very small. And so she was in the house of, in the palace of Dhritarashtra. But this Dhritarashtra who was very much desirous of enthroning his own sons, even though they did not have the right, the right to rule. Dhritarashtra did not have the right to rule. Neither his sons had the right to rule the kingdom of the whole world being ruled from Hastinapura. The seat of the King of Hastinapura was the seat of the Emperor of the entire world those days. So in spite of that, being very very greedy, greed for power, greed for the royal power, so they don't hesitate to do anything. So these Kauravas they always were attempting to kill the Pandavas but Krishna protected the Pandavas so that's what Kunti is telling that Kunti Devi along with her children were also saved from a series of dangers by Krishna. Srila Prabhupada says Kunti Devi was shown more favor because Lord Krishna did not save the other children of Devaki whereas he saved the children of Kunti Devi. Kunti had five sons and they were all saved. Kunti her five sons Draupadi all of them were saved by Krishna. Parikshit the grandson of Arjuna all of them were saved by Krishna. Why? This was done because Devaki's husband Vasudeva was living whereas Kunti Devi was a widow and there was none to help her except Krishna. So what is the meaning of this? Prabhupada says the conclusion is that Krishna bestows more favor upon a devotee who is in greater dangers.

#### Attachment to Krishna, Material existence, Krishna consciousness, Protection, Dependence on Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna is always there to protect us and Krishna wants us to depend on him for all protection so that we become attached to him."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that material existence causes us to forget Krishna and rely on our own arrangements, while true protection comes from developing attachment to Krishna.

Sometimes, Krishna puts his pure devotees in such dangers because in that condition of helplessness, the devotee becomes more attached to the Supreme Lord Krishna. Actually, material existence is such that we forget Krishna and we think that we have to personally make our own arrangements for our protection, because material world is full of dangers. But then the reality is Krishna is always there to protect us and Krishna wants us to depend on him for all protection so that we become attached to him. So that simply by developing our, reviving our memory of Krishna and developing our attachment, which is natural for us, because in our heart there is dormant Krishna consciousness, then we become eligible to transfer ourselves to the personal abode of Krishna where we actually belong. This is the whole description in the Bhagavad Gita. The more the attachment is there for the Lord, the more success is there for the devotee. See, due to material contact, we develop material attachments and that perpetuates our material existence.

#### Devaki, Krishna's mother, Advanced devotee, Krishna's greatness, Subordination to Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna agrees to become the son only of the most advanced devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Devaki was not an ordinary woman, as only an advanced devotee can become Krishna's mother, and reinforces Krishna's supreme position, stating that everyone is subordinate to Him.

But if we develop attachment for Krishna and if that attachment increases more and more, just like it happened for Kunti. So, Prabhupada is clarifying, Devaki is not an ordinary woman. Devaki, the devotee who became the mother of Krishna, was not an ordinary woman. After all, who can become the mother of the Supreme Personality of God? Krishna agrees to become the son only of the most advanced devotee. In their previous lives, Devaki and her husband Vasudeva underwent severe austerities and when Krishna therefore appeared before them wanting to give them a benediction, they told him they wanted a son. But where can there be a person like a god like Krishna? But where can there be another person like Krishna? That is not possible. Krishna or God is Asaamardhva. That is, no one is equal to him. No one is greater than him. everyone is God. No. One who says this, Prabhupada explains, he is actually totally ignorant about God. He is like an animal. He is like a dog. Prabhupada says, not God, but dog. Not G-O-D, but D-O-G, dog. For God is great and he is no competitor. No one is equal to him. Everyone is subordinate to him. Everyone is lower than him. And in the Chaitanya Charita Amritha, it is said, Ekale Ishwara Krishna Arsaba Bhrithya. Everyone is a servant. Only Krishna is the only master. Even the greatest of demigods like Brahma, Shiva and even Vishnu, of course Vishnu is not a demigod, but everyone is subordinate to him. Everyone else

**Summary:** The speaker describes the roles of demigods like Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu in managing the material world and the three gunas, while emphasizing that Krishna is the supreme controller above all.

else is a servant of Krishna. Shiva Virenchi Nutam, in the Shastra, the various scriptures, it is said, Lord Krishna is offered respect even by Lord Shiva and Lord Brahma, the topmost of demigods. Krishna is offered respect by everyone else. That's a fact. Now, above the beings, there are demigods. Demigods are empowered personalities in this world, material world, who are many, many, many millions of times more powerful than human beings. That's a fact. They control the wind. All over the universe, the wind is blowing. One of the devatas controls the sun planet, which is supplying heat and light to all the millions of other planets in this universe. So, they are universal level controllers. But even they are subordinate to Krishna. They are empowered by Krishna. The power is given to them by Krishna. Krishna is only all powerful. Everyone else is dependent on Krishna for their power. As we human beings are above the lower animals, above us, there are demigods, devatas. The most important of demigods are Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva. Lord Brahma is the creator of this universe. That is the power of Brahma. And Lord Shiva is the destroyer of this whole universe. As Lord Vishnu, who is Krishna himself in another form, for the sake of certain functions, Krishna appears in the form of Vishnu. So, Vishnu is the maintainer of the entire universe. So for the sake of this material world, there are three guna's: Satwa Guna, Raja Guna, and Tama Guna. Lord Vishnu takes charge of sattva guna, Brahma takes charge of rajoguna, and Shiva takes charge of tamo guna. Now these three controllers of these three gunas, they are not under the influence of the gunas. Prabhupada gives the example just like a superintendent of a jail is himself not a prisoner even though he may be in the prison, but he is there as the controller of the prison not as a prisoner. Similarly these three personalities Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are transcendental to the mouths

**Key Quote:** "I must utilize my senses for Krishna's service."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of 'Hrishikesha' as the master of the senses and emphasizes the importance of using our senses in Krishna's service to achieve liberation and return to Godhead.

but Krishna is a supreme controller above everyone else and therefore he is known as Hrishikesha. Hrishika means senses and Isha means the master. Actually Krishna is the master of everyone's senses, of all the senses. So we have got senses and we think we control our senses, actually we don't control. The example is given, I've got this hand, I think I can lift my hand whenever I want, but if there is the control of Krishna is there that he withdraws to move my hand, that happens when I may get a paralytic stroke, then I cannot move my hand independently. So therefore Krishna is the controller of everyone's senses and therefore it is called Vishikesha. What does it mean? It means that I must utilize my senses for Krishna's service. My senses are not meant for my enjoyment or my utilization, no, they are meant for serving Krishna and that is the perfect situation, proper situation. As soon as we recognize Krishna is the controller of my senses, I use it for Krishna's service, I become completely free from material bondage, I reinstate myself in the position of Krishna's devotee and I am eligible to go back to God. I'll stop.

**Key Quote:** "This is the reciprocation of the Lord with his devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker compares Devaki's and Kunti's situations, highlighting the constant dangers Kunti faced and Krishna's protection, emphasizing the Lord's reciprocation with devotees.

So, here is a list of different dangerous encounters that Kunti Devi, along with her sons, had to face. Srila Prabhupada explains this very nicely in the purport. The list of dangerous encounters is submitted here in Devaki, because in the previous verse there is a reference to Devaki, who was protected as much as Kunti was also protected. But Prabhupada is comparing Devaki's situation with Kunti's situation. Devaki was once put into difficulty by her envious brother. Otherwise, she was well. So, Kunti and her sons were put into one difficulty after another for years and years together. See the difference? Devaki, after she was imprisoned and you see Krishna was born and Krishna was transferred to Vrindavan. And then, Devaki's problems were over. But Kunti Devi and her sons were put into so many different dangerous situations, so many difficulties. They were put into trouble by Duryodhana and his party due to the kingdom. And each and every time, the sons of Kunti were saved by Lord Krishna.

This is the reciprocation of the Lord with his devotees. Therefore, Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, Name Bhakta Pranasyati Kaunteya Pratijaanihi Name Bhakta Pranasyati: "My devotee will never be vanquished." And that's a fact. Though they tried to kill the Pandavas, the Kauravas could never succeed in doing so.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Duryodhana's attempt to poison Bhima and throw him into the river, highlighting Duryodhana's envy and Bhima's vulnerability.

Because the Pandavas were always protected by Krishna, without any doubt. So, it begins with Vishan. Vishan means, once Bhima was administered poison in a case. Bhima was administered poison in a case. The Pandavas and Kauravas, they grew up in the same palace in Hastinapura. And Dhritarashtra was the caretaker king. And the grandfather of the Pandavas and Kauravas, Bhishma, he appointed Dronacharya to teach and coach the princes. Both the Kauravas, the hundred sons of Dhritarashtra and the five sons of Pandu, the Pandavas, 105 students Dronacharya had. And he coached them very nicely in military science because they were Kshatriyas. Now, in such training time, it was very clearly evident that Bhima was the strongest among all the 105 students. They became Dancing Kings because of His power and Kṛṣṇa's assistance. Now, it is said that Bhima was very successful in ложdayevar, playful and British. You might watch this armas with me... They are this many great Kauravas. The זonöledzksy and Brigareta of Dronacharya have exactly the same power and compassion that flashinkeya has. The beautiful women, the don'ts and the ladies' Dojo, for me to actually face him in combat one-on-one so Duryodhana with a evil mind asuric mentality he decided let me kill this Bhima and he administered a trick one once he organized a kind of a picnic for all the princess and they all went and they were playing and then he arranged that food be served in the picnic spot and he had made sure secretly that one of the items the cake which was to be served to all the princess Bhima's cake was poisoned so Bhima Bhima was given that cake and he didn't suspect anything he just ate it and after eating a little while he started feeling very very drowsy and Bhima tried to remain awake and somehow he was feeling extremely sleepy so he went off somewhere and just completely slept off. All the princes then were going back and suddenly the Pandavas the five of them or four of them other than Bhima they noticed Bhima is missing so they are searching and searching and searching and searching where is Bhima. What has Duryodhana done? He has arranged that secretly Bhima be thrown into a river. And because he was completely asleep effect of the pandemic was that Bhima was thrown into a river.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of the house of shellac, Vidura's warning, and the Pandavas' escape through a tunnel, highlighting their intelligence and Krishna's protection.

And Bhima in this way was actually saved from being killed by Krishna's arrangement. It was Krishna's arrangement. Then once they were put into a house made of shellac. Now each of these dangers that are mentioned, it is elaborately explained in the Mahabharata. So I will not be able to explain each and every particular danger like that. But in brief I may state that another attempt was made to burn the Pandavas alive by sending them to a new palace that was called Kunti. It was constructed but it was made of combustible material, shellac. And Duryodhana's plan was to set fire when they were all settled inside nicely one particular night. So Vidura came to know about it and Vidura informed Yudhishthira that you are being sent to a palace which is going to set fire. Be careful. So Yudhishthira through Vidura's help, he dug a tunnel as soon as they went into the palace. He dug a tunnel. And before escaping through the tunnel, underground tunnel, Yudhishthira himself set fire to that palace. And then after that the Pandavas with Kunti escaped.

**Summary:** The speaker recounts the attempted disrobing of Draupadi and Krishna's miraculous intervention, as well as Bhima's fight with the demon Hidimba.

And then that's the way they were saved from that fire. So then Draupadi was dragged out and attempted to be stripped naked once in a gambling match. Somehow that gambling match that happened. And Draupadi was saved by Krishna who supplied her unlimited length of sari. They tried to disrobe her by pulling her sari. But Draupadi was supplied with unlimited length of sari. So they could not strip her naked at all. Krishna saved her. She cried out Krishna. Because the Pandavas were unable to intervene because they had lost themselves in the gambling match. So they were unable to save her. And the other elders in the assembly did not interfere with this Duryodhana and Dushasana's misdeed, because Draupadi also was kind of lost in the gambling match and she would become a kind of a servant to the Kauravas. Something like that. Then when they were exiled in the forest, Bhima had to fight with the man-eater demon Hidimba, Rakshasa. So one Rakshasa, man-eater. But Bhima killed this Rakshasa. Again, Krishna's mercy that Bhima was empowered to kill this man-eater who was a very dangerous Rakshasa, who had killed many humans and devoured them and eaten their flesh.

Such a dangerous man-eater was killed by Bhima because he was empowered by the Lord. Then after all this tribulation there was a great battle of Kurukshetra. Arjuna had to meet such great generals as Drona, Bhishma, Karna. All very very powerful fighters. But Krishna, he protected Arjuna and the Pandavas. And no harm was done by the Kauravas. Even though the Kauravas were very powerful, they could not do any harm to the Pandavas. And at the end when Parikshit was in the womb of Uttara, then Ashwathama released the Brahmastra to kill the child. But Krishna saved. Krishna personally entered the womb of Uttara and saved the child. So in this way the Pandavas were protected by Krishna at all times, whenever there was danger to their life, whenever there was any difficulty.

**Key Quote:** "One who is on the path of material progress, trying to improve himself with respectable parentage, great opulence, high education, and bodily beauty, cannot approach you with sincere feeling."
**Summary:** Queen Kunti reveals that material opulence can hinder sincere devotion to Krishna, emphasizing the importance of humility in approaching the Lord.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 26th verse of the 8th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, continuing the prayers by Queen Kunti. The meaning of this verse is: One who is on the path of material progress, trying to improve himself with respectable parentage, great opulence, high education, and bodily beauty, cannot approach you with sincere feeling. So Kunti Devi is revealing a secret about the way to approach Krishna—the simple ways to call out Krishna's name and in this way directly come in contact with Krishna, approach Krishna. But there is a quality to such utterance of the name or calling out the name. So she is telling here, one can approach with sincere feeling if they are materially exhausted. If they are puffed up with material opulence, then they cannot sincerely call out the Lord's name.

**Key Quote:** "These material assets makes one materially opulent means artificially puffed up artificially proud and it's also intoxicating."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that material advancements like wealth, education, and beauty are temporary and create artificial pride, hindering spiritual progress.

So Srila Prabhupada says, "Being materially advanced means taking birth in an aristocratic family and possessing great wealth, Janma, Aishwarya, and education, Shruta, and attractive personal beauty, Shri, Janma, Aishwarya, Shruta, Shri." These four are described here. All materialistic men are mad after possessing all these material opulences, and this is known as the advancement of material civilization. The whole world practically is in ignorance about the spiritual truths, spiritual reality, and therefore, people are mad after material opulence. But the result is that by possessing all these material assets, one becomes artificially puffed up. We are being intoxicated by such temporary possessions. Why is it said artificially puffed up? Because there is no real asset to be proud of. It is simply some illusory possession that people become proud of. How long can you have your wealth? How long can you have bodily beauty? How long can you have material uprightness, education? Only as long as the body lasts. At the most, after that, everything is separated. Everything is separated from you. Can you take your wealth with you when you put the body to your next life? Can you take your material education? Can you take any material possessions? No, you cannot. So therefore, it is described here, these material assets make one materially opulent, meaning artificially.

**Key Quote:** "By once uttering the holy name of the Lord the sinner gets rid of a quantity of sins that is unable to commit."
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the power of chanting the Lord's name, highlighting the difference between sincere devotion and external displays, and the importance of feeling in the utterance.

The buddha shloka and other buddhas are incapable of uttering the holy name of the Lord by addressing him feelingly, "Oh Govinda, Oh Krishna." You see, the quality of uttering the name, that is important also. It's not just that somebody is able to say the name. Now, Shilpa Prabhupada explains a very important point here. He says, "It is said in the shastras," is quoting from the scriptures, "that by once uttering the holy name of the Lord, the sinner gets rid of a quantity of sins that is unable to commit." That means even once uttering the name of the Lord is so powerful, so effective, it can destroy any quantity of sin. It doesn't matter what the quantity of sin is. So such is the power of uttering the holy name of the Lord, chanting Hare Krishna, simply vibrating the tongue and producing the sound Hare Krishna. He's very, very, very powerful. So such is the power of uttering the holy name of the Lord. There is not the least exaggeration in this statement. What the shastras are telling, that any quantity of sin can be destroyed completely by just one utterance of the holy name, is not an exaggeration. It's a fact. It's a 100% fact actually. The Lord's holy name has such powerful potency. There's a secret that is known to the pure devotees and to those who are associated with the pure devotes. But there is a quality of such utterances also. It depends on the quality of feeling. So there is difference between a sincere devotee calling out for Krishna by chanting his name, by uttering his name, Krishna, and there is a difference between a sincere devotee and a person who is not so sincere but simply makes an external show that I can also chant. No, it's not going to be effective if one is not a sincere devotee, if one doesn't utter with feeling.

**Key Quote:** "A helpless man can feelingly utter the holy name of the Lord whereas a man what does the same Holy Name in great material satisfaction cannot be so sincere."
**Summary:** Sincerity in chanting comes from a feeling of helplessness and dependence on the Lord, contrasting with the insincerity of those materially satisfied, suggesting material advancements can be disqualifications for spiritual progress.

So that is explained by Prabhupada: a helpless man can feelingly utter the holy name of the Lord, whereas a man who utters the same Holy Name in great material satisfaction cannot be so sincere. So sincerity is being explained specifically. He, what does it mean to be sincere enchanting Hare Krishna? It means that have within the heart the feeling of utter helplessness, utter helplessness. Sheila proper says in another place that just like a very, very small child cries for the mother, the child cries helplessly, helplessly, so the mother is particularly attentive to the child who cries helplessly. Immediately she attends to the child. Similarly, when man utters the Lord's Holy Name in helpless state of feeling, then the Lord immediately appears and actually takes care of the devotee. A materially puffed up person may utter the Holy Name of the Lord occasionally, but he is incapable of uttering the name in quality. So quality of the Lord is the state of feeling. That is not the state of reality is not there in the utterance by materially satisfied people. Therefore, the four principles of material advancement which are mentioned by Kunti Devi in this prayer, which are the four principles—high parentage, good wealth, high education, attractive beauty—are so to speak disqualifications for

**Key Quote:** "The principle of life should always be to decrease the degree of material intoxication which leads one to be more and more illusioned about the aim of life."
**Summary:** Material opulences are like a fever, an external symptom of an unhealthy condition, and spiritual advancement involves decreasing material attachment, not increasing it.

There is something mental, how to warfare between good and bad, of another political understanding that all these material opulences are useless for spiritual practice. The material covering of the pure spirit soul is an external feature. All the material opulences are like an external covering, as much as the body, our mind, material mind, material intelligence, all these are external coverings of the spirit soul. As much as here is an example, Prabhupada gives an example, as much as fever is an external feature of the unhealthy body, very good example. The general process is to decrease the degree of the fever and not to aggravate it by maltreatment. And somebody gets fever, it is an indication of unhealthy body. So what should one do? One should try to decrease the fever, not increase it. Similarly, it is sometimes seen that spiritually advanced persons become materially impoverished, and this is no discouragement. This is not discouraging if they become materially very poor after making spiritual advancement. On the other hand, such impoverishment is a good sign, as much as the falling of temperature is a good sign. Nobody wants to increase the fever. When somebody gets fever, they want to reduce it. Similarly, material wealth, there is no need of increasing material wealth when one spiritually advances. There's no need. If one's material wealth reduces, that's a good sign. It is not a sign of misfortune. No, the principle of life should always be to decrease the degree of material intoxication, which leads one to be more and more illusioned about the aim of life. All these

**Key Quote:** "All these material assets a high parentage and high education material beauty material wealth all these are intoxicating so that intoxication results in one becoming illusioned about the aim of life."
**Summary:** Material assets intoxicate and create illusion, hindering one's ability to enter the kingdom of God, emphasizing the need to become sober and detached from material opulence.

intoxicating, so that intoxication results in one becoming illusioned about the aim of life. So if somebody is really illusioned, then they are not fit for entrance into the kingdom of God. So we have to reduce this intoxication and become sober. Dheera, the Sanskrit word is Dheera. Krishna says, Dheera Stratra Namukhyati, one who is sober, he's not, he or she is not bewildered by this material opulence or material wealth.

**Key Quote:** "My obeisances are unto you who are the property of the materially impoverished."
**Summary:** The lecture begins with prayers and then introduces Queen Kunti's prayer focusing on the Lord being the property of the materially impoverished.

Om Agyana Timiran Dhasya Gyananjan Shalakaya Chakshurun Militam Yena Tasmai Shri Gurave Namaha Nama Om Vishnu Padaya Krishna Preshtaya Bhutale Shri Mate Bhakti Vedanta Swamin Nithinamine Namaste Saraswate Deve Gauravani Pracharine Nirvishesha Shunyavadi Pashchatyade Shatarine Jaya Shri Krishna Chaitanya Prabhu Nithyananda Shri Advaita Gadadhara Shri Vasadi Gauravakta Vrinda Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudhirayet. In this session we will be discussing from the 27th verse of the 8th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. This is the 8th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam, continuing the prayers by Queen Kunti. Namo Akinchanavittaya Nivritta Gunavrittaya Atma Ramaya Shantaya Kaivalya Pataye Namaha. The meaning of this verse is: My obeisances are unto you who are the property of the materially impoverished. You have nothing to do with the actions and reactions to the material modes of nature. You are self-satisfied and therefore you are the most gentle and you are the master of the monads.

**Key Quote:** "The Supreme Lord is the property of the materially impoverished."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the concept of the Lord belonging to the materially impoverished and clarifies that it doesn't mean a living being can be a complete renouncer in the absolute sense.

So this is yet another prayer by Queen Kunti. It is a sequel to the previous two prayers. In the previous prayer Kunti Devi had explained that people who are materially opulent are perfect, and they cannot feelingly utter the holy name of the Supreme Lord. But here Kunti Devi is telling the Supreme Lord is the property of the materially impoverished, Akinchanavittaya. So Shri La Prabhupada explains in the purport that a living being is finished as soon as there is nothing to possess. What does it mean? One is akinchanavitha without any material possessions. So it is not to be misunderstood. So Prabhupada is clarifying the sense in which this is used by Kunti Devi, akinchanavitha. The Supreme Lord is the property of the materially impoverished. What is the meaning of that? How do we understand it? So a living being is finished as soon as there is nothing to possess. So a living being is finished as soon as there is nothing to possess.

**Key Quote:** "A living being renounces something for gaining something more valuable."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that renunciation involves giving up something for a greater spiritual gain, not simply becoming empty-handed.

So a living being is finished as soon as there is nothing to possess. Therefore, a living being cannot be in the real sense of the term a renouncer. Sometimes people think I have to renounce. I have to give up. I have to give up my wealth. I have to give up my house. I have to give up my family. I have to give up my possessions. I had to give up my everything. But we should also understand that we cannot really be a renouncer in that way. Why? Because the principle of renunciation is explained by Prabhupada as a living being renounces something for gaining something more valuable. For example, a student sacrifices his childish proclivities to gain better education. As children are sent to school, initially, they may be very, very playful. But as they become mature and serious, then they actually try to gain better knowledge. So, they are given up their playful tendency. Similarly, a servant gives up his job for a better job. So, in the same way, a devotee renounces the material world, not for nothing, not to become empty handed, without any possessions,

**Key Quote:** "They give up material wealth to gain some spiritual wealth."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of the Goswamis of Vrindavan to illustrate how devotees renounce material possessions to gain spiritual wealth and devotion to Krishna.

you know, but for something tangible in spiritual value. So, devotee gives up material possessions to gain some spiritual, spiritually tangible value, something of spiritual value and it is quite tangible, it is not intangible. So, the example is given of the Goswamis of Vrindavan who were disciples of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. It is said here, Srila Rupa Goswami, Srila Sanatana Goswami and Srila Raghunath Das Goswami and others gave up their worldly pomp and prosperity for the sake of service of the Lord. Devotion is service, for Krishna Bhakti, for Krishna Seva for that reason. They were big men in the worldly sense. The Goswamis were ministers in the government service of Bengal. Rupa Goswami and Sanatana Goswami are ministers of Nawab Hussain Shah in the then government of Bengal during that time. And Srila Raghunath Das Goswami, who was the son of a big zamindar of his time, very, very rich. His father was very rich. But they left everything to gain something superior to what they previously possessed. So, don't think that devotees are renouncing and giving up and becoming totally impoverished. No, they give up material wealth to gain some spiritual wealth.

**Key Quote:** "The devotees are generally without material prosperity, but they have a very secret treasure house in the lotus feet of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates a story about Sanatana Goswami and a touchstone to illustrate that devotees possess a secret treasure in their devotion to the Lord, which is more valuable than material wealth.

The devotees are generally without material prosperity, but they have a very secret treasure house in the lotus feet of the Lord. So, this treasure possessed by the devotees is unknown to materialistic persons. They can't evaluate. There is a nice story about Srila Sanatana Goswami. Prashupa tells a story. Now, Sanatana Goswami had a touchstone with him. A touchstone can convert any base metal to gold simply by touching. In Hindi they say paraspathar. In Sanskrit, they say chintamani. So, it is such a touchstone. If you touch iron with a touchstone, it become gold. So, Sanatana Goswami, he had a touchstone with him and he had left this stone, touchstone in a pile of refuse, in some garbage. He had thrown it in the garbage. A needy man took it. So, somebody approached Sanatana Goswami, I am a very poor man. So, can you give me something so that I can get rid of my poverty? So, Sanatana Goswami said, you want some touchstone? It is there. You can take it. Where is it? Oh, it is in the garbage heap. So, this poor man, he took it and he thought, oh, now my poverty problem is solved completely. But later on, he wondered, why was this valuable stone, this touchstone kept in such a neglected place? Why was it kept there? He was an intelligent person also. He was considering that what kind of thing I have taken from the Goswami, from Sanatana. He therefore asked Sanatana Goswami for the most valuable thing. He was intelligent enough to understand, if touchstone is the most valuable thing Sanatana Goswami has in his possession, then he would not have left it in the garbage. Nobody leaves in the garbage something very, very valuable that they possess. So, why had he kept it in the garbage? So, therefore, he went and asked Sanatana Goswami that can you give me the most valuable thing in your possession?

**Key Quote:** "Krishna Nama is the spiritual touchstone. It is not a material touchstone. It is a spiritual touchstone."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the holy name of the Lord is the true spiritual touchstone and that a factual devotee doesn't give material things but the supreme asset, Krishna.

Sanatana Goswami said, yes, I can give you. And what did he give? Sanatana Goswami gave him the holy name of the Lord. That is why in one of the scriptures, it is said, Nama Chintamani Krishna. Krishna Nama is the spiritual touchstone. It is not a material touchstone. It is a spiritual touchstone. Akeenchana means one who has nothing to give materially. This is the meaning of the word Akeenchana. It should not be misunderstood. A factual devotee or Mahatma does not give anything material to anyone. Just like Sanatana Goswami, he gave the holy name. That is not a material commodity. It is 100% spiritual. Now, Sanatana Goswami or any Mahatma, any factual devotee does not give material, anything material to anyone, because the Mahatma himself or the pure devotee himself, he has already left all material assets. He has given up himself. So, he does not have material assets to give you. He has given them up.

**Key Quote:** "Material hankerings and spiritual advancement go ill together."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that material desires and spiritual progress are incompatible, and neophyte devotees should distinguish between spirit and matter, lacking the spiritual vision to see them as one.

He can, however, deliver the supreme asset. What is supreme asset with a pure devotee? It is the personal of Godhead, Krishna. Krishna is the property of the pure devotees. Krishna can be delivered by a pure devotee. Krishna can be delivered, therefore it is said here by Srila Prabhupada, because Krishna is the only property of a factual devotee, Krishna can deliver, sorry, because Krishna is the only factual property of the real devotee, so Krishna can be delivered by a devotee to anybody who desires to have Krishna. The touchstone of Sanatana Goswami which is thrown in the rubbish was not the property of the Goswami, otherwise it would not have been kept in such a place. So this specific example is given to neophyte devotees just to convince them that material hankerings and spiritual advancement go ill together. They don't go together. Material opulence and spiritual advancement don't go together unless one is able to see everything as spiritual in relation with the Supreme Lord. One must always distinguish between spirit and matter. A neophyte devotee should not artificially try to see the spirit and matter as one and the same. A neophyte devotee should make distinction between what is spirit and what is matter, should make a distinction. A spiritual master like Sanatana Goswami, although personally able to see everything as spiritual, set this example for us only because we have no such spiritual vision. We don't have spiritual vision at the present moment to understand that even matter being emanation from Krishna is also ultimately spiritual only, but then such a vision is not possible for a neophyte devotee in the beginning of Devotional Service. So what happens is, what happens.

**Key Quote:** "Material advancement is Anartha. It is not required."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that material advancement is an unwanted thing (Anartha) that leads to entanglement and misery, and encourages listeners to give it up and embrace Krishna consciousness under the guidance of pure devotees.

When somebody advances materially, material advancement is civilization. Such material advancement is a great stumbling block for spiritual advancement. The more one becomes materially advanced, the more one becomes puffed up, and consequently, such a puffed up person cannot make spiritual advancement even if such a person takes to chanting Hare Krishna, because the chanting will be done without the sincere feeling. That is not possible for a materially intoxicated person. Such material advancement entangles the living being in the bondage of material body followed by all sorts of material miseries. See, material advancement comes with a price. What is that? With material advancement, there is entanglement and entanglement means material miseries. So, this has to be carefully understood. So, therefore, in Sanskrit, material advancement is called Anartha, unwanted things, unwanted. Actually, this is so. This is a fact. Material advancement is Anartha. It is not required. So, Prabhupada gives an example that in the present context of material advancement, one uses lipstick at a cost of 50 cents and there are so many unwanted things which are all products of material conception of life. So many material possessions people have, but that makes them only entangled, and subsequently, they have to face so many unwanted miseries. Everybody understands miseries are unwanted, but that's a result of possessing so many material things which are actually Anartha. So, Prabhupada's instruction is give up this business of material advancement and take to Krishna consciousness under the guidance of pure devotees.
