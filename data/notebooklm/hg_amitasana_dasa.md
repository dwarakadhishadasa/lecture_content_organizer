**Key Quote:** "A demon may be a great soldier and a commander of a large number of infantry, but in presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is powerless and is destined to die."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of the lecture, focusing on Lord's challenge to Hiranyaksha and the powerlessness of demons before the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Om Namo Bhagwate Vasudevaya. Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto No. 3, Chapter No. 18, Text No. 12. You are supposed to be the commander of many foot soldiers and now you may take prompt steps to overthrow us. Give up all your foolish talk and wipe out the cares of your kith and kin by slaying us. One may be proud, yet he does not deserve a seat in an assembly if he fails to fulfill his promised word. A demon may be a great soldier and a commander of a large number of infantry, but in presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is powerless and is destined to die. The Lord therefore challenged the demon not to go away, but to fulfill his promised word to kill him.

**Key Quote:** "Give up all your foolish talk and wipe out the cares of your kith and kin by slaying us."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of the verse, emphasizing the futility of Hiranyaksha's words and the Lord's challenge, drawing a parallel to Dhritarashtra's anxiety.

Thus ends the Bhagavad Gita. So this chapter, the title is The Battle between Lord Bohr and Hiranyaksha. So in this particular verse, Lord is speaking to Hiranyaksha and saying that you are supposed to be commander of many foot soldiers and you may now take prompt steps to overthrow us. And in the previous verses we know that how Hiranyaksha challenges the Lord and blasphemes him. The Lord tolerated his piercing ill words, but in order to reply him, he expressed his terrible anger. So he used many ill words against the Lord, he challenged the supremacy of the Lord. And now the Lord is mentioning, give up all your foolish talk – there's no point in just talking, big, big talks – and wipe out the cares of your kith and kin. Cares of kith and kin, near and dear ones, the relatives, because the battle is about to ensue. So they are concerned what's going to happen, just like Dhritarashtra was concerned what will happen to his kith and kin. Wipe out the cares of your kith and kin by slaying us. How will the cares get wiped out? By slaying us. How Dhritarashtra also when he was anxious, he was anxious what will happen to his sons. And his anxiety will get allayed or rather removed if his sons win the battle. So likewise your kith and kin, the cares can be wiped out if you slay us. One may be proud yet he does not deserve. He does not deserve a seat in an assembly if he fails to fulfill his promised words.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Our constitutional position is that we are amsa of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the constitutional position of living entities as parts of the Lord, emphasizing that everything belongs to Krishna and should be used in His service.

Our constitutional position is that we are amsa of the Lord. Being an amsa of the Lord, whatever we have in our possession, our gross body, subtle body, including the atma, we, belongs to the Lord. The gross body is made of panchabhuta, which is again energy of the Lord, the subtle body, and even the atma, mamaivamso, Krishna says. So in that sense when we become Krishna conscious or come to our constitutional position, there is no question of being proud. When we have a notion of a God who is casting within our consciousness, God is a pursuit of knowledge and knowledge. And on the other hand one will recognize or realize that everything including him belongs to the Lord. And a natural outcome of that understanding would be since the Lord is the proprietor of my body, my abilities, my skills, whatever I have belongs to the Lord, hence it has to be used in the service of the Lord.

### Maya, false ego, ahamkara, spiritual life, servant of Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The whole spiritual life, all spiritual processes are how to annihilate, wipe out that ahamkara, purify that ahamkara and revive our real ahamkara, real ego."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Maya covers the understanding of belonging to the Lord, leading to false ego and challenging the Lord, and how spiritual life aims to purify and revive the real ego as a servant of Krishna.

Now, this understanding gets covered by Maya, the illusory energy of the Lord. When the living entity desires to be the Lord, to challenge the Lord, to rebel against the Lord, this understanding what we have that I belong to the Lord, all my abilities are coming from the Lord, gets covered, and to the extent that we even challenge the Lord, that's what is happening in the case of Renaksha, he is challenging the Lord, forgotten that whatever he has, so the Lord is saying, don't talk unnecessarily, give up your foolish talk. Now the Lord is completely aware of the actual situation, he knows out of false ego he is puffed up. The Lord is all-knowing. So he is saying, give up your foolish talk and wipe out cares of this thing, you want to fight, you think that you are powerful, you can kill me, go ahead, do it. And he says, one may be proud, because of this ahamkara. I heard in one place, there was a man, he was born in our place, but he has everything in life, he belongs to His head. He doesn't have anything left in this life that, what has become eternal now, he is full of past. You can name here 준비, panchabhuta is a secret. अःकारक् everybody is so complex, thirteen percent of that is a secret. Things that are protect. अःकारक् It's like tube-desection for meat, that this is mine. Ahamkara does not come from the Lord. Manas buddhi ahamkara. That false ego does not come from the Lord. Manas buddhi also is coming from the Lord. So that's why we are here in this material world because we have that ahamkara, aham ameti. And the whole spiritual life, all spiritual processes are how to annihilate, wipe out that ahamkara, purify that ahamkara and revive our real ahamkara, real ego. That is I am servant of Krishna, I am amsa of Krishna and I should serve Krishna. And when that real ego gets awakened then we are qualified, we are eligible to go back to the spiritual world and blissfully engage

**Summary:** The speaker recounts Arjuna's victory in the battle of Kurukshetra, highlighting his capabilities and the eventual reinstatement of the Pandavas.

in the service of the Lord. This is the sum total of this whole creation. Arjuna, as we all know, he fought valiantly in the battle of Kurukshetra. Although the opponents were Karna, Bhishma, Dronacharya, great stalwarts, maharathis, yet Arjuna won that battle. And he was blessed with different arms by different devatas. He was very powerful. He was, you know, the pet sort of student of Dronacharya. He was very capable. So he won the battle. Although opponents were great, he was very capable. He was very quick. He was very alert, he was very unique, warriors and soldiers and, you know, so many maharathis, still he won it, won the battle. And when the battle is over they are reinstated back to the kingdom, Hastinapura, the Pandavas becomes the king. And then we know that how eventually Krishna also winds up his past times and leaves Delhi.

### Arjuna, Dwaraka, coward men, defeat, Maya

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Arjuna could not protect the queens. He got defeated."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Arjuna's defeat by cowards while escorting the queens from Dwaraka, illustrating how even a great devotee can be overcome by Maya.

Finally, Yudhishthira Maharaj tells Arjuna that you go to Dwaraka now that the Krishna has left, the queens will be all alone, unprotected. You can bring them to Hastinapura so that, you know, always women, Prabhupada also says in the Vedic culture, should always be under the protection of men. So Arjuna was sent to Dwaraka to bring back the queens so that they can be in Hastinapura and since the Pandavas are ruling, they can be under their protection. So Arjuna goes to Dwaraka to bring the kings, the queens and on his way back, he was coming, you know, the chariots were there and the queens were there and many, many queens. So whole big caravan kind of thing. And on the way, he was attacked by some cowards men, Gwalas. And they were not maharatis, they were having, wielding, they were not having some weapons, they were having some sticks in their hands. And weaklings, skinny, you know, seeing them compared to the soldiers in the battlefield who were armed, who were trained, you know, Akshounis, so to say, of soldiers with elephants, with all kinds of horses, well-trained, with all kinds of arms and ammunitions. Compared to that, they were just, you know, ignoble cowards men, weaklings with sticks in their hands. And Arjuna tried to fight against them fiercely so that he can protect the queens because they were attacked. And Arjuna could not protect the queens. He got defeated. Then Arjuna, this is in the Bhagavatam, he makes this wonderful statement. How a devotee can also sometime may get puffed up, may forget his constitutional position, because maya is very powerful. But then very soon, the devotee realizes, just like Prabhupada gives an example, marginal energy. The shore of an ocean, sometimes it is under water, sometimes it is, when the waves recede, then it is, there is no water. So likewise, we also get covered by maya, our consciousness. And then we associate with devotees. We hear Bhagavatam. We read Prabhupada books.

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "The dhanush is same. The same dhanush which Arjuna used to kill maharatis, big, big soldiers and, you know, Bhishma, Drona, all these kind of people."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the similarities between the battle of Kurukshetra and Arjuna's defeat, highlighting that the only difference was the absence of Krishna.

Again, the maya recedes, the covering, so to say, recedes. So Arjuna says, tad vai dhanus. Now you see, Arjuna is comparing, there are many, many similarities between what was the situation in the battle of Kurukshetra and what was the situation when these cowards men attacked him. There are many, many similarities. Tad vai dhanus. The similarities, the dhanush is the same. Dhanush means bow and arrow. And it is not an ordinary dhanush, gifted by some devata to Arjuna. Tad vai dhanush. The dhanush is same. The same dhanush which Arjuna used to kill maharatis, big, big soldiers and, you know, Bhishma, Drona, all these kind of people. Same dhanush. Sa isha waha. The horses were not ordinary horses. The same horses what were there in the battle of Kurukshetra were there with Arjuna now. Sa isha waha. Sa ratho. The same chariot driven by the same horses. Sa ratho. The ratha is also the same. The horses driving the chariot is also the same. Sa hayaste. And same Arjuna, who is holding the bow. Arjuna is also same. Bow is the same. Chariot is the same. Horses are the same. Arjuna is same. Sa hayaste. Soham rathi. The one who is rathi is referring to himself. Nripatayo yata aanamanti. And then Arjuna says sarvakshanena. In a moment. Tad abhud asad eeshariktham. But there is one difference. That same Arjuna who could kill big big kings. Nirpa. Nirpa means kings. Could destroy them. Could kill them. Could vanquish them. Could defeat them. Same Arjuna driven by the same chariot. Same horses. Same Nandiva bow. Eeshariktham. But there is one difference. In the battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna was there with Arjuna. And here in this particular situation, eeshariktham.

### Krishna's absence, null and void, humility, Krishna consciousness

**Key Quote:** "Minus Krishna is like pouring ghee on the ashes. There is no use."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that without Krishna, all of Arjuna's powers were useless, emphasizing the importance of Krishna consciousness and genuine humility.

Krishna is not there. So then Arjuna says, because of absence of Krishna, rest everything is same. Because of absence of Krishna, basman hutam. Just like, on ashes you pour ghee. It does not inflame. Fire doesn't come out. No use. So same Arjuna, same Nandiva bow, same chariot, driven by same horses, minus Krishna is like pouring ghee on the ashes. There is no use. There is no fire coming out. Basman hutam kuh karadham. Just like seed you put in a barren land. No use. Seed may be very good, barren land, it doesn't sprout, evoktam usyam. Just like magic wand. You know you can use the magic wand to show a magic, that money comes out, but no use. Magic wand doesn't bring out money. It's just a magic. Temporally it appears to be like that. No money. No actual money comes out. So likewise, Arjuna is saying, in the absence of Krishna, all my powers, all my fame, all my abilities, because of which I could this thing, in a moment's notice, shanena, all became null and void. So as devotees also we should always remember. Krishna consciousness means that. Sometimes we try to be humble. We sometimes are told, don't be proud. Sometimes we are told, don't get puffed up. Being puffed up is a natural outcome when our pure consciousness is covered by Maya. It's a by-product, or rather it's an outcome of... In other words, somebody who is not Krishna conscious cannot be genuinely humble. The reverse, if somebody is Krishna conscious, he doesn't have to artificially impose, don't know why I should be humble. A natural outcome would be humility. Whatever I have, whatever strength I have, whatever abilities I have, whatever intelligence I have, whatever speaking power I have, whatever singing power I have, it's all coming from Krishna. It belongs to Krishna.

### Kshetragna, devotee, Krishna, admission, prestigious university

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "All credit goes to the Lord. It belongs to Him."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Arjuna to illustrate that all credit goes to Krishna, and then begins a story about a young man admitted to a prestigious university.

I am just a Kshetragna, a knower of the field of activities. All credit goes to the Lord. It belongs to Him. Just like Arjuna, because he is a devotee of the Lord, the moment he got defeated, he realized. He is not puffed up that, no, because I am great, therefore I could defeat so many great people in the battle of Kurukshetra. He realizes, it was Krishna who was there, because of Him I won. Now that Krishna is not there, it's all useless. All that power, skills, abilities, Gandiva bow, chariot, horses, everything null and void. So here we see Arjuna, and in contrast we see Krishna. Both are amshas of the Lord. One is puffed up, challenging the Lord, wanting to fight against Him. And Arjuna is, because he is Krishna conscious, because he is a devotee of the Lord, realizes his position and he is saying, Without you, no value. One time there was a young man, he got an admission in a very prestigious university, the Liu Pasteur Institute. So this is in Paris. I am sure all of you would have heard about pasteurization, pasteurization of milk. So this person is credited with, so to say, the invention of this pasteurization process. So this person got an admission. It is like, you know, very prestigious like Harvard, MIT and all those things. So he got an admission in there and he was so excited. Some lakhs and lakhs of students apply for it and some selected few get admission. So he was one among them. And he was doing Ph.D.

**Key Quote:** "Wasting time. And here I am, young man, full of energy, full of life."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of the young man in Paris who encounters an old man chanting on a rosary and judges him, only to discover the old man is Louis Pasteur.

He got admission for doing post-doctoral. So he was very happy, very excited. And then he reached Paris. And in Paris, like here we have metro. There also they have, like a metro, local trains within the city. So he boarded the train and he was few stations ahead of him. He had to get down and then from there take a cab to the institute. And since he was young, you know, very ambitious. He had a goal to, you know, make it and he has finally done it. Naturally, you know, some element of confidence was exuding him, bordering towards pride. He was sitting in the train. The train started moving and then suddenly he sees an old man next to him in the seat, just with eyes, you know, half closed, chanting on the rosary and softly murmuring. You know, he was a Christian. And Christians also use the rosary beads and, you know, hail Mary. So they was, he was very softly chanting. So this young man looks at him, this old man. And naturally a feeling of thing comes, useless fellow, wasting time. Like many times people may feel when devotees, they see, you know, chanting and all those things, wasting time. And here I am, young man, full of energy, full of life, full of achievement. Now I am going to do Ph.D. and then after that I am going to pass out. I am going to do research and make a difference in the world. And see this poor fellow, wasting time, simply. So he, anyway. So he asked him, what are you up to? You know, very sarcastically, what are you up to? She said, I am chanting hail Mary. So the conversation ensued. The old man also became inquisitive. Where are you heading? Where are you going? So he said, I have got admission in Louis Pasteur Institute. I am going there. So the old man, some more conversation happened and said, God bless you. Wish you all the very best. The train stopped. The old man gave his card and the old man got down the station. And this young man again continued and in his mind it was their useless fellows. And as the train started, he took the card from his pocket and saw the card. And of the card, it was written, Louis Pasteur. The person, the scientist, whose institute was this, was the person who was chanting on the rosary beads.

### half-baked, humble, knowledgeable, Newton, false ego, ignorance

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "More and more, we become knowledgeable. The more and more, we become humble."
**Summary:** The speaker reflects on the story, explaining that pride comes from being half-baked and that true knowledge leads to humility, using Newton as an example.

So, when we are half-baked, we naturally feel that we are on top of the world, we are proud. More and more, we become knowledgeable, the more and more, we become humble. In fact, it is said that scientists like Newton were quite humble. Newton was once asked, you know, when he was in the last days of his life. So somebody approached Newton and said, I am sure when you take your last breath, you will die. You will be leaving this body with lot of satisfaction, with the sense of accomplishment that you have done it. So many accomplishments to your credit. The world will remember you for your accomplishment. You will die as a proud man. So Newton said, what have I done? What have I accomplished? What have I fathomed? What have I discovered? I am like a small boy standing on the shore of mighty ocean. And the whole ocean lies in front of me completely unexplored. Imagine, big ocean and a child is standing on the ocean. He says, I am like a child standing on the shore of a mighty big ocean. And the whole ocean lies in front of me completely unexplored. So it is because of false ego, because of hankara, because of ignorance, we forget our constitutional position and we become puffed up. We become proud. And we also as conditioned souls are no exception.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Pride cannot touch them."
**Summary:** The speaker acknowledges that conditioned souls are prone to pride and emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's promises.

We are not pure devotees. People like devotees like Prabhupada, they are completely Krishna conscious. Pride cannot touch them. Whereas we all are fallible. We all get puffed up. Somebody praises us. Artificially we say, no, no, no, it's okay, it's okay. Deep within, ah, great. You are a big collector, yes. So, it's a journey. This purification also cannot happen overnight. Slowly as we become Krishna conscious, example is given when the sun rises, all the darkness slowly gradually dissipates. As the sun of Krishna consciousness will rise, genuine Krishna consciousness, the more and more we realize our insignificant position as amsa of the Lord, the more and more all the ahankara, all the darkness which is there, covering our consciousness will get dissipated. So here it is said, the Lord therefore challenged the demon not to go away, but to fulfill his promised word and kill him. One may be proud, yet he does not deserve a seat in an assembly,

**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Whatever is happening is for good, God is all good."
**Summary:** The speaker begins a story about a king and his God-fearing minister, where the king mocks the minister's belief that everything happens for good, until he cuts his finger.

if he fails to fulfill his promise. One time there was a king, and he had a minister. So invariably the king was puffed up. Power corrupts, they say. And the minister, relatively, was quite God-fearing, was always believing in God, believing in destiny, whatever is happening is as per the will of the Lord, sanction of the Lord, it's for our good. So he was having that belief. And invariably when the king and the minister would have a conversation, the king would mock at the minister, what are you talking about? Everything is happening for good, God is all good. Whatever is destined will happen in our life. So he would make fun of his minister. But the minister, because he was conscious of the Lord, he would always maintain his stand, yes, God is all good. Whatever is happening is for our good. Just like Krishna says, I am the well-wisher of all living entities. So this minister also would emphatically say, yes, whatever God is doing is for our good. So one day the king was cutting an apple. And unfortunately, because maybe his attention was somewhere else, while cutting the apple he cut his finger. And it got badly cut. Blood started oozing out. And the minister was there. He says, what has happened? See this. And now I know that everything happens for good. Whatever God is doing is for good. What is good in this? My finger has got cut.

**Key Quote:** "The Goddess will not be pleased if we offer somebody who is not complete."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story, where the king imprisons the minister, gets captured by tribals, and is saved from being sacrificed because of his cut finger.

So the minister says, the Lord has a higher plan. Everything happens for good. So the king got wild. You nonsense. My finger has got cut. God has a higher plan. He took that, ordered his minister, put him behind the bars. So he was imprisoned. So the king went out on the forest for hunting. And he somehow lost his way. And he was captured by some tribals, Aborigines. And they took captive. They bound him and took him. And finally he was presented, you know, the whole village, the chief, village chief was there. And there was some puja of some Kali was happening there. And the chief of the village, he was very happy when all his, you know, so-called soldiers brought king, tied, because they wanted to Narabali, offer a human being in sacrifice to Goddess. So he was happy. So nice. Goddess will be very pleased today. It's not an ordinary man. It's not an ordinary man whom you're going to sacrifice. It's going to be a king, because he was in royal robes. And so they untied him. And they brought him close to the Kali. And about to kill him, suddenly the chief said, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So they all got up. What happened? Says, no, we cannot offer him. So they were curious. He says, see, his finger is cut. The Goddess will not be pleased if we offer somebody who is not complete. He is incomplete. Finger is not there. So what to do? Okay, useless fellow, go. They relieved him. So the king comes back to the kingdom and, you know, he is now recollecting the words of the minister. You know, whatever happens, God has a higher plan. If his finger was not there, if finger was there, today he would have been chopped off.

### minister's word, higher plan, Narabali, devotees, protection, purification, Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Everything which is happening is for our good."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes the story, where the king realizes the minister's wisdom and the minister explains that even his imprisonment was for his own good, emphasizing the devotee's faith in Krishna's plan and the purpose of purification.

So now having realized his minister's word, he felt sorry that what he has done to the minister. And he, you know, says, okay, release him. So the minister comes. Says, now I understand what you said. God has a higher plan. Even my finger getting cut, there was a higher plan of the Lord. By the way, do you think that I imprisoned you, that was also a higher plan of the Lord? That is also for your good? He says, yes. He says, how? He said, had you not imprisoned me, I would have invariably accompanied you to the forest. And having realized that your finger is not there, I would have been Narabali. So God is great. Everything which is happening is for our good. So when we are devotees of the Lord, we are naturally conscious of the Lord, His protection, our dependence on Him. Whatever the Lord takes us through, we take it as a blessing. Sometimes we may be able to understand, sometimes we may not be able to understand. A devotee that way never rebels. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, maro bhi raakho bhi jo ichcho to maro. This consciousness naturally stems from a pure Krishna consciousness understanding. Whatever is happening, if we are so long surrendered to the Lord, trying to please our Lord, trying to serve Him, trying to follow this process which will purify us, whatever ups and downs we may go through, even as devotees life, having faith that Krishna has a higher plan, we may encounter some difficulties, some challenges, somebody, you know, not treating us well. We are here for purification. We are not here for a cozy, comfortable life, everyone is good, everything is good. In one lecture we heard that, if we become super peaceful, we all want to be peaceful, no problems, so that we can peacefully practice Krishna. If we become super peaceful, first thing we want to do is, we will forget Krishna. So that way, let's take whatever is unfolding in our lives in stride, be grateful to Krishna, Prabhupada, for Divya Gyan, the knowledge what they have given us, and pursue this process, practice this process very sincerely.

### anger, scriptural understanding, parampara, superficial understanding
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/-ZjWL2a5c6E?t=259
**Verse References:** BG 2.47
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "What meets our eyes is a superficial understanding."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the apparent contradiction of the Lord exhibiting anger when the scriptures advise against it, emphasizing the importance of understanding scriptures through parampara to avoid superficial interpretations.

For someone who is totally new to Krishna Consciousness, this can be bewildering. How can the Lord get angry? Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita Himself says there are three gates leading to hell: lust, anger, and greed. And here the Lord Himself is getting angry. This is Jaisa Achar and then Prachar. So here the Lord is getting angry and grew more and more enraged at the smell of blood of His person. In His eagerness to win, this we see. Okay, actually this can be expected, after all He was a demon, eagerness to win. And Krishna also says you have the right to do your duty but do not be attached to the results. On one side the Lord says control the senses, control the mind. From the very beginning control the senses, and then He marries 16,108 queens. So people sometimes even ask this question: Why the Lord married so many queens? From their understanding, was He not satisfied with one wife? Why did He dance with the gopis? That's why Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita says, what meets our eyes is a superficial understanding. That's why Krishna says, it's a most confidential knowledge. Tatvatah means in truth. What we can understand just by reading like a novel or a comic or any other book, will not be tatvatah understanding. It will not be the real understanding. That's why Krishna says one who understands in tatvatah, in truth, he gets eligible for liberation from the cycle of birth and death. He goes back to the kingdom of God. So how do we understand? Why the Lord who is... And we also understand saintly people are expected to be tolerant, not get provoked. They should be peaceful. They should be equipoised. They should be forgiving. These are all qualities of devotees and Lord should also exhibit these qualities. And here we are saying that the Lord is fighting and Lord is getting angry and is beating Hiranaksha and is eager to win, to defeat Hiranaksha. So how do we understand this? So as I mentioned, if we have not studied the scriptures in a parampara, a parampara understanding, just like Prabhupada is writing the purports, when we read those purports and understand them, all our misconceptions and wrong understandings slowly can get wiped away. Typical understanding is a saintly person means he should never get angry. That's why many times people say Hinduism, because of all this tolerance and ahimsa, that's why these Mohammedans invaded India and we were just simply tolerant and they ransacked the temples, destroyed the temples. And we were all talking about ahimsa, we should be tolerant. Actually that's not the correct understanding. Wherever anger is required, it has to be exhibited. Wherever ahimsa is required, it has to be done. The whole Bhagavad Gita was spoken by Lord to Arjuna to inspire him to fight. Sometimes it can be bewildering what to tolerate, what not to tolerate, when to get angry, when not to get angry. There is a very famous quote which says, not to get angry is very easy. If someone decides I'll not get angry, relatively it's easy. A stone also does not get angry. But to get angry at the right time, in the right circumstances, on the right person, to the right degree, is not very easy. In other words, there is place of anger, there is place for every emotion. The emotions what we exhibit, originally is there in the Lord. Lord is a person, and person means emotions, feelings. And every emotion has a place. Just like Hanuman got angry, and he burned the Lanka. He was a great devotee of the Lord. Everyone worships Hanuman. He worships Hanuman, as a great devotee of the Lord. And he got angry, and he burned the Lanka. And still we glorify him, still we worship him. And still we accept him as a great devotee of the Lord. So many times, people have a very superficial understanding of our scriptures. In fact, many people who come up with these arguments, may not have even read the scriptures. Or if they would have read, they would have read very superficially, some thing written by some author, and they miss out the correct understanding.

### religion, misunderstanding, violence, scriptural knowledge

**Key Quote:** "Had he read Quran, he wouldn't be a terrorist."
**Summary:** The speaker shares a story about a Hindu man in Afghanistan who avoids danger by reciting a verse from the Bhagavad Gita, highlighting the idea that violence often stems from a lack of true understanding of religious texts.

One time there was a family, who was visiting Afghanistan, an Indian family. They had gone to meet some of their friends and acquaintances. So, they were visiting Afghanistan for the first time, and as you all know, it's an area which is strived with lot of terrorism, lot of violence. So this family was going in a car, and suddenly they were stopped on the highway. And two men, with guns, stopped the car, and said, come out. So they were completely, you know, panic stricken, fearful, what's going to happen, fearful of death. Imagine, on the highway, deserted highway, somebody stops the car, and comes with a gun. So their heart started pounding. So anyway, they had no option, they came out of the car, and the so-called terrorist, asked that person, what is your religion? So this person, although he was Hindu, from India, but fearful that they are not going to spare him if he says I am a Hindu. So he spontaneously says, I am a Muslim. So the terrorist, how can he believe? Look like Indian, look like, so he said, can you recite a verse from Quran? So this person is a Hindu, how does he know Quran? Viva voice, they say, just to test your knowledge. So this person, you know, where does he remember Quran? Started, yada yadahi dharmasya glanir bhavati bharata, somehow, spontaneously, spoke out that verse, and the terrorist, okay, okay, go. So he got into the car, and went off. So, when they started off, the wife said, hey, why did you say you are a Muslim? And he asked you to quote Quran, and you said, yada yadahi, you quoted a verse from the Bhagavad Gita. Why did you do that? He said, had he read Quran, he wouldn't be a terrorist. It's a fact that, many times, people who are fighting in the name of religion, in fact, you ask anybody, I ask this question quite often, how many of you feel that today the world is in chaos because of religion? 95% of people raise their hands. I've asked this question in many, many gatherings, many, many forums. How many of you feel that today, because of, in the name of religion, people are fighting, the world is in a mess. If you look objectively also, all the fights which are going on in Syria, in Afghanistan, Iraq, all these things, it's all stemming from, you know, these differences, Israel, Palestine.

**Key Quote:** "It's because of fanatic understanding of religion."
**Summary:** The speaker argues that the world's problems are not caused by religion itself, but by fanatic and ignorant interpretations of religious texts, often fueled by vested interests.

So, how many of you feel that the world is in chaos because of religion? Everyone, except for few people, they raise their hands. People see that people are fighting in the name of religion. Religion, which is supposed to bring about peace, harmony, universal brotherhood, actually is doing just the opposite. India got divided, like Prabhupada says in the Bhagavatam, earlier it was all Bharat-Varsha, it got divided in the name of religion: Hindustan and Pakistan. People are seeing that countries are getting divided, countries are fighting in the name of religion. Actually, the fact is, it is not because of religion. It's because of fanatic understanding of religion. Where do people have Tatvataha understanding? First and foremost, people have not read the Bhagavad Gita, not read the Quran, not read the Bible, even if they have read the Bible, or Quran, or whatever it is, it is superficial understanding. Just like, if you read and don't understand in Parampara, what is the understanding we are getting? The Lord is getting angry. And anybody can justify that, anybody can get angry, because we are following, we are devotees of the Lord. So, what has happened is, people with vested interest have fanned the religious sentiments of ignoble people, gullible people, ignorant people, people who are jobless, people who are illiterate, and has created chaos in the whole thing. Many of the so-called jihadis, they may be illiterate otherwise.

**Key Quote:** "The solution is not to pluck out the eyes."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of cataracts and blurred vision, the speaker explains that the solution to problems caused by misinterpretations of religion is not to abandon religion, but to correct the understanding through a bona fide spiritual master and parampara.

Just like we had that terrorist attack in India. They were paid some amount, the family would be paid few lakhs of rupees, and, you know, they were asked to participate in this jihad. So, in one sense, it is a very sorry state of affairs, but the result is not that you do away with religion. It says, just like a cataract, when the eyes have cataract, and the vision becomes blurred, the solution is not to pluck out the eyes. Na rahega baans, na bajegi baansuri. They say, pluck out the eyes, no more cataract, no more blurred vision. But that's not the solution. You remove the cataract, and your vision is restored. So dharma, or religion, has a very important place, because it helps us lead a meaningful life. Without dharma, it is nothing but polished animalism. So, when we understanding in parampara, we are fortunate to understand from a bona fide spiritual master, we can get a clear understanding, and not get bewildered,

### tolerance, anger, devotee qualities, blasphemy

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "One should be ready to tolerate all insults to one's own self."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the example of Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who preached humility and tolerance but also exhibited anger towards those who blasphemed devotees, explaining that devotees should tolerate insults to themselves but become angry when Krishna or his devotees are blasphemed.

when we read such things. Prabhupada says, Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu became angry. Although he says, One who does not deserve respect also, maana dena, respect. Tolerant than a tree. Humbler than a blade of grass. Anybody tramples, it just stands up. Tree, you cut it, it gives you wood. You shake it, it gives you fruits. Tolerant, does not repel back. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who is preaching that, is saying, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu became angry with the miscreant brothers, Jagai and Madai, who blasphemed and struck Nithyananda Prabhu. In his Sastastaka, Lord Chaitanya wrote, One should be humbler than the grass, and more tolerant than the tree. One may then ask, why the Lord exhibited his anger? The same thing here. Lord one side is saying, three gates leading to hell, and other side, he himself is getting angry. Lord Chaitanya is saying, humbler than a blade of grass, and then he is becoming angry, and Jagai and Madai. The point is that one should be ready to tolerate all insults to one's own self. This is the principle. Sometimes we can also get bewildered. No, no, we should get angry. Little bit somebody provoked, angry. And justify, Lord also got angry. The principle is, the point is that one should be ready to tolerate all insults to one's own self. My ego gets hurt, I should tolerate. Somebody speaks something, I feel bad, I tolerate. I become provoked, I tolerate. One should be ready to tolerate all insults to one's own self. But when Krishna or his pure devotee is blasphemed, a genuine devotee becomes angry, and acts like fire against the offenders. Here Mother Earth, she is also a devotee, and Hiranaksha, and the Lord, just like Lord Chaitanya, became angry. Jagai and Madai, they hit Nithyananda Prabhu, and the Lord became angry.

**Key Quote:** "Every emotion has a place, but with the right knowledge."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that all emotions have a place when aligned with dharmic principles and used in Krishna consciousness, highlighting that anger can be controlled and directed towards chastising evil-doers and blasphemers.

So every emotion has a place, but with the right knowledge, Tattvata understanding, we can have a proper understanding, where and when to apply that emotion. Just like Krishna said, dharma aviruto kamo asmi, even karma has a place. dharma aviruto, like that, all emotions, if it is not dharma aviruto, in the sense, if it is in line with dharmic principles, have a place. If you always remember Krishna, by your activities, and seeing Krishna everywhere, even in the heart of demoniac persons, then anger will never overcome you. Now how do we tolerate? Suppose somebody is, you know, in the middle of the night, he is provoking us, he is making our life miserable, or he is speaking some sarcastic words, and I am getting affected. So the solution is, if you are always remembering Krishna, and seeing Krishna everywhere, even in the heart of demoniac people, then anger will never overcome you. Being purified of false pride, many times, we get angry because of false pride, because of ego. And then we justify that, so and so is responsible for my anger. Actually, if we look introspect, it is because our ego got hurt, our self-respect, our esteem got affected. Maybe itch chali jayegi, what will people think about me? But occasionally, if there is good reason, you may have to become angry, just to chastise the evil doers, and blasphemers. So specially when we are young, we will require some guidance. Superficial understanding is not to get angry. So Prabhupada says, if there is good reason, you may have to become angry, just to chastise the evil doers, and blasphemers. Because we are living in a material world, where everyone is in one sense diseased. Everyone has ego, everyone has pride, everyone is there to put down others. So sometimes, we may have to get angry, to chastise the evil doers, and the blasphemers.

**Key Quote:** "Anger can be controlled, we cannot stop anger altogether."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while saintly persons tolerate personal insults, they become angry at blasphemy, and that while conditioned souls will get upset, it's important to avoid holding grudges and hatred.

Anger can be controlled, we cannot stop anger altogether. But if we simply become angry with those who blaspheme the Lord, or the devotees of the Lord, we can control our anger in Krishna consciousness. When insignificant persons use rough words to cast false, angry accusations against saintly persons, their fruitless words do not disturb the great personalities. So if it is, mind you here, angry accusations against saintly person, personal attack, just like here it is said, all insults to one's own self, saintly persons, they do not get disturbed. They act like, but when required, evil doers, blasphemers, blasphemers of devotees, blasphemers of the Lord, they have the right to become angry, they should become angry. Sometimes, when we are living in day to day life, we will get upset, we will get, somebody will speak some things, bit critical, unnecessarily, will pass some remarks, as we said, we all are conditioned souls, we are not pure devotees, where we have risen above all this. So when, now here it is said, a saintly person should tolerate, should not get disturbed. Now what if we get disturbed? We will get disturbed. Only when our consciousness has risen to a certain level, when we are advanced in Krishna consciousness, saintly person, great personalities, we will not be affected. Suppose somebody has insulted us, and we get angry, we get affected, we get worked up, and the result of that is, many times, we can either retaliate, or sometime, if it is, let's say a senior devotee, or somebody else, we can't retaliate, deep within, we have grudges, hatred, ill feeling, can't do anything, but then, inside, keep brewing, anger, hatred. In fact, it is said that if a devotee has that kind of a consciousness,

**Key Quote:** "How are you different from a parasite?"
**Summary:** The speaker shares a personal anecdote about being insulted and losing his temper, illustrating the difficulty of tolerating insults and the importance of forgiveness.

he is hurting himself. So, how to keep our heart clean? We will get affected, we will get, so to say, somebody insults us, somebody speaks harsh words. One time, I went out to meet somebody, many years back, when I used to go out for life membership. So, we went to a donor's place, and I was telling him, he had agreed to become a member, and I was supposed to go and collect the membership amount. He was ready, he was having a cheque book in his hand. He was about to write the cheque, and I was sitting, I took out the receipt book, and the person sitting next to me, his friend, he was also there, in his office. So, that person said, what do you do whole day? So, I told him that we get up in the morning, and we have the sadhana, and then we have different services and all that. Then that person suddenly switched tone and said, do you know what is a parasite? So, it took me some time to understand, what is he up to? He said, I understand. Do you know what is a parasite? I said, yeah, I understand. How are you different from a parasite? He asked. Parasite is basically a person, parasite in a body, lives on the other person's blood, or other person's this thing. So, what he was trying to indicate is that we are parasites, we don't do any meaningful work, we beg. We just do little bit of ringing the bell, while our time, and beg people, and live at the cost of others. So, moment I heard that, how are you different from parasite? I became angry. I said, how can you call out so, and I tried justifying, you know, no, you don't know how much we are building a big temple, it's a public temple, so many people will come, temple is required, and all those things. While all this anger discussion was going on, the person took the checkbook, and kept it inside. It was in a drawer. And then he said, Swamiji will see later on. That's it. People don't expect that saintly person should get provoked, and lose temper. That's a natural understanding. And in one sense, that's the understanding which people have. But, we cannot go to other extreme. Now here, this was a blasphemy to me. How are you different from a parasite? Ideal would have been to just tolerate. Just, after all he is ignorant, he has his own understanding of who the devotees are. Maybe he is an atheist. Simply tolerate, and somehow, without offending him, Lord's service should happen. Somehow intelligently, if I had added, he would have even given the check. So sometimes, we will get affected, so to say, we will get, momentarily lose our temper, because we are conditioned souls, we are not pure devotees.

### forgiveness, anger, resentment, Krishna consciousness

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "You have to let go."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of monkeys trapped by holding onto bananas to illustrate the importance of letting go of anger, resentment, and ill feelings to find peace.

But the worst thing is, we brew anger within us. We stop talking to someone. Like here it says, the lips in rage, he bit his lip in rage, took up his mace again, and began to repeatedly brandish, you know, anger within. So it is said that for a devotee, it is very important to also cultivate a quality, and that quality is shama. Shama means forgiveness. Just like here it says, if one remembers that the Lord, seeing Krishna everywhere, even in the heart of a demoniac person, the person who has insulted you, if you are Krishna conscious, genuine Krishna conscious, anger will not overcome you. Being purified of all false pride. So it is said that sometimes when people have to catch monkeys, wild monkeys in jungles, they take cages, and they put it in the forest, and inside the cages, they put something which the monkeys like. We all know monkeys like bananas and, so big big bananas, bunches they will keep inside those cages, and they leave them, and they leave them in wild forest. What they expect is that once the monkeys come inside the cage, to eat the bananas, and they will drop the lever, and the cage will get closed. So the monkeys, one or two times they got trapped, but you know, we all learn from experience, monkeys are also that way quite shrewd. So the monkeys saw that, you know, this is a trap for us. So instead of going inside the cage, to eat the bananas, they came on the side of the cage, put the hand inside the cage, and they were trying to take the bananas. So that even if the lever goes in, they will get the bananas also without getting trapped. But then it so happened that people started observing, those who had put those cages, the monkeys would hold big big bananas in their hand, will try to pull it out, but the cage ribs were there, the bars were there, they won't be able to pull out the banana, because bananas were quite big. And they are desperate to eat the bananas, and they will not leave the bananas. Trying, trying, trying, somehow not leaving the banana, and finally they will be caught. So the learning from this is, just like the monkeys, they can go free, if they just drop the banana. So likewise, many times, we just tightly hold on to that anger, resentment, hatred, ill feeling against someone, you have to let go.

**Key Quote:** "Father forgive them, for they know not what they are doing."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating the importance of forgiveness, humility, and letting go of anger, while also emphasizing the need to become angry when the Lord and His devotees are blasphemed, and to beg forgiveness if one gets provoked unintentionally.

We will be peaceful. We have to also analyze, most of the time, that hatred, ill feeling is because I have got insulted. Somebody has hurt me. All of us are conditioned souls, we all are diseased. Jesus says, Father forgive them, for they know not what they are doing. Everyone is acting in lower modes, we all get overpowered. Drop it. We will momentarily get angry. Beg forgiveness, ask forgiveness, let go. Keep your heart clean. Keep your consciousness clean. So if we have that, now having said that, we have to avoid the other extreme. Other extreme is, every time let go. If the Lord and His devotees are blasphemed, we have to get angry. If I get insulted, I tolerate. If unknowingly, unintentionally, in spite of this, I get provoked, I get angry, I use harsh words, I beg forgiveness. I let go.

**Key Quote:** "If we have experienced real love. Real beauty of the Lord, then we will experience that satisfaction."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that by surrendering to Krishna (Madan Mohan) and experiencing divine love, one can overcome lusty desires and the enchantment of material beauty.

World over, people are enchanted by Cupid, arrows of Cupid. Cupid shoots arrows, pierces our heart. We have that picture of a heart being pierced by an arrow, lusty desires. And Cupid is called Madan, and Krishna is called Madan Mohana, who enchants the Cupid, who is much, much more attractive, millions of times more attractive than the Cupid, so-called beauty in this material world. So if we get enchanted by Madan Mohana, if we worship Madan Mohan, if we surrender to Madan Mohan, if we follow the instructions of Krishna, Madan Mohan, which is given in the Bhagavad Gita, then Cupid has no place in our lives. We will not be tormented, will not be shot at by the Cupid, if we have experienced real love, real beauty of the Lord. Then we will experience that satisfaction, we will experience that higher taste.

**Key Quote:** "Spiritual life means austerity, tapo divyam. And austerity means voluntarily accepting some inconvenience for a higher purpose."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the mentality of personal deliverance with the desire to serve Prabhupada's mission of expanding Krishna consciousness through building temples, emphasizing that spiritual life involves accepting inconvenience for a higher purpose.

Why build this temple? So many donors, so many problems, so many escalations. There can be this mentality. There could be somebody who is interested in his own deliverance, personal deliverance. A person with that mentality, why should I break my head? Why should I be involved in this thing? Unnecessary tension, stress, anxiety. But if we execute the instructions of Prabhupada, who desired that preaching be expanded, desired that temples be built, more and more people get Krishna consciousness. Prabhupada very emphatically demonstrated by his personal example what he desired, what he wanted from his disciples. Spiritual life means austerity, tapo divyam. And austerity means voluntarily accepting some inconvenience for a higher purpose. There may be inconvenience, but we accept it for a higher cause.

**Key Quote:** "The first victim of brahmana injustice, brahmanical injustice, was Maharaj Pariksit."
**Summary:** This segment introduces the context of the verse, focusing on Pariksit Maharaj, the curse by Shringi, and the influence of Kali Yuga.

tasya putrati tejasvi niharan balako arba kahe rajnagam prapitam tatam sutva tatredam abhravesh Translation and purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada Translation The sage had a son who was very powerful, being a brahmana's son. While he was playing with the inexperienced boys, he heard of his father's distress, which was occasioned by the king. Then and there the boy spoke as follows. Due to Maharaj Pariksit's good government, even a boy of tender age who was playing with his other inexperienced boys could become as powerful as qualified brahmana. The boy was known as Shringi, and he achieved good training. In brahmacharya by his father, so that he could be as powerful as a brahmana, even at that age. But because the age of Kali was seeking an opportunity to spoil the cultural heritage of the four orders of life, the inexperienced boys gave a chance for the age of Kali to enter into the field of Vedic culture. Hatred of the lower orders of life began from the brahmana boy under the influence of Kali, and thus cultural life began to dwindle. Day after day. The first victim of brahmana injustice, brahmanical injustice, was Maharaj Pariksit. And thus the protection given by the king against the onslaught of Kali was slackened. Thus ends the bhaktivedanta purva.

**Key Quote:** "Good governance means to protect the citizens, kshatriyas and also protect the kingdom from the influence of the sinful habits, sinful tendencies."
**Summary:** This segment explains the divine plan behind the events, the role of Pariksit Maharaj in protecting against Kali Yuga, and the importance of good governance.

So just to give you a context of what's being mentioned in this verse. In the previous verse, Pariksit Maharaj, while he was in the forest, he saw the sage. Reached his hermitage. And since the sage was busy in his meditation, he didn't open his eyes. He didn't properly receive the king as per the etiquette. So he was very angry. Many leelas which are mentioned in the Bhagavatam, if we understand in the context of the divine plan of the Lord, we'll be able to understand them correctly. One may question, if Pariksit was such a great devotee of the Lord, why did he become angry? Why did he feel insulted? Just because he was not received respectfully. In fact, a devotee of the Lord is very tolerant. Like Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, He is more tolerant than a tree. He is humbler than a blade of grass. So overall, it's a divine plan of the Lord. As we all know, there are four cycles, four yugas. Kali Yuga, Treta Yuga, Satya Yuga, Dwapara Yuga. And Kali Yuga had to begin. So Shringi, who is the Brahmana's son, So what did Pariksit do? When he felt insulted, he took a dead snake which was lying nearby and put it around the neck of the Brahmana. So Shringi, who is the son of this Brahmana, he saw his father being insulted. He felt very offended and he cursed Pariksit Maharaj. And in this verse, Prabhupada is mentioning that the influence of Kali, when there is a strong king like Pariksit Maharaj, good governance means to protect the citizens, kshatriyas and also protect the kingdom from the influence of the sinful habits, sinful tendencies Like meat eating, intoxication, gambling, illicit sex, which is very rampant in present times. because we are in the midst of Kali Yuga.

**Key Quote:** "As devotees of the Lord, yes, we have a duty to see how we can reach this message, distribute the holy name to people."
**Summary:** This segment describes the symptoms of Kali Yuga and emphasizes the duty of devotees to spread the message of the Lord.

And thus cultural life began to dwindle day after day. So since Pariksit Maharaj was cursed and then he was cursed to die in next seven days. So the world lost a great king like Pariksit Maharaj and once the king is not very strong then things start deteriorating. The first victim of Brahminical injustice, now Sringi was a Brahmin boy, Brahminical injustice against the lower orders like Kshatriyas, Brahminas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras. So it says the injustice of the Brahminical injustice began with Pariksit Maharaj. So, to curse Pariksit Maharaj to die in seven days was not appropriate even if we were to evaluate what Pariksit Maharaj did. But Pariksit Maharaj instead of counteracting or counter cursing Sringi, he accepted it. He went to the bank of Ganges, heard the Srimad Bhagavatam and died remembering the Lord. So, as I mentioned earlier, we are in Kali Yuga and Kali Yuga is of all the four ages is the most degraded. And, we can see the symptoms. What do you mean by that? Yes, they are degrading. Yeah. It's coming to you. He's seem consistently degrading. It has not only sounded degradatory but. But I'm not saying he is dead. In fact, the symptoms are mentioned in the Srimad Bhagavatam and which are very much visible to us in present times. There's a lot of fights happening, lots of wars happening, a lot of confusion, a lot of quarrels happening. Meat-eating is rampant, intoxication, gambling, illicit sex, extramarital affairs, live-in relationships. What was not so common, what was unheard of maybe 20 years back, has become very common. So as devotees of the Lord, yes, we have a duty. To see how we can reach this message, distribute the holy name to people. It's our duty, it's Prabhupada's mission.

We are part of that mission. But Chetanaya Mahaprabhu says, First we have to protect ourselves. First we have to realize that, yes, Kali Yuga. Is at its full force and things are degrading. We have to protect ourselves. We have to insulate ourselves. Like in the flight also when you travel. They say that the oxygen thing will, the mask will fall down from the top. Before helping others, kindly put the mask. So we have to help ourselves. We have to protect ourselves, insulate ourselves from the ill effects of Kali Yuga.

And try our best, whatever we can, to help others. Janma Sarthak Kari Koro Pakaar. Many years back, I came across this story. In fact, it's not a story, I saw a television, this episode. This was more than 20 years back. And those days, I think, it would have been 20 years ago. This was more than 20 years back. And those days, I think, it would have been 20 years ago. It was black and white television. And I, even till date, remember this. But those days, it was not like you like some episode, you save it, you can download it. It's on YouTube. I vaguely remember. There was a man. He was very poverty stricken. And Practically had no money with him. He had a young daughter. And he was barely able to manage the day-to-day needs of the family. Including groceries and clothes. So the daughter was getting, you know, the marriageable age. And he was in anxiety, how to marry the daughter. And he was in anxiety, how to marry the daughter. And even in Vedic times, there was, you know, marriage. And even in Vedic times, there was, you know, marriage. It was done in a way. Some dowry was also given, not in the sense, what we see in present times, it is demanded. It was out of love. So, this person was a lot of, had a lot of anxiety, lot of worry, how to manage his household expenses. How to marry the daughter. And he was trying various means to earn money but things were not happening. So one day a friend of his gave him a challenge. He said you need money. I can give you enough money, so much money that for the rest of the life you can live happily. You don't have to worry about your finances. Not only that, you can very easily get your daughter married. So he couldn't believe such a thing as possible, but there is a challenge. Now he was so desperate for money, he said I am ready to accept any challenge. He said the challenge is that you have to live in a room all by yourself, all alone for 10 years. Three times the food will be given in that cell, in that room. But you will not be allowed to interact with people. But you will not be allowed to interact with people. But you will not be allowed to interact with people. with anyone, including your family, including your near and dear ones. Even in prisons they have, you know, in a month you can for some five minutes or something you can meet. There's some protocols. But here the condition was that for ten years you cannot talk to anyone, you cannot meet anyone, you cannot hear anything. There were no smart phones, there was no mp3 players. You can hear the songs, FM radio, nothing. And you all know that man is a social animal. We thrive on relationships, social beings. Relationships are very important. So this man accepted the challenge and he thought instead of struggling the whole life, it's a struggle for 10 years. I'll somehow manage. But he never anticipated what that struggle would be, how intense that struggle would

be. So this whole documentary or film what was made is basically to showcase his emotions. What this person went through, what struggles and this whole camera was focusing on his facial expressions, on what he was doing during those 10 days. These days you have some reality shows where somebody is put in some house. I haven't seen anything, just maybe some idea and then people watch what they are doing. So for 10 years he was in this room, locked. Three times food was served to him, and then first initial 1 week 10 days. He was... He started missing something, something unusual. See one day we can manage food, second day, something, you know, we feel very uncomfortable. So likewise if we are in a room and all by itself... One day, two day, we can somehow manage. So after one week, ten days, he started feeling very uneasy. And that started showing up on his face, on his expression. He started becoming uncomfortable, little jittery. Felt like talking to someone but there's nobody. Even the camera captured whatever he was speaking, whatever he was expressing, whatever words he was speaking also was being captured, was being shown. So he even started thinking that is it really worthwhile taking this challenge and stay for ten years? Because seven days itself was so difficult. And he started even thinking that maybe let me walk out. But then what else will he do? How will he get the money? So he continued. One month passed, two months passed, three months passed. And then after three months, he became so agitated because of loneliness. No companionship, nobody to talk to. Sometimes he would be shouting, screaming, hitting his head on the walls. Sometimes he started becoming... He started becoming... He started becoming... A little bit mad. Anyway, he kept on going. One year passed, two years passed, three years passed. And now he almost became like mad. He had big beard, you know, hairs not combed. Maybe not bathing daily. And at times screaming, at times howling.

**Summary:** This segment describes the man's descent into near madness due to prolonged isolation, emphasizing his suffering and the anticipation of the end of his ordeal.

The camera would capture. He would be lying for hours together on the floor. No proper time for sleeping. You know, we all have a schedule. Morning we get up, we have to go for work. Somebody comes, meet. And then night time comes, we sleep. But here you have no one. You practically don't know whether it's day or night. It's a dark, dungeon room all alone. So three years passed. Four years pass. And it was quite evident from his face that he's suffering. He's suffering. He's miserable. He's not able to take it. But somewhere, whatever sanity he had, he was trying to reconcile. Another five years. Another four years. And then a couple of more years passed. Seven years. Eight years. Eight years. And by now, he had practically become mad. For you would see the camera would capture. He would start screaming. Whatever he's speaking is incoherent. Whatever is not making any sense. He's shouting. He's screaming. All by itself. Just like you go to a Nimhans or some mad people, you can see. They'll be laughing. No reason. Talking. No reason. What they're talking is all gibberish. So, the camera was capturing everything. You could hear what he was speaking. You could hear what he was shouting, screaming. Everything. Now, nine years passed. This man, although a little bit, whatever little sanity is waiting, when that one year will pass and he can walk out. Sometimes, some very interesting thing which has to happen. Or some very important festival or something. So, we wait. Countdown. Countdown starts. 30 days left. 35. 28 days left. So, in his mind, probably the countdown had begun.

**Key Quote:** "Little by little, he started getting interested in what is being written, what is written in the Gita."
**Summary:** This segment narrates how the man receives a Bhagavad Gita and gradually becomes interested in it, marking the beginning of his transformation.

So, then, I clearly remember, somehow, he got a copy of Bhagavad Gita. Just for your information, in ISKCON also, many devotees go and preach in prisons. And just for your information, not everyone who is behind bars or who is in prison is quite possible there could be innocent people also. So, not everyone. Everyone is a hardcore criminal. So, devotees go and many times the Gita's also are distributed. So, somehow, this person got the Gita and, so the camera is not, what is he doing with the Gita? He is all alone, all the time in the world, nothing else to do, started reading Gita. So, initially when he was reading Gita, it was quite evident from his face, facial expression, it is not making any sense to him. Probably he is not able to understand what is written. Like it happens when you first try to read Gita, it may look like it is very philosophical and maybe for some it may be difficult to understand. So, he started reading and then it was quite evident that it is not interesting. It is not making any sense. So, he would, you know, flip few pages and then he would close it and keep it. Again, he would pick up after some time or maybe after few days. And then, the camera captured very interesting thing. Little by little, he started getting interested in what is being written, what is written in the Gita. So, he started with some bit of sobriety reading what is there in the Gita. He started becoming little sober. It appeared, this whole episode was, the camera is capturing the action. So, whole expression was that what he is reading is now started making sense to him.

**Summary:** This segment describes the man's increasing absorption in the Gita, leading to calmness, sobriety, and a sense of contentment, as he begins to understand the purpose of life.

And then, nine years, six months passed. Now, daily, three hours, four hours, he is reading Gita. And then, seven months passed. Nine years, seven months passed. By now, he had calmed down. All that agitation. All that anxiety. All that screaming, shouting, howling. All that had calmed down. And then, six hours, seven hours, he is reading Gita. Nine years, nine months passed. And now, he was completely calm. He was very sober. Very intensely, very sincerely reading Gita daily. Nine years, eleven months passed. Thirty days to go. And you could see from his face, there is some bit of divinity reflecting. You know, some sages, very austere, you can see from their face. So, the camera captured that. Very calm, very sober, very serene, very contentment reflecting on his face. Ten days left. Nine years, eleven months, twenty days over. He started experiencing so much of joy, so much of bliss, so much of happiness, reading Gita. That started feeling that whatever I had to gain in life, whatever I want, I have already achieved. After all, why we need money? Why we need, ultimately, the common denominator in everyone's life. Whether somebody needs money, somebody needs adventure, somebody is fond of travelling, somebody is fond of renunciation, somebody is fond of different hobbies. Ultimately, it's for happiness, feeling good.

**Key Quote:** "Now that I have got you, which is like valuable jewel, what I was looking for was nothing. I don't want."
**Summary:** This segment connects the story to the pastime of Dhruva Maharaj, illustrating the renunciation of material desires upon realizing a higher purpose and experiencing spiritual fulfillment.

So, the camera was capturing, which is in line with the pastime of Dhruva Maharaj, who went to the forest, did austerities, and then when the Lord came, gave darshan and said, What do you want? He said, I don't want anything. Now that I have got it. I was looking for broken pieces of glass. Now that I have got you, which is like valuable jewel, what I was looking for was nothing. I don't want. I don't want any varam. I don't want any benediction. I just want you. Because now that I have you, I have everything. So, maybe the inspiration from this particular pastime, so this person, nine years, eleven months, one day left, for him to walk out of that room, with that huge sum of money, he felt that money is not required. Now that he, has everything, he has understood the purpose of life, he has understood the message of Krishna, and then this person is shown that one day before his tenth year getting completed, he walks out of that room. And he says, I don't want your money. Maybe whatever that episode was made, or that film was made, inspiration must have been taken from Dhruva Maharaj's pastime.

**Summary:** This segment shifts to a discussion of Kali Yuga, highlighting the temptations and distractions of the modern world, particularly social media, and how they capture our attention for profit.

Wanted to maybe convey in this thing. The point here is, in Kali Yuga, we will be tempted. There are lot of distractions. There are lot of allurements. And as time is passing by, it's on the rise. Many of us may not be even aware that we may already be addicted to smartphones. These algorithms have been designed by the best of brains. MIT, Harvard, Stanford, all these elite students, they work in Facebook, Google, all that. And they are, they are, in one sense, the common people are guinea pigs. Our, so to say, our innocence is being played with. We are victims. No doubt, I am not against social media or smartphones. But, many of us may not realize, or already would have realized, that how it is addictive. 15 minutes, 20 minutes, you want to watch something, or do something, but then, hours pass by. Because that's how it is designed. The algorithms are designed. You see something, the next related thing will be served. We are having a symposium going on, which says that whole principle is, to capture your attention. The content you produce, if you are able to capture the attention, they will promote your content. And the content creators, brainy fellows, in different fields, producing content. And it's flooded with content. And algorithms are serving that content, and capturing our attention. And that captured attention is being sold to the advertisers.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of protecting the creeper of bhakti and experiencing a higher taste to avoid falling for the allurements of lower tastes in Kali Yuga.

Okay, you have a product. Whom do you want to show? Which demographic? Which country? Which age group? Which gender? Which city? Which town? Which locality? I will serve. Give me this much money. They may not say, but this is how the whole industry is. So we as devotees, janma sarthakari, we have got Prabhupada's message. We have got, khanda brahmite kono bhagyavan jeev, guru krishna prasade paaye bhakti lata abhij. We have got the bija. But, we should protect the creeper of bhakti. And as I said, with the influence of Kali Yuga, there are lot of allurements, lot of temptations, lot of distractions. And if we don't safeguard ourselves, we will fall for it. Krishna also in the Gita says, just by artificially restraining ourselves, restricting ourselves, we cannot protect. We cannot say, I will not see, I will not do, I will not do this, I will not say this. Sometimes, devotees can also fall in a trap of, that what we try to resist, it persists. The more we say, no, no, no, no, no, it again hits us back with more intense force. So that's why Krishna in the Gita says, raso varjam rasopi asya param drishtva nivartate by experiencing a higher taste. And, how will we experience a higher taste? All the emanation, all the tools, everything Prabhupada has given. If we don't use that, if we don't experience a higher taste,

**Key Quote:** "Necessity is the mother of invention."
**Summary:** The speaker shares a personal story about eating poorly cooked rice during a curfew to illustrate how necessity drives us to accept even unpleasant things when no better alternative exists, relating it to the need for a higher taste to avoid lower ones.

we will fall for lower taste. I remember when there was some curfew, I was studying, when I was doing my engineering, we were in the third year, sixth semester, and somehow there was curfew, and we were stuck in the hostel. It was a long curfew. And even the mess, the canteen, where the food was cooked, that was also shut down, and people had left. So few of us were there in the hostel, we cannot now take a bus and go back home. We were in the hostel. The mess is closed. And I clearly remember that day, not because we were fasting, sometimes we don't eat, not because food is not available, we choose not to eat. But that was a day, when morning to evening, we had no option to eat. There is nothing around, which you can eat. So it was four o'clock in the evening, although there was a curfew, we, friends, walked out of our room, went to nearby kiosk, where they used to make some tea, coffee and all that. And there was one small shop, it was closed, we somehow requested it, and got some rice. I can relate with what is hunger. It was four in the evening, not eaten since morning, maybe previous night also not eaten. Got some rice, there was nothing, no vegetable, no dal, no masala, this thing and all that. Came back to the room, and in hostel room, some of you may be able to relate with what I am saying, maybe times have changed. So we used to have those electric heaters, raw coils, and then some pan to boil water, or to make tea sometime. And in hostel typically, that pan is full black, because you don't wash it so often, or maybe you don't know how to wash it. So came back to the room, had never cooked rice, no idea how the rice is cooked, but circumstances of such you have to, necessity is the mother of invention. So put the rice, put the water, and put it on that heater. And slowly that water started boiling, and no idea how much it has to boil, how long it has to boil. And first time in my life, I saw black rice. We have heard of brown rice, red rice, I saw cooked black rice. And, couple of my friends, we had option either to throw it, visual thing was to throw it, but stomach was saying, no, eat it. And we ate it. I guarantee, if anybody were to see that rice, you will spit at the thought of eating it. But, if you have no option, you will eat it.

### Higher Taste, Sadhana, Addiction, Kali Yuga

**Key Quote:** "If you have no higher taste, if you are not relishing higher taste... then we will fall for lower rasas. And that is what Kali Yuga is. The higher taste is missing in people."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the importance of sadhana and relishing a higher taste to avoid addictions and the degraded state of Kali Yuga.

So same is the case with us, if you have no higher taste, if you are not relishing higher taste, if you are not chanting daily, regularly, Krishna also talks about how you can be like a lotus in a dirty pond, untouched by the dirt of the pond. So, Prabhupada has given us everything, the higher taste is there. Nice, wonderful kirtans, deities, we can come, we can spiritually rejuvenate, recharge. The temples are like oasis, it's like a desert, outside. Desert in the sense, although it may be raining, it may be, we may have green parks or something, we may have a little bit of material existence, we are parched, we are thirsty. Real pleasure is not there and we are hankering for that. So, if we have to, so it is, Prabhupada has given us the morning sadhana, raso varjam raso piyasya param drishtva nivartate. So, if we have that higher taste, on a daily basis, taking that medicine, chanting, reading, hearing, then we will not fall for the lower things. These days, lot of people are struggling with different kinds of addiction, alcohol, smoking, drinking, social media, smartphones, wrong sites, and people are also trying different things, how to come out of those addictions. There was an article called six human needs. There are needs, just like food, clothing, shelter, it's a need. Likewise, there are other needs. Needs for variety, needs for stability, needs for recreation. And if we don't get in a right way, the right quality of rasa, then we will fall for lower rasas. And that is what Kali Yuga is. The higher taste is missing in people.

**Key Quote:** "Unless our consciousness changes... we always think that if I achieve this, I will be happy."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that true happiness comes from a change in consciousness, not from external achievements or material possessions.

And that's why people are just helplessly falling for the lower tastes. So, we can always blame. People hope against hope, the new government will come, good days will come. Yesterday in the symposium, somebody was saying, how the campaign is made, political parties, they strategize. People believe, good days are coming, and they vote. Unless our consciousness changes, unless our... One thing is very clear, you all can relate with this, we always think, that if I achieve this, I will be happy. Small story, there was a person, a king living in a palace, but somehow he was not happy. Always, you know, sad, morose, even though he was living in a palace, had everything, all the opulence, all the luxuries, everything at his beck and call, but not happy. And whenever he would come on his balcony, he would see, he could see at a distance, there was one small hut, made of thatched roof. And, the person staying, that farmer, who was sitting, staying in that hut, whenever he would walk, he would just be fully, jubilant, smiling, happy, singing, dancing. So the king became jealous, became envious, what is this? I have everything, and I am not happy, this person is smiling.

**Key Quote:** "I have everything, and I am not happy, this person is smiling."
**Summary:** The speaker shares a story about a king who is envious of a happy farmer, despite the king's wealth, to illustrate that material possessions do not guarantee happiness.

This happened with me also. When I was, my father was in public sector, he used to live in a big bungalow. And, you know, everything was there, all facilities was there. Somehow, exam time, lot of stress, tension, anxiety. And there was one servant, servant quarter. He would be, coming and then, he would have a transistor, and he would put some film song, and he would, you know, smile and, I used to also feel, you know, he is smiling, he is happy, living in a servant quarter, living in a big bungalow. And same is the case with most of the people. Don't think Mukesh Ambani is fully happy. Although he may show. Same is the case with everyone. Because real happiness, is a different commodity. Money cannot buy that. Money is important for, money can buy us lot of goods, lot of materials, lot of things. But not necessarily, person who has money is happy. So this person would walk out of his house, and he was very happy, always singing, smiling. So the king became envious. So he asked his minister, how is it that I am not happy, I have everything, I am living in a palace, and this person has nothing. But he seems to be smiling. So the minister immediately looked at the king, looks like, he has not joined the 99 club. So the king had heard of Rotary club, Lions club, what is this 99 club? So he said, I will show you what is 99 club, and what it means to join 99 club. So then, this minister, took a bag of 99 gold coins, and one night, quietly went and placed this bag, outside the door of this hut.

So next morning, this farmer, he came out of the house, he saw something very unusual, just outside the door. He saw a bag, he became curious, he picked up the bag, he opened the bag, and he was delighted. 99, sorry, gold coins. He didn't know how many. So when you get something, some lottery, so curiosity is that, okay, how much? How much? So he started opening the bag, started counting the coins, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and the last coin, it was 99. So he said, something is wrong, one coin is missing. Generally, if you get a bundle of notes also, you know, it could be either 100. Many times, you don't even count, somebody says, 100 notes, bundle of 100, 100 notes. So he counted again, 1, 2, 3, 4, and the last coin he counted, 99. So he should be happy or sad? He became sad. Where is the 100th gold coin? Who took it? Where did it go? So then, he said, doesn't matter, maybe Lord wants me to work hard to get it. So till then, he had lived a very carefree life, happy go lucky, merry life. And then from that day onwards, he started working hard to earn enough money so that he can collect enough money, buy a gold coin and have the satisfaction and happiness that he has 100 gold coins. Earlier, he used to very leisurely come out of his house. Whatever time he would feel, he would work and then come back, relax. And then now, he would go out of his house early in the morning, 8 o'clock, work very hard, come back late, stressed, anxiety. And the king noticed that from his balcony. Suddenly, what has happened to him? There is no longer smile on his face. He is always stressed out, coming back late to his house. So minister, now he has joined the 99 club.

**Key Quote:** "We have 99 things in your life which are good to be grateful for... But we are crying, waiting for one thing to happen when we will be happy."
**Summary:** This segment explains the concept of the '99 club,' highlighting how we often focus on what we lack rather than being grateful for what we have, hindering our happiness.

So all of us can laugh but we are also part of this 99 club. What is 99 club? 99 club means you have 99 things to be happy. 99 things in your life which are good to be grateful for, to be happy, to be delighted, to be thankful, to thank Lord Krishna, you have given me so much. But we are crying, waiting for one thing to happen when we will be happy, when we will go back to Krishna and say thank you Krishna, you have given me so much. If that is our state, we will never be happy. And most of us are not grateful at times, even as devotees. Sulking, finding faults, criticizing, blaming, blaspheming. How will we experience higher taste? Higher taste is not just okay, chanting is very important, reading is very important, but what do we do the rest of our day? Are we always sulking, complaining, blaming, finding faults, cursing people, cursing others, cursing the environment, cursing the traffic? Or counting our blessings, Krishna you are so kind, Krishna you are so merciful, Prabhupada you have given me so much, you have given me the holy name, I am so rich, I am so fortunate, I have everything in this world.

**Key Quote:** "We should be contented with what we have and for the sake of doing good to others, we should have some goals."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of gratitude and contentment while also acknowledging the value of having goals for the benefit of others.

So it is very important that we count our blessings, we be grateful to Krishna for giving us so much. Yes, all of us may be lacking something, everyone will be lacking something, something may be missing, something, yes we may also have some goals, I want to achieve this, be this, do this, have this, that's okay, that's fine. We are not saying that life should be completely bland. Yes, we should be contented with what we have and for the sake of doing good to others, we should have some goals. Prabhupada also was very, had aspirations, there is nothing wrong in having aspirations, I have to distribute more books, reach out to more people, open more temples. But goals not because I am lacking something and with the hope, with the desire that one day when I have that, I will be happy. Then it's a rat race and there is no end to it. I remember when I was in 10th, my father used to tell me, if you get good marks in 10th, your life is done. Then you know, everyone is laughing because you have also heard from your parents. Then same thing repeated in 12th. By 12th, it was with more force beta. This is the time when you get in good engineering college, then better four years, five years, at least you will be an engineer.

**Key Quote:** "If you get good marks in 10th, your life is done."
**Summary:** The speaker shares personal anecdotes and references a book by an MIT professor to illustrate the 'rat race' mentality and how achieving external goals does not guarantee lasting happiness.

But after you get into engineering college, it's a rat race. Always, there is a book written by a professor in MIT who did his studies in MIT and later on he became a professor and he has written a book on happiness. And he says, when I went to MIT, I was very excited because it's the most elite college, the best of the students from all over the world. Getting into it is very, it's a very prestigious college. Some of you have heard of MIT. So he says, I was very happy. And when I took admission, all the students were so happy. You know, we had the welcome address and everyone was like, our life was done. In seven days, that happiness was gone. And then in that book, he shares the statistics. He says, about 30% students in MIT go through phases of depression. And some 8% of that amount, depressed students, get into such heavy depression that they even are not able to continue with their studies. And then he did research on the subject called happiness to find out why is it that people are not happy, even though they are in such prestigious college. All the people who would pass out from MIT would get, you know, the best of jobs and best of companies, earn the best of salaries, why are they not happy? Then he said, we are working with a paradigm that if I get this, I'll be happy. Just like if I get admission in MIT, I'll be happy. That happiness will last for a few days. If I get promotion, I'll be happy. If I get a child, I'll be happy. For a few days, you'll be happy. If I get a new car, I'll be happy. If I get a new bungalow, I'll be happy.

### Spiritual Happiness, Material Happiness, Higher Taste

**Key Quote:** "As a soul, atma, we are looking for a different happiness. We are Sat, Chit, Ananda. Constitutional happiness is a different commodity."
**Summary:** This segment distinguishes between material and spiritual happiness, emphasizing that true and lasting happiness comes from relishing a higher taste through spiritual practices.

But as a soul, atma, we are looking for a different happiness. We are Sat, Chit, Ananda. Constitutional happiness is a different commodity. That's why Prabhupada emphasizes spiritual happiness. Material happiness, spiritual happiness. Higher taste comes when we are relishing spiritual happiness. And when we relish spiritual happiness, we'll be able to give up material happiness. That's why many of us would have come across when we take up Krishna Consciousness, automatically our inclination for going for movies, going for some restaurants outside, it automatically goes down. So that professor, in that book he writes that how this paradigm is, if I get this, I'll be happy. If I get this, I'll be happy. Paradigm should be different. The paradigm should be that I already have so much. If I am not happy with whatever I have, 99 things which I have, what is the guarantee if I get the 100th thing, I'll be happy? So as devotees, we should always recognize that how much Prabhupada Krishna has given us, how much blessed we are, how much fortunate we are, what all we have. We have the highest game, Nama Chintamani, touchstone. If we are not happy, if we are not sad, the problem is with us, problem is with our thinking, problem is with our mindset.

**Summary:** This segment recaps the main points, emphasizing the need for devotees to protect themselves from Kali Yuga, cultivate a higher taste, and help others.

It's not with anyone else. So to recap, whatever we discussed, Kali Yuga, it's in full force. We as devotees have to protect ourselves. Prabhupada Krishna has given us lot of tools, lot of higher tastes, Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavatam. We have to do our sadhana nicely, protect ourselves, insulate ourselves, experience this higher taste and try our best to help others. That is what Prabhupada is expecting from us. That will make our human form of life successful.

### Kumbh Mela, Desires, Spiritual Aspirations

**Key Quote:** "Our Krishna conscious philosophy is not to be desire-less but right kind of desires."
**Summary:** This segment addresses a question about desires, clarifying that spiritual aspirations and bona fide desires are acceptable within Krishna consciousness.

We'll stop here. Anyone has any question, anything like to ask? One question probably we can. Hare Krishna Prabhu. For many years I had a desire that I should attend Kumbh Mela, like 99 club. Kumbh Mela? Kumbh Mela. Because my father was in a travelling job, he was, so he used to go, now called Prayagraj. So now when I come here, today I feel it's Kumbh Mela. The reason is that the Ganga of Harinam is flowing and the various sadhus of Hare Krishna movement are here due to the synopsis. So I feel that I have received my Kumbh Mela today here in spite of my being in 99 club. I'll get a curse of avoiding you of Kumbh Mela. So we have to understand 99 club thoroughly. You should not say I'll not go to Vrindavan because I got going to pilgrimage. Everything has a place, right? So we have to see it properly. We should aspire for the right things. We cannot be desire-less. The goal is not to be like a stone. Stone is very peaceful, very calm, no agitation, sitting in one place. But, we are not like stones. So our Krishna conscious philosophy is not to be, is to have desires but right kind of desires. So one may have a desire that I should go to Kumbh Mela and, you know, have, bathe in Ganges, associate with devotees. It can be a bona fide desire. May not be necessary because unless you go there, you will not be happy. Just we need variety. We need association of devotees. It's a human need also to travel. So little bit intelligently we have to see. Some desires are bona fide desires. Like Prabhupada, he had so many desires. Spiritual desires we can have. I want this. I want this temple to be built. So we have to little bit be careful. Sometimes we can think that any desire is wrong. We can have desire which can be which are authorized and which are bona fide. We'll stop here. Granth Rajshri Mat Bhagavatam

### Parikshit Maharaj, Srimad Bhagavatam, Religious Principles, Kali Yuga
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/RxWcBMs-zpY?t=0
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Srimad Bhagavatam is a ripened fruit of all Vedic literature."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam about King Parikshit's contemplation and discusses the importance of Srimad Bhagavatam as the essence of all scriptures, highlighting the six questions asked by the sages of Naimisharanya and the impact of Kali Yuga on religious principles.

om namo bhagavate vasudevaya Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, 1st Canto, 18th Chapter, Parikshit, Cursed by Brahmana by verse number 31. eshā kim nivṛtāśeṣā karano militekṣaṇā vruṣā samādhir ahosve kim no sthyākṣātra-bandhubhihi Translation and work part by His Divine Grace, Sri Bhaktivedanta Swamishila Prabhupāda. Translation Upon returning, he began to contemplate and argue with the both in himself whether the sage had actually been in meditation with the sense concentrated and eyes closed or whether he had just been feeing trance just to avoid receiving a lower kshatriya. Parapada A king being a devotee of the Lord did not approve of his own action and thus he began to wonder whether the sage was really in a trance or was just pretending in order to avoid receiving the king. He was a kshatriya and therefore lower in rank. Repentance comes in the mind of a good soul as soon as he commits something wrong. Srila Vishwanatha Chakravarti Thakura and Srila Jiva Goswami do not believe that the king's action was due to his past misdeeds. The arrangements were so made by the Lord just to call the king back to home, back to Godhead. According to Srila Vishwanatha Chakravarti, the plan was made by the will of the Lord and by the will of the Lord the situation of frustration was created. The plan was that for his so-called misdeed the king could be cursed by an inexperienced Brahmana boy infected by the influence of Kali and thus the king would leave his hearth and womb for good. His connection with Srila Shukadeva Goswami would enable the presentation of great Srimad Bhagavatam which is considered to be a book incarnation of the Lord. This book incarnation of the Lord gives much fascinating information of the transcendental pastime of the Lord like his Rasalila with the spiritual cowherd damsels of Rajabhumi. This specific pastime of the Lord has special significance because anyone who properly learns about this particular pastime of the Lord will certainly be desuited from mundane sex desire and be placed on the path of sublime devotional service to the Lord. The pure devotee's mundane frustration is meant to elevate the devotee to a higher transcendental position. By placing Arjuna and Pandavas in frustration due to the interview of their cousin brothers the prelude of battle of Urukshetra was created by the Lord. This was so incarnated the sound representation of the Lord Bhagavad Gita. So by placing Arjuna and Pandavas and by placing King Pariksit in an acquired position the incarnation of Srimad Bhagavatam was created by the will of the Lord. Being distressed by the hunger and thirst was only a show because King endured much even in the womb of his mother. He was never disturbed by the glaring heat of Brahmastra released by Ashwatthama. The King's distressed condition was certainly unprecedented. The devotee like Maharaj Pariksit are powerful enough to forbear such distress. Such distress by the will of the Lord and they are never disturbed. This situation in this case was therefore all planned by the Lord. Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta Karupada. Hare Krishna. Today's verse is a very very important verse especially those who are practicing Krishna Consciousness. Why and how we will see in this verse? Before that, this verse, before this verse, we know the previous verses. How and what position Pariksit Maharaj came and how he came in. Once Pariksit Maharaj was went to hunt and by the will of the Lord he became fully fatty and thirsty and he entered the Hermitage of King Shamikarushi. And usual general general etiquette or anyone guest comes to our house what we will do? We will give at least at least we will smile at them. Smile at them or give a glass of water or something like that. And also who is who is who is going to where? Is a King, Emperor of the world is going to Hermitage of a Shamikarushi and Rishi, Sage. But what happened is opposite happened there. Because he is unprecedented. That's why in the previous verse also if you see Prabhupada writes is unprecedented events. And as soon as the Pariksit Maharaj went there is no response and Sage was sitting silent in a meditation. And even Pariksit Maharaj is a great Emperor and he was a King. And more than that he was a devotee of the Lord. But situation was totally opposite. Then as as in the previous verses mentioned the will of the Lord the King Pariksit Maharaj become very angry. Very angry. Then what happened? He took a dead snake and put around his shoulder and he came out from the Hermitage. And while coming to his kingdom this happened in this verse is explained. What has happened is explained here. . . Upon returning he began to contemplate. He began to contemplate. That's why he said Prabhupada writes in the purport. The King that being a devotee of the Lord did not approve his own actions. Thus began to wonder whether the Sage was really trans or pretending to order to avoid receiving the King. The translation is saying upon returning he began to contemplate and argue within himself. He is arguing within himself. Whether the Sage had actually been a meditation with the sense concentrated and closed eyes or whether he had just been feeing pretending trans just to avoid receiving a lower Kshatriya. See there is a order lower Kshatriya. He is not saying I am the King. He is feeling a lower Kshatriya. Means Brahmanas are always highly respected. Brahmanas are always highly respected. That is our culture. But here there is a different situation happened. Let us hear. Srimad Bhagavatam is not ordinary literature. Srimad Bhagavatam is a ripened fruit of all Vedic literature. Essence Saram Saram all the Saras are explained in Srimad Bhagavatam. And everything is there in the Srimad Bhagavatam. Everything. Political, economical, social, moral, religious. Everything is there in this Bhagavatam. That is why Bhagavatam is a complete whole. That is why the six questions asked by sages of Naimisharanya in their turn there are six questions I in the previous in the Bhagavatam classes all of us heard the six questions. The first question in the first chapter the first canto 9th was what is the absolute and ultimate good for a people in general. Ultimate good there is no good more than this. That is ultimate good. That is the first question. The second question what is the essence of all scriptures not one scripture all scriptures and third one tell why Krishna the supreme personality of Godhead is appeared. And fourth one tell us the acts of Lord performing relationship creating a material world. And fifth one describe the activities of the incarnation of the Lord. And last question is very very important especially connected to today's verse. Where have religious principle gone after Krishna's disappearance from this planet? Where have religious principles we know religious principles means everyday worship the Lord. People like nowadays spirituality but they don't like religiosity. Why? Because religious means they have to follow some kind of procedures do's and don'ts and all those things. But religious is not like that explained by Srila Prabhupada especially in Srimad Bhagavatam. Religiosity, religion is a different meaning especially in Srimad Bhagavatam. That's why here if you understand this verse where have religious principle gone after Krishna's disappearance

### Devotional Service, Repentance, Three Modes of Material Nature, Lord's Plan

**Key Quote:** "Repentance comes in the mind of a good soul as soon as he commits something wrong."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of watching one's thoughts and actions while practicing Krishna consciousness, explaining that pure devotees are above the three modes of material nature and that repentance is a crucial tool for devotees who accidentally commit mistakes, referencing Prabhupada's teachings on the necessity of inner repentance for a Vaishnava.

from this planet. That is asked by sages of Naimisharan in a first canto first chapter 23rd verse. And answer this question Shukadeva, Suta Goswami answers this question in a first canto 3rd chapter 43rd verse. He says bruhi yegeshvare krishne brahmani dharma varnami swamkshata adunopeti dharmakam sharanam gatah It is mentioned since Shri Krishna, the absolute truth master of the mystic master has departed from this own abode, please tell us who is the religious principle has taken. Answer to this question krishne svadhamno bhagate dharmo jnanadivihi saha kalo nasta dharmashe purna krodhunavati vidhi The translation This Bhagavatam Purana is brilliant as a sun and it arises just after departed of Lord Krishna to his own abode. It is a brilliant sun. Brilliant sun means there is no darkness. Brilliant sun. Accompanied by religious not only religious Prabhupada translates knowledge, not only knowledge etc. etc. means morality. Prabhupada explains another place political. Person who has lost their vision due to the dense dark, dense darkness of ignorance is not only darkness, is a dense darkness of ignorance in the age of kali shall get light from this Purana. That's why Srimad Bhagavatam is various verse actually. That's why dharmo nirmastranam satham Bhagavatam begins verse like that. Because dharma, what is actual dharma explained in Srimad Bhagavatam. Here if you see in the verse what we are hearing, the sages came but he didn't respond. King went to hermitage of sage, he didn't respond. It is effect of kali yuga. Beginning of kali yuga. But in this kali yuga, the brilliant sun like Srimad Bhagavatam gives a knowledge and all the required facility one who is serious about spiritual life. That's why Srimad Bhagavatam is very very important. And especially in this verse, it is very very important for all of us to understand especially those who are practicing devotional service. It is mentioned here while returning he began to contemplate and argue with himself whether the sage has actually been meditation with the sense concentrated the eyes closed whether he had been feeing trance just to avoid receiving the kshatriya, lower kshatriya. As I mentioned, Srimad Bhagavatam gives a answers to all our questions with an examples. This is one of the most important examples because Srimad Bhagavatam begins begins with Parikshit Maharaj's past time. As a practitioner of Krishna consciousness we have to watch full of our thoughts. Not only thoughts, our actions also. Not like that, we are practicing Krishna consciousness, we can do whatever we like to do. No. We are above the modes, of all the material natures. No. Krishna says No. What is the last verse of 14th chapter? To get out from the three modes of material nature we have to do means pure unalloyed devotional service we have to do. Then only we can come out from the three modes of material nature. Otherwise, three modes of material nature is very difficult to overcome. That's why Krishna is saying, Daivyesha gunamai mamamaya duratya. It's a my maya. It is not ordinary person's maya. Mamamaya duratya. Maameva prapadyante maya metam tarantite. One who surrendered to Krishna he can be relieved from this three modes of material nature. But, the pure devotee of the Lord is not under the material nature. That is the meaning of pure devotee of the Lord. He is above the three modes of material nature. He will be doing a pure unalloyed devotional service of the Lord. But, Lord will take this pure devotees to teach general people like all of us. That is happening in this verse. In this verse. It is not like Pariksit Maharaj having misdeeds or previous karmas so that he has to suffer by cursing a takshaka word, takshaka snake bite and he will suffer and he will die within seven days. No. It is the will of the Lord. Lord will take this pure devotees for his mission. Like for example, all of us we know the Jaya Vijaya Narsimha Deva past time. It is not like that Jaya Vijaya's are envious of Sanak Kumar and all Kumaras. Not like that. It is a Lord's will. Lord having different plans. In that past time Lord want to fight. With whom he can fight? With ordinary people he can fight? No. He has to fight with whom? His own devotees. Not only his own devotees. Pure devotees. Not only his pure devotees. They should have a competition with Lord. Like Iranya Akshaya and Iranya Kashyapu they are fighting. When Iranya Kashyapu saw the Lord he is the right person to fight today. I didn't get till now right person to fight. See. They are fighting like anything. That is a Lord's plan. That is a Lord. That is why Lord is not ordinary personality. He is a supreme personality of Godhead. He will choose what he want to do. Krishna's material word will work. It is not like that Durga will work her own wills. No. She will work under the direction of Krishna. Everything is moving under the direction of Krishna. Wind blows by the fear of Krishna. And waves from the river stops because of fear of Krishna. That is why Krishna's activities, Krishna's will is not ordinary will. Ordinary will. And especially when he is enacting pastime with pure devotees not ordinary activities. That is why Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita janma karma jame divyam yomaveti tatvatah tektvadeham punajanmam naiti mameti savarjana. Janma and karma activities of Krishna and his devotees is not ordinary. It is a transcendental. It is a transcendental. One who understands this transcendental activities, tatvataha with the truth, then you will never return back to this material world. We have to understand Krishna's very tatvataha. In reality we have to understand. Reality we have to understand. And how reality we have to understand Krishna again explains in Srimad Bhagavad Gita 9th chapter. It is not like that simply by feeling, okay when we go in front of the devotees we will cry after that. Not like that. You have to understand Buddha and Bhava. We should have a feelings and we should have a should have a truth. In a truth we have to understand Krishna. That is why Srimad Bhagavatam is a very very important and especially Srimad Bhagavatam gives a direct answers and direct. Bhagavatam is full of questions and answers. Perfect questions and perfect answers. There is no some different questions and different. No. Perfect questions and perfect answers. And in the especially in this verse if you see the king being a devotee of the Lord did not approve his own actions. He could have thought what I did is correct. But he is thinking and he is contemplating, contemplating. Thus he began to wonder whether this sage is really meditation or he is to avoid this lower Kshatriya. Maybe he is in meditation. He is doing meditation. I disturb him. Or he is want to avoid this lower Kshatriya association. See this is a mood of a king because the king is a devotee of the Lord. Devotees never blame others. Devotees are very humble in nature. They will not expect. Always give respect. And have to think whether it is really mistake happened and what I can do. They will not blame. Even though sometimes past misdeeds also that's why Brahma says, tattenukampam supameekshamanam munjana evatmam kurtam vipakam Even the highest of the highest great calamities happens also will think it is my past misdeeds. It is not because of somebody else. He will not blame anyone else. He will always take responsibility. Because of my past misdeed it happened like this. This is one of the lesson we can learn from this verse. And second, because each and every word and sentence in the Bhagavatam is a lesson for all of us. You can see in this. This is the first line I read in the Parbat. And second. And especially Prabhupada articulate very nicely. And second line. The repentance comes into a mind of a good soul as soon as he commits something wrong. See. Repentance comes to in the mind of a good soul. It is very very important. Each and every word also you have to see. Repentance comes in the mind of a good soul as soon as he commits something wrong.

### Qualities of a Devotee, Krishna's Mercy, Ajamila's Story, Offenses to the Holy Name
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/RxWcBMs-zpY?t=1200
**Verse References:** SB 1.18.31
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Even devotees sometimes commit some sinful activities, either unknowingly or due to past behaviour, but if you sincerely repent, thinking I should not have done this, this Supreme Lord will excuse him."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the qualities of a devotee, emphasizing that elevated character and behavior please the Lord, and highlights the importance of genuine repentance for accidental sins, referencing the story of Ajamila and warning against intentionally committing sinful activities while expecting forgiveness due to chanting the Hare Krishna mantra.

Sometimes repentance. People will also repent. Repent or atone. Sometimes atone also. Some mistake happened I will do something so that I can atone. But that is one way level is correct. Prabhupada explain it. It is called Karmakandya process. But repentance is good for a devotees especially when he commits something wrong. Usually devotees will not do mistake. But accidentally it happens. You have to repent. Prabhupada one more place is explained. Repentance in the Back to Godhead magazine one place Prabhupada explains very nicely. Without Thapa or inner repentance the soul cannot leave as a Vaishnava. In the Back to Godhead magazine. Without Thapa and inner repentance the soul cannot leave as a Vaishnava. Without Thapa and whole process become useless. Without Thapa or heart being impure therefore good friends seek atonement without delay. Without repentance Vaishnava can't leave. That's why the repent is very very important tool for a devotee especially accidentally or sometime he commit a mistake. And one more place in a Srimad Bhagavatam Prabhupada says the devotees are naturally faultless. Accidentally sins committed by the devotee are sincerely regret. And by the grace of the Lord all sins unwillingly committed by the devotee are burnt to ashes in the fire of in the fire of repentance. See all the things will be pushed into fire and burnt into ashes in the fire of repentance. And this is the quality of one more quality of a devotee. There are different qualities. There are 26 qualities of a devotee. Just I like to read that 26 qualities. When Lord Vishnu appeared in front of Prithu Maharaj he glorifies the quality of Lord he glorifies the quality of Prithu Maharaj. Why he is glorified? He says the Lord Vishnu was very pleased with Maharaj Prithu and offered him a good character and behavior and offered him a benediction. The Lord openly says that performing a great sacrifice and undergoing austerity and mystic yoga practices cannot satisfy him. What satisfies the Lord? He is pleased only by elevated characters and behavior. But this cannot be developed unless one become a pure devotee of the Lord. Unalloyed, unflinching devotional service done to the Lord develops a good quality of a spirit soul. The spirit soul is a part and parcel of the Lord. That's what Krishna is saying. That's what Krishna is saying. That's what Prabhupada says. Repentance in the mind of a good soul. Actually soul is always good. Soul is not bad. Soul is a covered. It is like Prabhupada gave an example. It is a knife. Knife if you take it is a corroded, rusted. Knife is bad but when you do rusting if you remove then knife will work nicely. Like our soul also covered with a false ego, all these coverings. But we have to remove that contamination by practicing a unalloyed devotional service. Unalloyed devotional service. That unalloyed devotional service it is all explained in Srimad Bhagavatam through examples like Parikshit Maharaj. That's why Parikshit Maharaj's pastime is a will of the Lord to teach an example for all of us. And one more place in a Vaishnava bhajan because we are all Gaudiya Vaishnavas. One of our great Acharya named Narottama Das Thakur, he says very nicely ... ... ... ... ... Narottama Das Thakur saying repentance for having spoiled his human life and knowingly drunk a poison of material life. The purport is that one certainly becomes addicted to sinful activities when he becomes devoid of this good which is wife when he has lost his good sense does not take to Krishna Consciousness. If we are not taking Krishna Consciousness our good life will be spoiled. That's what Narottama Das Thakur says. That's why after coming to Krishna Consciousness you have to take it this process very seriously by accidentally if something mistake happened we have to repentance and when you do the repentance what will happen? Automatically all the sinful activities will go away. And the Bhakti Yoga is so powerful not only sinful activities are result of sinful activities will go away sinful tendency also burn away from our our mind. That is the power of devotional service. That's why Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's famous instruction very first instruction ... ... ... ... ... ... devotional service is so powerful. Where it is rain ... ... ... ... ... ... .... ... ... ... ... ... This Krishna is available to us very easily. How? Especially in this age of Kali Yuga. kalerdosha nithairajan asti ekamahaguna keetanadeva krishnasya muktasangaparamraje In this age of Kali Yuga, so much degraded age, and that Krishna was departed before in the Dwapar Yuga. But now also he is available. Why he is available? Because he knows Kali Yuga people are mandasumandamatyomandabagyaheupadrutaha They are very dull-headed people, unfortunate. And those people the Lord appeared in the form of Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare That's what also explained in Srimad Bhagavatam. Iti shodashakanama kalbhi kalmashanashanam nato paratranaya sarva vedeshu drishyate See, how important Srimad Bhagavatam. And after getting this solution, we should be very carefully receive and carefully practice this. But we commit offences while chanting holy name. Especially we will commit sinful activities or sometimes accidentally by strength of the holy name of the Lord. The sixth offence. Committing an offence at the holy name by committing a sinful activity. That is the most serious offence towards the holy name. Why? Why? Because we know holy name we have to chant very seriously and it will burn away all our sinful tendency. But again we will commit mistake. That's why Prabhupada explains. If ordinary people commit a mistake, government sometimes reduces the punishment and all those things. But any higher officer commit a mistake in a government, what will happen? Nowadays to what will happen all of us we know. Immediately will come eye lights, head lights, whatever lights. All lights will spotlight, brilliant lights will come on them. So much promotion, so much of this one will happen. Because they are in responsible position. They should not do mistake like that. They should not do mistake like that. They should not mistake like that. And after getting to know. Chanting Hare Krishna Mantra is highest of all the religious principles what we can practice. And you should not commit offences. Especially by taking a strength of this holy name. Then what will happen? It's a very grievous offence. That's why we should not commit offence by taking a strength. Okay, I will chant Hare Krishna Mantra and I will eradicate all my sinful activities. No, that is not good. We have to be conscious. We should not commit any offence. And by accidentally if we commit an offence. We have to repent and eradicate offence. That also Prabhupada explains. You have to genuinely you have to repent. Genuinely you have to repent. Even devotee. One more place Prabhupada says very nicely. In the story of Ajamila. Ajamila was a Brahmana. Such a Brahminical culture is born and bought up. But because of association he lost all his Brahminical quality. But he is so fortunate. He is so fortunate. He kept his youngest son name is Narayana. And he got a fortune. At the time of death. And here in the second chants. That is a Prabhupada titles. In the second chants. The chapter name is a story of a real death experience. In that one Prabhupada says. Even devotees sometimes commit some sinful activities. Either unknowingly or due to past behaviour. But if you sincerely repent.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's plan become very easy for us when we follow Krishna's orders."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that King Parikshit's actions were part of the Lord's plan to call him back to Godhead and that understanding these arrangements requires the guidance of acharyas, emphasizing the importance of surrendering to Krishna and following His orders to avoid frustration and receive His mercy, referencing the question asked by sages about where religious principles have taken shelter.

If sincerely repent. Thinking I should not have done this. But I am so sinful. I have again committing this. This Supreme Lord will excuse him. On the basis of genuine repentance. However if. Intentionally commit sinful activities. Expecting that the Lord will forgive him. Because he is chanting Hare Krishna mantra. That is inexcusable. See. It is inexcusable. That is why we should be very very careful. When you are chanting. Especially taking a stent of the Holy name of the Lord. And committing a mistake. Like this. There are so many things Prabhupada explained. How repentance is good for a devotee. To rectify our mistakes. Especially sinful activities. Unknowingly. Especially accidentally. We should not worry. That is what Krishna also explained. Srimad Bhagavatam. Apiche Sudhacharo Sadhurayavetaman. By accidentally. Accidentally if sometime we commit mistake. But he is properly situated. Lord will excuse him. Lord in the heart. Sitting in a. Devotee's heart. He will purify that person. We should not worry. But devotees should be very conscious. We should not commit. We should not do anything and everything. We should be very cautious. In our actions. That is why. Pariksit Maharaj was. What is. Pariksit Maharaj was. Thinking. Whether. This sages. Sorry. The sage was really. Meditation. Or pretending. Or. Is. Not. Don't want to receive. Lower. Rank. Kshatriya. See. He is a introspective. And he is a repentant. I should have not done. Putting a snake like this. Dead snake like this. This is one of the thing. We can learn. Should be introspective. And should be repentant. Of our. Bad activities. And second thing is. The third line. Sheela Vishwanatha. Chakravati. Thakur. And Sheela Jeeva Goswami. Do not believe. That. King's action. Was due to. Most. Fast. Misdeeds. The arrangement. Was so. Made by the Lord. Just to call a king. Back to home. Back to Godhead. See. This is another interesting point. Charge. Charge. Not. Home. Is. Surrounding. The third point. Krishna explained. Sheela Vishwanatha. Chakravati. And Sheela Goswami. Thakur. Thakur. The third point. Krishna explained. Sheela Vishwanatha. Chakravati. And Sheela Goswami. Thakur. The third point. Krishna explained. Sheela Vishwanatha. Chakravati. And Sheela Jeeva Goswami. Do not believe. King's action. Was due to. Past. Misdeeds. Arrangement. Was so. Made by the Lord. Just to call. arraignment by the Lord. And these things, the arraignments and the understandings, we can have only through Acharyas. Otherwise, we may also think, why these devotees also sometimes they will commit mistakes, especially pure devotees like Pariksit Maharaj. But this can be understood properly by the explanation of our previous Acharyas like Vishwanatha Chakravarti and Jiva Goswami. And according to Vishwanatha Chakravarti and Jiva Goswami, he says, in a Prabhupada purport, he says, the plan was made by the will of the Lord and will of the Lord, the situation of frustration was created. By the will of the Lord, the situation and frustration created in the Pariksit Maharaj. And the plan was that for his so-called misdeed, the king would be cursed by inexperienced brahmana boy. Infected by an influence of Kali. And thus, king would leave his heart home for a good, making possible the connection with the Srila Shukadeva Goswami. This connection would enable the presentation of great Srimad Bhagavatam, which is considered to be a book incarnation of the Lord. See, that question asked by sages, where religious principles has taken? And Krishna want to give answer and Krishna already planned. What is the plan? Okay. So, Krishna, he has already planned. What is the plan? He has already planned. He has already planned. What is the plan? He has already planned. He has already planned. He has already planned. He has already said, now Kali Yuga is starting. Dwapara is hinding. Krishna will plan. Then where this religious principle will take? Then Krishna had arrangements. That's why Krishna will do all arrangements for his devotees. And Krishna is always ready to, always ready to reclaim conditioned souls more eager than us. More eager than. That's why Prabhupada says, when you keep one step towards Krishna, Krishna will take how many steps? Thousand steps Krishna will take. And our steps is very small. And how much is Krishna's step? All of us we know Vamana Deva's incarnation. How much is Krishna's steps? One step will cover lower and one step will cover upper. That is Krishna's steps. And it will take thousand steps to show. Because if we keep all these things, because we are not Bali Maharaj to give that kind of shows. And Krishna will show His mercy as we surrender. That's why Krishna is saying in 4th chapter, etam am prapadyente tam stativa bhajamiham. As we surrender, I will reciprocate. If Bali Maharaj is fully atmani vedanam, fully surrendered, that's why He showed this much only covered. And that is Krishna's mercy. That's why Krishna's intervention if we want in our life, we have to fully surrender to Krishna. When you surrender to Krishna, Krishna will reciprocate. That's what Krishna is promising in Srimad Bhagavatam. Krishna is promising in Bhagavad Gita, don't worry, just surrender to me, I will take care. I will take care. Even Krishna is saying, even if you commit mistakes also, don't worry, you were properly situated, I will take care. Kshipram bhavati in the 9th chapter, that's why this 9th chapter of Bhagavad Gita is most confidential knowledge. It reveals all confidentiality in the 9th chapter of Bhagavad Gita. Most confidential knowledge. This verse Apiches Sudacharo, that also comes in 9th chapter. And Krishna is saying, satatam keetayanto mam etantashtra dhrdavata, that also comes in 9th chapter. And after that, kshipram bhavati dharmatma kshantim kshantim. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. So, Krishna is saying, yogakshema maha mahyananya canthayatho, ananya canthayatho, yogakshema maha, always think of me, I will take care of you. Who can give assurance like this? Only Krishna can give assurance like this. And to whom He can give assurance like this? Okay, if He gives also, how many people can practice like this? Those who are pure devotees of Krishna, that's why that chapter ends with, man manam adhbhakto, madhyaji mam namaskuru. For them only it will reveal, even though it is the most confidential, everyone knows 9th chapter is most confidential, but it will not reveal automatically to everyone. Only devotees of Lord Krishna like Arjuna, devotees of Lord Krishna like Arjuna can understand this. That's why, devotional service, Lord already ready to give devotional service. Lord already descended in the form of holy name, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare. Now, whose hand is there to receive Him? It is in our hand, our hand. That's why, we have to be very sincere, serious to receive Krishna. And when you receive Krishna, Krishna will take care all of this. That's why devotees' business is, how to receive Krishna, how to practice Krishna consciousness, Krishna will take care everything. That's why it is mentioned in the verse, the transcendental pastimes of Lord is revealed in the Srimad Bhagavatam, especially Rasalila. Why Rasalila is mentioned here? The gopis not bothered, my husband what he will think, my relatives what he will think. The midnight they left everything and came to dance with Krishna. Why? They know, only surrender to Krishna is a real, real protector. That we can't understand simply by, with our more mundane understanding. Only we have to understand through a Acharya's. That's why Acharya's explanations required. And Prabhupada is saying, just by hearing this pastime, the mundane sexism will be desuded, it will be rejected. We can't, we will not think about that. That is the power of Krishna's pastime. It will burn away all our so-called, not only sinful activities result, sinful tendency also go away from this. That's why this is a transcendental pastime of Krishna explained in Srimad Bhagavatam. And Srimad Bhagavatam not first only explains this, because we will not understand this. From first canto to ninth canto, very nicely explained. What is Krishna? Who is Krishna? What is his activities of Krishna? That's why the questions, if you see, where does the religious principle take shelter? Before that they ask one more intelligent. That's why the sages are not ordinary sages, they are introspective sages. They ask, why Krishna appeared? What is the ultimate goal? Explain the various incarnations of Krishna. Then he asks, where they have taken shelter? Because ultimately Bhagavatam explains where they take shelter and this is ultimately you have to understand. That's what is Srimad Bhagavatam. Bhagavatam is a so powerful literature. So powerful literature is a practical demonstration with examples. And one more place, next word. The book incarnation of the Lord gives a much fascinating information that I explained. The pure devotee's mundane frustration meant to elevate a devotee to a higher transcendental position. This is another thing we can learn from this verse. The pure devotee's mundane frustration is meant to elevate a devotee to a higher transcendental position. This is another thing we can learn from this verse. The pure devotee's mundane frustration is meant to elevate a devotee to a higher transcendental position. Like our Acharya, Srila Prabhupada, best example. How much struggle he did. He just simply took an Indigo or whatever airlines to go to America.

### Transcendental Pastimes, Srila Prabhupada's Example, Devotional Service, Krishna's Intervention
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/RxWcBMs-zpY?t=2400
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The pure devotee's mundane frustration is meant to elevate a devotee to a higher transcendental position."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, particularly Rasalila, and explains that hearing these pastimes can desuit mundane sex desires, highlighting Srila Prabhupada's example of facing difficulties to establish Krishna consciousness and emphasizing that Krishna uses His devotees as instruments to teach others how to practice devotional service.

No, now we are going to hear about Prabhupada. How much struggle Prabhupada took, with a 70 years old person. elderly person with two heart attacks, leaving a Rundavan in Dhamodari temple and going to for what? To get something from US? No, Prabhupada asked once, one rebutted, Swamiji, why you came to this US? Then Prabhupada said, what did Prabhupada say? Anyone knows? I came here, which you people don't have. That is Krishna Consciousness. And Prabhupada is not simply saying this one. Prabhupada is genuinely saying. That we can see in the song which we are going to sing in the few days, Barokrupa Gaila Krishna. In that one, Prabhupada writes, the translation is like this. The few lines of that verse is mentioned very nicely. Prabhupada said, My dear Lord Krishna, you are so kind upon this useless soul. Who is writing this? Prabhupada is writing. And what about our position? We don't know. My dear Lord Krishna, you are so kind upon this useless soul. But, I don't know why you have brought me here. I don't know why you have brought me here. You can do whatever you like with me. Whatever you like to do, marvabhi, rakvabhi, jyohicchathu mara. That is one of the Prabhupada's words. That is one of the Vaishnava's song. Narottam Das Thakur writes. And second, he says, but I guess, you have some business here. You have some plans here. You have some business here. Otherwise, why would you bring me to this terrible place? Ugrasthani. Anebe yene ugrasthani. Why you brought this plan? Even though I am useless, but you have some purpose, you brought me here. That is the Prabhupada's mode. That is the pure devotees' mode. That's why, to understand this. To understand Krishna's activities and Krishna's intervention in our life, we have to become a pure devotee of the Lord. Otherwise, it is not possible to understand Krishna's activities. And sometimes, we may think also, maybe these are all some stories. No, no, no. When you practice, when you chant Hare Krishna mantra, when you practice Krishna, we ourselves can see. Prabhupada gave example. When you eat food, in order to ask others, whether I am satisfied or not. You can tell this. You yourself can tell, I am satisfied, I am feeling, I am, get rid of angry, angry mood. You can say, that is the meaning of Bhakti Yoga. That is the meaning of Srimad Bhagavatam's essence. That is the thing. Like this, there are so many interesting topics we can understand from this verse. And one more place Prabhupada says very nicely, it says, one more place Prabhupada says. Then the next line. The pure devotee's mundane prestation meant to elevate a devotee to a higher transcendental position. I read this one. The Prabhupada's example, if you see, is so much difficulties. But after that, what Prabhupada achieved. He established 108 temples, 10,000 disciples, not only that time, now also it is going on. Because frustration meant to elevate a devotee in a highest transcendental position. By placing Arjuna, the Pandavas in frustration due to intrigue of their cousin brother, the Lord created a prelude of battle of Kurukshetra. He did this just to incarnate the sound representation of the Lord, that is, Srimad Bhagavad Gita. It is not like Arjuna is a foolish person. No, he is a very intelligent, he is a good Akesha, he is a conquered, he is a so elevated person. But Krishna put him in an illusion to get a Bhagavad Gita. For whom? For all of us. That's why Krishna takes his devotees as an instrument to teach a general mass of people, how to practice the Bhagavad Gita. It is a devotional service. Similarly, the placing King Pariksit in an awkward position, the Lord created the prelude incarnation of Srimad Bhagavatam. In the next point, King Pariksit being distressed by hunger and thirst, he was only a show, because the king is endued much worse even in the womb of his mother, where he was never disturbed by the glaring heat of the Brahmas released by Ashwatthama. Thus, as mentioned above, the king's distressed condition, was certainly unprecedented. All of us, some of us may be knowing or all of us may be knowing, how Pariksit Maharaj got a name Pariksit. How he got? When he is in the womb of mother Uttara, Ashwatthama released a very powerful weapon, Brahmastra. It is a glaring effulgent. Then finally, who protected? Krishna entered and protected. And that time Pariksit Maharaj saw. A person, one who is protecting. As soon as he took birth, he was searching, where is that person? I want to see that person. That's why his name is called Pariksit. And that distress he controlled. What is this small kind of hunger, thirst and all those things? It is simply a show. That's what Prabhupada was saying. It is simply a show. For what it is a show? Because the Srimad Bhagavatam has to come out from this. And Lord wants pariksit maharaj back to home back to godhead that is the purpose behind this that is the purpose behind this and also it is very nicely mentioned the devotees like maharaj pariksit are powerful enough to forbore such distress caused by the will of the lord thus they never disturbed they never disturbed this situation in this case was therefore all planned by the lord the devotees when they put especially pure devotees and they put in this condition distress condition and frustration they'll never get disturbed like prabhupada example so much but you will never disturb never disturb this example once one of our senior devotee was sharing in the bottom class also when prabhupada was traveling in a flight suddenly flight got little jerk and everyone is there stuck and devotee next to prabhupada saw what prabhupada what is the prabhupada action then prabhupada was nicely chanting hare krishna mantra why you have to worry i am complete surrender to you that is a quality of a pure devotee pure devotee like this there are a very nice interesting things we can learn shri mad bhagavatam especially shri mad bhagavatam perverts written by sheela prabhupada sheila prabhupada and one more place prabhupada writes a letter these letters are very powerful prabhupada is write many letters how we can get protection from the lord and how do we engage with this god in depend on the Lord, not only that, how do we inline our life in the plan of the Lord. One letter, one such letter, Prabhupada writes very nicely to his disciple, Mahatma Prabhu, is mentioned, so far you are thinking about things, making so many plans, that is alright. Making so many plans and thinking things is alright, but our first business is Krishna's plan. We may do so many plans, but what is our first business? But our first business is Krishna's plan. That is the only plan and no matter how many schemes we employ to adjust things in this material world, no matter, we can do so many aaj, paaj, all those things, but in this material world, if they have no solid basis in Krishna's plan, they remain merely a dream of pentasmagoria. See, Prabhupada writes letters in such a way that, and next line Prabhupada writes very nicely, so, in this Krishna conscious moment, I am trying, I am training boys and girls all over the world, how to act nicely by practicing serving Krishna in their everyday life, not one day or one time. Everyday life, and whom, boys and girls, everyone, everyone, that is a Krishna conscious moment for everyone, everyone, boys and girls, and next, that is the more important than trying for something which I may like to do, but which will never happen, we may have so many other plans, but we have to inline with Krishna's plan, then automatically everything will be taken care. Just like Prabhupada gave example also, in the letter Prabhupada. Prabhupada writes, just like Sudhama Vipra, he did not want to offer something very small, because he told small what is, we can offer small, but his wife insisted, so he offered Krishna only a small bowl of flat rice, chip rice, and Krishna took it with a great pleasure, with a great pleasure, and when Sudhama Vipra returned to home, to his poor hut, he found a huge palace made of jewels. So, he offered only a small bowl of chip rice, and Krishna took it with a great pleasure, with a great pleasure, and when Sudhama Vipra returned home to his poor hut, he found a huge palace made of jewels. So, the point is that, to make use of what we have, what already we have, that is the most important, and if Krishna sees that, if we are using properly for pleasing him

### Krishna's Plan, Following Krishna's Orders, Chanting Hare Krishna, Surrender and Prayer
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/RxWcBMs-zpY?t=3000
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** practical
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna's plan become very easy for us when we follow Krishna's orders."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of aligning with Krishna's plan, which involves chanting Hare Krishna, following the four regulative principles, and associating with devotees, explaining that Krishna understands our position and will help us if we put in the effort to achieve Him, and encouraging listeners to continuously pray for Krishna's guidance and intervention in their lives.

in a loving attitude, loving attitude of devotional service, then Krishna gives very, every facility in reciprocation of love, vocational love, so if you have talent for a musical achievement, that is nice, but if you have nourished some idea of becoming a famous player playing some music, that will become a source of frustration. If you have a plan to please Krishna, that is good, but I want to become a musician for my pleasure, what will happen? That will become a source of our frustration. Frustration, the end. So it is better if you play your music for Krishna, by having very ecstatic kirtans, in your center with a vancure and in this way i have introduced it all of the devotees and so general public as well as will be able to join together cooperatively in the glorification of the supreme personality of godhead not that we shall glorify anyone else let the materialistic operate in their own way but we have got a vaishnavism vaishnavism stand and we should train the general public to accept it and come up to a our platform our process of doing things not we should reduce to their standard see prabhupada is very strict acharya means stick the principles you never deviate you can and that principles also in line with the krishna's plan that's why whatever activity we do we have to in line with the krishna's plan but how do we know it is the krishna's plan and my plan one more later you prabhupada writes very nice he writes prabhupada writes a letter to a mahatma one more devotee jai dev prabhu jai dev prabhu he writes in a 1972 23rd july my dear jai dev please accept my blessings so and so i have noted the content krishna's plan become very easy for us when we follow krishna's orders how do you know krishna's plans when you follow krishna's order sometimes we plan but we don't we plan and others also can plan but difficulty comes when you do execution especially when the order krishna sold krishna said you have to surrender it's like order oh how do you surrender all those things but krishna is the supreme lord you can order and krishna is not only simply ordering he gave an example like a shimad bhagavatam he gave how to practice and how to surrender also he showed exam that's why krishna is a so merciful that's why we chant, E Krishna Karunasindhu Dhinabandhu Jagatpate. He is not ordinary person to give some order and leave. No, no, no. Or blame somebody. No, I told him but he didn't do. No, Krishna gives an order and everything you will plan for the devotees. But depends on your surrenderance. Etamam prapadyantam tam satyapadyantam. You will plan for all the devotees. And here it is mentioned, Prabhupada writes in the letter, Krishna's plan become very easy for us when we follow Krishna's orders. What is Krishna's order? Otherwise what will happen? Otherwise, we are following the Maya's plan and become frustrated at every step. If you are not following Krishna's plan, you have to follow Maya's plan. If you follow Maya's plan, what will happen? You will be always frustrated. Not only always frustrated, every step you will be frustrated. Following Krishna's order means, Prabhupada says, I mentioned in the previous letter, Prabhupada writes, everyday life you have to follow. And in this letter, Prabhupada writes, following Krishna's orders means, chanting daily 16 rounds, following the 4 regulations, 4 rules and regulations, rise early, associate with the devotees, like that. Unless these principles are followed, we cannot expect Krishna's protection. See, why is so important this chanting Hare Krishna mantra, especially 16 rounds, especially following 4 regulatory principles, especially associated with the devotees. These are the most important. Most important. Expect Krishna's protection. Krishna's protection. You should associate it with them, as much as possible. As much as possible. But, like a Sanatana Gosvami, keep your position. That is alright. But, utilize it to make spiritual progress. That is a real thing! Not for satisfying my anchoring and desires. Hope you meet with good health. See, Prabhupada writes. Krishna's plan means, we have to keep our program very consistent. lands, ratings, ratings, that is important. You should avoid Wall Street Scratches. над Krishna's plan means, we have to follow the Krishna's order. What is Krishna's order? Chanting Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, 16 rounds. Oh, we may think, oh, today onwards if I am not chanting 16 rounds, then no protection. No. Krishna understands our position. Krishna understands. Okay. Like, what is Krishna? How Krishna will understand? Krishna demonstrates his proper rights. Okay. Whatever your position, that's what Prabhupada is saying. Whatever you are in a, whatever position you are there, that position you, whatever you have, you offer. Like Prabhupada gave example in Sudhama. You don't have anything. He has only small chipped rice, that is all, flagged rice, that also he was reluctant to give. Who told? His wife told. Please go and offer with love and devotion. And Krishna, what he gave? Palace, all those things he gave. And we can, and we can also hanker like this. Like that? Yes, we can hanker like that also. But Krishna is only, that much only limited? No. What Krishna wants to give? Krishna want to give his love of God. Krishna want to give himself. For that, we have to be pure devotee of the Lord. But we should not worry, oh, I am not pure devotee, what can I do? No. Whatever position we are there, we can offer. Krishna will help. That's why Prabhupada says, God help, those who help themselves. If you are chanting one round, okay. Next, tomorrow I will chant two rounds. If you are chanting two rounds, I will chant four rounds. Then Krishna will help us. God helps those who help themselves. That's why Krishna's protection always will be there. But put an endeavour to achieve Krishna. That is required. That is required. That's why Rupa Goswami says, Ekala laulyam tatra maulyam. Only your eagerness to achieve Krishna, that is required. That's all. Nothing else. You have to put that endeavour. Whatever you are there, put that much effort. Krishna will understand this. Krishna will understand. He will give you necessary intelligence. All the things Krishna will give. But our endeavour should not be stopped. We have to always continuously endeavour. Sometime while chanting, as we discussed, chanting time also, we will have some difficulties to chant and all those things. But we can pray to Krishna. Krishna, this is my position. Please help me. That's what our chanting Hare Krishna mantra. Please engage me in your service. I am engaged in Maya service. Please engage me in your service. Continuously, genuinely pray for Krishna. Then all our sinful tendencies, everything will burn as repentance. As we discussed, the fire of repentance will burn and we become a pure devotee and the guidance of a pure devotee. And we have so many instructions given by Srila Prabhupada. Just you have to follow. Just you have to follow Prabhupada's instruction, chanting Hare Krishna mantra, follow the four glider principle, just coming to temple, take prasadam and our process is… Our penance is very simple. In order to do, climb big big mountains, fasting and all, our fasting is… After immediately fasting, feasting. See, it is very simple. See, feasting. And our program, our morning program, dance, everyday dancing. Not like that when you are at home, no, everyday dancing, everyday, every, every, every, Prabhupada says, if you are ready, you can give, everyday you can celebrate festivals, but we are not ready. Everyday we can celebrate festivals. And we have such a nice literature to read, Srimad Bhagavatam, we have such a nice association of devotees, all our acharyas are exalted devotees, so much literature to read, so many festivals. We have so much of pilgrimage we can go. What else we want? Everything is there in Krishna consciousness. Only we have to show our interest, then Krishna will give all the facilities. That's why we have to surrender to Krishna and pray to the Krishna, Krishna, today onwards at least I am yours. Please help me to take your intervention in my life. Then Krishna definitely give, definitely intervene in everyone's life. Because Krishna's business is only that. That's all. That's all. He said, how to recline this country. That's why Krishna is making so many arrangements for all of us. Temples, he sends a pure devotee, he sends a holy rivers, he sends a literature. Everything Krishna is giving, for us. Because Krishna is so much compassionate. That's why, as I mentioned, He Krishna Karunasvindu Dheenabandhu Jagatpate, Gopeshagopitam Radhakanta Namostute. And that pastimes are explained in Srimad Bhagavatam. And that's why Pariksit Maharaj was never disturbed. It's Krishna's plan. But is there any mistake? from my side? Whether the sage is pretending or is not ready to receive, what is my mistake from my side? That's why the devotee will think, I should not commit any mistakes. Whether if I commit mistake also, I have to repent. And after that what he did? Pariksit Maharaj not simply went to emperor, okay what to do? No. After that he consulted the sages, now within 7 days I am going to die, what shall I do? He associated the devotees. Then he got a finally association of Srila Shukadeva Goswami and a great retreat like Sriman Bhagavatam. Not only he received the mercy, he distributing mercy to all of us in the form of Sriman Bhagavatam through Srila Prabhupada.

Suta Goswami explained in the second chapter, savipumsan parodharmo eto bhaktir hadokshajai hayato ki aprateta eyaatma supraseedati The ultimate religious principle for all humanity is by which one can render unalloyed devotional service unto Krishna, that devotional service, should be rendered without any motivation, without any interruption. One cannot engage in the devotional service expecting something in return. We cannot do some business with the Lord. That becomes desire, motive. I want some fruit in return. I am engaged in devotional service, therefore I want something in return. That is not called pure devotional service.

**Summary:** This segment narrates the events following the Mahabharata war, focusing on Ashwatthama's revenge and the release of the Brahmastra.

During the Mahabharata war, both Pandavas and Gauravas fought for 18 days. At the end of, almost at the end of 18 days, all people are killed, except few people. From Pandava side, five Pandavas and their sons, five sons, Krishna and Satyaki. From Gaurava sides, Ashrathama, Kripacharya and Krithavarma. Except these people, everyone was killed. So at the 18th day of war, under the direction of Lord Krishna, Bhima broke the thigh of Duryodhana by unfair means. Because he hit on the thigh. Actually, according to the warrior's code, one should not hit anyone below the waist. But he cannot be killed by any other means. Therefore, Krishna told, should kill him by unfair means. Therefore, under the direction of Krishna, Bhima broke the thigh of Duryodhana. Duryodhana fell down and he was writhing in pain. That time, Ashrathama came and saw the precarious condition of his master, Duryodhana. And he heard from Duryodhana that he was beaten by Bhima by unfair means. After hearing this, Ashrathama became very much angry. Then he decided to put an end to Pandava dynasty. Then, thereafter, with help of Krithavarma and Krishapacharya, went to the camp of Pandava in the middle of the night. And he massacred the five sleeping sons of Draupadi. After that, he took the heads and went in the presence to his master in order to please Duryodhana. But Duryodhana was not pleased by seeing the killing of five sons of Draupadi. When Draupadi came to know, when she heard that her sons were massacred by, killed by, murdered by Ashrathama, she became very much afflicted. And she was overwhelmed with anxiety. And she was, she began to cry. And her eyes were full of tears. When Arjuna saw his wife, Draupadi was crying. Then he came and said, said, my dear Draupadi, please don't worry, don't cry. I'll go and cut the head off of that Ashrathama and bring and give it to you. After that, you can burn the bodies of your sons and take your bath standing on the head of Ashrathama. After saying this, Arjuna and Krishna set out to follow Ashrathama. Then they are going with great speed to chase, chase Ashrathama. When Ashrathama saw that Krishna and Arjuna were coming at a great speed, and he started going little more further. But by the will of providence, his horses were tired. It could not go further. So he saw that his life is in danger now. Immediately, because he does not, he didn't know anything to do. Because of, his life was in danger. Therefore, he had a weapon, ultimate weapon named Brahmastra. Then, he had to release the weapon to protect himself. But he did not know how to retract the weapon. So, as soon as he released the weapon, Brahmastra, fire started blowing everywhere. It was so fierce that Arjuna thought even his life was in danger. Immediately, he took shelter of Krishna. He asked Krishna, My dear Krishna, how is this danger effulgence spreading all around? Where does it come from? I do not understand. Please let me know. After hearing from Arjuna, Krishna said, My dear Arjuna, this is the act of Ashwatthama. Because his life was in danger, he helplessly released his weapon, Brahmastra, to protect himself.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, only another Brahmastra can counteract this weapon."
**Summary:** This segment describes Arjuna's response to Ashwatthama's Brahmastra and introduces the concept of cosmic annihilation.

But he did not know how to retract the weapon. Therefore, only another Brahmastra can counteract this weapon. Since you are very expert in military science, you can use your weapon to subdue this weapon. After hearing this, Arjuna circumambulated Supreme Lord and he released his own weapon, Brahmastra, to counteract Ashwatthama, Brahmastra. When the two Brahmastras joined, extreme heat produced. It was so fierce, it covered entire universe, all planets. Then all the population of the entire three worlds was scorched by the excessivity of this combined weapons of Brahmastra, combined Brahmastra. Then everyone thought our life is finished. Everyone was reminded of Brahmastra. The Samvartaka fire which takes place at the time of cosmic annihilation. Because they thought our life is finished, over. So, Prabhupada says, what is this annihilation? The heat produced by this Brahmastra resembles the fire exhibited in the sun globe at the time of cosmic annihilation. In Bhagavatam, it is described there are four kinds of annihilation. One is called Naimithika. Second is called Prakthika. And third is called Athyantika. And the fourth one is called constant annihilation.

**Key Quote:** "At the end of the lifespan of Brahma, one annihilation happens. That is called cosmic annihilation."
**Summary:** This segment explains the four types of annihilation described in the Bhagavatam.

Naimithika means occasional annihilation. Brahma, Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, we call Brahma as just, as infinite as the Vedic With that we are called Brahma. That is called Kappa. One Yuga consists of Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dwapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga. Put together, 43,20,000 Lakhs which are one day of Brahma. That means 432 crores of years is one day time of Brahma. That is called Kalpa. Kalpa means Lord Brahma creates the living entities. The day time of Brahma is called Kalpa. And Vikalpa, creation of Lord Brahma, that is called Vikalpa. And Mahakalpa, creation of all the material elements along with Lord Brahma, that is called Mahakalpa. So, during the night of Brahma, so this is the day time of Brahma's 432 crores of years and the same as the night time, 12 hours, 12 hours. So, during the day time of Brahma, one annulation happens. That is called occasional annulation. Occasional annulation. During this annulation, all the three planets meet with destruction. All the living entities enters into the body of Lord Narayana. Even Lord Brahma also goes to the body of Narayana. He sleeps there. When he wakes up, he comes out of the body of Narayana and all the living entities will come out and accept according to the different desire, accept different bodies according to the past desires in the previous night of Lord Brahma, previous day of Lord Brahma. This is called one annulation. And second is called total annulation. Total material annulation. That happens at the life time of Brahma. One day of Brahma is 864 crores of years. One life time of Brahma is like that Brahma will live 100 years. That means 864 crores multiply into 30, multiply into 12, multiply into 100. So, put together, Brahma will live for 3.11 trillion years. years, not million, not billion, trillion years. That is the lifespan of Brahma. At the end of the lifespan of Brahma, one annihilation happens. That is called cosmic annihilation. This is what is mentioned here, that annihilation. Cosmic annihilation. Then one more annihilation called Athyantika. A person, when he understands, when he attains the transcendental knowledge, he knows, he distinguishes between the relative truth from the absolute truth. He understands that I am not this body. I am the part and parcel of the supreme person that I have guarded. Therefore, he engages in devotional service and gives up this body. That giving up the body is called Athyantika. That means final annihilation. Annihilation of this material body. This is third annihilation. And fourth annihilation, at every moment, time, invariably transforms the body of all created beings. Krishna also says in Bhagavad Gita, Dei nosmini etade, kaumaram yavanam jara, tada tehyantra praptir, dheras tatra namu yati. The soul passes from youth, childhood to youth, youth to old age. Similarly, it passes at death and enters into another body. How? Because the time changes our body. What body we had yesterday, we don't have the same body now. What body we will have tomorrow, that is different. So time, invariably, transforms all the created bodies of this material world. This causes, this transformation causes the living entity, takes birth, and, again dies. Constant annihilation of birth and death. This is the fourth annihilation.

**Key Quote:** "Hearing about the Supreme Lord is the only right medicine for the conditioned souls to get cured from all material diseases"
**Summary:** This segment details the process of cosmic annihilation, including the drought, fire, wind, and rain, and the merging of elements.

So to get out of this all annihilation, what one should do, Sw tych Goswami says, one should hear the nectarian pastimes of Lord Krishna, submissively. That is the only suitable boat to cross over the ocean of material existence. Submission to the Lord Buddha, which is the only suitable boat to cross over the ocean The cosmic annulation, second annulation in detail. At the end of Brahma, as annulation approaches, there will be no rain at all. Therefore, there will be completely drought which takes place. Because of drought, there will be no food grain. Because of that, people will starve to death. And they will not have anything to eat. Father will kill son and eat because there is no food. And son will kill father and eat. Like that, people will eat one another. Gradually, the population will become nil. And after this, the sun in its annihilating form drinks all water from the ocean and from the living entities. Our bodies also contain some water. So, the son will take away all the water from the bodies and take away water from the earth. Its' completely dry. Because of that, sun will illuminate such a huge heat. And after this, there will be a fire from the mouth of ananta at the bottom of the universe. Due to the fire of ananta, the whole universe will burn, from the top blazing sun's, from the bottom. Due to the fire of ananta, the whole universe will burn, from the top blazing sun's, from the bottom. from the bottom, the fire of Ananta Deva. Because of the combined fire, the universal shell will burn like a ball of cow dung. It will grow like a burning of cow dung. After this, there will be heavy wind. It will take place for 100 years. Then after that, there will be heavy rain for 100 years. Due to this heavy rain, the whole shell of universe will be filled with water. Will be filled with water. Then after that, as this water is filled in the universe, the earth, deprived of its quality of fragrance, it merges with water. And the water, deprived of its quality of taste, merges with fire. Fire, it doesn't degrades the quality of form. It merges with air. Air will merge with ether. Ether will merge with false ego. False ego will merge with Ma Tattva. Ma Tattva will merge with the Supreme Lord, Ma Vishnu. This is the way that cosmic annihilation occurs. So at the time of cosmic annihilation, all the material elements and Lord Brahma, even as everything goes to the Lord Brahma, everything goes to the Lord Brahma. Everything goes to the body of Ma Vishnu. When Ma Vishnu breathes out, all the universe comes out from the body of Ma Vishnu. When breathes in, all the universe goes inside

the body of Ma Vishnu. Just when we breathe out, breathe in, how much time it takes? Maybe 3 seconds or 4 seconds or 5 seconds. So the breathe out and the breathe in time of Lord Ma Vishnu is equal to 3.11 trillion years. That is the lifespan of Brahma. Compared to eternal life, that is very, very insignificant. Just like we keep on breathe out, breathe in. It's very, very insignificant. Compared to eternal life, this 3.11 trillion years of Brahma is very, very insignificant. This is the one annihilation, cosmic annihilation. So next, Prabhupada says, The energy produced by Brahmastra is very, very insignificant compared to the energy produced by Brahmastra. Because these atomic weapons can destroy at most one city or one country or some portion of the world. But it cannot destroy everything. Whereas the Brahmastra can destroy the entire universe. So Prabhupada compares between Brahmastra and the modern atomic bomb and the Brahmastra of The golden days. 희 And Britain and France want to take revenge against Germany. Therefore, they attacked Germany. Then Hitler took the support of Japan and other countries to attack them. Then France and Britain took the support of the US and other countries. Hitler is the cause of the Second World War. It happened for six complete years. From 1939 to 1945. Because of the war, millions of people were killed. Millions of people were killed. And so many buildings were damaged. And although the President of America warned Japan to surrender, they did not surrender. They wanted to capture power. They had a lot of power at that time. Military power. A lot of military strength. Therefore, they were re-puffed up. They did not want to surrender. Then the American President gave the order to finish Japan. After receiving the order, they dropped one atomic bomb.

**Key Quote:** "Demons engage in Mugra Karma that is meant to destroy the world."
**Summary:** This segment criticizes the development of nuclear weapons and describes the punishment for leaders who harm innocent people.

So, Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, The demons, those who have no knowledge about God, they do not understand that God is in control. They take shelter of false conclusion. And who have lost themselves and who have no intelligence. They engage in horrible things. They engage in horrible, unbeneficial work. Meant to destroy the world. Demons engage in Mugra Karma. That is meant to destroy the world. So, today, we are all proud of nuclear weapons. As soon as one country manufactures some nuclear weapons, they will go and test. As soon as it is successfully fired out, then they think our mission is successful. And we are proud of inventing nuclear weapons. But at any time, the war can take place. Just like Hitler, one person caused the world war. Similarly, at any moment, because of false ego of one person, one president, the world war can take place and it will give, it will create total havoc in the world. So, the invention of nuclear weapons are not meant to give peace and prosperity to the world. But to give disturbance and destruction to the world. This bombs which were put by Americans, it killed so many innocent people. A king, it is said in the Bhagavatam, a king or administrative head or the president or prime minister of the country, if they kill an innocent person or if they give a punishment to a Brahmana, unnecessarily, they will be taken to the hell. By the Yamutadas. The hell called Shukramukha. In that hell, what they will do? The Yamutadas take the king and put inside the rollers. Put inside the, just like a sugarcane will put on the rollers. It will skews. Juice will come out. And that sugarcane will come out. Similarly, the person who kills an innocent person. It will be put inside the rollers and will make him complete chutney. And the body will come out and again they will put. Like that, because the person will not die. The person will not die. Although they give severe punishment, the person will not die at all. They will feel the pain severely, but they will not die. So, again and again, they will take and put. This is the result of punishing a faultless person.

**Summary:** This segment explains the king's responsibility to ensure religious principles are followed and how they share in the karma of their citizens.

It is said in the Manu Samhita, There are people in the country. The people, sometimes they may engage in pious activity or impious activities. King will share one-sixth. King will get one-sixth share of either pious activity or impious activities. He will get one-sixth share. In this world, more or less, all people will perform sinful activity. Therefore, king will get one-sixth share. Just like in the country, suppose 1200 murders happens in a year. So, the prime minister or head of state will get the reaction of 200 murders. Although, he might have not done. Because people, when they do, he will get the reaction. This is very very responsible post. Nowadays, people do not know. Even there are so many rapes happens. So many things, people loot many things. King will get or the prime minister or chief minister will get one-sixth share of this reaction. At the same time, suppose he sees the people are chanting Hare Krishna Mantra. 12000 people are chanting Hare Krishna Mantra. 16 rounds in the country. He will get the benefit of. He will get the benefit of 2000 people chanting Hare Krishna Mantra. That means, 2000 into 16 rounds, how many rounds? That many. 32000 rounds. Benefit, he will get, although he does not chant. So, this is the duty of king to see that people are engaged in religious principles. They are devoted to the Lord. Nowadays, people, they do not see. They always engaged in great karma activities. Therefore, all of them are assured to go Shukram Ka. To become chutney.

### Brahmastra, living entities on other planets, soul's qualities

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "The soul is unbreakable, insoluble, it cannot be burnt, it cannot be dried."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the effects of the Brahmastra on other planets and argues that life exists throughout the universe, citing the qualities of the soul.

And second Prabhupada says, in the second point. This heat produced by the Brahmastra, it created severe impact on all other planets. Everyone was scorched by excessive heat. They felt excessive heat. Who will feel the excessive heat only? Living entities can feel. Here Prabhupada says, in other planet. There are full of living entities. Whereas, the less intelligent people think. There are no living entities in other planets. Only earth has got living entities. It is repeated in Bhagavad Gita. Krishna says, in Bhagavad Gita, about the qualities of soul. achyedyayum, adhayayum, akhileshiyo, shyoshyayavacha nityasarvagatastanur, acaloyam, sanantana The soul is unbreakable. Insoluble. It cannot be burnt. It cannot be dried. The soul is eternal. Sarvagata. All pervading. Soul present everywhere. Soul present everywhere. It is unchangeable. Eternally the same. Here, Krishna uses the word Sarvagata. Sarvagata means, the living entities spread all over the creation of the Lord. Therefore to say, there are no living entities in other planets. In other planet is completely wrong. People nowadays, modern scientists or people those who are interested in creating, inventing something new thing. They want to see what is going on in other planet. Therefore, they send people. They are trying to send people to moon planet. They could not achieve any success. They brought some dust finally. By spending millions of dollar. Now they are spending much more. Millions of dollar to go to Mars planet. To bring more dust. Because we don't have any dust. So, people unnecessarily, they engaged in trying to find something. Here from Bhagavatam, Bhagavad Gita, we can clearly see that every planet has got full of living entities. This body is made of earth, water, fire, air, ether. Our bodies are predominantly made of earth. The living entities which live in the water, made of, predominantly made of water. So, similarly there are birds. Predominantly made of air. So, living entities living on the land, in the earth, in the water, in the air. Why not in the fire? Because they have got the body, suitable body to live in the fire. So, to say there is no living entity in the sun planet is wrong. Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita. 4th chapter. In the beginning, I spoke this science of self realization to sun god Vivasvan. Krishna cannot speak to some in person. When we speak, we have to speak to person. I can't speak to wall. Krishna spoke this instruction to sun god Vivasvan. When the king is there, naturally, people also will be there. So, to say there are no living entities in the sun planet is wrong. Otherwise, Krishna would not have said this. He would not have said in Bhagavad Gita, Sarvagata. The living entities are not there in other planets, the word becomes meaningless. Sarvagata means living entities present everywhere. The people, those who are less intelligent, they do not understand that there are living entities even on other planets.

**Key Quote:** "Without his will or sanction, nothing can be built up or destroyed."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that the Lord's will is supreme and discusses the five factors necessary for completing an action, highlighting the importance of devotional service.

So, in the next point Prabhupada says, The atomic energy is not powerful enough to destroy the world. And secondly, ultimately, it all rests on the supreme will of the supreme lord. Because without his will or sanction, nothing can be built up or destroyed. Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, There are five causes to complete an action. Five factors to be considered. To complete or perform an action. Arjuna, it is said in the Vedanta, there are five causes to accomplish an action. They are, Adhishtanam, the body. Kartha, the doer or performer. Karanam, the senses. Cheshta, endeavor. Daivam, the supreme will of the supreme lord. That is, will of the super soul within our heart. The body is meant to... The Adhishtanam is the body. And Kartha means the doer or the soul. The soul performs an activity that brings reaction. The soul, as God desire, therefore, it wants to perform an activity. When we perform some activity, naturally we get the reaction of the activity. And how to perform the activity? The soul uses the senses. Without senses, we cannot perform an activity. Even senses are used for that we should put an endeavor. Unless we put an endeavor, we cannot accomplish an action. Just like when we do a business, we should put an endeavor. Not just simply sit and roam and sleep. We should put an endeavor to complete the activity. Even though we may put an effort, still we may not be successful. Why? The supreme will of the lord is important. If the lord does not will, we may not attain success. Therefore, the will of... We should always depend upon the will of the lord. Those who are in Krishna consciousness, even though they perform activity, they do not get any reaction for the activity. Because they act under the direction of Krishna. Just like a military man. He kills the people in the battle. But he does not get any reaction. Rather, he is awarded. Rather, he is awarded. He is recognized by government. Why? Because he did the activity under the direction of his authority. Similarly, if we perform an activity in devotional service under the direction of Krishna, we will not get any reaction. Rather, we will be recognized by the supreme lord. After that, we will go back home, back to Godhead. Because we follow the authority of Krishna. We follow the supreme authority. Therefore, we should always depend upon the will of the lord.

**Key Quote:** "If one is a devotee of the Lord, if he depends on the Lord in every respect, if he depends on Lord Vishnu in every respect, for him, opulence, victory, peace of mind, all are guaranteed."
**Summary:** This segment narrates the conversation between Prithrasura and Indra, emphasizing the importance of depending on the Lord and how He sometimes removes opulence to encourage devotion.

Depend on the mercy of the lord. In this context, I would like to narrate the conversation happened between Prithrasura and Indra. Indra, he accepted Vishwaroopa as his spiritual master, because he lost his kingdom. Demons came and took away his kingdom. Therefore, he accepted Vishwaroopa. With the help of Vishwaroopa, he got back his kingdom. And after that, Indra killed Vishwaroopa. Because Vishwaroopa was inclined towards even demons. Therefore, he does not want to lose position. Again, demon can come and take away the kingdom. Therefore, he killed Vishwaroopa. Vishwaroopa's father, Veshtha, performed some sacrifice. He wanted to produce a son by which he can kill Indra. Because when he was chanting a mantra wrongly, wrong pronunciation, instead of the son will begat to kill Indra, he will be killed by Indra. Because he chanted, pronounced little wrong, wrongly. Therefore, he got the opposite result. Prithrasura was born. Then he wanted to take revenge against Indra. Because he killed his brother. So, both of them were fighting. That time, Prithrasura said to Indra, O Indra, if one is a devotee of the Lord, if he depends on the Lord in every respect, if he depends on Lord Vishnu in every respect, for him, opulence, victory, peace of mind, all are guaranteed. All are guaranteed. Sanjaya also says in Bhagavad Gita, Yatra Yogeshwara Krishna, Yatra Partho Dhanurdhara, Tatrasir Vijayabhoothir, Dhruvanithir Mathir Mama. Wherever Krishna is there, opulence, victory is certain. So, the same thing, Prithrasura said to Indra, whoever depends on Lord Krishna, in every respect, he will attain everything. For such a person, has nothing to worry in this world. He can get everything. But Lord Krishna is so kind to such a devotee, he will not give any opulence. He will take away the opulence from the devotee. Because that opulence gives an amper to his devotional service. Therefore, Lord takes away the opulence of the devotees, and leaving like a beggar.

**Key Quote:** "If at all I favour anyone, especially favour to anyone, first of all, I will take away all his riches, and make him beggar."
**Summary:** This segment explains how Krishna favors devotees by taking away their riches to increase their dependence on Him, using the example of Vrithasura.

So, once Krishna said to Yudhishthira Maharaj, same thing, yasyam anugrunaami harishye tadhanu shanahi, tadodhanum tyacinti yasya svajana dukkha dukkhidam. Krishna said to Yudhishthira, my dear Yudhishthira, if at all I favour anyone, especially favour to anyone, first of all, I will take away all his riches, and make him beggar. So that his wife, his children will kick him out. Thereafter, he will suffer misery after misery. When somebody is in misery, they will always depend on Krishna. Somebody gets some opulence, they will forget Lord. Therefore, Krishna makes sure that, that devotee should always depend on me. Suppose some devotees, even though they are rich, they still can remember Krishna, just like a Sudama. Krishna awarded full riches to Sudama, much more than Indra. But still, Sudama did not forget Krishna. Our case is different. If Krishna awards all riches, we will completely forget Krishna. Therefore, Krishna will not give any riches. Even if you want to become rich, we will put an end to that. Krishna will make sure that, that will not be successful. Because Krishna wants us back home, back to Godhead. He does not want to leave us here, to suffer in this material world. So, this is one point. So, Vrithu also said, Indra, I want to give up everything. I wish to give up everything for the service of the Supreme Lord. I don't want anything in this material world. I want to completely get detached from family, wife, children, society. Relatives. I want to make friendship with only devotees. See the demons. Although he was born as a demon, because he exhibited the quality of pure devotee. He said, Indra, I don't want to go to heavenly planets. I don't have any desire to go to heavenly planets. Nor I have a desire to go to Droloka. Nor I have a desire to go to Brahmaloka. I don't want even liberation. Nor do I aspire to have an unconquerable position, unconquerable position in this world, to rule the people. I don't want anything. Simply I want to engage in the service of the Lord. And he indirectly said, Indra, actually you are fool number one. Because Lord sided with you to defeat me. Lord sided with you to defeat me. Actually, I am not at all defeated. Although I know, I will be killed in this battlefield. But still, after this body, immediately I will go back home, back to Godhead. And I will enjoy. Whereas you suffer. Whereas you suffer in this material world. Overperforms Tabasya, you will get BP. And you will get lot of disease. You have to suffer. Not me. See, the Vrithasura had complete dependence on Lord. Even though, see, killing on the battlefield, particularly getting defeat on the battlefield, somebody will feel worried. But Vrithasura was completely happy. Because he knows, whatever Lord does, it is a benefit for me. Good for me. He is assured of going back home, back to Godhead. Although Indra killed him, practically he was defeated. In one sense. But still, it is Vrithasura who won. Because he went back home, back to Godhead, even in the same life. So, the will of Lord is important.

### material nature's law, Lord's supervision, Jayadratha
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/Jsn6hYxnR3c?t=2857

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The material nature is working under my direction, producing all moving and non-moving beings."
**Summary:** This segment explains that material nature works under the Lord's supervision and introduces the story of Jayadratha.

Therefore, we should always depend on the will of Lord. One more point, Prabhupada says here, material nature's law, works under the direction of Lord. As confirmed in the Bhagavad Gita. The Lord says there, that natural laws work under His supervision. The world can be destroyed only by His will, of the Lord. And not by the whims of tiny politicians. Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, mayadakshinaprakati soyate sacharacharam hetunane kaunteya jagadvipari vartade The material, he says to Arjuna, Arjuna, this material nature is working under my direction. Producing all moving and non-moving beings. Under its rule, this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again. Although Lord creates everything, still, He is aloof from all the material activities. He does not do any activity. He is aloof from all the material activity. He is just only a director. He does not get involved in work. But his activities are conducted by the modes of material nature. Just like a CMD of the organization, personally, does not get involved in work, per se. But he gives direction to his subordinates, directors. In turn, they give direction to managers, supervisors. So, they work. Similarly, Krishna does not do any activities personally. Simply enjoys with his devotees. He gives direction to demigods. They act under the direction of Krishna. They do not act independently. Demigods do not act independently. But they act under the direction of Krishna. Krishna sometimes, personally, controls the material nature. Just for the sake of devotees. In this context, I would like to narrate a small story in Mahabharata. It may take 5 to 10 minutes. Once Jayadratha, Jayadratha was the husband of Dushala. Dhrithastha had 100 sons. One daughter, Dushala. She got married to Jayadratha. Jayadratha was going to meet Shalva to get his daughter married.

**Summary:** This segment narrates the story of Jayadratha abducting Draupadi and the Pandavas' pursuit.

That time, Pandavas were in exile in one vana, one forest. So, he was going. And he saw the cottage. He saw Draupadi standing in the cottage, in his house. When he saw the beauty of Draupadi, he was completely captivated by the beauty of, splendorous beauty of Draupadi. Immediately, he told his friend, Kotika, my dear friend, you please go and find out who she is. This Kotika came and asked Draupadi, so, I am so and so, I have been sent by, I have been sent by Jayadratha. So, she told, she replied, responded to his question. Actually, I am not supposed to speak to anyone, anyone other than my husband. Still, I will answer your question. Then she told, I am daughter of Draupada. I got married to five sons of Pandavas. They have gone out. Please wait for some time. They will return and they will receive nicely. This person went and told Draupada, sorry, Jayadratha, so and so. Then Jayadratha came and when he saw the beauty, again, some more he want to carry away her, because so beautiful Draupadi was. Then he said, Draupadi, why you are suffering so much in this forest? Better, you marry me. You come with me. You can enjoy royal opulence. Surrounded by so many mates, why you are suffering here? Your husbands are beggars. Husbands are beggars. An intelligent woman follows her husband in prosperity. When he is rich, woman follows. He is giving, who Jayadratha is telling to Draupadi. Intelligent woman follows her husband in prosperity. And he rejects him. And she rejects him in adversity. Whenever husband is, means he doesn't have any money, wife will reject. That is intelligent woman. Therefore you be intelligent. You come with me. You can enjoy with me. These people are beggars. What enjoyment you can get? As soon as she heard this statement from Jayadratha, she was shocked and said, you rascal, shut your mouth and get lost from here. Then Jayadratha became very angry. Then he forcibly caught hold of Draupadi and put on his chariot and started taking to his capital. When he was taking, Yudhishthira was little far away. He was in the forest. And he saw some birds, animals are agitated. And they started moving here and there. So he could understand there is some calamity. Therefore Pandava was immediately rushed to the cottage. When they saw, Draupadi was not there. They were informed by housemaid that Jayadratha came and forcibly took away Draupadi. He has gone this direction. Please go and immediately catch him. So he went this way. And he started catching. So Pandavas immediately followed the same direction to catch Jayadratha. So he had some army also. So Pandavas saw and killed all the people. So when Jayadratha saw that all his army was completely vanquished, he put Draupadi down and started escaping. Because somehow he wanted to save his life. So when Bhima saw this, Draupadi was there. And he told Yudhishthira, Yudhishthira, you take Draupadi home. I will go wherever he goes. I will finish him today. Even if he goes to heavenly palace, I will not leave him. Today is finished. So then Yudhishthira said, No, no, please don't do this. Because he is Gandhari's son-in-law. Our sister's husband. If you kill him, Mother Gandhari will lament. Therefore please don't kill him.

**Summary:** This segment describes Jayadratha's humiliation, his tapasya to please Lord Shiva, and Dronacharya's formation of the Chakraviya.

But still Arjuna and Bhima followed Jayadratha. At last Bhima went and caught Jayadratha. He gave a nice beating. He was about to kill. That time Arjuna said, See, do you remember what Yudhishthira said? Please don't kill him. Then he has to follow his brother's word also. He took a knife and shaved his head here and there. Shaving the head here and there, left some hair here and some portion shaved. That is as good as killing. In the Shastra, shaving the head of the person here and there is as good as killing. After shaving the head, he tied him nicely like an animal and brought him to the cottage of Pandavas and left to Yudhishthira and Draupadi. If at all you are interested to lead life, want to be alive, then you declare yourself as a slave of Yudhishthira. Then you leave. Immediately when Yudhishthira saw this Jayadrila was bound by like an animal, he told Bhima, let him free. So then he removed all the ropes. Then Yudhishthira instructed, My dear Jayadrila, please don't do this kind of activities and all. No, you please go anywhere as you wish. So he let him free. Then Jayadrila was completely humiliated. He put his head down in shame. Then he went to forest to perform tapasya. So he performed severe tapasya to please Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva was pleased. Then Lord Shiva asked, My dear Jayadrila, I am very much pleased with your tapasya. Please ask any benediction. Then Jayadrila asked, I want to defeat all the Pandavas one day in the battlefield. Lord Shiva said, It's impossible. Because Krishna is there. As long as Krishna is there, nobody can defeat Pandavas. However, I will give one benediction. That you can defeat the Pandavas except Arjuna in the crucial time of war. So he gave this benediction to Jayadrila and went. So in the Mahabharata war, thirteenth day of war, so Bhishma fell down. Arjuna started massacring all the Gauravariyas. When Duryodhana saw this, all the soldiers who had sacrificed everything for his sake were mercilessly killed by Arjuna. Pandavas. Therefore he went and told Dronacharya, My dear Dronacharya, see you are very very lenient. You don't want to fight wholeheartedly with Pandavas. Because of your lenience in the battle, all my people are killed. It was like insulting for Dronacharya. Because he is trying to find fault in the loyalty of Dronacharya. Then Dronacharya said to Duryodhana, Duryodhana you are actually you are insulting me. I am doing my duty properly. But you are not understanding. As long as Krishna is there, nobody can defeat. This is the law. Still, however, today I will kill one of the leading warriors in the battlefield. Provided, if you take away Arjuna from my presence. So next day, just another three, four minutes I will take. Okay? So next day, Dronacharya formed circular formation. Chakraviya. Chakra-Yuha. So, Duryodhana directed some people to take away Arjuna from the battlefield. So Arjuna was taken away. Rest of the Pandavas were there. Yudhishtha, Bhima, Nakula, Sahadeva, all people. Arjuna was not there. He created Chakraviya. Chakra-Yuha.

Dronacharya. This Chakraviya, only four people can penetrate. One is Krishna. They know how to penetrate. Go inside. By Krishna, his son Pradyumna, Arjuna, and Abhimanyu. Nobody knows. None of the Pandavas knows except Arjuna and Abhimanyu. So, Yudhishtha and all Pandavas tried to enter. Tried to penetrate. But Drona just drove them away. All the people came back. Then immediately, Yudhishtha went and asked Abhimanyu. My dear Abhimanyu, only you know how to penetrate. Please, go. We'll follow you. Don't worry. He said, my dear uncle, I know only how to go inside. I don't know how to come out. If I, something happens, some danger happens, I don't know how to come out. He said, don't worry. We'll follow you. Then, Abhimanyu went inside and started creating heavy damage to the Kaurava warriors. He killed so many people. By seeing the superhuman feet of Abhimanyu, the warriors, their hair stand on the head. By seeing the superhuman feet of Abhimanyu, all the people started running here and there. That time, they were following, Pandavas were following. That time, Jayatra came in front of all Pandavas. He did not let them allow. Because he got the boon to defeat. So, he took the chance to defeat all the people. Abhimanyu went inside and he was caught inside. All the great people joined together killed Abhimanyu. Although, sunset happened already. Because after sunset, nobody can kill. They should stop the war. But, Abhimanyu was killed after sunset. All the people, Dronacharya, Kripacharya, Ashwathama, many people, Karna, everyone. So, when Arjuna heard this, that his son is killed, then, all the Pandavas said, Jayatrita is the cause for your son's death. Then, he took the bow. Tomorrow, by sunset, I'll kill Jayatrita. If I do not fulfill my vow, then, I'll enter fire. I'll commit suicide. Then, after that, next day, so, Jayatrita heard this. That Arjuna took the bow. That, I'll be finished today.

**Key Quote:** "As we surrender to Lord, Lord will also reciprocate."
**Summary:** This segment describes how Krishna uses his mystic power to protect Arjuna and ensure Jayadratha's death, emphasizing the importance of surrender to the Lord and following the instructions of the guru.

Then, immediately, went and told Duryodhana. Today, I'll go home. You take care of your fight. I'll not fight. Because, if I'm there, I'm finished today. Duryodhana said, no, no, don't worry. Because, big, big people, you don't come in the front. Far away, 100 miles far away, be there. Arjuna cannot come at all. Certainly, he has to commit suicide today. So, they were overjoyed by hearing this. Bow took by Arjuna. So, next day, then, Arjuna started fighting, fighting, fighting. Time was almost come. Son was about set. Still, he was far away. Then, Krishna thought, how to protect my devotees. Then, Krishna used his mystic power to kill Arjuna. So, as soon as son was set, all the people became, all the Gauravas became overjoyed. Today, Arjuna is finished. He has to commit suicide by entering fire. That time, he was off-guarded. Who? Jayatrada put his weapon and came out. And, thinking that, I'm saved, Arjuna is finished. Immediately, Krishna removed his mystic power. Son is there. Arjuna cut the head of Jayatrada. So, Arjuna used his Pashupada weapon which was given by Lord Shiva. Before releasing weapon, Krishna said, the birth of Jayatrada. When he was born, the voice from the sky said to his father, your son will be glorious. He will bring glorious to your dynasty. However, in the battle field, one hero will cut off the head of your son. After hearing this, the father of Jayatrada called on Arjuna to kill his son. Then, he told, whoever causes my son's head to fall down on the earth, his head will burst into 100 pieces. This, he told, who? Krishna told Arjuna, you should cut off the head and the head should go to his father's lap. Because, his father was performing evening prayer, offering near to that area. One lake was there. There, he was sitting and performing evening prayer. He told, use your celestial weapon, you cut the head of Jayatrada and the head should go and fall on the father's lap. So, exactly, Arjuna released his weapon, his arrow, cut the head and immediately sent numerous arrows. That arrows carried the head of Jayatrada and put on the lap of father. He was closing his eyes and praying. Suddenly, something fell. He got up. So, the head fall from the head of Jayatrada fell on the ground. Immediately, as soon as fell on the ground, his head burst into 100 pieces. So, Krishna always hankering to save his devotees. He personally controls the loss of nature to protect his devotees. It is called Bhaktavatsala. He does not care for any other thing. The conclusion here is, under the will of Lord, everything happens. The so-called leaders neither they can create nor destroy it. If at all it has to be destroyed, it should be sanctioned by the will of the Lord. Lord gives protection according to one's surrender. Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, As we surrender to Lord, Lord will also reciprocate. Similarly, if we sincerely follow the instruction of our Guru, chanting six notes, getting up early in the morning, attending reading, hearing, spreading the Holy Name, if we sincerely follow the instruction of Lord, sorry, spiritual master Prabhupada, Krishna is certainly bound to give protection from all sides. And later, Krishna will take us back home, back to Godhead. That is the will. He is always ready to give protection to his devotees. That is the purport of this verse. Thus ends this Bhagavad Gita.

**Key Quote:** "So the nature of Kali Yuga is, the Kali Yuga is even famous as the age of quarrel."
**Summary:** The speaker transitions to discussing current events, specifically a cricket tournament controversy, to illustrate the quarrelsome nature of Kali Yuga and how it manifests at various levels of society.

So the last week, one of the important news has been that the next year in 2025, early 2025, there is going to be a world's cricket tournament, Champions Trophy, ICC Champions Trophy, which is supposed to be hosted by Pakistan and to be played in Pakistan. So India has raised objections that they don't want to send their team to Pakistan due to security reasons and also due to the tensions, political tension, which is existing between, prevailing between the two countries. And Pakistan is adamant, they want the tournament to happen there only and they are demanding. They are demanding ICC, that it should go on whether they come or don't come, whether India participates or not participates. But if India does not participate, then there will be a huge revenue loss because everyone, India is the most populated country in the world and has the most crazy cricket fans, everyone wants to watch Indian team. If India doesn't play, the viewership goes down. So ICC is in trouble. So why I am sharing this is because we can see there is this fight happening at an international level between nations. So the nature of Kali Yuga is, the Kali Yuga is even famous as the age of quarrel. So there exists fight at so many levels on Kali Yuga, between persons to persons, society. Society to society, community to community, and even nation, state to state. We also know how here, Kannada, we have to, Kannadigas want people to talk Kannada. Others don't want, they don't want to learn Kannada, so there is tension. And nation to nation, as we have seen here. And therefore, it is so difficult, for people to live together, even within a family, you know, or for friends, and for communities, to live together,

accepting each other's differences and to stay without fighting is such a difficult thing.

And based on these principles of Srimad Bhagavatam, Srimad Bhagavatam, based on these principles of Srimad Bhagavatam, only Srila Prabhupada started the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. It is an international society, coming together of the devotee people from all parts of the world, all race, caste, creed, religion, colour, coming together for the purpose of Krishna Consciousness and staying together. So, it is also said, It's also said ISKCON is also famously it is coined that Srila Prabhupada built ISKCON

**Key Quote:** "The international society for Krishna consciousness has been organized for this purpose."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the purpose of ISKCON, citing a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam, emphasizing the importance of devotee association for understanding the Lord and His devotees.

when Srila Prabhupada built a house in which the whole world can live. So Prabhupada in fact defines the purpose of starting ISKCON. Why did he start ISKCON? It is mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam 4th Canto 12th Chapter 48. In the context of Drona Maharaj and Drona Maharaj's character and activities. In the end of that narration where Maitreya Rishi is narrating this. He says, Prabhupada says in the purport. It is said that only in the association of devotees can one understand the importance of the character. And pastimes of the supreme personality of Godhead or his devotees. It is especially recommended that Drona Maharaj's character be discussed in a society of the twice born. Which refers to the qualified Brahmanas, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas. One should especially seek the society of Brahmanas who are elevated to the position of Vaishnavas. Thus discussion. The discussion of Srimad Bhagavatam which describes the character and pastimes of devotees and the Lord is very quickly effective. Then Prabhupada states the purpose. The international society for Krishna consciousness has been organized for this purpose. What is that purpose? In every center of this society, not only in the morning, evening or noon. But practically 24 hours a day. There is continuous devotional service going on. Anyone who comes into contact with the society automatically becomes a devotee.

**Key Quote:** "Anyone can join the international society for Krishna consciousness and be initiated to become twice born."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the opportunity for anyone to join ISKCON, become initiated, and be considered twice-born, emphasizing that advancement in devotional service is only possible in the association of devotees.

We have actual experience that many Karmis and others come to the society. And find a very pleasing and peaceful atmosphere in the temples of ISKCON. In this verse. The word Dvijanmanam means one of the twice born. Anyone can join the international society for Krishna consciousness. And be initiated to become twice born. So Prabhupada opened up this opportunity for all of us. For anyone who agrees to practice the principles of Krishna consciousness. And be in the association of devotees. To become initiated and to become twice born. And that is the purpose of ISKCON. So therefore we see in the association of devotees. One can stay together despite the nature of Kali Yuga which is full of quarrel and fight. So it is possible to mature in devotional service only in the association of devotees. Therefore there is one more statement of Srila Prabhupada where Prabhupada says. That if one thinks that one can advance in devotional service or Krishna consciousness. By practicing alone. One is living in hallucination. To think that I can advance by myself living alone. I don't need any association of devotees. That means hallucination. It's only imagination.

### devotee association, imperfection, ISKCON as a hospital

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "ISKCON is a hospital."
**Summary:** The speaker acknowledges that friction and disagreements are natural when living with others, even in ISKCON, and uses the analogy of ISKCON being a hospital for those who recognize their spiritual disease.

It is possible only in living in association of devotees. But then when we live with some devotees. When we live or when we stay with different people. It is natural that there will be some kind of friction. Some kind of disagreement. Some kind of you know fault from one person to other person. And there can be kind of disturbance between each other. So it is common. Even in the society of so called devotees. Even within ISKCON. It happened. Once one devotee came to Srila Prabhupada. And told Prabhupada that I want to leave this movement. I want to leave the association of devotees. So Prabhupada was very surprised. He was very distressed. He asked why? What happened? Why do you want to leave? So he said. This devotee. He said this to me. That devotee he is so harsh. So cruel. This devotee she is so mean. How can devotees behave like this? That's why I don't want to stay with them. Then Srila Prabhupada said. Who is devotee in ISKCON now? Only one devotee is there me. All of you have just shaven up. Wearing robes. Wearing tilak, kanti mala. And acting like devotees. So actually you are trying to be devotees. So you are not actually devotees. You are trying to be devotees. And therefore when we are practicing devotees. When we are sadhakas. It is natural that we are not perfect. We are all patients. ISKCON is a hospital.

### spiritual disease, treatment, devotional service, blazing fire

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Those who don't come to ISKCON, they don't know that they are deceased."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the hospital analogy, explaining that those who come to ISKCON are aware of their spiritual disease and are seeking treatment, and that devotional service makes the material world appear full of pleasure.

The difference between those who come to ISKCON and those who don't come to ISKCON is They don't know that they are deceased. Those who don't come. Those who are coming regularly. And practicing everything. They know we have got the disease. So we are taking treatment from the doctor. And then Those who are little seriously infected. They will get admitted also. Like we are all admitted. Full time. Even more means intensive care. ICU. So actually we are all practitioners. People make mistake generally. When they see devotees, kanti mala, tilak. This thing they think that Oh he is sadhu. He is perfect. Sadhu bhushana. Sadhu means reservoir of all good qualities. It is true. It should be like that. But We are not pure. We are practicing. We are becoming pure. So therefore Prabhupada writes further in one more Srimad Bhagavatam purport about this. In the same context of Dhruva Maharaj's Leela Prabhupada says. Anyamadi philosopher may question us. You may be very happy in the association of devotees but what is your plan for crossing the ocean of material existence? Dhruva Maharaj's answer is that it is not very difficult. He clearly says that this ocean can be crossed very easily if one simply becomes mad to hear the glories of the lord. For anyone who consistently engages in hearing the topics of the lord from Srimad Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavatam and Chaitanya Charita Amrita and who is actually addicted to this process just as one becomes addicted to intoxicants it is very easy to cross the nescience of material existence. The ocean of material nescience is compared to a blazing fire. Samsara Dhabanala. But to a devotee this blazing fire is insignificant because he is completely absorbed in devotional service. Although the material world is blazing fire, to a devotee it appears full of pleasure. Vishwampurna Sukhayate.

### devotional service, material and spiritual world, mango analogy

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "By devotional service one is elevated to transcendental planet Goloka and Dhavan and also there, there is only devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotional service is the same in both the material and spiritual worlds, using the analogy of an unripe and ripe mango to illustrate the difference in relishability.

So the purport of this statement by Dhruva Maharaj is that devotional service in the association of devotees is the cause of the development of further devotional service. By devotional service one is elevated to transcendental planet Goloka and Dhavan and also there, there is only devotional service. So for the devotee both in the material and spiritual world is the same. There also devotional service, here also devotional service. Devotional service does not change but the devotee changes, the devotee improves. Prabhupada gives wonderful example here in the purport. The example of mango can be given here. If one gets an unripe mango, it is still a mango. And when it is ripe it remains the same mango. But it has become more tasteful and relishable. When the mango becomes ripe it will be sweet, delicious, tasteful, relishable. Similarly, there is devotional service performed according to the directions of the spiritual master and injunctions and regulative principles of Shastra. That is Vaidhi Bhakti or Sadhana Bhakti. And there is devotional service in the spiritual world rendered directly in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But they are both the same. There is no change. The difference is that one stage is unripe the other stage is ripe and more relishable.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, it is possible to mature in devotional service only in the association of devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of devotee association for maturing in devotional service, comparing devotees to unripe mangoes that may taste sour but can grow together in ISKCON.

Therefore, it is possible to mature in devotional service only in the association of devotees. It is said that only in the association of devotees one can understand the importance of the character and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or his devotees. So, therefore we are all unripe mangoes. So, we are all devotees but not pure devotees. We are in the process of becoming pure devotees. As long as we are following the instructions of the spiritual master, following the rules and regulations and trying to advance then we are in the path to become ripened. So, this is important. So, while we are in the path of becoming pure devotees there will be in the unripe stage there will be if you pluck an unripe stage if you taste an unripe mango what will happen? It will appear sour. Therefore, our relationships among devotees sometimes may appear sour. You are trying to bite an unripe mango. So, it will be sour. So, therefore we have to be careful and that is also one of the reason why Srila Prabhupada created ISKCON so that even unripe stage even the devotees in unripe stage, mangoes in unripe stage also can differentiate together

**Key Quote:** "All devotees dark ugly put together nice rubbing and after that shiny diamond like pure devotees will come that is the formula of getting together devotees in ISKCON"
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of diamonds being polished through friction to illustrate how devotees, through association and interaction, can become more refined and pure.

so that together they can grow. One more example one devotee gave me one senior devotee was giving that the association of devotees living in association of devotees or being together in association of devotees practicing devotees, sadhakas not even pure devotees under the instruction of pure devotees staying with sadhakas it is like this. You know how diamonds diamonds get that shine and glow and you know so sparkling and diamonds are liked by everyone right? Especially for jewellery and this thing so much they make. So, how does it come? It is nothing but carbon charcoal, coal is also carbon diamond also is carbon coal is black, ugly not so good. Diamond is shiny, sparkling how it is possible when it is extracted from the underground it is not really that sparkling shining diamond it becomes how it becomes like that they crush, they cut and after that they put in one machine all the diamonds cut diamonds together they will put in a machine and in very high speed this machine is rotated and what happens? One diamond to another diamond it rubs friction and by that friction all the edges, rough edges everything get cut together and then it becomes smooth and shiny and then after some time of rubbing it will become when it is taken out each diamond would have become shiny similarly all devotees dark ugly put together nice rubbing and after that shiny diamond like pure devotees will come that is the formula of getting together devotees in ISKCON

so therefore when we are in association of devotees, devotees should be we should all learn to become little tolerant to each other so one more Draupad gives very wonderful explanation about this in a Bhagavad Gita lecture given in early days of ISKCON January 3rd 1967 in New York Bhagavad Gita 10th chapter 4th shloka Prabhupada gives this lecture in fact when I joined ISKCON full time as a Brahmachari way back in 2009 just before joining at that time we had Satyagorachandra Prabhu who was the temple commander here he was ashram head now he is in the Andhra Pradesh and Hyderabad he is a governing body member and president of Hyderabad so at that time very senior devotee very nice very sweet devotee so he told us told us bhaktas he told us when you go inside ashram when you join you will have so many devotees because I was coming from a very different background I was coming from home I had not lived any hostel any community I was living with my family my father mother and my sister that's all small family never lived in a bigger community now I am going to enter into community society of devotees so how to take it so Prabhu said as soon as you go inside when you enter ashram entrance just before you go to prasadam hall near the staircase there is one big quote Prabhu had nicely made that and got it put there for all devotees to read when passing by even daily this was that quote this is from the Bhagavad Gita 10.4 lecture so big laminated quote was there and he said if you read this understand this and internalize it and start living like that then your life in ashram will be very smooth

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 100-0 principle, encouraging devotees to give 100% in relationships and expect nothing in return, using the example of saying Hare Krishna and not receiving a response.

very ideal of course only pure devotees can actually implement but we have to practice we are unripe mangoes to pray don't expect oh why did not sometimes you know one some devotee was telling me Prabhu I see this simple now this devotee some devotees very bad behavior very uncivilized I say Hare Krishna with a smile they are like they will simply go Prabhu they will not even say Hare Krishna how do you feel Prabhu if you say Hare Krishna and the other devotee does not respond to you with Hare Krishna how do you feel he said I don't feel I was like I literally actually I did not know I said no I don't feel anything then I was thinking that oh why he is feeling like that because he is expecting that if I say Hare Krishna the other person must say Hare Krishna in fact the reason for saying Hare Krishna is so that I can get response so you think that I am I told the devotee you think that you are fortunate that you chanted Hare Krishna by seeing the devotee but that devotee is not fortunate enough to say Hare Krishna when seeing you so you continue to say you get the benefit and at least he will also get benefit by hearing you and one day by hearing in spite of not responding if you are saying Hare Krishna if one day they will also respond by saying Hare Krishna right even more ideal I didn't say this but I was just thinking even more ideal even more highest how pure devotee thinks pure devotee how he thinks I say Hare Krishna that devotee didn't respond to Hare Krishna because when I saw that devotee I could remember Krishna and I said Hare Krishna but when he saw I am such a fallen soul he could not remember Krishna by seeing me that's why he didn't say Hare Krishna

**Summary:** The speaker describes how a pure devotee thinks, taking responsibility for another's lack of response to Hare Krishna, and concludes by summarizing the essence of Parikshit Maharaj's teachings.

I am such a fallen soul so let me continue to say Hare Krishna one day I may be able to come to that stage this is of course too much but we can practice at least to some level we have to start so that is the essence of today's Parikshit Maharaj what he is trying to teach principle in this so with this we will stop here if anyone has any question we may or it's already almost time up maybe we can take it individually

### limitations of senses, spiritual knowledge, surrender, humility, perception of reality

**Key Quote:** "Our scriptures are saying that we cannot perceive the reality with our senses because our senses, we all have four inherent defects."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the limitations of our senses in perceiving reality, referencing scientific theories about extra dimensions and emphasizing the need for spiritual knowledge, humility, and surrender to a spiritual master to gain a glimpse of reality.

I'll share with you a quote from a very eminent scientist. He says, "All the scientific theories do not dictate that there has to be only three dimensions. Although we can't see with our eyes or feel with our fingers, additional dimensions of space are a logical possibility. Our senses register only three dimensions. So, extra dimensions might sound incredible. Even the dimension in the world we are living in, the Earth planet we are living in, in Hyderabad city what we are living in, what we are seeing is not necessarily complete reality. Forget about where we have not gone. But our scriptures are saying that we cannot perceive the reality with our senses because our senses, we all have four inherent defects. So, with this limitation, inherent defects in our senses, we will never be able to perceive the reality. So, when we get spiritual knowledge, we understand how small, insignificant we are, coupled with humility. I am a small, insignificant Jeeva. I have limited sense perception. Can't even control myself. How can I control things?" When that living entity develops that humility, surrenders to the Supreme Lord, surrenders to a bona fide spiritual master, OM AGYANATI MIRAN DASYA GYANANJANA SHALAKE, we open our eyes with the torch of knowledge.
